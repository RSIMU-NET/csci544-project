Progress made in addressing departmentwide training issues, but efforts are still in the early stages and face several challenges. Actions taken by DHS include issuing its first training strategic plan in July 2005, establishing training councils and groups to increase communication across components, and directly providing training for specific departmentwide needs. However, several challenges may impede DHS from achieving its departmental training goals. First, the sharing of training information across components is made more difficult by the lack of common or compatible information management systems and a commonly understood training terminology. Second, authority and accountability relationships between the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer and organizational components are not sufficiently clear. Third, DHS's planning may be insufficiently detailed to ensure effective and coordinated implementation of departmentwide training efforts. Finally, according to training officials, DHS lacks resources needed to implement its departmental training strategy. Examples of planning and evaluation of training demonstrate some elements of strategic practice. Specific training practices at both the component and departmental levels may provide useful models or insights to help others in DHS adopt a more strategic approach to training. We found that some components of DHS apply these practices, while others do not. For example, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) aligns training priorities with strategic goals through planning and budgeting processes. In the area of evaluation, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center obtains feedback from both the trainee and the trainee's job supervisor to inform training program designers in order to make improvements to the program curriculum. Training has been used to help DHS's workforce as it undergoes transformation and cultural change. The creation of DHS from different legacy organizations, each with its own distinct culture, has resulted in significant cultural and transformation challenges for the department. At the departmental level, one of the ways DHS is addressing these challenges is by encouraging the transformation to a shared performance-based culture through the implementation of its new human capital management system, MAXHR. DHS considers training to be critical to effectively implementing this initiative and defining its culture. Toward that end, the department is providing a wide range of training, including programs targeted to executives, managers, and supervisors. For example, at the component level, CBP has developed cross-training to equip employees with the knowledge needed to integrate inspection functions once carried out by three different types of inspectors at three separate agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Addressing an organization\u2019s culture\u2014that is, its underlying assumptions,  beliefs, values, attitudes, and expectations\u2014is at the heart of any serious  organizational transformation or change management initiative. As the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) strives to protect the nation from  terrorism, it faces significant challenges in transforming from 22 separate  agencies and programs to a single coordinated department, requiring the  integration of approximately 180,000 employees as well as multiple  management systems and processes. In recognition of these challenges,  we have designated the implementation and transformation of the  department as high risk.", "Training and development can play a key role in helping DHS successfully  address the challenge of transformation and cultural change and help  ensure that its workforce possesses the knowledge, skills, and  competencies needed to effectively respond to current and future threats.  In addition, a strategic approach to the management of training can help to  effectively target limited resources and further the achievement of its  organizational goals. To this end, our framework for assessing training  management provides a way for DHS to recognize and develop such an  approach.", "You asked us to examine how DHS, as a federal agency undergoing  transformation, uses training to help achieve its organizational goals. In  response to your request, this report discusses (1) how DHS is addressing  or planning to address departmentwide training and the related challenges  it is encountering; (2) examples of how DHS training practices, specifically  those related to planning and evaluation, reflect strategic practices; and  (3) examples of how DHS uses training to foster transformation and  cultural change.", "To achieve our objectives, we reviewed internal training at both the  departmental and component levels, focusing on the systems and  processes in place to manage, plan, and evaluate training for DHS\u2019s  workforce. To this end, we analyzed training, management, and planning  documents and interviewed numerous officials responsible for training  issues in the Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (CHCO office) and  at six organizational components collectively responsible for training 95  percent of the DHS workforce. To determine whether DHS used a strategic  approach in managing, planning, and evaluating its training activities, we  drew on our previous work regarding strategic planning and effective  management practices, as well as criteria contained in our guide for  assessing strategic training and development efforts in the federal  government. We recognize that DHS provides a significant amount of  training to external audiences, such as state and local governments;  however, given the nature of your request and interest in examples of how  DHS is using training to foster its organizational transformation, we did  not include training intended for audiences external to DHS within the  scope of our review.

The intent behind the creation of a single department was to  improve coordination, communication, and information sharing among  these previously separate entities, thereby increasing their effectiveness in  protecting the nation\u2019s security. Each of these organizations brought with  it the capacity and expertise to provide training for its particular aspect of  homeland security. For example, in several cases such as the Coast Guard  and FLETC, this training capacity, as well as the management systems  supporting it was transferred intact with the creation of the new  department. In other cases, such as CBP and U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE), the training functions of legacy organizations  were merged. Table 1 presents information on selected training  characteristics of components in our review, including the origin of each  component\u2019s training function. In addition, the Act led to the creation of  the CHCO position in DHS responsible for, among other human capital  topics, oversight and planning of the training of employees. The CHCO,  who reports directly to the department\u2019s Under Secretary for Management,  has primary responsibility for defining and developing the department\u2019s  role regarding training. Figure 1 depicts these positions as well as the  department\u2019s major components in the context of DHS\u2019s overall  organizational structure.", "Training both new and current staff to fill new roles and work in different  ways will play a crucial part in the ability of federal departments and  agencies, such as DHS, as they work to successfully transform their  organizations. In 2004, we issued an assessment guide that introduces a  framework for evaluating the management of training in the federal  government. As presented in our guide, the training process can be  segmented into four broad, interrelated phases: (1) planning/front-end  analysis, (2) design/development, (3) implementation, and (4) evaluation.  For each of these phases, we summarize key attributes of effective training  programs and offer related issues and questions. Using this framework,  this report identifies selected strategic training practices, with a focus on  the planning and evaluation phases, that may offer an opportunity for  others in DHS to build on experiences and practices discussed below.", "The results of a governmentwide survey conducted by the Office of  Personnel Management in 2004 on human capital practices and employee  attitudes suggest that efforts to identify and build upon examples of good  training practice within DHS may be particularly relevant. For each of the  eight questions in the 2004 Federal Human Capital Survey that focused on  training related topics, the percentage of DHS respondents providing  positive responses (typically the top two options on a five-point scale) was  lower than the governmentwide average. In fact, the DHS response ranged  from 5 to 20 percentage points lower than the governmentwide average for  the same questions. For example, 54 percent of respondents at DHS  indicated that they received the training they needed in order to perform  their jobs, compared to 60 percent governmentwide. Half (50 percent) of  DHS respondents said that they were either satisfied or very satisfied with  the training they received for their present jobs, as opposed to 55 percent  that expressed these levels of satisfaction governmentwide. The largest  difference involved having electronic access to learning and training  programs, where 51 percent of DHS respondents responded positively,  compared to 71 percent governmentwide. A DHS official told us that the  department is aware of the challenges reflected in these data and is  currently exploring options with the Office of Personnel Management to  conduct further analysis. The aim of this work would be to identify areas  where DHS might target additional attention as well as provide a baseline  for future attitude measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Made Progress in Addressing Departmentwide Training Issues, but Challenges May Impede Its Efforts", "paragraphs": ["DHS has made progress in addressing departmentwide training issues and  these efforts reflect some of the elements of a strategic approach toward  training as described in our previous work. Most training-related activities  at DHS\u2014such as planning, delivery, and evaluation\u2014primarily take place  at the component level and relate to mission issues. Therefore, any  successful approach regarding departmentwide training issues will require  the concerted and coordinated efforts of multiple components within DHS  as well as the ability of the CHCO to effectively lead a network of different  training organizations. The department\u2019s current efforts, although  promising, are still in the early stages and they face significant challenges.  Unless these challenges are successfully addressed they may impede  DHS\u2019s ability to achieve its departmentwide training goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Recently Developed a Departmental Training Strategy", "paragraphs": ["DHS recently developed a coordinated departmental training strategy that  supports broader human capital and organizational goals and objectives.  We have previously reported that effective organizations establish clear  goals with an authority structure able to carry out strategies and tactics,  that is, the day-to-day activities needed to support the organization\u2019s vision  and mission. By so doing, a well-designed training function can be directly  linked to the organization\u2019s strategic goals and help to ensure that the  skills and competencies of its workforce enable the organization to  perform its mission effectively.", "DHS\u2019s department-level training strategy is presented in its human capital  and training strategic plans. Issued in October 2004, its human capital  strategic plan includes selected training strategies, such as developing a  leadership curriculum to ensure consistency of organizational values  across the department and using training to support the implementation of  the new DHS human capital management system, MAXHR. In July 2005,  DHS issued its first departmental training plan, Department of Homeland  Security Learning and Development Strategic Plan, which provides a  strategic vision for departmentwide training. This plan is a significant and  positive step toward addressing departmentwide training challenges. The  plan identifies four short-term goals for fiscal year 2006 and one long-term  goal for fiscal years 2006 through 2010. Among the short-term goals are  such tasks as defining the scope of training activities and improving the  governance process between the CHCO office and individual  organizational components, supporting the rollout of MAXHR,  identifying/implementing best practices, and addressing specific concerns  regarding DHS\u2019s training facilities and advanced distributed learning  studies. The plan also articulates a long-term goal for DHS to \u201cbecome a  recognized world-class learning organization where managers and  supervisors effectively lead people.\u201d", "Each of these goals is followed by supporting strategies and tactics. For  example, to achieve its goal of ensuring the best use of training resources  through the identification and implementation of best practices, the plan  identifies specific strategies, one of which is to improve the awareness of  ongoing DHS training activities among organizational components. This  strategy is, in turn, supported by still more specific tactics such as  developing a site on the DHS Interactive system to facilitate the sharing of  information across the training community.", "More significant than the fact that DHS issued a training strategic plan  document is the fact that DHS followed an inclusive and collaborative  process while developing it. We have previously reported that for high- performing, results-oriented organizations, a strategic plan is not simply a  paper-driven exercise or onetime event, but rather the result of a dynamic  and inclusive process wherein key stakeholders are consulted and  involved in the identification of priorities and the formation of strategies.  When creating its plan, DHS consulted training leaders at components  throughout the department, in addition to others, to help develop and  review its content. Several training leaders we spoke with thought highly  of this process and the extent to which it provided them opportunities to  contribute and comment on the draft plan.", "DHS has made considerable progress in addressing departmentwide  training issues through the development of its first training strategic plan.  However, there are areas where future efforts can be improved.", "Linkage to DHS organizational and human capital strategic plans.  Our past work on strategic planning and management practices shows that  effective strategic plans describe the alignment between an agency\u2019s long- term goals and objectives and the specific strategies planned to achieve  them. Clearly linking training tactics with particular organizational  objectives creates a direct line of sight that can both facilitate the ability of  staff to work toward mission goals and enable stakeholders to provide  meaningful oversight. In the introduction to the DHS training strategic  plan, the department\u2019s CHCO highlights the value of this practice stating  that \u201cthe key purpose of  plan is to align our education, training and  professional development efforts with the President\u2019s Management  Agenda and the Department\u2019s vision, mission, core values and strategic  plan.\u201d", "The DHS training strategic plan contains examples of goals, strategies, and  tactics that align with and support goals found in the department\u2019s human  capital and organizational strategic plans; however, these linkages are  never actually identified or discussed in the plan itself. For example, the  DHS training strategic plan contains a goal and several tactics related to  MAXHR training. These, in turn, support a MAXHR goal and strategy in the  department\u2019s human capital strategic plan as well as the \u201corganizational  excellence\u201d goal of the DHS strategic plan. However, the training strategic  plan does not show these linkages. Identifying such linkages, either in the  training plan itself or in an appendix, would more clearly communicate to  both internal and external stakeholders the connections and justifications  for specific training goals, strategies, and tactics.", "DHS\u2019s own human capital strategic plan provides an illustration of one  way to communicate linkages between goals and strategies contained in  the plan and the broader organizational goals they are intended to support.  For example, in an appendix, the DHS human capital strategic plan  contains a matrix that directly links strategies, such as developing a new  Senior Executive Service (SES) performance management system, with  specific objectives contained in the DHS strategic plan as well as the  President\u2019s Management Agenda human capital standards for success.", "Usefulness of performance measures. We have previously reported  several key characteristics of effective strategic and management plans,  including the need for performance measures. Appropriate performance  measures along with accompanying targets are important tools to enable  internal and external stakeholders to effectively track the progress the  department is making toward achieving its training goals and objectives.  To this end, organizations may use a variety of performance measures\u2014 output, efficiency, customer service, quality, and outcome\u2014each of which  focuses on a different aspect of performance.", "The DHS training strategic plan contains few specific performance  measures for its goals or strategies and all of these are output measures.  For example, the plan makes use of output measures in its requirement  that certain actions, such as the development of a new management  directive or the chartering of a team, be completed by the end of fiscal  year 2006, and in establishing a deadline for when reports need to be  completed in order to be included in the 2007 plan. In contrast to output  measures like these, which gauge the level of activity or effort by  measuring whether a particular thing is produced or service performed,  other types of measures, such as measures of customer satisfaction or  program outcomes, focus on the impact or results of activities. By  appropriately broadening the mix of measures it uses and more clearly  identifying targets against which DHS can assess its performance, DHS  can improve the usefulness of its plan. After we completed our audit work,  DHS training officials informed us that they decided to delay the  development of performance measures until the rollout of the plan, when  they could be developed by individual teams, as needed. They  subsequently informed us that these teams will be held accountable to  establish further performance measures that are outcome based and  results oriented.", "DHS\u2019s human capital strategic plan again provides an illustration of how  the department\u2019s training strategic plan might begin to work toward the  inclusion of different types of performance measures. For example,  accompanying the strategy that DHS assess the feasibility of establishing a  21st Century Leadership Training and Development Institute, the plan  identifies two performance measures\u2014customer satisfaction and cost of  delivery\u2014along with specific targets for each. For the customer  satisfaction measure, the plan establishes a target of 4.5 on a scale from 1  to 5. The plan also includes specific tactics to achieve the strategy, such as  developing and obtaining cross-organizational support, developing  measures and methodologies for leadership training, and implementing a  learning management system, along with key milestone dates for  completing them.", "The department may benefit from considering the experiences of leading  organizations regarding the development of results-oriented performance  measurement. In general, results-oriented organizations we have studied  that were successful in measuring their performance developed measures  that were  tied to program goals and demonstrated the degree to which the desired  results were achieved,  limited to the vital few that were considered essential to producing data  for decision making,  responsive to multiple priorities, and  responsibility linked to establish accountability for results.", "Similar to the consultative process DHS followed when developing the  goals and strategies contained in its training strategic plan, decisions  concerning the selection of an appropriate set of performance measures  should also be based on input from key stakeholders to determine what is  important to them when assessing the department\u2019s performance  regarding training. Clear and appropriate performance measures,  developed in this way, can also provide DHS with valuable information,  especially significant in the current fiscal environment, when it seeks to  justify requests for resources from Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training Councils and Groups Created by DHS Increase Communication across Components", "paragraphs": ["Under the overall direction of the CHCO office, DHS has established a  structure of training councils and groups that cover a wide range of issues  and include representatives from each organizational component within  DHS. The department is in the process of using these bodies to facilitate  communication and the sharing of information within its diverse training  community. In some instances, these councils and groups foster greater  collaboration and coordination on training policies, programs, and the  sharing of training opportunities. We have previously reported that  agencies with a strategic approach to training recognize the importance of  having training officials and other human capital professionals work in  partnership with other agency leaders and stakeholders on training  efforts.", "The Training Leaders Council (TLC) plays a vital role in DHS\u2019s efforts to  foster communication and interchange among the department\u2019s various  training communities. This council consists of senior training leaders from  each of the department\u2019s components as well as representatives from  several department-level headquarters staff and support organizations  with an interest in training-related issues. Started in October 2004 and  formally chartered by the CHCO in March 2005, the TLC\u2019s mission is to  establish and sustain a collaborative community with the aim of promoting  high-quality training, education, and development throughout DHS. To this  end, it functions as a convener of training leaders from throughout the  department and provides an overarching framework for several  preexisting training groups and councils that were reestablished as  standing committees of the TLC. Membership of the TLC consists of senior  training leaders from each DHS component. In addition, most of these  leaders as well as other training staff serve on one or more of its  subgroups. See figure 2 for descriptions of the TLC and each of its  subgroups.", "One key function of the TLC and these other training groups is to serve as  a \u201ccommunity of practice\u201d wherein officials can discuss common training  challenges and share knowledge and best practices. For example, the  Training Evaluation and Quality Assurance Group, composed of DHS  training professionals responsible for evaluating and ensuring the quality  of DHS training programs, conducted an informal survey of evaluation  practices in various components with the intent of identifying effective  evaluation approaches. A training official involved in the group told us that  this survey was particularly important for the department\u2019s newer  organizations, such as the Directorate for Information Analysis and  Infrastructure Protection, which need to establish new practices from  scratch. According to this official, his directorate and other organizations  within DHS plan to use the group as a way to tap into the experience of  other components within the department, such as CBP and FLETC, which  have considerably more experience with training evaluation.", "In addition to sharing information about training practices, these groups  can also provide a forum for exchanging practical information with the  goal of making more efficient use of existing resources. For example, one  training official told us that as a result of information obtained at TLC  meetings, the official became aware of the existence of free training space  available at facilities of two other components located in the Washington,  D.C., metro area. Also, as a result of participating in these meetings, the  official\u2019s organization was able to send an additional person to the Federal  Executive Institute after becoming aware that another component had  surplus spaces and was offering them at a reduced price to other  components within DHS.", "Another role carried out by the TLC is to collaborate on the formulation of  training policies and advise the department\u2019s CHCO accordingly. For  example, the TLC, in cooperation with staff from the CHCO office and an  external contractor, conducted a survey of training sites throughout the  department in 2004. This study cataloged available physical resources and  site capacities with the aim of identifying potential opportunities to share  these resources more efficiently, consolidate unneeded or duplicative  sites, and identify other opportunities to increase training collaboration  and effectiveness. This effort resulted in a series of recommendations that  were subsequently incorporated into the department\u2019s training strategic  plan.", "The activities of the department\u2019s Advanced Distributed Learning Group  (ADLG) provides another example of how training officials from different  components have worked together to develop proposals for solutions to  departmentwide challenges. This group identified several issues in the  area of technology and learning, including the need for a compatible IT  infrastructure across components and the fact that some components  lacked established systems with which to coordinate and manage training  opportunities and attendance. Working with an outside consultant, the  ADLG\u2019s efforts resulted in a proposal that DHS create a new Advanced  Distributed Learning (ADL) Program Management Office to oversee the  process of setting common standards. This proposal was subsequently  included as part of the department\u2019s training strategic plan. In addition, the  ADLG\u2019s work also led to DHS entering into a memorandum of  understanding with the Office of Management and Budget and the Office  of Personnel Management to create a DHS headquarters learning  management system. Throughout this process, the ADLG represented the  interests of the DHS training community as it worked with representatives  from the Chief Information Officer\u2019s office and other functions within the  department, as well as outside consultants.", "Despite these positive steps, DHS\u2019s effort to foster communication and  coordination through departmentwide training councils and groups is at a  relatively early stage and so far has produced varied results. Some training  organizations, such as the TLC and ADLG, have met regularly leading to  tangible results, while others such as the Training Evaluation and Quality  Assurance Group, have met a few times and have only begun to set the  groundwork for substantive coordination and collaboration in these areas.  In addition, a training official told us that even active organizations like the  TLC have encountered difficulties related to the relative lack of staff  support for these efforts. As a result, additional burdens sometimes fall to  the leaders and members of these groups who, in addition to serving on  one or more departmental training groups or councils, must carry out full- time training positions at their home components."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Provides Training to Address Selected Departmentwide Needs", "paragraphs": ["Another way DHS addresses departmentwide training issues is to directly  provide training interventions or resources that address selected  departmentwide needs, goals, or objectives. Three examples of the areas  where DHS has worked to directly provide or support training on the  departmental level are the following: (1) training related to the  implementation of MAXHR, (2) DHS leadership development, and   (3) training related to civil rights and civil liberties.", "Training for MAXHR implementation. DHS\u2019s new human capital  management system, known as MAXHR, represents a fundamental change  in many of the department\u2019s human capital policies and procedures that  will affect a large majority\u2014approximately 110,000\u2014of its civilian  employees. MAXHR covers many key human capital areas, such as pay,  performance management, classification, labor relations, adverse actions,  and employee appeals, and will be implemented in phases affecting  increasing numbers of employees over the next several years.", "DHS correctly recognizes that a substantial investment in training is a key  aspect of effectively implementing MAXHR, and in particular, the new  performance management system it establishes. The need for in-depth  performance management and employee development training is further  supported by the department\u2019s results on the 2004 Federal Human Capital  Survey. In this survey, just over half of DHS respondents\u201451 percent\u2014 believe supervisors or team leaders in their work units encourage their  development at work, significantly less than the governmentwide response  of 64 percent. DHS officials said they plan to educate all affected DHS  employees on the details of the new system, how it will affect them, and  the purpose of the changes. To do this, the department decided to develop,  coordinate, and manage MAXHR training centrally through the CHCO office  and offered its first training in May 2005. DHS plans to continue to provide  its workforce with MAXHR training over the next several years following a  phased approach that takes into account both when individual provisions  of the new regulations take effect as well as the different audiences that  exist within the DHS community, including human capital personnel,  supervisors, and general employees. See figure 3 for a depiction of planned  training during 2005 and its intended audiences.", "The department has worked with contractors to develop training that uses  a variety of approaches, including classroom instruction, ADL, handbooks,  manuals, and quick reference guides, depending on specific needs. For  example, in May 2005, labor relations/employee relations specialists and  attorneys in the department received 2-\u00bd days of training on the  provisions of the new regulations and the major difference between them  and previous programs. Structured as a \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d type  intervention intended to prepare participants to conduct supervisor  briefings in their own components, this was an instructor-led course held  at sites across the country. In addition to educating individuals about the  regulations, procedures, and systems associated with MAXHR and the  adoption of a new performance management system, the department also  plans to offer training specifically targeted to developing the skills and  behaviors that will be necessary for its successful implementation. For  example, in July 2005 supervisors began to receive training on techniques  for providing meaningful feedback to, coaching, and mentoring employees.", "DHS leadership development training. Leadership development is  another area top management in DHS acknowledged as appropriate for  departmentwide training to supplement existing component-level  offerings. In 2004, the Secretary of Homeland Security announced the  \u201cOne DHS\u201d policy that identified the need to establish a common  leadership competency framework for the department, as well as a unified  training curriculum for current and future leaders. The purpose of this  framework was to identify the skills, abilities, and attributes necessary for  success as a DHS leader and to establish measurable standards for  evaluation.", "To this end, the CHCO established the DHS Leadership Training and  Development Group (LTDG), comprising training officials from each DHS  component who combined an expertise in leadership development with  personal knowledge of the missions and unique aspects of their particular  organizational components. The LTDG met regularly from late 2003 to  mid-2004. During this time, the group developed a set of new core  leadership competencies for DHS supervisors, managers, and executives,  which it issued in April 2004. According to a DHS official, since the  development of these new competencies they have been used by one  component as part of its own leadership development plan and they have  also helped to guide and inform current MAXHR leadership development  efforts.", "DHS has recently taken steps regarding another facet of its leadership  development initiative\u2014its SES Candidate Development Program. In June  2005, DHS issued a management directive establishing the SES Candidate  Development Program, which included a rigorous selection process and  critical leadership development opportunities, such as mentoring,  developmental assignments, and action learning designed to give SES  candidates experience in different job roles. DHS initially announced that  it planned to implement the program in fiscal year 2005, but now may  delay doing so until fiscal year 2006.", "Civil rights/civil liberties training. A third area in which DHS has taken  steps to provide or support departmental training involves civil rights and  civil liberties. FLETC\u2019s Behavioral Science Division and Legal Division,  working with the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, produced  several training interventions, including Web-based, CD-ROM, and in- person programs designed to increase sensitivity and understanding in  protecting human and constitutional rights. As part of this effort, FLETC  held diversity seminars that focused on promoting understanding and  respect of religious practices, particularly involving those of the Arab and  Muslim communities. In another example of this effort, the Office of Civil  Rights and Civil Liberties produced Web-based training on current policies  regarding racial profiling.", "Our interviews with DHS training leaders suggest that further  improvements can be made in communicating the availability of selected  departmentwide training programs and resources. Staff at the Office of  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties provided copies of its civil rights and  liberties programs to training offices at each component in the  department. While some senior training officials told us that their  components actively disseminated this material by placing it on the  component\u2019s training Web site or incorporating it into preexisting courses,  other senior training officials we spoke with were unaware of any  departmental training on these topics. In addition, other officials told us  that their component\u2019s training office had independently developed its  own material on Arabic sensitivity training, wholly apart from similar  efforts undertaken by others in the department. More specifically, they  told us that their development of certain training modules predated the  development of very similar modules later prepared by DHS\u2019s Office of  Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and FLETC, leading these officials to  conclude that they may have been able to assist departmental efforts by  sharing their work had they been aware of them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges May Impede Achievement of Departmentwide Training Goals", "paragraphs": ["As DHS moves forward, it faces challenges to achieving departmentwide  training goals.

It will take  time for these organizations to evolve into a coordinated, integrated  department. We have previously reported that successful transformations  of large organizations, even those faced with less strenuous  reorganizations and pressure for immediate results than DHS, can take  from 5 to 7 years to fully take hold.", "One issue DHS officials raised was the lack of common or compatible  management information systems, such as information technology or  financial management, which can inform decision makers\u2019 efforts to make  efficient use of training resources across components. For example, DHS  officials stated that a key challenge they encountered involved the  difficulty of knowing what others were doing outside their particular  offices or components. DHS lacks any unified sourcebook that employees  could consult for the names, telephone numbers, and other relevant  information of key contact persons in areas such as acquisition. Obtaining  accurate information about resources and products available in the  marketplace as well as data on users, vendors, and kinds of work has been  a challenge to that effort. Another issue cited by officials concerned the  lack of compatibility between learning management systems across  components.

The process starts with the assumption that many  factors influence individual and unit performance and it is important to  determine what the factors are before concluding that training is the  solution. From its HPT analysis, the Coast Guard determines whether  training is needed or whether another type of solution, such as a policy  change, would be more appropriate. For example, in addressing a problem  in aviation maintenance, a Coast Guard working group looked at likely  causes of its performance problems and concluded that focusing on  making aviation maintenance training better was not the only solution.  More specifically, training officials encountered problems with job  dissatisfaction and subpar performance from aviation chief warrant  officers. In this case, training officials used HPT to analyze the nature of  work performed by those responsible for aviation maintenance and  concluded that there was not a good match between job skills and  responsibilities. Specifically, over the last 20 years, the scope and nature of  the work performed by chief warrant officers changed significantly from  maintaining components to managing aircraft systems.

The analysis identified the skills and knowledge  necessary for new maritime inspector tasks and provided training  interventions, such as developing job aids and targeted classes, to prepare  inspectors for the tasks most relevant to support their new role.

Rather,  they approach evaluation through an iterative process capable of  informing all stages of training. DHS\u2019s CHCO office used multiple forms  of feedback from employees to develop its training strategy for MAXHR.  From February through April 2005, the department administered surveys  and conducted focus groups to obtain information on the needs, attitudes,  and reactions of different communities affected by MAXHR. Shortly after  issuing its new human capital regulations, the department provided basic  information to all employees on the nature and timeline of changes they  could expect under MAXHR through a Web broadcast. After the broadcast  an online survey was used to obtain feedback from employees regarding  the broadcast itself and their general feelings and concerns about the  MAXHR initiative.", "DHS followed this initial survey with a larger survey to gather additional  feedback on how information regarding MAXHR had been communicated,  as well as specific areas where employees wanted additional information.  Concerns about the need for training were prominent among the more  than 9,000 responses received, with respondents ranking training as the  second most serious challenge to the successful implementation of MAXHR.  According to a senior DHS official, the survey results will inform  subsequent training and communication efforts.", "DHS also collected evaluative feedback by conducting a series of focus  groups held in locations across the country. The aim of these sessions was  to validate the design of the performance management program  established under MAXHR and identify concerns that would inform the  development of additional training. Consistent with the strategic training  practice of seeking out different perspectives when redesigning and  assessing training efforts, DHS staff held separate focus groups for  bargaining unit employees, non-bargaining unit employees, and  supervisors and managers at all of the locations visited. This enabled them  to identify issues of particular concern to each of these groups as well as  issues common to all three. For example, both the bargaining unit and  non-bargaining unit employee focus groups raised concerns about  supervisors having inadequate skills for fairly administering the new  performance management system. This concern was also shared by  supervisors and managers themselves who expressed the need for  additional skills training in areas such as goal setting and providing  performance feedback. The sessions validated the CHCO office\u2019s plans to  offer performance management training to supervisors and managers  before the implementation of the new system and assisted in refining  issues for future training.", "FLETC\u2019s methods for evaluating its major training programs include  feedback from multiple perspectives when examining the benefits of  training on actual employee job performance. FLETC\u2019s Level III  evaluations obtain feedback from both trainees and their supervisors to  inform future improvements to training curricula. Evaluation results are  compiled into a comprehensive report used during FLETC\u2019s periodic  curriculum reviews on its major training programs, such as the Natural  Resource Police Training Program. The report contains detailed feedback  from both the trainee and supervisor perspectives 6 months to 1 year after  the trainee has attended the training program.

Officials noted that the merger into CBP led to some resistance from  employees who had not yet understood or accepted the reasons for the  merger. These same officials acknowledged that they must continue to  work at informing employees why changes were made and provide  vehicles for better integration through training.

To develop this training,  CBP-wide working groups identified and validated critical tasks for the  new frontline CBP officer to perform. A mix of training delivery methods  were used (i.e., e-learning and instructor led), and classroom knowledge  and skills were reinforced with on-the-job training.

Because agricultural  inspections are more specialized, CBP officers receive training sufficient  to enable them to identify potential agricultural threats, make initial  regulatory decisions, and determine when to make referrals to CBP  agriculture specialists. More detailed agricultural inspections are  performed by these specialists who have substantial training and  background in agricultural issues.", "A variety of training delivery methods were used (e.g., e-learning and  classroom) and these training methods were reinforced with extensive on- the-job training. In addition to traditional content areas (e.g., cross-training  for former U.S. Customs officers includes courses on immigration  fundamentals and immigration law), training courses also covered CBP\u2019s  new priority mission of preventing terrorism (e.g., training in detecting  possible terrorists and fraudulent documents, honing interviewing skills,  and making appropriate referrals to staff for additional inspection). CBP  emphasizes on-the-job training in an effort not to place inspectors on the  job without direct supervisory and tutorial backup. Training for new  recruits has also been modified to include a preacademy orientation  program at the port location where the recruit will eventually work before  he or she receives academy training. This is a 72-day course for CBP  officers and a 46-day course for CBP agriculture specialists.", "CBP\u2019s main strategy to prepare for field delivery of training was to provide  extensive train-the-trainer courses so that trainers could return to their  field sites and instruct officers there. Training priorities were established  with the idea of spacing the training out so that field offices would not be  overwhelmed. For example, CBP rolled out its primary cross-training to  airports, while antiterrorism training was rolled out to land borders.", "Officials reported that cross-training benefited CBP officers since they  have gained more knowledge by learning both immigration and customs  laws and procedures. This increase in knowledge has the potential benefit  of providing more variety in job tasks as well as increasing the  opportunities for advancement since an officer can now apply for  supervisory-level positions that had previously been open only to former  U.S. Customs or Immigration and Naturalization Service officers.", "Change has not come about without challenges, however, as many officers  were reported to have resisted changes to their responsibilities, mainly  related to the difficulties in learning a new set of procedures and laws.  Officials noted that there has been an enormous amount of required  training for CBP officers, and it can sometimes be overwhelming. For  former officers, in addition to completing an extensive cross-training  schedule and new training related to terrorism prevention, there are many  other required courses related to their mission. For example, training  modules are required in areas such as body scanning, hazardous materials,  cargo inspection, and seized assets.", "Although staffing challenges may ultimately be relieved with trained  officers able to perform dual inspections, officials noted that it has been  extremely difficult to take staff off-line to complete the \u201cOne Face at the  Border\u201d training. One official said that classes have been very difficult to  schedule because of the constant pressure to staff operations. For  example, in one case, a class was canceled right after it began because the  trainees were pulled out to staff their inspection booths. This official also  noted that trainers have had to be very flexible to accommodate staff  schedules to ensure that training occurs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
