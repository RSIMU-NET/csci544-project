However, the program does not fully meet all key elements of effective oversight. For example, the program is not structurally independent from all laboratories it oversees and has not assessed risks posed by its current structure or the effectiveness of mechanisms it has to reduce organizational conflicts of interest. Without conducting such assessments and taking actions as needed to address risks, the program may not effectively mitigate impairments to its independence.", "In addition, some experts and laboratory representatives GAO interviewed raised concerns that the program's reviews may not target the highest-risk activities, in part because it has not formally assessed which activities pose the highest risk. Without assessing the risk of activities it oversees and targeting its resources appropriately, the program cannot ensure it is balancing its resources against their impact.", "Moreover, the program does not have strategic planning documents, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan, to guide its oversight. Although it began taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan, the program is not developing workforce plans as part of this effort. Developing a joint workforce plan that assesses workforce and training needs for the program as a whole would help the program leverage resources to ensure all workforce and training needs are met.", "Selected countries and regulatory sectors GAO reviewed employ other approaches to promote effective oversight. For example, in Great Britain, an independent government agency focused on health and safety oversees laboratories that work with pathogens. In addition, in both Great Britain and Canada, regulators (1) focus their oversight on biological safety, because safety incidents provided the impetus for laboratory oversight in these countries and (2) regulate all potentially hazardous pathogens and activities in laboratories."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO's recommendations in GAO-18-145 included that the Federal Select Agent Program (1) assess risks posed by its current structure and address risks as needed; (2) assess the risk of activities it oversees and target reviews to the highest-risk activities; and (3) develop a joint workforce plan.

Safety lapses have occurred at laboratories in the United States that  conduct research on hazardous pathogens and toxins (known as select  agents) that may pose a serious threat to humans, animals, or plants.  These lapses raise concerns about whether federal oversight of these  laboratories is effective. For example, in November 2016, the Department  of Homeland Security discovered that a private laboratory had  inadvertently sent a toxic form of ricin (a potentially lethal poison) to one  of its training centers multiple times since 2011, potentially putting training  participants at risk. In May 2015, the Department of Defense (DOD)  discovered that a DOD laboratory had inadvertently shipped live anthrax  bacteria to nearly 200 other laboratories worldwide over the course of 12  years. And in July 2014, the National Institutes of Health discovered  decades-old vials of smallpox in a storage room of a Food and Drug  Administration laboratory on its campus.", "We have, for many years, identified challenges and areas for  improvement related to the safety, security, and oversight of high- containment laboratories. In 2009, for example, we found a proliferation of  high-containment laboratories across the United States, with the number  of such laboratories in the government, academic, and private sectors  increasing since 2001. In addition, we found that there was no single  entity overseeing this proliferation, and that no federal agency knew how  many such laboratories existed in the United States or the aggregate  risks associated with the proliferation. We also found in 2009 and 2014  that, for the subset of these laboratories subject to federal oversight, the  oversight was duplicative, fragmented, and dependent on self-policing.  More recently, we found in 2016 that stronger oversight mechanisms for  federal high-containment laboratories were needed at the individual  federal department and component agency levels. We have made  numerous recommendations over the years, including that a single entity  be identified to determine the number of high-containment laboratories  needed to meet national goals, the aggregate risks associated with the  proliferation of laboratories, and the type of oversight needed. Federal  departments have made some progress in implementing  recommendations from our past reports, including addressing issues we  identified regarding duplicative oversight. However, the United States still  has not identified a single entity to perform the functions we  recommended.", "All high-containment laboratories in the United States that register to work  with select agents are regulated by the Federal Select Agent Program  (which this statement subsequently refers to as the Select Agent  Program), through which two agencies share oversight responsibility.", "Specifically, oversight is shared by the Division of Select Agents and  Toxins within the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agriculture  Select Agent Services within the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA)  Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The program was  established to regulate the possession, use, and transfer of select agents  in response to security concerns following bioterrorism attacks in the  1990s and early 2000s.", "Other countries also regulate and oversee hazardous pathogens handled  in high-containment laboratories, and they sometimes take approaches  that differ from that of the United States. Moreover, other high-risk sectors  in the United States, such as the nuclear industry, sometimes take  different approaches to oversight. Notwithstanding such differences, our  past work reviewing some of these sectors has identified five key  elements of effective oversight in areas where low-probability adverse  events can have significant and far-reaching effects. These elements are  as follows:  Independence: The organization conducting oversight should be  structurally distinct and separate from the entities it oversees.", "Ability to perform reviews: The organization should have the access  and working knowledge necessary to review compliance with  requirements.", "Technical expertise: The organization should have sufficient staff  with the expertise to perform sound safety and security assessments.", "Transparency: The organization should provide access to key  information, as applicable, to those most affected by operations.", "Enforcement authority: The organization should have clear and  sufficient authority to require that entities achieve compliance with  requirements.", "My remarks today are based on our October 2017 report on the oversight  of select agents in high-containment laboratories. Our report  (1) examined the extent to which the Select Agent Program has the  elements of effective oversight and has strategic planning documents to  guide its oversight efforts, and (2) described approaches that selected  countries and regulatory sectors have used to promote effective  oversight. Today, I will discuss key findings and recommendations from  that report.", "For our report, we discussed the five key elements of effective oversight  above with agency officials, experts, and representatives from  nongovernmental organizations to ensure their applicability to the  oversight of select agents. We reviewed laws, regulations, and  documents related to the Select Agent Program to determine the extent to  which the program met the key elements. We also interviewed officials  from CDC and APHIS and registered laboratories to discuss the  program\u2019s inspections and other oversight responsibilities and other  issues related to the five key elements. To obtain expert views on the  effectiveness of the approaches the Select Agent Program and other  selected countries and regulatory sectors have used to promote effective  oversight, we worked with the National Academy of Sciences to convene  a 2-day meeting with 18 experts. We also reviewed relevant  documentation and interviewed regulatory officials from selected  countries\u2014including the United Kingdom and Canada\u2014and other sectors  such as nuclear energy. More detailed information on the scope and  methodology of our work can be found in the October report. The work  upon which this statement is based was conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, we found that the Select Agent Program does not fully meet  all key elements of effective oversight. For example, the program is not  structurally distinct and separate from all laboratories it oversees and,  therefore, does not meet the key element of independence. Regarding  another key element\u2014the ability to perform reviews\u2014some experts and  laboratory representatives raised concerns that the program\u2019s reviews  may not target the highest-risk activities, in part because it has not  formally assessed which activities pose the highest risk. Moreover, the  program does not have joint strategic planning documents, including a  joint workforce plan, to guide its shared oversight efforts. We made 11  recommendations to address these issues. HHS and USDA agreed with  our recommendations and outlined actions they are taking, or plan to  take, to address them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Select Agent Program Does Not Fully Meet Key Elements of Effective Oversight or Have Joint Strategic Planning Documents to Guide Its Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The Select Agent Program does not fully meet key elements of effective  oversight. In particular, the program has oversight shortcomings related to  each of our five key elements: independence, performing reviews,  technical expertise, transparency, and enforcement. In addition, the  program does not have joint strategic planning documents to guide its  oversight efforts, such as a joint strategic plan and workforce plan. It did,  however, begin taking steps to develop a joint strategic plan during the  summer of 2017.", "First, regarding independence, the Select Agent Program is not  structurally distinct and separate from all of the laboratories it oversees  because the two components of the Select Agent Program are located in  CDC and APHIS, both of which also have high-containment laboratories  registered with the program. Many experts at our meeting raised  concerns that the Select Agent Program cannot be entirely independent  in its oversight of CDC and APHIS laboratories because the Select Agent  Program is composed of divisions of those agencies. To help reduce  conflicts of interest, the program has taken steps such as having APHIS  lead inspections of CDC laboratories. However, it has generally done so  in response to concerns raised by others. The program itself has not  formally assessed all potential risks posed by its current structure and the  effectiveness of its mechanisms to address those risks. The Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s Circular A-123 requires federal agencies to  integrate risk management activities into their program management to  help ensure they are effectively managing risks that could affect the  achievement of agency objectives. In addition, federal internal control  standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond  to risks related to achieving defined objectives. Without (1) regularly  assessing the potential risks posed by the program\u2019s current structure  and the effectiveness of its mechanisms to address them and (2) taking  actions as necessary to ensure any identified risks are addressed, the  program may not be aware of or effectively mitigate impairments to its  independence that could affect its ability to achieve its objectives.", "Second, regarding the ability to perform reviews, we found that the Select  Agent Program performs several types of reviews to ensure compliance  with regulatory and program requirements. However, the program may  not target the highest-risk activities in its inspections, in part because it  has not formally assessed which activities pose the highest risk to  biological safety and security. For example, many experts at our  meeting and laboratory representatives we interviewed raised concerns  about the amount of time inspectors spend assessing compliance with  inventory controls (e.g., by counting and examining vials containing select  agents) and reviewing inventory records during the inspection process,  which takes time away from inspecting other aspects of biological safety  and security. Experts at our meeting said that these activities do little to  reduce the risk of theft of select agents (a security concern) because  samples could be clandestinely removed from vials and replicated without  being detected by the inventory controls currently in place. Further, other  laboratory representatives told us that activities to assess compliance  with certain program requirements, such as time-consuming reviews of  records, did little to reduce risk and were unnecessarily burdensome to  both researchers and inspectors. These inspection activities are generally  intended to address biological security concerns; however, recent high- profile incidents at registered laboratories have concerned biological  safety rather than security.", "To improve the inspection process and identify trends and associations  between inspection findings and risk, a 2015 internal review of the CDC  component of the Select Agent Program recommended that the CDC and  APHIS components of the program work together to analyze inspection  and investigation data. According to program officials, they have not yet  addressed the recommendation because they do not currently have  adequate tools to do so, but the program is transitioning to a new  database that will enhance their ability to identify trends and associations  and thereby guide improvements to the inspection process. However, the  program did not provide a plan for when or how the program will carry out  these analyses to improve the inspection process. Federal internal control  standards state that management should identify, analyze, and respond  to risks related to achieving defined objectives. Without developing and  implementing a plan to identify which laboratory activities carry the  highest biological safety and security risks and to respond to those risks  by aligning inspections and other oversight efforts to target those  activities, the Select Agent Program will not have assurance that it is  effectively balancing the potential safety and security gains from its  oversight efforts against the use of program resources and the effect on  laboratories\u2019 research.", "We also found that the Select Agent Program did not fully meet the other  three key elements of effective oversight: technical expertise,  transparency, and enforcement. For example, although the program has  taken steps to hire additional staff and enhance the technical expertise of  its staff, workforce and training gaps remain. In addition, although the  program has increased transparency about registered laboratories and  violations of the select agent regulations to the public and registered  laboratories since 2016, the information it shares is limited and there is no  consensus about what additional information could be shared, given  security concerns. Lastly, although the program has authority to enforce  compliance with program requirements, it is still working to address past  concerns about the need for greater consistency and clarity in actions it  takes in exercising this authority.", "In addition to not fully meeting the five key elements of effective oversight,  we found that the Select Agent Program does not have joint strategic  planning documents to guide its shared oversight efforts across CDC and  APHIS. For example, the program does not have a joint mission  statement to collectively define what the program seeks to accomplish  through its oversight. It also does not yet have a strategic plan. Agencies  can use strategic plans to set goals and identify performance measures  for gauging progress towards those goals. Strategic plans can also  outline how agencies plan to collaborate with each other to help achieve  goals and objectives. The program began taking steps to develop a joint  strategic plan during the course of our review and, in August 2017, began  soliciting bids from contractors for the plan\u2019s development. The statement  of work for the contract stipulates that the contractor shall develop guiding  principles for the Select Agent Program along with a mission statement  and strategic goals and objectives, among other requirements. However,  it does not have any requirements related to development of a joint  workforce plan. We have found in the past that agencies\u2019 strategic  workforce planning should be clearly linked to the agency\u2019s mission and  long-term goals developed during the strategic planning process.  Developing a joint workforce plan that assesses workforce and training  needs for the program as a whole would help the program to better  manage fragmentation by improving how it leverages resources to ensure  all workforce and training needs are met. Leveraging resources is  especially important given fiscal constraints.", "In our report, we recommended that CDC and APHIS take several steps  to address these findings. First, we made five recommendations to  improve independence, including that CDC and APHIS regularly assess  the potential risks posed by the program\u2019s structure and the effectiveness  of its mechanisms to address those risks, and take actions as necessary  to ensure any identified risks are addressed so that impairments to  independence do not affect its ability to achieve its objectives. Second, to  improve the ability to perform reviews, we recommended that the  directors of the Select Agent Program work together to develop and  implement a plan to identify which laboratory activities carry the highest  biological safety and security risks and to respond to those risks by  aligning inspections and other oversight efforts to target those activities.  We also made several other recommendations, including recommending  that the directors of the Select Agent Program develop a joint workforce  plan that assesses workforce and training needs for the program as a  whole."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Countries and Regulatory Sectors Employ Other Approaches to Promote Effective Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Selected countries and regulatory sectors employ approaches to promote  effective oversight that sometimes differ from those of the Select Agent  Program by, for example, having regulatory bodies that are structurally  independent from the entities they oversee or taking a risk-based  approach to performing reviews. To illustrate, with regard to  independence, Great Britain\u2019s Health and Safety Executive, whose  mission is to protect worker and public health and safety and which  oversees laboratories that work with pathogens, is an independent  government agency. According to officials from the Health and Safety  Executive and laboratory representatives, one strength of this approach is  that it avoids potential organizational conflicts of interest because none of  the laboratories it oversees are part of the same agency. Some other  regulatory sectors in the United States, including the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC), are also structurally independent from regulated  facilities as a mechanism to ensure independence. Prior to the creation of  NRC in 1974, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission was responsible for  both promotion and oversight of the nuclear industry. The Energy  Reorganization Act of 1974 established NRC as a separate, independent  entity. According to a Senate committee report, this was a response to  growing criticism that there was a basic conflict between the U.S. Atomic  Energy Commission\u2019s regulation of the nuclear power industry and its  development and promotion of new technology for the industry.", "Related to the ability to perform reviews, regulators in Great Britain and  Canada apply a risk-based approach by targeting laboratories with a  documented history of performance issues or those conducting higher- risk activities. In both Great Britain and Canada, the organizations that  oversee laboratories generally focus their oversight on (1) biological  safety, and (2) regulation of all potentially hazardous pathogens in  laboratories. In contrast, the Select Agent Program originated from  security-related concerns and regulates only those pathogens identified  on the U.S. select agent list and no other pathogens that may be handled  in high-containment but are not select agents, such as West Nile virus.", "Other differences we found in approaches include relying on scientists  and other laboratory personnel to have requisite technical expertise on  the pathogens and activities in their laboratories, sharing incident  information on their public websites, and having prosecutorial authority  when incidents occur.", "In conclusion, CDC and APHIS share a critical role in ensuring that  important research on select agents can be conducted in high- containment laboratories in a safe and secure manner. The Select Agent  Program has made a number of improvements over the past few years,  such as hiring additional staff and improving training to enhance  expertise. Nevertheless, the program does not fully meet all key elements  of effective oversight and more is needed to develop joint strategic plans  to collectively guide its shared oversight efforts. In our prior work, we  have found that existing federal oversight of high-containment  laboratories is fragmented and largely self-policing, among other things.  Our October 2017 report, in combination with these past findings,  continues to raise questions about whether the current government  framework and oversight are adequate.", "Vice Chairman Griffith, Ranking Member DeGette, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes our prepared statement.
