These potential threats can be partially mitigated by having a national public health situational awareness capability\u2014that is, a capability for public health officials to be able to access real-time information about emerging threats to enable them to make timely, responsive decisions to prepare for and respond to emergencies. PAHPRA required HHS to establish a near real-time electronic nationwide public health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network of systems.", "PAHPRA also included a provision for GAO to evaluate HHS's progress in developing such a capability. This report addresses what progress HHS has made toward establishing the network. GAO analyzed documents describing HHS's plan for enhancing public health situational awareness and evaluated evidence of actions taken by HHS to establish the network required by PAHPRA. GAO also examined the department's IT planning and management processes and guidance, and interviewed HHS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA) required the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish an electronic nationwide public health situational awareness network and to develop an implementation plan to guide its efforts. The law further required HHS to include in its plan specific activities for incorporating data into the network. HHS developed an implementation plan that identified several actions related to enhancing existing information-sharing capabilities needed to establish the network. However, the actions identified in the plan did not address all of the required activities, such as defining data elements and standards. Until the department addresses all required activities, it will lack an effective tool for ensuring that public health situational awareness network capabilities have been established in accordance with all of the requirements defined by the law.", "In addition, HHS did not identify measurable steps for completing and tracking the status of the activities required by the law. PAHPRA required HHS to include in its plan the measurable steps to be taken to establish the network. Federal guidance also suggests that implementation plans identify timelines of tasks, cost and resource estimates, and performance metrics that can be used to track and monitor progress toward completing tasks and delivering expected outcomes. According to HHS officials who developed the implementation plan, the department established a committee of policy and planning experts from various federal agencies to define the measurable steps for completing the actions identified in the plan. However, HHS did not assign responsibilities for defining such steps to the committee, and the committee had not done so. Until the department defines measurable steps, it will not have the information and planning tools it needs to make progress toward establishing a network that provides information-sharing capabilities needed by public health entities to prepare for and respond to emergencies, as required by PAHPRA.", "GAO identified other weaknesses in HHS's planning efforts that have contributed to the department's lack of progress toward establishing the network. Specifically, HHS did not follow guidance developed by its Chief Information Officer (CIO) for managing information technology (IT) resources. According to the guidance, officials who manage IT initiatives are to involve a governance organization led by HHS's CIO and designate a project team that includes a project manager and business owner. The team is to manage and oversee initiatives according to the guidance, including the development of a project management plan that identifies timelines and schedules, estimated project resources and costs, and performance metrics for tracking any progress made toward completing tasks and delivering expected outcomes. However, HHS did not designate such a team and did not involve the CIO in its planning efforts. As such, the department lacks the structure and mechanisms needed to plan, manage, and oversee actions for establishing the network. Until HHS adheres to its own guidance for managing the IT resources necessary to improve electronic information-sharing capabilities of systems and networks in use by public health entities throughout the country, it will likely continue to fall short in its efforts to establish the nationwide public health situational awareness network required by PAHPRA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that HHS complete a plan that includes all actions for establishing the network, develop a project management plan that identifies measurable steps for completing the actions, and conduct IT management processes according to CIO guidance.

The components include critical response resources,  medical care capacity, environmental threats, and the preparedness  status of the many public health jurisdictions across the country. In  addition, information about health-related events provided by data  collection and analysis conducted through biosurveillance techniques is  needed to support early detection of disease outbreaks by public health  officials, thus enabling more efficient and appropriate emergency  preparedness and response.", "Since 2006, Congress has mandated that the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) take steps toward improving the nation\u2019s  awareness of threats related to public health emergencies. Specifically,  the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA)  called for  improvements in public health situational awareness techniques. This act  recognized the need for efficient sharing of real-time information to help  prevent the devastating consequences that could result from a public  health emergency. To address this need, the act required HHS to develop  a strategy for establishing a near real-time electronic nationwide public  health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network  of systems. The network was to share data and information to enhance  early detection of, rapid response to, and management of potentially  catastrophic infectious disease outbreaks and other public health  emergencies that originate domestically or abroad. HHS was required to  establish such a network in collaboration with state, local, tribal, and  territorial public health entities. The 2006 law also required us to report on  HHS\u2019s efforts to develop a strategy for establishing the network.  Accordingly, we reported in December 2010 that the department had not  taken the actions required by PAHPA.", "The requirements for HHS to establish the electronic public health  situational awareness network were reiterated in the Pandemic and All- Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (PAHPRA).  In  addition to the requirement that HHS develop a strategy for establishing  the network, this law required the department to develop an  implementation plan that was to accompany such a strategy. The plan  was to define the actions that would need to be taken to establish the  network.", "Further, this law required us to report on HHS\u2019s efforts. Accordingly, our  objective for this review was to determine what progress HHS has made  toward establishing the electronic situational awareness network  capabilities required by the law.", "To address the objective, we focused on steps taken by HHS since our  2010 report toward establishing electronic public health situational  awareness capabilities required by PAHPRA.  In particular, to determine  the progress made by HHS toward establishing the network, we obtained  and reviewed the strategy and implementation plan that the department  developed to address the PAHPRA mandate. We compared the contents  of the implementation plan to the requirements defined in the act to  determine the extent to which the requirements were included in the plan.  In doing so, we analyzed actions described in the implementation plan to  determine which were related to the development of new IT capabilities or  enhancements to existing systems that would be needed to establish the  network capabilities. We focused our review on those actions.", "To determine the progress made toward establishing the network, we  examined documentation provided by HHS that reported the steps the  department has taken to address the actions described in the  implementation plan, including the development of systems and  information-sharing tools intended to enhance public health situational  awareness. We also reviewed documentation that provided detailed  information about the systems, such as stakeholders and sources of the  data collected and shared by the systems. We compared HHS\u2019s  implementation plan to departmental guidance for managing enterprise IT  resources and investments. Such guidance included requirements  reflected in the statutory provisions commonly referred to as the Federal  Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA).", "To supplement our analysis of the documentation collected from HHS, we  held discussions with officials in HHS\u2019s Office of the Assistant Secretary  for Preparedness and Response (ASPR). These officials were  responsible for completing the strategy and implementation plan and,  thus, were knowledgeable of the actions that had been taken to establish  the network capabilities required by PAHPRA.

Since clinicians at the county, city, or tribal  level are most likely to be the first ones to detect an incident, they and  local public health officials are expected to report an incident or  symptoms of diseases to the state health department and other  designated parties. States provide supporting personnel, financial  resources, laboratory capacity, and other assistance to local responders  when needed. When an incident occurs that exceeds or is anticipated to  exceed state, local, or tribal resources, state governors may request that  the federal government provide resources to assist the state in its  response efforts.", "For incidents involving primarily federal jurisdictions or authorities (e.g.,  military bases, federal facilities, or federal lands), federal departments  and agencies may be the first responders and first line of defense in  coordinating activities with state, local, and tribal partners. Along with  HHS, several other federal agencies play a role in supporting public  health functions, including the Departments of Agriculture, Homeland  Security, Defense, and Veterans Affairs. Among these, HHS is the  department with primary responsibility for supporting public health  emergency preparedness and response: it serves as the federal focal  point for coordinating response support for public health and medical  services.

This  official is also responsible for coordinating with state, local, tribal, and  territorial officials to ensure effective integration of federal public health  and medical assets during emergencies. The office was established in  December 2006 and is made up of six subordinate offices.", "In addition, PAHPA established the National Biodefense Science Board in  2006, which HHS now refers to as the National Preparedness and  Response Science Board.  This board is to provide expert advice and  guidance to the Secretary on scientific, technical, and other matters  regarding current and future chemical, biological, nuclear, and  radiological agents.", "PAHPA also mandated that the Secretary of HHS develop and submit to  the appropriate committees of Congress by June 16, 2007, a strategic  plan that described the steps the department would take to develop,  implement, and evaluate an electronic public health situational awareness  network. The network was to be made up of interoperable systems that  would enable the simultaneous sharing of information needed to enhance  awareness at the federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels of public  health. The strategy was to identify measurable steps the Secretary  would take to develop, implement, and evaluate the network. It was also  to identify actions for improving information sharing, coordination, and  communication among disparate biosurveillance systems supported by  HHS. The law required the department to establish such a network by  December 19, 2008. The Secretary designated ASPR to be responsible  for developing the public health situational awareness strategy.", "However, we reported in December 2010 that the Secretary of HHS had  not met the requirements enacted by PAHPA in 2006.  In particular, we  found that the department had not developed a strategic plan for  establishing the network and had not integrated relevant but disparate  strategies that existed throughout the department as a step toward  establishing an electronic public health situational awareness network.  Thus, we recommended that the Secretary of HHS develop and  implement a strategic plan that defined goals, objectives, and priorities for  establishing an electronic public health situational awareness network.  We noted that such a plan should include performance measures for  evaluating capabilities of existing and planned information systems,  identify gaps in information-sharing capabilities and needed areas of  improvement, and integrate related strategies within HHS for sharing  information among federal, state, local, and tribal entities. The department  neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation, but stated that a  complete strategy would be developed.", "Subsequently, Congress reauthorized the act in 2013 and reiterated the  mandate for HHS to develop a strategy and implementation plan for  establishing an electronic public health situational awareness network,  and to establish the network.

For example,  electronic biosurveillance systems are used to collect data such as  complaints from emergency department patients and lab test results  related to disease syndromes, and to provide these data to public health  officials. These data collection and information-sharing techniques are  employed not only to detect the initial signs of emerging threats, but also  to track the spread of syndromes, diseases, and other biological events  throughout the duration of a public health emergency. Additionally,  geographic information systems and mapping tools that support  emergency response are useful to public health officials, as these tools  provide visual and quantitative data such as maps of available hospital  facilities and bed capacity, the location of electrical grid generators, and  information regarding regional populations.", "At the federal level, several agencies have implemented and continue to  use IT systems and tools as part of their efforts to collect, integrate, and  share critical public health and medical information. In our December  2010 report, we described 25 systems in use by HHS\u2019s Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration  (FDA), Indian Health Service, and the Office of ASPR to support public  health situational awareness.  These systems had been developed and  implemented to enable emergency response information-sharing in  support of various other public-health-related department initiatives or  mandates.", "In its role as the federal focal point for coordinating response support for  public health and medical services, HHS coordinates national emergency  response efforts for public health emergencies through ASPR\u2019s  Secretary\u2019s Operations Center (SOC). This center was established in  2002 primarily in response to the events of September 11, 2001. The  SOC is a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week emergency operations center that  uses information systems and tools to collect and analyze data from other  federal emergency operations centers, such as those at CDC and FDA.   The systems are also used to share information with other federal  agencies that have responsibility for public health and other emergency  support functions, such as the Departments of Homeland Security,  Agriculture, and Transportation, and with state and local entities.", "ASPR officials stated that they have used information systems operating  from the SOC to support situational awareness during recent  emergencies. For example, during the Louisiana flooding in August 2016,  HHS deployed regional teams to the field to collect public health data  from electronic health records of patients injured or otherwise affected  during the flooding. The teams integrated the data into one of the SOC  analytical tools, called Fusion Analytics, which layered the patient data  with other data, such as information regarding the location of medical  facilities that were available and able to treat certain patients.  The HHS  teams were then able to provide the information to local public health  officials to help them make decisions regarding where to transport victims  for treatment.", "In addition, the department used maps and images produced by another  system, the HHS emPOWER Map, to identify populations of Medicare  beneficiaries who use electricity-dependent medical equipment, such as  ventilators and powered wheelchairs. This information was used to  support planning and response efforts in the field in case of a power  outage. The system also provided graphical information about areas likely  to flood in support of emergency responders making preparations. Figure  3 shows an example of the type of information provided by emPOWER  Map.", "ASPR officials noted other ways in which HHS has used IT systems  operating from the SOC to help provide situational awareness for the  early detection of illnesses in the Zika virus outbreak during the summer  of 2016. For example, HHS used its interactive geographical information  system tool, called GeoHEALTH, to map the number of cases within the  country by state and county. This information was collected from state  and local public health officials via CDC\u2019s disease surveillance systems  and from the National Biosurveillance Information Center via open source  reporting. Using GeoHEALTH, HHS also mapped areas where potential  contraceptive access issues could exist based on a number of key  factors, including counties with high uninsured rates of women of  childbearing age. Another way that GeoHEALTH was used in support of  Zika monitoring was to map laboratory capacity for disease testing, as  well as areas that were screening for Zika in the blood supply. The maps  provided information to public health officials that enabled them to  determine, for example, whether a jurisdiction had the medical facilities,  lab capacity, resources and medications, and expertise needed to  effectively respond to the outbreak. Figure 4 shows an example of a map  produced by GeoHealth.", "ASPR also allows public health entities at the state, local, tribal, and  territorial levels to use its systems to collect data. The data are used by  these other entities to supplement or enhance information collected from  the systems and tools used within their jurisdictions to support  biosurveillance, public health reporting, and emergency response  operations.", "Other HHS systems are also available for use by public health entities  throughout the country. For example, CDC developed and implemented  the BioSense system, which is used not only by its own program and  Emergency Operations Center staff, but also by public health staff at state  and local health departments and the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The system was designed to collect health data from sources such as  hospitals, laboratories, and pharmacies, and to provide public health  entities access to the data.

Specifically, the plan  lacks any actions to address a required activity for defining the minimal  data elements needed to establish the network, and another activity for  collaborating with public health officials to develop standards for  interpreting and reporting on data collected by the network. When  reporting on barriers to meeting requirements of PAHPRA, HHS  described challenges related to the definition of essential data elements  and the establishment of standards to enable system interoperability.  Accordingly, ASPR officials did not include in the implementation plan any  specific actions related to defining the minimal data needed or  establishing applicable standards for the network.", "Table 2 summarizes the required activities and network data providers  defined by PAHPRA, and actions included in the implementation plan that  address the requirements of the law.", "Lacking the specific actions to define the minimal data elements needed  from the sources and to develop standards for sharing the data in  collaboration with state, local, and tribal public health officials, the  implementation plan\u2019s usefulness for ensuring that needed information is  available to be shared in a standardized format and can be used by public  health officials throughout the nation is diminished.

Further, the law required the National Preparedness and  Response Science Board to assist HHS in its planning efforts by  providing expert advice and guidance, including recommendations,  regarding the measurable steps the Secretary should take to modernize  and enhance public health situational awareness information sharing  capabilities through a biosurveillance network. To define measurable  steps for IT projects, OMB guidance notes that implementation plans  should include a timeline of tasks and steps toward implementing  requirements; an estimate of costs to implement the tasks; resource  requirements; and performance metrics to be used to determine whether  tasks are completed on time and within resource requirements, and  whether they result in the expected outcomes.", "However, the implementation plan that HHS developed does not identify  timelines, estimates of cost and resource requirements, or performance  metrics that can be used to track and measure progress made toward  completing tasks and, thus, to determine whether expected progress and  outcomes of the IT-related actions are being achieved. For example,  actions included in the plan to enhance existing information-sharing  networks in support of public health situational awareness are defined to  be taken within a broad time frame\u2014between 2016 and 2018\u2014but do not  include metrics, such as interim milestones for completing specific tasks,  that could be used to monitor and measure progress toward completing  the actions. Further, the plan does not identify cost estimates to  implement the actions or any performance metrics to determine whether  the outcomes of the actions deliver expected benefits on time and within  cost, as suggested by OMB guidance.", "HHS officials also did not identify in the implementation plan specific  resource requirements and responsibilities for taking the actions identified  in the plan. For example, although the plan identifies HHS and state,  local, tribal, and territorial stakeholders as the lead entities for taking a  number of the actions, and the Departments of Homeland Security,  Defense, and Veterans Affairs as participating entities, it does not  designate identifiable contacts, such as particular offices within the  departments or stakeholder contacts within the many public health  entities identified in the plan.", "In addition, HHS officials did not include in the implementation plan any  measurable steps related to the enhancement of public health situational  awareness information sharing capabilities through a biosurveillance  network, as required by the law. While the National Preparedness and  Response Science Board provided to HHS a number of  recommendations related to the integration of biosurveillance systems  and information, it did not identify and recommend the specific tasks and  the timelines, estimates of cost, and resources requirements necessary to  achieve a national biosurveillance system based on existing state,  regional, and community level capabilities. Instead, the board  recommended that HHS establish a central authority within the  department to define the measurable steps for achieving these  capabilities.", "ASPR officials stated that they did not identify measurable steps for  completing the actions identified in the implementation plan because they  created the National Health Security Strategic Guidance Committee in the  summer of 2016 to be responsible for developing the measures and  overseeing the conduct of the actions, including those related to  biosurveillance. However, the National Health Security Strategic  Guidance Committee charter does not include any responsibilities related  to defining steps or overseeing the actions for establishing the network,  and, as of May 2017, the committee had not done so.", "Because HHS did not identify measurable steps, in accordance with  PAHPRA and OMB guidance, it lacks key planning elements needed to  ensure the actions are taken to develop the network.

The report discussed the outcomes from one  action that had partially addressed the third objective of the  implementation plan\u2014to evaluate existing network capacity to ensure it is  leveraged where appropriate and that new capacity is promoted where  needed. Specifically, the report described existing capacity within the  department that supports information sharing among public health  entities. It noted that such capacity is achieved through the use of several  systems that ASPR has implemented and operates within the SOC.

Specifically, they did not  assess network capacity existing among all levels of public health to gain  an understanding of the networks and the contributions each could make  to support nationwide public health situational awareness. The officials  did not identify where interoperability existed or was needed between  systems and networks, or whether integration techniques were needed to  ensure that all relevant information from disparate networks could be  shared.", "Further, ASPR officials did not identify and evaluate other federal  agencies\u2019 and state, local, and tribal public health entities\u2019 existing  electronic information-sharing network capabilities, as required by the  law. Although actions for doing so were identified in the plan (actions  3.3.1, 3.3.2, 3.3.5, and 3.3.6), neither ASPR nor any other department  officials had identified electronic information-sharing capabilities existing  among public health entities that could be built upon to establish the  network required by PAHPRA. As a result, outcomes of ASPR\u2019s actions  to evaluate existing capacity did not provide the information needed to  determine what network capabilities already exist throughout all levels of  public health and what system enhancements need to be developed to  establish electronic public health situational awareness capabilities in  accordance with PAHPRA.", "HHS\u2019s January 2017 status report also did not address any other IT- related actions identified in the implementation plan for establishing the  network. Specifically, the report did not discuss any actions taken to  address the first and second objectives of the implementation plan and,  therefore, did not reflect the status of HHS\u2019s efforts to create a working  group and develop a set of measures for each action to track progress  toward developing the network capabilities required by PAHPRA.  Likewise, the report does not address the status of any actions taken by  the department to engage federal and nonfederal public health officials to  ensure the information required to establish the network is available.", "ASPR officials told us that the development and implementation of the  systems operating in the SOC represent the extent of their efforts that  could address IT-related actions identified in the implementation plan.  They stated that the specific actions outlined in the plan had not been  taken because other public health partners within federal agencies and  state, local, tribal, and territorial entities were designated in the plan to be  responsible for leading and participating in the steps necessary to  complete the actions. A director within ASPR further stated that, while  they are responsible for establishing policy and making plans to address  the PAHPRA mandate, they are not responsible for establishing the  electronic network capabilities other than those provided through the  operation of the systems in the SOC.", "However, neither the National Health Security Strategic Guidance  Committee nor any other entity within HHS has taken responsibility to  ensure that actions are taken to establish the network, and to track and  monitor progress of the actions from initiation to completion.

Specifically, while ASPR designated the  National Health Security Strategic Guidance Committee to be responsible  for managing and overseeing the actions related to the establishment of  the network, the committee\u2019s authority was not established in accordance  with department guidelines for managing IT resources. In particular, the  committee does not include a project manager, business owner, or the  CIO; rather, it is made up of policy and planning officials from HHS and  other federal agencies.
