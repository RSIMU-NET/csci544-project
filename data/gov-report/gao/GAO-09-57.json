Securing the U.S. highway infrastructure system is a responsibility shared by federal, state and local government, and the private sector. Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has primary responsibility for ensuring the security of the sector. GAO was asked to assess the progress DHS has made in securing the nation's highway infrastructure. This report addresses the extent to which federal entities have conducted and coordinated risk assessments; DHS has developed a risk-based strategy; and stakeholders, such as state and local transportation entities, have taken voluntary actions to secure highway infrastructure -- and the degree to which DHS has monitored such actions. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed risk assessment results and TSA's documented security strategy, and conducted interviews with highway stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal entities have several efforts underway to assess threat, vulnerability, and consequence--the three elements of risk--for highway infrastructure; however, these efforts have not been systematically coordinated among key federal partners and the results are not routinely shared. Several component agencies and offices within DHS and the Department of Transportation (DOT) are conducting individual risk assessment efforts of highway infrastructure vulnerabilities, and collectively have completed assessments of most of the critical highway assets identified in 2007. However, key DHS entities reported that they were not coordinating these activities or sharing the results. According to the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, TSA is responsible for coordinating risk assessment programs. Establishing mechanisms to enhance coordination of risk assessments among key federal partners could strengthen and validate assessments and leverage limited federal resources. DHS, through TSA, has developed and implemented a strategy to guide highway infrastructure security efforts, but the strategy is not informed by available risk assessments and lacks some key characteristics GAO has identified for effective national strategies. In May 2007, TSA issued the Highway Modal Annex, which is intended to serve as the principal strategy for implementing key programs for securing highway infrastructure. While its completion was an important first step to guide protection efforts, GAO identified a number of limitations that may influence its effectiveness. For example, the Annex is not fully based on available risk information, although DHS's Transportation Systems -Sector Plan and the National Infrastructure Protection Plan call for risk information to be used to guide all protection efforts. Lacking such information, DHS cannot provide reasonable assurance that its current strategy is effectively addressing security gaps, prioritizing investments based on risk, and targeting resources toward security measures that will have the greatest impact. GAO also identified a number of additional characteristics of effective national strategies that were missing or incomplete in the current Highway Modal Annex. Federal entities, along with other highway sector stakeholders, have taken a variety of actions to mitigate risks to highway infrastructure; however, DHS, through TSA, lacks a mechanism to determine the extent to which voluntary security measures have been employed to protect critical assets. Specifically, highway stakeholders have developed publications and training, conducted research and development activities, and implemented specific voluntary protective measures for infrastructure assets, such as fencing and cameras. However, TSA does not have a mechanism to monitor protective measures implemented for critical highway infrastructure assets, although TSA is tasked with evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of federal initiatives to secure surface transportation modes. Without such a monitoring mechanism, TSA cannot determine the level of security preparedness of the nation's critical highway infrastructure."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the nation\u2019s  highway transportation system includes approximately four million miles  of roadways, 600,000 bridges, and 50 tunnels over 500 meters in length.  This system supports 86 percent of all personal travel, moves 80 percent of  the nation\u2019s freight (based on value), and serves as a key component in  national defense mobility. The U.S. highway system is particularly  vulnerable to potential terrorist attacks because of its openness\u2014vehicles  and their operators can move freely and with almost no restrictions, and  some bridge and tunnel elements are easily accessible and located in  isolated areas making them more challenging to secure. Failure to prepare  for a terrorist attack against critical highway infrastructure could,  according to security experts, lead to catastrophic loss of life and  economic disruption estimated to be in the billions of dollars. Thus, the  challenge of effectively securing the nation\u2019s highway infrastructure  against legitimate threats involves balancing the cost and effectiveness of  implementing security measures while not impeding the free flow of  people and commerce.", "Securing the nation\u2019s highway infrastructure system is a responsibility  shared by federal, state and local governments, and the private sector.  Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transportation  Security Administration (TSA) has primary responsibility for ensuring the  security of highway infrastructure. DHS\u2019s Infrastructure Protection (IP)  Office, whose mission includes leading the coordinated national effort to  reduce the risk to critical infrastructure and key resources posed by acts  of terrorism, supports TSA\u2019s efforts to protect highway infrastructure. In  addition, the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is the lead federal agency  responsible for the security of the nation\u2019s ports and waterways, which  may include highway assets that have a maritime nexus, such as bridges.  In conjunction with highway infrastructure stakeholders, such as state and  local governments, the federal government is involved in a range of  security efforts, including conducting risk assessments, providing  guidance and training to asset owners, and conducting research and  development activities, among others. The federal government is also  responsible for providing some funding assistance to highway  infrastructure stakeholders. However, the bulk of the responsibility for  implementing specific security measures falls largely on state and local  governments who own most highway infrastructure, although independent  entities, such as public authorities and private entities, own a limited  number of major, iconic structures.", "You asked us to assess the progress DHS has made in securing the nation\u2019s  highway infrastructure. This report answers the following questions:     To what extent have federal entities assessed the risks to the  nation\u2019s highway infrastructure and coordinated these efforts?", "To what extent has DHS developed a risk-based strategy,  consistent with applicable federal guidance and characteristics of  an effective national strategy, to guide its highway infrastructure  security efforts?", "What actions have government and highway sector stakeholders  taken to secure highway infrastructure, and to what extent has  DHS monitored the implementation of asset-specific protective  security measures?", "To identify what efforts federal entities have taken to assess the risk to  highway infrastructure and coordinated their efforts, we obtained and  analyzed risk assessment data from DHS and the Department of  Transportation (DOT), comprised of various threat, vulnerability, and  consequence related assessments for highway infrastructure assets. We  sought to determine the reliability of these data by, among other things,  obtaining information on the processes used for collecting and  maintaining written data from agency officials. On the basis of our review  of the processes used to collect the data, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We interviewed DHS,  DOT and selected state transportation, homeland security, and law  enforcement officials, associations representing highway infrastructure  owners and operators, and members of the Highway Government  Coordinating Council (GCC) and the Highway Sector Coordinating  Council (SCC), to discuss federal risk assessment efforts. We also  obtained information on federal coordination and collaboration activities  from TSA and highway infrastructure stakeholders and compared these  efforts to the coordination requirements established in Homeland Security  Presidential Directive-7, as well as GAO\u2019s recommended practices for  effective collaboration. To assess the extent to which DHS developed a  risk-based strategy consistent with applicable federal guidance, including  the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and the Transportation  Systems Sector-Specific Plan (TSSP) and best practices to guide its  highway infrastructure security efforts, we reviewed federal agency  reports, guidelines, and infrastructure security studies on risk  management sponsored by industry associations. We also interviewed  DHS and DOT officials, state, and industry association highway  infrastructure representatives regarding their use of risk management  principles for protecting highway infrastructure. As the principal strategy  for protecting the nation\u2019s highway infrastructure, we also analyzed TSA\u2019s  Highway Modal Annex to determine how it aligned with the requirements  set out in Executive Order 13416, Strengthening Surface Transportation  Security. In addition, we assessed the extent to which the Highway Modal  Annex contained the desirable characteristics for an effective national  strategy that we have previously identified. To identify the actions taken  by government and highway sector stakeholders to enhance the security  of highway infrastructure and assess the extent to which DHS through  TSA monitored the implementation of asset specific protective security  measures implemented by stakeholders, we interviewed DHS, DOT, and  the Department of Defense (DOD), and selected state transportation and  homeland security officials; associations representing highway  infrastructure operators; and the chairpersons of the Highway GCC and  SCC. Although the perspectives of the state transportation and homeland  security officials we spoke with cannot be generalized across the wider  population of highway infrastructure owners and operators, they provided  us a broad overview of highway infrastructure asset security. We selected  the associations that we spoke with based on input from TSA, FHWA, and  industry stakeholders who identified the major associations representing  highway infrastructure owners and operators. We also analyzed TSA  reviews of security practices at the state level and records of GCC and  SCC meetings and stakeholder conferences. In addition, we selected 12  bridges and 1 tunnel to observe security measures implemented since  September 11, 2001, and to discuss security-related issues with highway  infrastructure owners and operators. We selected these assets based on  criteria including location, ownership, and importance or criticality. We  also considered input from TSA, DOT, and the American Association of  State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) to help ensure that  selected assets represented those that have implemented a range of  security measures\u2014from minimal to more robust. Due to the limited  number of assets in our sample, and because the selected assets did not  constitute a representative sample, the results of our observation and  analysis cannot be generalized to the universe of highway infrastructure  assets. However, our observations provided us with an overview of the  kinds of security measures implemented at some critical infrastructure  since September 11, 2001 as well as perspectives on issues highway  infrastructure owners and operators face.

While a number of federal laws impose safety requirements on  highway infrastructure, no federal laws explicitly require highway  infrastructure operators to take action to safeguard their assets against a  terrorist attack. In November 2001, the Aviation and Transportation  Security Act (ATSA) generally required TSA to (1) receive, assess, and  distribute intelligence information related to transportation security; (2)  assess threats to transportation security and develop policies, strategies,  and plans for dealing with those threats, including coordinating  countermeasures with other federal organizations; and, (3) enforce  security-related regulations and requirements. Further, in November  2002, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 created DHS and mandated IP to  comprehensively assess the vulnerabilities of the critical infrastructure  and key resources of the United States; integrate relevant information,  intelligence analyses, and vulnerability assessments to identify protective  priorities and support implemented protective security measures; and  develop a comprehensive national plan for securing the key resources and  critical infrastructures of the United States.

These efforts are intended to help identify potential security  gaps and prioritize mitigation solutions. However, the degree to which  vulnerability assessments have been completed for individual highway  infrastructure assets varies considerably between these entities, given  their available resources and other security priorities. For example, given  the substantial number of highway infrastructure assets under their  jurisdiction and staffing limitations, TSA\u2019s Highway Motor Carrier Division  (HMC) has chosen to identify highway infrastructure vulnerabilities by  working primarily with State departments of transportation to identify the  extent to which common security practices are employed.

These security reviews focus primarily  on state DOT offices, but may include other state agencies with  transportation security functions, such as the Offices of Emergency  Management or Homeland Security. At the time of our review, HMC  officials stated that the resources associated with conducting vulnerability  assessments makes it impractical to conduct asset-specific assessments of  the vast number of bridges and tunnels that comprise the nation\u2019s highway  system. For this reason, HMC had chosen to utilize primarily a non asset- specific approach to conducting vulnerability assessments of the highway  infrastructure sector, through the CSRs.  HMC officials stated that they  rely on infrastructure owners and operators to conduct asset-level  vulnerability assessments on highway assets, and that they generally  review these findings as a component of their CSR activities. However, as  previously stated, after reviewing a draft this report, TSA commented in  January 2009 that it intends to conduct individual assessments on all  bridge and tunnel properties that TSA has identified as critical beginning  in 2009.", "Since the CSR program was initiated in May 2004, HMC has completed  CSRs for most of the states and a select number of CSRs for specific  highway infrastructure assets. According to HMC officials, the goal of  these efforts is to assess potential security gaps and provide state officials  with suggested actions for strengthening security. However, the pace of  TSA\u2019s CSR program has slowed considerably in recent years, and no  timeframe currently exists for their completion for all 50 states.  Specifically, most of the state level CSRs were conducted during the first  two years of the program\u2019s implementation, which began in May 2004.  HMC officials stated that a combination of competing priorities and a  reduction in staff available to perform CSR\u2019s led to the slowing of this  effort. Specifically, HMC officials said that the 9/11 Commission Act placed  a number of additional requirements on the division, such as completing a  national risk assessment for school buses. While HMC officials are  currently planning to conduct highway infrastructure CSR\u2019s in all  remaining states, it remains unclear if, or when, this will be achieved. In  accordance with standard program management principles, timeframes or  milestones should typically be incorporated as part of a road map to  achieve a specific desired outcome or result. The voluntary nature of the  CSR program contributes to the inability for TSA to establish clear  timeframes for completion. For example, according to HMC officials, two  states have already declined to participate in the CSR program due to their  lack of perceived security risk to their assets. In January 2009, HMC  officials said that one of those states subsequently reversed its decision  and is willing to participate in the CSR program. In 2008, HMC also began  conducting follow-up state level CSR\u2019s to states previously assessed, and  has completed a limited number of such assessments as of January 2009.  According to TSA officials, the purpose of these visits is to update existing  data and determine current infrastructure security efforts at the state- level.", "In the absence of CSR vulnerability data for infrastructure assets in the  remaining states, TSA may rely on other mechanisms to obtain this data.  As outlined in HSPD-7, the SSA is responsible for conducting or facilitating  vulnerability assessments across the sector. According to TSA officials,  the CSR effort represents their primary mechanism for meeting this  responsibility. Yet, given competing priorities and resource limitations  identified by HMC, there may be limited value to expending further  resources to complete highway infrastructure CSRs in states or territories  lacking any critical assets. Specifically, only two remaining states or  territories that have not undergone a CSR have any highway infrastructure  assets deemed nationally critical by IP. However, to obtain vulnerability  information for the remaining critical assets, TSA could conduct a CSR  visit or collaborate with other highway sector stakeholders. For example,  HMC may be able to leverage the resources of other federal partners that  have completed vulnerability assessments for those assets. Another  potential option includes the utilization of the existing bridge safety  program to obtain information about critical asset vulnerabilities.  According to HMC officials, they are currently conducting pilot programs  with several states to incorporate security-related questions within  mandatory National Bridge Inspection program conducted biennially by  state inspectors. While TSA has stated that it intends to conduct  individual assessments on all bridge and tunnel properties that it has  identified as critical, TSA does not plan to begin those assessments until  our review is completed.

While DHS provides the assessment tools as well as operational  and technical support, the actual BZPP assessment is conducted by local  law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction over the selected asset. Based  on the vulnerabilities identified during the assessment, a Buffer Zone Plan  is developed, in cooperation between IP and state and local partners, to  address potential security gaps and identify measures to deter terrorist  activity near key assets. As part of this plan, recommended enhancements  are identified that may be eligible for grant funding based on a validation  of the assessment and approval of a spending plan by IP officials.

For example, HITRAC disseminates  worksheets to each of the SSA\u2019s to collect estimates of consequences  resulting from a variety of different attack scenarios. For each scenario,  the SSA develops numerical rankings for several categories of potential  consequences, including potential loss of life, economic effects,  psychological consequences, and potential effect on agency mission.

In addition, some asset-level  federal vulnerability assessments, such as SAVs, also include estimates of  potential consequences. For example, the standard template used to  record information during these visits incorporates a series of questions  regarding consequences to estimate the potential loss of life and other  economic consequences resulting from an attack, and to determine how  critical the asset is based on its interdependencies with other  transportation systems or facilities. Although these consequence estimates  are a key component of an asset-specific risk assessment, not all critical  highway assets have been subject to an SAV assessment to allow for  consequence data to be evaluated nationwide to help establish protection  priorities.

According to USCG officials, MSRAM analysis routinely  includes the review of completed IP assessments of port-related  infrastructure, including bridges and tunnels; however, coordination  among the other two agencies is less mature. For example, HMC officials  were generally unfamiliar with the scope of IP\u2019s SAV assessments and  were unaware how these activities may be leveraged to achieve mutual  goals. According to TSA officials, they had begun to receive notifications  of IP assessments in July 2008; however, in September 2008, they stated  that they generally do not review these assessments or incorporate the  results.

However, OIP officials stated that, due to  a lack of funding, the scope of this effort was limited only to IP\u2019s own  vulnerability assessments.", "Another area where additional collaboration between federal partners may  be improved involves the potential streamlining, or standardization, of  existing assessment tools and methodologies. As outlined in the NIPP,  vulnerability assessments need to be comparable to support national-level  and cross-sector analysis. Further, HSPD-7 requires DHS to establish  uniform policies, approaches, guidelines, and methodologies for  integrating Federal infrastructure protection and risk management  activities within and across sectors.  However, a number of varied risk  assessment tools and methodologies exist both within and across sectors  that differ in terms of assumptions, comprehensiveness, and objectivity.  Efforts to combine or streamline some of these tools and methodologies  may assist to enhance the comparability and usefulness of the various risk  assessments. For example, IP\u2019s Strategic Plan: FY 2008-2013, identifies  opportunities for the development of a scalable methodology, in  collaboration with other SSAs, to standardize current approaches for  identifying vulnerabilities and promote better coordination and  collaboration. USCG officials also cited the need for a comprehensive risk  analysis model so that all sectors could utilize a common tool. According  to the Highway Modal Annex to the TSSP, issued in May 2007, TSA was  working with DOT agencies, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration (FMCSA) and FHWA, to combine their respective risk  assessment and risk mitigation tools into a single product that will reduce  redundancy, increase efficiencies, and minimize impact on private  stakeholders.

In addition, the 9/11 Commission Act  requires DHS and DOT to execute and develop an annex to the  memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the two agencies, which  was signed in September 2004, that addresses motor carrier security. The  annex must delineate specific roles, responsibilities, and resources needed  to address motor carrier transportation security matters and the processes  the Departments will follow to promote communications, efficiency, and  ensure non duplication of effort. HMC officials stated that they plan on  developing a similar annex to the MOU for highway infrastructure, but  they do not have a timetable for doing so. Our prior work has shown that  collaboration between federal stakeholders can be improved by clearly  identifying organizational roles, responsibilities and specific processes for  collaboration between sectors\u2014and how any conflicts would be resolved.  HMC officials stated that such an annex would serve to lay the  groundwork and provide the proper protocols for sharing of data and  personnel, and acknowledge leadership roles and responsibilities to  strengthen highway infrastructure security.", "The 9/11 Commission Act also requires that DHS, to the greatest extent  practicable, provide public and private stakeholders with transportation  security information in an unclassified format. The Highway Modal  Annex provides limited details on how (process, policy, mechanism) it will  collaborate or what is needed to enhance information and intelligence  sharing. For example, the Annex does not describe HITRAC\u2019s role related  to information sharing. HITRAC is a joint organization between IP and the  Critical Infrastructure Threat Analysis Division within I&A that is to  integrate, analyze, and share information regarding threats and risks to  U.S. critical infrastructure for DHS, other federal departments and  stakeholders, the intelligence community, state and local governments and  law enforcement stakeholders, and the private sector. HMC officials  attributed this omission to the TSA guidance used to develop the Highway  Modal Annex not requiring a description of how it is to collaborate or what  is needed to enhance information and intelligence sharing. The Act also  required DHS to establish a plan to share transportation information  relating to the risks to transportation modes, including the highway mode  that was due in early 2008; however the plan has not yet been completed.  TSA officials said that DHS was developing the information sharing plan,  but they did not know when the plan would be issued.

These incentives are important because asset  owners are not currently regulated by TSA. According to HMC officials,  the guidance provided by TSA to HMC used to develop the Highway Modal  Annex did not require a description of possible incentives. In addition,  HMC officials said that they are working on developing a separate national  bridge strategy to supplement the Annex.   According to HMC officials the  national bridge strategy is to assist the stakeholder community in  assessing both the criticality and the security vulnerabilities of its assets;  identify the most appropriate and cost- effective mitigation tools; and  serve as a mechanism for the identification of sources of funding that are  exclusively dedicated to security needs and do not require diversion of  funding that is otherwise reserved for safety or structural enhancement or  refurbishment.

Highway  infrastructure operators have received some federal funding for  implementing security upgrades since September 11th, 2001, but available  funding has been limited due to competing priorities, such as dams and  nuclear facilities.

Within the highway sector, these activities include  research on the vulnerabilities of bridges and tunnels to various types of  explosives and experimental methods to help protect these assets. At the  federal level, research and development activities are coordinated through  the DHS Transportation Sector Working Group.

Unlike some other transportation modes, such as commercial aviation, no  federal laws explicitly require highway infrastructure owners to take  security actions to safeguard their assets against a terrorist attack. The  protection of highway infrastructure is being undertaken using a voluntary  approach, although TSA retains the authority to issue and enforce security  related regulations and requirements it deems necessary to protect  transportation assets. According to HMC officials, TSA\u2019s decision to  implement a voluntary approach to highway infrastructure security is  based on available threat information, as well as information obtained  during CSR activities, which indicates to them that states are generally  aware of their security responsibilities and are implementing protective  actions. In addition, HMC officials stated that a voluntary approach to  security requires reduced federal resources and provides a greater amount  of buy-in and acceptance from asset owners than government regulations.  Asset owners have implemented a range of voluntary protective security  measures to help ensure public safety and protect their highway  infrastructure assets. For example, asset owners commonly employ  measures such as cameras or other surveillance equipment, and install  fencing and other physical barriers to control access to vulnerable  structures, among other protective measures. (See appendix III for  additional examples of protective security measures for highway  infrastructure assets). Specific mitigation measures typically fall into three  broad categories:     Deterrence and Detection. These mitigation measures secure access to  restricted areas and reduce the likelihood of a potential attack. Common  protective security measures include installing fencing, improving lighting,  conducting security patrols and installing electronic detection systems.", "Defense. Defensive measures are intended to reduce the consequences of  a successful attack. For example, installation of a physical barrier around  vulnerable components or systems, such as a bridge pier, may reduce the  impact of an explosive blast on the structure.", "Design and Redesign. These efforts are intended to harden planned or  existing infrastructure assets against potential attacks by incorporating  security considerations into engineering designs.", "According to highway infrastructure operators, factors such as competing  priorities and budgetary constraints greatly influence whether security  measures are implemented. One principal factor impacting the  implementation of security measures identified by some state officials we  spoke to concerns the availability of revenue sources to fund security  improvements for individual assets. For example, bridges and tunnels  funded by user fees, such as tolls, could generate additional revenue for  security enhancements. Alternately, mitigation measures financed with  general federal and state transportation funds may be limited due to  competing state priorities. However, the federal government has provided  funds to state and local stakeholders to implement highway infrastructure  improvements through a combination of several FEMA grant programs.  Since 2004, FEMA has funded 60 highway-related security projects,  totaling approximately $34 million (see table 3). Some of these projects  include funding for additional cameras and surveillance equipment,  watercraft for investigation and response to threats, and interoperable  communication equipment, among others.", "States have generally taken actions to help secure their highway  infrastructure; however, wide variation exists regarding the  implementation of specific protection efforts. According to TSA\u2019s 2006  summary of its CSRs, all of the states polled have completed at least some  security-related actions among the 11 functional areas assessed by TSA.  However, TSA reported that the level of implementation of security  actions varied between states. For example, TSA reported that  background checks of transportation workers conducted by state agencies  ranged from a criminal history check driving records and citizenship  checks down to reference checks for employment applications. According  to TSA, the need for background checks varied from state to state, since  the perceived threat and the level of risk tolerance also vary by state. In  another example, most of the states responded that they conducted  security planning at the state level; however, according to TSA, state  governments vary considerably in the way the security plans are  organized. For example, they reported that states assign different security  functions to different agencies\u2014particularly for transportation security  functions. Each agency does some level of planning to ensure its ability to  perform its functions. As a result, these preparations are documented in  different places, including emergency response plans, traffic management  plans, hazardous materials management plans, National Guard plans,  homeland security advisory level preparedness plans, continuity of  operations plans, and police patrol plans. Some of the plans are more  complete than others, depending on the diligence of the agency. TSA  reported that most of these states were able to produce a document that  defined basic responses to different threat levels and defined who was in  charge. Similar variation in state responses and the scope of individual  efforts were also illustrated in several of the other security-related  functional areas.", "The variation in state security efforts identified by TSA is generally  consistent with what we identified during interviews with officials and  observations of select highway infrastructure in five states. Although the  specific protective security measures implemented at the 13 individual  assets we visited were varied, we identified some common mitigation  themes, such as investment in new security equipment, leveraging law  enforcement resources, and identifying incident response roles, among  others. Specific protective measures identified by asset owners with whom  we spoke, include increased surveillance efforts\u2014adding cameras and  other detection equipment\u2014as well as installation of fencing, physical  barriers, and implementation of enhanced access controls.

However, TSA has  not documented how it will monitor the industry\u2019s progress in  implementing voluntary highway infrastructure protective security  measures for assets identified as nationally critical.", "Although various federal entities have issued suggested security measures  to asset owners, the extent that they have been implemented remains  unclear. DHS risk assessment activities, including the CSR and SAV  programs, identified highway infrastructure assets that would benefit from  additional security measures and have suggested a number of voluntary  protective actions to asset owners to address these enhancements.  However, given the voluntary nature of these programs, TSA, IP, and  USCG stated that they do not know the extent to which asset owners are  implementing the protective security measures identified by completed  risk assessments for critical infrastructure. In addition to competing  resource priorities previously identified, IP officials stated that monitoring  the implementation of voluntary protective security measures remains  difficult due to limited resources. Specifically, they stated that IP does not  have the resources needed to conduct follow-up assessments on all Tier 1  and Tier 2 assets across all critical infrastructure and key resources. They  also noted that repeated visits may create a burden on private sector  partners. In 2008, IP implemented the Enhanced Critical Infrastructure  Protection initiative.  This effort involves sending PSAs to all Tier 1 and 2  assets, including transportation infrastructure.  According to DHS, while  this is a voluntary, non-regulatory program, PSAs conduct initial and  follow-up visits to CIKR and document the implementation of enhanced  security and protective measures.  According to HMC officials, the  completion of a second round of state CSR visits will provide an  opportunity to review whether asset owners are implementing previous  CSR-related security considerations; however, the follow-up visits will be  performed over a four year cycle and will not be conducted at the asset  level. While these efforts are a positive step, they do not provide the type  of detailed information necessary to ensure that specific highway  infrastructure assets, particularly those deemed nationally critical, are  protected. According to TSA officials, the collection of more detailed data  about protective measures is not currently feasible given available  resources and other security priorities. However, HMC officials have  stated that alternative cost-effective methods of collecting this information  may be available, such as potentially leveraging the resources of state  transportation inspectors during biannual bridge safety inspections.

While the cost of enhancing highway  infrastructure security can be significant, the potential costs of a terrorist  attack, in terms of both the loss of life and property and long-term  economic impacts, would also be significant although difficult to predict  and quantify. The importance of the nation\u2019s highway infrastructure and  the limited resources available to protect it underscore the need for a risk  management approach to prioritize security efforts so that a proper  balance between costs and security can be achieved. By not fully  evaluating the risks posed by terrorists to the nation\u2019s highway  infrastructure through available assessments, TSA and its security  partners are limited in their ability to focus resources on those highway  infrastructure vulnerabilities that represent the most critical security  needs. The large and diverse group of stakeholders involved in highway  infrastructure security makes it difficult to achieve the needed  cooperation and consensus to move forward with security efforts. As we  have noted in past reports, coordination and consensus-building are  critical to the successful implementation of security efforts. By  coordinating risk assessment activities and sharing the results of risk  assessments, DHS could more effectively use scarce resources to target  further assessment activities and mitigate identified risks.", "By developing the Highway Modal Annex for highway infrastructure, TSA  established strategic goals and objectives, a key first step in implementing  a risk management approach. However, highway infrastructure  stakeholders could benefit from a Highway Modal Annex that clearly  describes their roles, responsibilities, relationships, and expectations for  securing highway infrastructure and provides accountability for  accomplishing its objectives. Moreover, performance measures developed  in conjunction with the Highway GCC and SCC are important to assist TSA  in evaluating the effectiveness of highway infrastructure programs, based  on desired results that are defined by the Annex. Without performance  measures, TSA may not have information with which to systematically  assess these program\u2019s strengths, weaknesses, and performance.

It will be important over time to obtain  and incorporate feedback from the stakeholder community as to how the  strategy can better provide this guidance, and how Congress and the  executive branch can identify and remedy impediments to  implementation, such as legal, jurisdictional, or resource constraints.  Finally, while the varied actions government and industry stakeholders  have taken to address the risks to highway infrastructure are important  initial efforts, without a mechanism to monitor what protective security  measures are being taken to secure nationally critical infrastructure, TSA  cannot fully determine the extent of security preparedness across the  nation\u2019s highway infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are recommending that the Secretary of Homeland Security take the  following three actions:     To enhance collaboration among federal entities involved in securing  highway infrastructure and better leverage federal resources, we  recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security establish a  mechanism to systematically coordinate risk assessment activities and  share the results of these activities among the federal partners.", "To help ensure that highway infrastructure stakeholders are provided with  useful information to identify and prioritize potential infrastructure  security measures, enhance future planning efforts, and determine the  extent to which specific protective security measures have been  implemented, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security  direct the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security  Administration, in consultation with the Highway Government  Coordinating Council and the Highway Sector Coordinating Council, to  take the following actions:  (1) for the upcoming revision to the Highway Modal Annex:  in addition to the results of threat assessment information, incorporate  the results of available vulnerability, and consequence assessment  information into the strategy for securing highway infrastructure;  consistent with Executive Order 13416 and desirable characteristics of  an effective national strategy, identify existing guidance developed by  other federal and state highway infrastructure stakeholders; indicate  timeframes or milestones for its overall implementation for which  entities can be held responsible; more clearly define security-related  roles and responsibilities for highway infrastructure security activities  for itself and other federal stakeholders, state and local government,  and the private sector; establish a timeframe for developing  performance goals and measures for monitoring the implementation of  the Annex\u2019s goals, objectives, and activities; and provide more  guidance on resources, investments and risk management to help  implementing parties allocate resources and investments according to  priorities and constraints; and  (2) develop a cost-effective mechanism to monitor the implementation  of voluntary protective security measures on highway infrastructure  assets identified as nationally critical."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment.

TSA  stated that it recognizes that it is responsible for all transportation security  matters, must fulfill its leadership role in the highway infrastructure arena,  and is prepared to assume responsibility for all highway infrastructure  security issues.  TSA added that it will request of all DHS, DOT and State  or local governmental bodies that TSA become the repository for all risk  assessment models and data associated with this mode.  Toward this goal,  DHS stated that TSA has convened representatives of both DHS and DOT  agencies to produce the \u201cNational Strategy for Highway Bridge Security,\u201d  which is currently under review by agencies and offices within both  Departments.  Once fully vetted, DHS believes that this document will  provide for appropriate participation and coordination of efforts by all  Federal agencies engaged in highway infrastructure security.  We support  TSA\u2019s efforts to improve coordination and develop the National Strategy  for Highway Bridge Security.  The intent of our recommendation is to help  DHS avoid potential duplication, better focus future assessment efforts,  and leverage limited resources.  Thus, if TSA\u2019s efforts result in a  mechanism that systematically coordinates risk assessment activities  among the federal partners, this effort would go far in addressing the  intent of our recommendation.  Developing a plan that establishes a  mechanism to systematically coordinate risk assessment activities and  share the results of these activities among federal partners will also be an  important and necessary step to fulfilling the agency\u2019s oversight and  coordination responsibilities.", "TSA concurred with our second recommendation to include the results of  available vulnerability and consequence assessment information in the  upcoming revision to the Highway Modal Annex.  In addition, TSA agreed  to incorporate existing guidance developed by other federal and state  highway infrastructure stakeholders, more clearly define security-related  roles and responsibilities, establish a timeframe for its overall  implementation and developing performance goals and measures. TSA  stated that at the time of the drafting of the first iteration of the Highway  Modal Annex, such vulnerability and consequence data was not available.  TSA further stated that as the agency has expanded its CSR program,  become more familiar with the stakeholder community security practices,  and conducted much more detailed analyses of vulnerability and  mitigation tools, TSA has improved its ability to conduct more  comprehensive risk assessments that address threat, vulnerability, and  consequences.  TSA further stated that while those elements were  considered in the preparation of the initial Annex, the document itself did  not adequately explain how they were incorporated into the resulting  strategy, and that future Annex publications would better explain TSA\u2019s  use of all three risk elements. TSA agreed that the agency is in the best  position to provide strategy guidance, coordination and oversight in this  area.  TSA also agreed that implementation milestones and preparedness  timeframes are appropriate for the Highway Modal Annex. However, TSA  cautioned that any limitations on the stakeholder community\u2019s  implementation strategies will be based on a lack of resources, and  indicated that the National Strategy for Highway Bridge Security is  intended to help responsible stakeholders find resources dedicated  exclusively to address the security needs of their structures.  TSA stated  that it does not believe that direct regulation is appropriate for the  stakeholder community accountable for highway structures because,  based on its experience, TSA believes this to be an overwhelmingly  responsible constituency that will be highly proactive given appropriate  resources and guidance.  However, until TSA provides the details of how it  plans to address our recommendation that it incorporate available  vulnerability and consequence information into the Highway Annex and  take other steps to strengthen the Annex, it remains unclear whether TSA  can demonstrate that the Highway Modal Annex provides highway  infrastructure stakeholders with available useful information to identify  and prioritize potential infrastructure security measures, enhances future  planning efforts, clarifies roles and responsibilities, and provides  accountability.", "With regard to our third recommendation to develop a cost-effective  mechanism to monitor the implementation of voluntary protective security  measures on highway infrastructure assets identified as nationally critical,  TSA agrees and stated that it is moving forward to identify a variety of  mechanisms to monitor the voluntary security measures implemented with  respect to critical highway structures. TSA stated that in fiscal year 2009,  using funds made available specifically for this purpose for the first time  since TSA was created, the agency will begin conducting individual  vulnerability assessments on the nationally critical Tier 2 structures list.   According to TSA, each assessment will be accompanied by a TSA- recommended approach to risk mitigation, and TSA will track the status of  those recommendations on a periodic basis.  TSA stated that its security  partners will be kept informed of the progress of this effort.  In addition,  TSA stated its intention to clearly identify any to the implementation of  voluntary security measures and would assist stakeholders in executing  identified measures.  Our intention in making this recommendation is for  TSA to have the tools to allow it to more effectively monitor the level of  overall security preparedness of critical assets, help identify potential  security gaps, establish protection priorities, and determine what, if any,  additional measures may be needed to enhance highway infrastructure  security.  Despite TSA\u2019s stated plans, the agency has not indicated the  frequency with which it plans to compile or analyze information on  highway infrastructure operator\u2019s security practices for critical assets, nor  did TSA provide a time frame for completing the asset specific  vulnerability assessments or identify what mechanisms would be used to  monitor their implementation of voluntary protective security measures on  highway infrastructure assets identified as nationally critical. Taking such  actions would be necessary to fully address the intent of this  recommendation.", "In addition, TSA noted that GAO has misstated or misinterpreted a key  fact involving TSA\u2019s desire and intention to conduct individual  vulnerability assessments on critical highway structures.  TSA believes this  misstatement significantly affects the findings of the report.  TSA noted  that the report indicates that TSA has either not decided whether to  conduct such assessments or determined that they do not need to be done.  Furthermore, TSA stated that it intends to conduct individual assessments  on all bridge and tunnel properties that TSA has identified as critical,  beginning in 2009.  However, TSA did not indicate its desire to conduct  these assessments, nor did it provide any documentation to support these  plans, during the course of this review.  Rather, throughout this review,  TSA officials repeatedly told us that the resources associated with  conducting individual vulnerability assessments of critical assets made it  impractical to conduct such assessments.  For this reason, TSA officials  stated that they would utilize primarily a non asset-specific approach to  conducting vulnerability assessments of the highway infrastructure sector,  through the CSR program, and that the agency would rely on  infrastructure owners and operators to conduct asset-level vulnerability  assessments on highway assets.  TSA officials did not make us aware of its  plans to conduct individual vulnerability assessments of critical assets  until the agency provided written comments on a draft of this report in  January 2009. While we acknowledge TSA\u2019s stated intention to conduct  individual vulnerability assessments on all critical highway infrastructure  assets, we do not believe that the agency\u2019s recently reported plans to  conduct these assessments affect the findings of this report because our  discussion of TSA\u2019s efforts related to highway infrastructure vulnerability  assessments was not used as the basis of any of the report\u2019s  recommendations. However, we have revised this report to clarify TSA\u2019s  plans related to vulnerability assessments. DHS also provided technical  comments and clarifications, which we have considered and incorporated  where appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report, we plan no further distribution for 30 days from the report  date.

This report answers the following questions:  To what extent have federal entities assessed the risks to the nation\u2019s  highway infrastructure and coordinated these efforts?", "To what extent has DHS developed a risk-based strategy, consistent with  applicable federal guidance and characteristics of an effective national  strategy, to guide its highway infrastructure security efforts? and  What actions have government and highway sector stakeholders taken to  secure highway infrastructure, and to what extent has DHS monitored the  implementation of asset-specific protective security measures?"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent that federal entities have assessed the risks to the  nation\u2019s highway infrastructure and coordinated these efforts, we obtained  and analyzed risk assessment data from DHS and DOT, comprised of  various threat, vulnerability, and consequence related assessments for  highway infrastructure assets. We did not assess the quality of the  assessments completed. We sought to determine the reliability of these  data by, among other things, discussing methods of inputting and  maintaining data with agency officials. On the basis of these discussions  and our review of the processes used to collect the data, we determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We  interviewed DHS, DOT and selected state transportation, homeland  security, and law enforcement officials, associations representing highway  infrastructure owners and operators, and members of the Highway GCC  and the Highway SCC, to discuss federal risk assessment efforts. Although  the selected state transportation and homeland security officials  perspectives cannot be generalized across the wider population of  highway infrastructure owners and operators, because we selected these  states based on characteristics including location, and input on states  representing security programs in which minimal to more robust security  measures were implemented, they provided us a broad overview of  highway infrastructure asset security. We selected the associations that we  spoke with based on input from TSA, FHWA, and industry stakeholders  who identified the major associations representing highway infrastructure  owners and operators. To determine the extent to which TSA has used a  risk management approach to guide decisions on securing highway  infrastructure, we compared NIPP and TSSP requirements with TSA\u2019s  efforts to implement such an approach. We focused on the strategic  planning and risk assessment elements related activities of the NIPP  management framework because DHS is early on in the process. The  views reported include only those individuals we interviewed and are not  necessarily representative of the views of others in those organizations.  We also reviewed federal coordination and collaboration activities related  to stakeholder efforts to assess and strengthen highway infrastructure  security and compared them to GAO\u2019s recommended coordination  practices. We also discussed with DHS, DOT and selected state  transportation, homeland security, and law enforcement officials,  associations representing highway infrastructure operators, and members  of the Highway GCC, and the Highway SCC, the federal coordination and  collaboration activities related to stakeholder efforts to assess and  strengthen highway infrastructure security and compared them to the  coordination requirements established in Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-7, as well as GAO\u2019s recommended practices for effective  collaboration. In addition, we analyzed TSA\u2019s actions regarding  performance measurement with requirements in the Government  Performance Results Act and GAO Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government regarding the use of use performance measurement.  To obtain information on how threat information is shared and TSA\u2019s  efforts to address threats, we met with officials from TSA\u2019s Highway Motor  Carrier Division, TSA\u2019s OI, and HITRAC. Individuals from these offices  provided documentation on DHS and DOT\u2019s threat assessment efforts. In  addition, we met with officials from DOT\u2019s Office of Intelligence regarding  the sharing of threat information.", "To assess the extent to which DHS developed a risk-based strategy  consistent with applicable federal guidance and characteristics of an  effective national strategy to guide its highway infrastructure security  efforts, we reviewed federal agency reports, guidelines, and infrastructure  security studies sponsored by industry associations on using risk  management, and interviewed DHS, and DOT officials and state and  industry association highway infrastructure representatives regarding their  use of risk management for protecting highway infrastructure. As the  principal strategy for protecting the nation\u2019s highway infrastructure, we  also analyzed TSA\u2019s Highway Modal Annex to determine how it aligned  with the requirements set out in Executive Order 13416: Strengthening  Surface Transportation Security. In addition, we assessed the extent to  which the Highway Modal Annex contained the desirable characteristics  for an effective national strategy that we have previously identified.", "To identify the actions taken by government and highway sector  stakeholders to enhance the security of highway infrastructure and assess  the extent TSA has monitored the implementation of protective security  measures implemented by stakeholders, we interviewed DHS, DOT, DOD,  and selected state transportation, homeland security, and law enforcement  officials, all major associations representing highway infrastructure  operators, and members of the Highway GCC, and the Highway SCC. We  also analyzed TSA, IP, and USCG vulnerability assessments of security  practices at the state level and records of GCC and SCC meetings and  stakeholder conferences. In addition, we selected 12 bridges and one  tunnel to observe security measures implemented since September 11,  2001 and to discuss security-related issues with highway infrastructure  owners and operators. We selected these assets based on characteristics  including location, ownership, and criticality, and input on locations  representing assets in which minimal to more robust security measures  were implemented from TSA, DOT, and AASHTO. Because of the limited  number of assets in our sample, and because the selected assets did not  constitute a representative sample, the results of our observation and  analysis cannot be generalized to the universe of highway infrastructure  assets. However, we believe that the observations obtained from these  visits provide us with a broad overview of highway infrastructure asset  security. We also reviewed federal guidance and applicable laws and  regulations. In addition, we observed FHWA training programs and joint  stakeholder conferences. We also reviewed DHS Science and Technology  Directorate, TSA, DOT, AASHTO, and TRB documents to identify research  and development efforts to improve highway infrastructure security. We  also compared TSA\u2019s actions to obtain data on actions taken by highway  infrastructure stakeholders to enhance security and to monitor  implementation of those actions with criteria in GAO Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 through January  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
