The 9/11 Commission Act (9/11 Act) requires 100 percent of U.S.-bound cargo containers to be scanned by 2012, and CBP has begun implementing the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) to address this requirement. GAO was requested to assess CBP's efforts to implement the 9/11 Act requirement. This report addresses (1) CBP's progress at the initial ports participating in the SFI program, (2) CBP plans to implement SFI, (3) the extent to which CBP has estimated costs and conducted a cost-benefit analysis of 100 percent scanning, and (4) any challenges to integrating 100 percent scanning with existing container security programs.

Since the inception of the SFI program, CBP has not been able to achieve 100 percent scanning at any participating port. While CBP has been able to scan a majority of the U.S.-bound cargo containers at the comparatively low volume ports, it has not achieved sustained scanning rates above five percent at the comparatively larger ports. CBP has not developed a plan to scan 100 percent of U.S.-bound container cargo by 2012, but has a strategy to expand SFI to select ports where it will mitigate the greatest risk of WMD entering the United States. CBP does not have a plan to scan cargo containers at all ports because, according to agency officials, challenges encountered thus far in implementing SFI indicate that doing so worldwide will be difficult to achieve. However, CBP has not conducted a feasibility analysis of expanding 100 percent scanning, as required by the SAFE Port Act. Such an analysis could help both CBP and Congress determine the most effective way forward to enhance container security. Recognizing that its strategy will not meet the requirement to scan all U.S.-bound cargo containers, DHS plans to issue a blanket extension to all foreign ports by July 2012 to be in compliance with the 9/11 Act. DHS officials acknowledged that they may revisit this plan before the July 2012 deadline. CBP, while identifying some SFI program costs, has not developed a complete estimate of U.S. program costs because of the lack of a decision on a clear path forward. CBP has also not conducted any cost-benefit analysis which would include other economic costs, including those borne outside the United States, which would be important to any analysis of alternatives to achieving the 100 percent scanning requirement. While uncertainties exist, a cost estimate and cost-benefit analysis, consistent with federal best practices, could assist DHS and CBP in better communicating the magnitude of the costs and benefits to Congress and in designing a clear path forward for enhancing cargo container security. CPB faces a number of potential challenges in integrating the 100 percent scanning requirement into its existing container security programs. The 100 percent scanning requirement is a departure from existing container security programs in that it requires that all containers be scanned before CBP determines their potential risk level. Senior CBP officials and international trading partners say this change differs from CBP's current risk-based approach based on international supply chain security standards. Our work also indicates that the 100 percent scanning requirement could present challenges to the continued operation of existing container security programs--depending upon how the SFI program is implemented and 100 percent scanning is achieved. Some foreign governments have stated they may adopt a reciprocal requirement that all U.S. origin containers be scanned, which would present additional challenges at domestic U.S. ports."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Concerns about the ability of terrorists to smuggle weapons of mass  destruction (WMD) inside cargo containers bound for the United States  have heightened since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  Oceangoing cargo containers play a vital role in the movement of cargo  between global trading partners. In fiscal year 2008, 611 foreign ports  shipped a total of 9.8 million cargo containers to the United States.  Balancing security concerns with the need to facilitate the free flow of  commerce remains an ongoing challenge for the public and private sectors  alike. While U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has maintained that the  likelihood of terrorists smuggling WMD into the United States in cargo  containers is relatively low, the consequence of such an action could be  devastating. For example, studies have estimated costs of a WMD attack at  a U.S. port to range from $58 billion to as high as $1 trillion.", "In the federal government, CBP is responsible for overseeing oceangoing  container security and reducing the vulnerabilities associated with the  supply chain\u2014the flow of goods from manufacturers to retailers. As CBP  performs this mission, it maintains two overarching and sometimes  conflicting goals\u2014increasing security while efficiently facilitating  legitimate trade and commerce. CBP has developed a layered security  strategy to address container security concerns. Core components of the  layered security strategy include analyzing information to identify  containers that may be at high-risk of transporting WMD, working with  host governments to examine high-risk containers at foreign ports, and  providing benefits to companies that comply with predetermined security  measures. In addition to CBP\u2019s layered programs, the Department of  Energy (DOE) provides radiation detection equipment to foreign  governments to prevent terrorists from smuggling WMD in cargo  containers through foreign seaports. Related to these U.S. container  security programs, CBP has worked through the World Customs  Organization (WCO) to develop and promote implementation of the SAFE  Framework of Standards for supply chain security, which as of June 2009,  157 countries have agreed to implement.", "To further address container security concerns, Congress passed, and the  President signed, the Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port  Act in 2006. The SAFE Port Act requires that pilot projects be established  at three ports to test the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of U.S.-bound  containers at foreign ports. To fulfill this requirement and determine the  overall feasibility and efficacy of 100 percent scanning, in December 2007,  DHS, the Department of State, and DOE jointly announced the formation  of the Secure Freight Initiative (SFI) pilot program. In August 2007, 2  months before the SFI pilot began operations, the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Act) was  enacted, which requires, among other things, that by July 2012, 100  percent of all U.S.-bound cargo containers be scanned before being placed  on a vessel at a foreign port, with possible extensions for ports at which  certain conditions exist. While foreign ports are not required to  participate, the 9/11 Act scanning requirement provides that cargo  containers loaded on a vessel in a foreign port that have not been scanned  are not to be allowed into the United States. This replaced a similar  provision in the SAFE Port Act that called for 100 percent scanning but did  not have a deadline for full implementation of the scanning requirement.  The 9/11 Act did not, however, specify who is to conduct the container  scans or who is to pay for scanning equipment or operations and  maintenance. According to CBP officials, with the passage of the 9/11 Act,  efforts to implement 100 percent scanning at participating ports changed  from a pilot test of the operational feasibility of scanning 100 percent of  U.S.-bound containers to an initial phasing in of the 100 percent scanning  requirement.", "Both DHS and CBP, as well as foreign governments and customs  organizations, have expressed serious concerns regarding the feasibility  and efficacy of the 100 percent scanning requirement. In April 2009, the  Acting Commissioner for CBP testified that much had been done to  enhance the security of cargo containers relative to other modes of  transportation, and added that the area of maritime security should not be  overemphasized to the detriment of other transportation modes. He also  emphasized that the threat of a significant nuclear weapon in a container  remains remote and requested that the scanning requirement be  thoughtfully reconsidered by Congress. In January 2009, the Secretary of  the Department of Homeland Security also stated that any requirement  regarding container scanning from Congress must be achievable and  affordable and noted that the July 2012 deadline for 100 percent container  scanning appeared to be unattainable. In April 2009, the Secretary  determined that CBP would focus deployment of the SFI program to  foreign locations of strategic importance in a way that will maximize  security benefits given its limited resources. In addition to DHS\u2019 concerns  that the requirement to scan all U.S.-bound cargo containers cannot be  met, foreign governments and customs organizations have expressed their  opposition to the requirement. For example, in June 2008, members of the  WCO unanimously endorsed a resolution expressing concern that  implementation of 100 percent scanning would be detrimental to world  trade and could result in unreasonable delays, port congestion, and  international trading difficulties. Similarly, in May 2008, the European  Parliament issued a resolution calling for the United States to repeal the  100 percent scanning requirement.", "In response to your request, we are providing you with information on  CBP\u2019s efforts to implement the SAFE Port and 9/11 Acts.  This report  addresses the following questions:     What progress has CBP made toward implementing 100 percent  scanning at the initial ports participating in the SFI program?", "What planning efforts has CBP made to address the requirement to  scan all U.S.-bound cargo containers by July 2012?", "What are the estimated costs to date of the SFI program, and to what  extent have future implementation costs been estimated?", "What challenges, if any, does CBP face in integrating the 100 percent  scanning requirement with its existing container security programs?", "To address these questions, we compared data on the volume of U.S.- bound cargo containers and the number of containers scanned at SFI ports  to the scanning requirement set forth in the 9/11 Act. After speaking with  CBP officials to resolve inconsistencies with the scanning data, we  determined that the data provided were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We reviewed available CBP documentation on expanding the  SFI program, including the SFI program management plan and  implementation strategy, and assessed it against A Guide to the Project  Management Body of Knowledge. We obtained available data on costs for  operating the SFI program as reported by CBP and DOE, which we  determined to be sufficiently reliable after assessing how CBP and DOE  collect and manage cost data. We assessed CBP\u2019s cost estimates for  further implementation of the SFI program using the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide. We reviewed the need to do a cost- benefit analysis using criteria in DHS\u2019 Cost-Benefit Analysis Guidebook  and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circulars. We reviewed  bilateral and multilateral efforts to enhance container security, such as the  WCO SAFE Framework of Standards. We conducted site visits at six of the  seven foreign ports that have been involved in the SFI program, and spoke  with foreign government, CBP, and terminal operator officials during these  visits. While the results of these site visits and interviews cannot be  generalized across all ports that ship cargo containers to the United States,  by observing operations at six of the seven ports involved with the SFI  program to date\u2014Busan, South Korea; Puerto Cortes, Honduras; Salalah,  Oman; Southampton, United Kingdom; Hong Kong; and Singapore\u2014we  gained an understanding of the factors and challenges associated with  implementing SFI at foreign ports. In addition, we met with CBP, DOE,  and State Department officials who have program responsibilities for SFI  and other programs that are part of the U.S. government\u2019s layered  maritime cargo container security strategy. Further, we met with  representatives from the WCO and European Commission, and officials  from seven foreign governments, five of which contain an SFI pilot port, to  discuss multilateral and bilateral efforts to promote supply chain security.  We also spoke with six members of CBP\u2019s Customs Trade Partnership  against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program. Our interviews with these trade  industry representatives were based on a nonprobability sample, so while  they are not generalizable to the entire maritime trade industry, they  provide insight into the relationship between the SFI and C-TPAT  programs. We met with CBP officials at domestic ports, as well as  domestic port authorities to understand the impact of a reciprocal  scanning requirement. As appropriate, we also relied on our prior body of  work on container security conducted over the last several years (see list  of Related GAO Products at the end of this report).", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2008 through October  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The facilities, vessels, and infrastructure within  ports, and the cargo containers passing through them, all have  vulnerabilities that terrorists could exploit. Containers carrying goods that  are shipped in oceangoing vessels are of particular concern because they  can be filled overseas at many different locations and are transported  through complex logistics networks before reaching U.S. ports. In  addition, transporting a shipping container from its international point of  origin to its final destination involves many different participants and  many points of transfer. The container, or material in it, can be affected  not only by the manufacturer or supplier of the material being shipped, but  also by carriers who are responsible for getting the material to a port, as  well as by personnel who load containers onto the ships. Others who  interact with the cargo or have access to the records of the goods being  shipped include exporters who make arrangements for shipping and  loading, freight consolidators who package disparate cargo into  containers, and forwarders who manage and process the information  about what is being loaded onto the ship.

Every time responsibility for cargo in containers changes hands  along the supply chain there is the potential for a security breach. As a  result, vulnerabilities exist that terrorists could take advantage of by, for  example, placing a WMD into a container for shipment to the United States  or elsewhere. U.S. government officials believe that the likelihood of  terrorists smuggling WMD into the United States in cargo containers is  relatively low.

In 2004,  CBP, along with 11 other member customs administrations of the WCO,  formed the High Level Strategic Group to develop international standards  for customs security practices. The group developed the WCO Framework  of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade (commonly referred to  as the SAFE Framework), the core concepts of which are based on  components in CBP\u2019s CSI and C-TPAT programs. For example, just as in  the CSI program, the SAFE Framework states that members should use a  risk-management system to target and identify cargo that may pose a risk  for terrorism. Similar to C-TPAT, the SAFE Framework incorporates the  concept of the Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) and provides  technical guidance for customs administrations to develop an AEO  program that offers incentives to companies that comply with  predetermined minimum supply chain security standards. According to  data from the WCO, as of July 2009, about 70 countries, including the 27  members states of the European Union, have implemented or have begun  developing AEO programs. In the United States, C-TPAT is the designated  AEO program and businesses participating in the program are Authorized  Economic Operators. In June 2005, the 173-member customs  administrations of the WCO adopted the SAFE Framework. Further, as of  June 2009, 157 WCO members, including the United States, had signed  letters of intent to implement the SAFE Framework (see fig. 2).", "While CBP has developed cooperative relationships with foreign  governments to enhance the security of U.S.-bound cargo containers  before they are placed on a vessel, several factors at foreign ports that  impact the security of cargo are beyond CBP\u2019s control. For example, while  CBP has developed specific standards for the inspection equipment used  to scan cargo containers at domestic ports, CBP has potentially limited  assurance that this inspection equipment is capable of detecting and  identifying potential WMD at foreign ports. Additionally, while CBP can  issue a \u201cdo not load\u201d order so that a specific cargo container would not be  allowed on a U.S.-bound vessel, it has no authority to compel host  governments to participate in security programs or to scan cargo  containers that it has determined may pose some risk. For example, when  CBP determines that cargo in a particular container at a CSI or SFI port  poses some risk, it must request that the host government\u2019s customs  service conduct a physical examination of the container since CBP has no  authority to do so itself. Similarly, unlike domestic ports, CBP cannot  compel private sector entities operating at foreign ports to participate in  security initiatives. For example, at one port, for a period of approximately  2 months, the terminal operator ceased to provide CBP information on  which containers leaving the port were bound for the United States. As a  result, CBP had greater difficulty determining which containers were U.S.- bound and, therefore, should be scanned with imaging equipment. Under  these circumstances, CBP would still have the option of preventing the  cargo containers from being loaded onto U.S. bound vessels, or flagging  the containers for further inspection once they arrive in the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Equipment Used to Conduct Examinations of Cargo Containers", "paragraphs": ["There are generally two types of cargo container examinations\u2014scanning  equipment and physical searches\u2014used as part of the SFI and CSI  programs. There are two basic types of scanning equipment currently used  to examine cargo containers that do not require the container to be  opened: (1) radiation detection equipment, including radiation portal  monitors, and (2) non-intrusive imaging equipment (NII), which may use  X-rays or gamma rays. Radiation detection equipment, such as radiation  portal monitors (RPM) and radiation isotope identification devices (RIID)  detect the presence of radioactive material that may be in a container.  RIIDs and certain types of RPMs can identify the type of material emitting  the radiation and whether the material poses a threat or is a naturally  occurring radioactive material, such as that found in certain ceramic tiles.  We observed at domestic and foreign ports that if radioactive emissions  were detected from a cargo container, customs officials used a handheld  RIID to determine whether the radiation being emitted posed a threat. The  second type of equipment, referred to as NII, uses X-rays or gamma rays to  scan a container and create images of the container\u2019s contents without  opening it. Examples of a RPM, handheld RIID, and NII are depicted in  figure 3.", "CBP officials, along with host government officials, review the images  produced with the NII to detect anomalies or shielding that could indicate  the presence of WMD.

For example, challenges associated with the perceived safety of  the NII scanning equipment, scanning cargo containers arriving at a port  by rail, or scanning transshipment cargo containers, among other things,  have prevented CBP from achieving 100 percent scanning at participating  ports. Specifically:    Safety Concerns: Port officials at five of the seven ports that initially  agreed to participate in the SFI program expressed concerns regarding  the safety of drivers and port operators who work near NII scanning  equipment, which generates radiation in order to generate an image of  a container\u2019s contents. CBP provided information or conducted town  hall meetings on the safety of the equipment to officials and workers at  participating ports. However, to address these concerns and allow for  the equipment to be used, port officials required that passage through  the NII equipment at the ports of Hong Kong and Busan be voluntary,  thus limiting efforts to test the feasibility of using the NII equipment, as  well as the SFI program\u2019s overall effectiveness.", "Logistics: Logistics issues and costs associated with moving cargo  containers to scanning areas at the Port of Southampton resulted in  the cessation of scans of cargo containers arriving by rail. Initially,  CBP and the terminal operator agreed that the terminal operator  would absorb the costs to place cargo containers arriving by rail onto  trucks so that those containers could pass through SFI scanning  systems, at a cost of approximately $60 per container, but this  arrangement ended in April 2008.", "Transshipment: Transshipment cargo containers\u2014those taken off of  one vessel to be placed on a U.S.-bound vessel\u2014present significant  challenges to scanning because of logistical difficulties associated with  transporting these containers. Transshipment cargo containers are  only available for scanning for a comparatively short period of time  and may be difficult to access. For example, UK customs officials  stated that it was not possible to route transshipment containers that  arrived by sea through the SFI equipment. As a consequence, the  scanning of transshipment containers was delayed at the Port of  Southampton, United Kingdom. Further, in April 2009, the Acting  Commissioner of CBP testified that there is no proven technology that  can scan these containers.", "Equipment Breakdowns: Scanning and communication equipment  breakdowns have occurred at several ports. For example, two of the  three seaports fully participating in the SFI pilot program experienced  weather-related mechanical breakdowns of scanning equipment.  Specifically, at the Port of Southampton, a piece of radiation scanning  equipment failed because of rainy conditions and had to be replaced,  resulting in 2 weeks of diminished scanning capabilities. Additionally,  Port Qasim in Pakistan has experienced difficulties with scanning  equipment because of the extreme heat. Because of the range of  climates at the more than 600 foreign ports that ship cargo to the  United States, these types of technological challenges could be  experienced elsewhere.", "Additionally, while cargo containers may be scanned at SFI ports, the  images obtained through these scans may not always be sufficiently clear  to determine the potential presence of WMD. For example, we observed  that some trucks carrying cargo containers at the Port of Hong Kong  passed through imaging equipment too quickly to obtain a clear enough  image to verify the contents of the container. This problem is not isolated  to scans that were taken at the Port of Hong Kong, as CBP officials at the  Port of Long Beach also showed us images taken at other SFI ports that  were not clear enough to read because the driver drove through the NII  equipment too quickly. The CBP officials also showed us an image in  which one-third of the container was not captured.

Terminal operators  have also incurred costs for implementing the SFI program. For example,  one terminal operator at the Port of Hong Kong set up a control room and  an information technology infrastructure to support the SFI program at a  cost of approximately $260,000.

According to an official from the group, if  foreign governments do not want to conduct scans of U.S.-bound  containers, terminal operators would purchase, operate, and maintain the  SFI equipment for scanning cargo containers entering the port on trucks.  Transshipment cargo containers would not be included in the program,  however, since no technical solution currently exists for scanning these  containers. The terminal operators would also be responsible for  adjudicating scanning equipment alarms with local government officials.  Terminal operators would recoup their costs for purchasing, operating,  and maintaining the equipment by charging a fee to users of the terminals.  An official from the consortium stated that at ports where the volume of  cargo containers is such that fees would not cover the cost of purchasing,  operating, and maintaining the scanning equipment, the U.S. government  would be responsible for covering the cost of SFI program operations.

CBP acknowledged that this $20 billion estimate of program  implementation costs was rough and based on the costs of implementing  SFI thus far. CBP officials also developed rough implementation cost  estimates for potential deployment options for SFI consistent with its  secure trade corridor strategy. These estimates range from $500 million  (with most SFI costs paid by the trade community or foreign governments)  to $1.6 billion (with SFI costs at 70 ports paid by DHS). However, the  officials acknowledged that none of these estimates were developed in a  manner consistent with the DHS cost estimation guidelines. CBP officials  stated that they have not developed a more comprehensive cost estimate  because DHS has not specified a clear path forward for the program. CBP  officials added, though, that it is difficult to estimate the cost for  implementing SFI at a single port without conducting a thorough  assessment of the port and obtaining the input of local government  officials. Given the agency\u2019s limited resources they stated that they cannot  conduct these types of detailed assessments at all ports that ship cargo  containers to the United States. These officials added that any estimates of  costs for full implementation would be of limited use given the complexity  and variability of operations at individual ports. Additionally, officials from  Industrial Economics, Inc. concurred that cost estimating would be  difficult because of the different factors beyond CBP\u2019s control that would  need to be considered, including whether the port was publicly or  privately held, whether port operations are centralized or spread out over  a large geographic area, the willingness of the host government to  accommodate the scanning program, and whether and to what extent the  port had communications and information technology infrastructure  available.", "While U.S. program cost of implementing the SFI program at individual  ports will likely vary based on factors beyond CBP\u2019s control,  commonalities exist among ports that allow for assumptions to be made  regarding costs for program implementation. Examples of such  commonalities include the need for inspection equipment at foreign ports  participating in the program\u2014which has generally been paid for by the  U.S. government\u2014and the need for personnel to review images produced  by imaging equipment. DHS\u2019s guidance on cost estimation states that  program managers need to keep analysis of costs moving forward, even in  periods of ambiguous, partial, or even missing information, and that this is  best managed by making assumptions to resolve uncertainty and allow  analysis to continue. Further, as we have previously reported, having a  realistic cost estimate makes for effective resource allocation and  increases the probability of a program\u2019s success. Additionally, a cost  estimate can serve as a basis for establishing and defending budgets and  driving affordability analyses. A cost estimate also helps agencies  determine whether a program is feasible and the resources needed to  support it. While we recognize that CBP may have difficulty developing  cost estimates because of the uncertainties and assumptions that will have  to be made, having a more comprehensive cost estimate could provide  CBP with valid cost information to share with Congress to allow it to make  sound and prudent decisions regarding SFI program implementation, and  could better position CBP and Congress to evaluate alternatives for SFI  program configuration and implementation.", "In addition to not identifying estimates of U.S. program costs, CBP has not  developed estimates of economic costs to other stakeholders such as costs  that would result from lowering terminal efficiency. For example,  Industrial Economics, Inc. concluded that 100 percent scanning will likely  reduce port and terminal efficiency as well as increase costs. Officials  from Industrial Economics, Inc. stated that these increased costs would be  due to costs to accommodate scanning\u2014additional land, labor, and  equipment\u2014as well as to delays caused by 100 percent scanning. These  officials also stated that while the precise degree to which costs may  increase is uncertain, some costs could be substantial, particularly for  larger volume ports or ports with significant amounts of transshipment  cargo containers as operations at these ports would need to be more  significantly altered to accommodate 100 percent scanning. Further,  officials from the World Bank and the WCO with whom we spoke stated  that implementing 100 percent scanning would likely create additional  shipping costs in certain parts of the world because of changes in trade  routes that would be necessary. In particular, the officials stated that U.S.- bound cargo containers may have to be funneled through hub ports that  could accommodate and operate the scanning equipment before the  containers are then shipped to the United States. They noted that these  additional logistics costs would have a disproportionately negative  economic impact on developing economies and countries with  comparatively small ports.", "Furthermore, CBP has not performed a cost-benefit analysis to assess  alternatives to achieving 100 percent scanning, such as its proposed  strategic trade corridor strategy and, as appropriate, other alternatives for  enhancing container security. According to CBP officials, they have not  performed this type of analysis because it is not legally required since the  100 percent scanning requirement was mandated and not initiated by CBP.  Although we recognize the 100 percent scanning requirement was  mandated by law, development of a systematic cost-benefit analysis,  which incorporates more comprehensive cost estimates, could better  inform CBP and Congress of the relative costs and benefits of different  alternatives for achieving 100 percent scanning of U.S.-bound goods from  all ports that ship directly to the United States as well as alternatives for a  path forward to enhance container security. This type of analysis could, in  turn, help DHS and Congress identify whether and to what extent other  viable options exist to implementing the 100 percent scanning  requirement.", "The Office of Management and Budget states that any cost-benefit analysis  that serves as a basis for evaluating government programs or policies  should identify and measure overall societal costs and benefits, not solely  costs and benefits to the federal government. For example, as discussed  later in this report, the implementation of the 100 percent scanning  requirement could potentially create challenges to the continued operation  of CBP\u2019s existing layered security programs and hinder their  implementation by reducing the willingness of foreign countries and  industry to participate. If participation is diminished, this could constitute  a cost (e.g., reduced implementation and effectiveness of other programs),  which would be one element to consider in any cost-benefit analysis. As  noted earlier, other costs beyond the federal government are those  incurred by foreign governments, the shipping industry, and consumers.", "Further, OMB cites as a key element of cost-benefit analysis the  consideration of alternative means of achieving program objectives by  examining different program methods of provision and different degrees  of government involvement. Additionally, DHS\u2019s Cost-Benefit Analysis  Guidebook states that cost-benefit analysis is designed to identify the  superior financial solution amongst competing alternatives, and that it is a  proven management tool to support planning and managing costs and  risks. By utilizing cost-benefit analysis to compare the current  implementation requirements of SFI with other alternatives, which might  include its proposed strategic trade corridor strategy or CBP\u2019s existing  layered strategy, CBP could more fully ensure that it is efficiently  allocating and prioritizing its limited resources, as well as those of  individual ports, in a way that maximizes the effectiveness of its cargo  container security efforts.

At CSI ports, when it is determined through  advanced information that a U.S.-bound container poses some potential  risk of WMD, CBP typically requests that the host government scan the  container with radiation detection and NII equipment. If these scans  indicate the potential presence of WMD, CBP requests that the host  government conduct physical examination of the container, which could  involve physically removing the container\u2019s contents for inspection. If the  host government declines a request to give the container additional  scrutiny, CBP can issue a \u201cdo not load\u201d order for the container\u2014so it is  refused entry onto the vessel\u2014or flag the container for further inspection  upon arrival at a domestic port. In contrast, under the 100 percent  scanning concept required by the 9/11 Act, all U.S.-bound containers are  required to be scanned with radiation detection and NII equipment before  any analysis of risk. At the three operational SFI pilot ports we visited, we  observed CBP officers reviewing scanning equipment outputs without the  use of ATS targeting information.

CSI allows for a reciprocal  arrangement in which foreign governments may also place staff at U.S.  ports. According to CBP, the strength of the CSI program is the  information gained from host government officials that CBP would  otherwise not have access to. We have also previously reported instances  where the CSI program establishes trust and collegiality, leading to  increased information sharing, as well as more effective targeting and  examination of high-risk cargo containers. For example, CBP officers  noted instances in which host government customs officials would notify  them of cargo containers they thought could be high risk so that CBP  could take a closer look at the information available in ATS related to the  containers. However, our work at three of the four operational pilot ports  indicates that implementing the SFI program at foreign ports could result  in reduced collaboration between CBP and host government customs  officials or the end of the CSI program. For example, at the Port of  Southampton, United Kingdom, customs officials previously worked side  by side to share information with CBP officers as part of the CSI program  and during the initial transition from CSI to SFI. However, United Kingdom  customs officials no longer participate in SFI, as they withdrew their  support for the program after the first 6 months of operation, which was  the agreed-upon time frame for their participation. CBP officials stationed  at the Port of Southampton stated that it has been more difficult to have  containers they determine may pose some risk physically inspected by  their British counterparts because of this reduced interaction caused by  the transition from CSI to SFI. This reduced interaction and challenges in  having U.S.-bound containers physically inspected may be because the  port\u2019s participation in the program was viewed by the British government  as a pilot and would not necessarily occur when implementing SFI or  another form of 100 percent scanning on a more permanent basis. If the  SFI program is implemented in such a way that CBP officials are stationed  overseas, and if host nation officials work with them to jointly research  shipping data on containers, then this type of information sharing could  continue under the 100 percent scanning requirement. However, foreign  government officials from Singapore and South Korea we spoke with said  that given the many security programs the United States has adopted, the  United States should choose whether it wants to continue CSI or  implement SFI, but that it cannot do both."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "C-TPAT and AEO Programs", "paragraphs": ["The willingness of private companies to voluntarily enhance their security  practices to join C-TPAT may be diminished if a key benefit of  membership is reduced by 100 percent scanning. Through the C-TPAT  program, members of the trade community (e.g., importers, vessel  carriers, and others) voluntarily enter into an agreement with CBP to  improve their security programs in return for various trade-related  benefits, such as reduced scrutiny of their cargo containers upon arrival in  the United States.  As part of this voluntary agreement, C-TPAT  participants share sensitive, corporate security plans with CBP and  provide CBP with access to their facilities. This level of information  sharing would otherwise not be available to CBP for companies that are  not C-TPAT members.", "According to a survey conducted in 2007 by the University of Virginia, the  most important motivation for businesses joining C-TPAT was reducing  the time and cost of getting cargo released by CBP.  However, this benefit  could be diminished by the 100 percent scanning requirement since, under  such a requirement all cargo is to be scanned regardless of membership in  C-TPAT. While the six C-TPAT members we interviewed generally  expressed their intent to remain in the program, three stated that there  would be less incentive to maintain membership, or for other companies  to join C-TPAT if the 100 percent scanning requirement is fully  implemented. If companies drop out of or do not join C-TPAT, it could be  difficult for CBP to determine what, if any, security initiatives have been  undertaken by the companies, unless other programs or methods were  developed to do so. CBP officials have stated that they do not believe 100  percent scanning will affect membership in the C-TPAT program, and that  the C-TPAT program has some benefits that will continue to exist  regardless of container scanning. For example, they note that C-TPAT  members that transfer cargo by truck to the United States from Canada or  Mexico will not be affected by the requirement. However, given that other  companies who use maritime shipping may lose an incentive for joining    C-TPAT or maintaining membership, the potential security benefit  associated with the program could be diminished to the extent that              C-TPAT membership does not grow or decreases.", "AEO programs\u2014programs similar to C-TPAT run by other countries\u2014may  be hindered by 100 percent scanning because it may be viewed as a  deterrent to private companies to join AEO programs. A core concept of  the SAFE Framework is a system of mutual recognition, whereby two  nations\u2019 AEO programs are mutually recognized by the respective customs  administrations. Mutual recognition of AEO programs occurs when  customs administrations agree to recognize one another\u2019s AEO programs  and security features and to provide comparable benefits to members of  the respective programs. As of June 2009, CBP had signed mutual  recognition arrangements with New Zealand, Canada, Jordan, and Japan.  Furthermore, the United States is discussing entering into a nonbinding  arrangement with the European Union. According to data from the WCO,  as of July 2009, about 70 countries had implemented or had begun  developing their own national AEO programs. Foreign government, World  Bank, and WCO officials we interviewed expressed concern that  implementation of SFI or other efforts to achieve 100 percent scanning  may hinder mutual recognition efforts because, under such a program, if  all U.S.-bound cargo is to be scanned, there is little incentive for  companies to join such partnerships, or governments to develop these  partnership programs, without one of the common benefits\u2014reduced  scrutiny of cargo containers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The 100 Percent Scanning Requirement Is a Departure from Multilateral Partnerships, Raising Concerns with Key Trading Partners and Leading to Calls for Reciprocal Scanning Requirements", "paragraphs": ["CBP has traditionally worked with its international partners to enhance  the security of the supply chain. The International Outreach and  Coordination Strategy, one of eight supporting plans for The National  Strategy for Maritime Security, establishes the goal of developing a  coordinated policy for U.S. government maritime security activities with  foreign governments, international and regional organizations, and the  private sector. According to the strategy, the United States must forge  cooperative partnerships and alliances with other nations, as well as with  public and private stakeholders in the international community, to achieve  effective maritime security. As CBP has recognized in security matters, the  United States is not self-contained, either in its problems or in its  solutions. The growing interdependence of countries requires policy  makers to recognize the need to work in partnerships across international  boundaries to achieve vital national goals. As such, CBP has taken a lead  role in working with the WCO and foreign customs administrations to  establish and implement international customs security standards that  benefit all participants. For example, CBP was a principal author of the  multilateral SAFE Framework of Standards\u2014based on CBP\u2019s existing  layered security strategy\u2014unanimously adopted by the members of the  WCO, and CBP officials have stated that its existing layered strategy  constitutes U.S. efforts to implement the elements of the SAFE  Framework.", "However, the 100 percent scanning requirement is a departure from these  existing efforts to enhance cargo container security through partnerships.  Existing CBP efforts to enhance cargo container security, such as  collaboration with the WCO to develop the SAFE Framework, have been  based on a bilateral and multilateral approach meant to enhance security  for all participants. Foreign government and international organization  officials with whom we met have also expressed concern that the 100  percent scanning requirement is inconsistent with multilaterally adopted  customs security standards, may negatively impact trade, and could  diminish container security. For example, customs and other officials from  foreign governments, including the European Union, South Korea, Hong  Kong, and Singapore, as well as international organizations, including the  WCO, have expressed their belief that scanning 100 percent of U.S-bound  containers is inconsistent with the risk-based strategy agreed to in the  SAFE Framework because it treats all containers as having the same risk  level before any analysis of the risks they may pose is performed. Foreign  government and international organization officials we spoke with added  that, given limited resources, 100 percent scanning could provide a lower  level of security, as the focused attention on specific high-risk shipments is  replaced by a blanket approach applying to all containers.", "Because the100 percent scanning requirement was initiated solely by the  United States, government officials in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East  with whom we met have stated that the requirement is perceived as being  for the sole security benefit of the United States. The European Union has  formally stated that the 100 percent scanning requirement was imposed  unilaterally and implies extraterritoriality. In June 2008, WCO members  unanimously endorsed a resolution expressing concern that  implementation of 100 percent scanning would be detrimental to world  trade and could result in unreasonable delays, port congestion, and  international trading difficulties. Similarly, in May 2008, the European  Parliament issued a resolution calling for the United States to repeal the  100 percent scanning requirement. Further, in June 2009, the governments  of five developing countries submitted a position paper to the WCO  opposing 100 percent scanning due to the disproportionate impact it will  have on their developing economies.", "According to State Department officials with whom we met, the 100  percent scanning requirement has negatively impacted interactions with  other countries on various issues. State Department officials overseas  have acknowledged that the 100 percent scanning requirement has already  impacted or could have impact on future U.S. interests. For example,  according to these officials, they have experienced difficulty making  progress on U.S. concerns related to agricultural exports and registration  of chemical products because they cannot discuss these issues without  foreign governments raising their concerns with 100 percent scanning.", "Related to these international concerns, some foreign government officials  with whom we spoke are considering requiring a reciprocal scanning  requirement for cargo coming from the United States. Specifically,  government officials in Honduras and the European Commission\u2014which  represents the 27 member states of the European Union\u2014have indicated  that they may consider a reciprocal container scanning requirement in  which containers from the United States that are being shipped to these  countries would have to be scanned. Although the European Commission  indicated it does not think scanning will enhance security, it added it  would be difficult not to ask for reciprocity if their member states are  initiating cargo scanning programs for the security benefit of the United  States.", "According to CBP and domestic port terminal officials, and our  observations at the domestic ports we visited, scanning outbound  containers to meet a reciprocity requirement would be challenging and  require additional resources. CBP officials noted that the difficulty  negotiating and obtaining space from terminal operators to install  scanning equipment for inbound containers would also apply to installing  equipment needed to scan outbound containers should reciprocity be  required. CBP officials also noted additional staff would be needed to  review container images and adjudicate identified anomalies. Further, it  would be difficult to identify the destination of outbound cargo containers,  according to CBP and port officials. Therefore, even if a few countries  asked that goods bound from their countries be examined, it might be  necessary for CBP to examine all outbound goods. CBP officials stated  scanning outbound containers could come at the expense of their ability to  secure the United States from inbound containers that might contain  WMD.", "Given the situation, foreign governments and the trade industry are  awaiting information on how CBP plans to implement 100 percent  scanning. Although the scanning requirement is a U.S. law, officials from  the European Commission stated that they are aware that DHS and CBP  have stated that implementing the law by July 2012 is likely not feasible,  which has created a sense of uncertainty regarding future implementation  of the scanning requirement. DHS acknowledged this concern, noting that  without a clear path forward for SFI, partnerships with foreign  governments would be put at risk. Although the Secretary of DHS  consequently endorsed the strategic trade corridor strategy as the path  forward, the department has not specified whether implementation of 100  percent scanning at strategic corridors would constitute the entirety of  CBP\u2019s efforts to implement 100 percent scanning or was an initial phase of  a broader effort to implement 100 percent scanning.", "Foreign terminal operators have also expressed concerns regarding the  lack of a clear path forward for the SFI program. During our discussion  with the Federation of European Private Port Operators, the terminal  operator representatives noted the July 2012 deadline was quickly  approaching, but there was a lack of information as to how the  requirement would be achieved. The terminal operator representatives  added that decisions needed to be made regarding who is required to pay  for and operate the scanning equipment, among other things. The officials  noted that they did not want to purchase scanning equipment without  standards being established because they did not want to bear this  expense and later learn that the scanning equipment they purchased is not  considered sufficient."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Challenges in scanning U.S.-bound cargo containers at participating ports  to date, as well as challenges in getting additional ports to participate,  have raised questions about the feasibility of scanning 100 percent of U.S.- bound cargo containers.

Such an analysis could  assist both the agency and Congress by providing important information  regarding CBP\u2019s ability to fully implement the 100 percent scanning  requirement and determining a path forward to enhance container  security.", "As CBP attempts to expand the SFI program, it will need more  comprehensive cost estimates. Such cost estimates could provide CBP  with valid cost information to share with Congress to allow it to make  sound and prudent decisions regarding SFI program implementation. CBP  and Congress could also benefit from a cost-benefit analysis (that includes  costs to international maritime stakeholders) to evaluate the relative costs  and benefits of various alternatives for implementing the 100 percent  scanning requirement, to include its strategic trade corridor strategy.

DOE provided comments  on October 19, 2009, that cite the need to distinguish between challenges  regarding the use of radiation versus nonintrusive image scanning  equipment. We have modified the report to include this distinction. DOE  made no comments on the recommendations since they were directed  towards DHS and CBP. A copy of DOE\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix II. DHS and CBP provided technical comments that have been  incorporated into the report, where appropriate.", "DHS also provided written comments\u2014that incorporated comments from  CBP\u2014on October 19, 2009. A copy of DHS\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix III. In commenting on a draft of this report, DHS noted that it  concurred with three recommendations and concurred in part with one. It  also commented that CBP views these recommendations as having been  largely achieved through its publication of previous reports to Congress.  We disagree with this for the reasons discussed in the paragraphs below.", "Regarding our first recommendation to conduct a feasibility analysis for  implementing the 100 percent scanning requirement for all U.S.-bound  cargo containers, DHS noted that CBP concurred with our  recommendation. The agency further stated that the recommendation had  been achieved in its June 2008 report to Congress, \u201cReport to Congress on  Integrated Scanning Systems Pilot (Security and Accountability for  Every Port Act of 2006), Section 231,\u201d where it discussed challenges to  implementing the requirement at participating seaports. Specifically, CBP  noted that its report concluded that the 100 percent scanning of U.S.- bound maritime container is possible on a limited scale in locations with  an array of accommodating and supportive conditions, such as host nation  cooperation, low cargo volumes, low transshipment rates and technology  and infrastructure costs covered primarily by the U.S. government. It also  noted that its report determined that these conditions would not likely  exist at all ports shipping to the United States. During our review, we  analyzed the June 2008 report and while it discusses these and other  challenges that exist at participating ports, we do not believe that it  constitutes a feasibility analysis of the 100 percent scanning requirement,  as required by the SAFE Port Act. In particular, as we have noted in this  report, the SAFE Port Act requires certain specific elements to be included  when evaluating the feasibility of expanding 100 percent scanning to other  ports, including an analysis of the infrastructure requirements to  implement 100 percent scanning and an analysis of requirements,  including costs, to install and maintain an integrated scanning system at  ports participating in the Container Security Initiative.  These analyses  were not included in the 2008 report and CBP has acknowledged that they  have not been conducted.", "Regarding our second recommendation to develop more comprehensive  cost estimates for achieving the requirement to scan 100 percent of U.S.- bound cargo containers, consistent with best practices, DHS commented  that CBP concurred with the recommendation and had already achieved it  through issuance of its June 2008 report to Congress. In particular, CBP  stated that it believes that it is incumbent upon the agency to develop  realistic cost estimates for the overall operational elements associated  with implementing legislative mandates, such as the 100 percent scanning  requirement. However, as acknowledged by CBP, the cost estimates  generated by CBP to date were not developed in a manner that is  consistent with cost estimation guidelines. For example, estimates  developed by CBP to date cover implementation of the program as it  currently exists, but do not examine costs over the life of the program,  which is a best practice identified by GAO and accepted by DHS. As a  result, total costs for the life of the SFI program could be significantly  greater than CBP\u2019s current cost estimates.  As we have noted in this  report, having more comprehensive cost estimates could provide CBP  with valid cost information to share with Congress to allow it to make  sound and prudent decisions regarding SFI program design and  implementation.", "Regarding our third recommendation to conduct a cost-benefit analysis (to  include all significant economic costs) of different alternatives for  achieving the 100 percent scanning requirement, to include as appropriate,  other alternatives short of achieving 100 percent scanning, DHS  commented that CBP concurred in part with our recommendation. In its  response CBP acknowledged that a cost-benefit analysis would be helpful  to frame the discussion and better inform Congress; however, it noted that  such a comprehensive study would place significant burdens on its limited  resources. Given the potential costs to the United States, foreign  governments and trade industry of implementing 100 percent scanning, we  believe a cost-benefit analysis is warranted to evaluate other alternatives.  CBP added that neither the SAFE Port Act nor the 9/11 Act require CBP to  conduct such an analysis and suggests that the Congressional Budget  Office is the most appropriate entity to conduct such an analysis. While  CBO does prepare cost estimates for pending legislation, as we mention in  this report, CBO has evaluated the 9/11 Act and assumed that foreign  governments would pay for implementing scanning systems at their port,  which has generally not been the case thus far. We believe that, given its  daily interaction with foreign customs services and its direct knowledge of  port operations, CBP is in a better position to conduct any cost-benefit  analysis and bring results to Congress for consideration. Further, as noted  in this report, DHS cites cost-benefit analysis as a proven management tool  to support planning and manage costs.  We believe that the challenges  faced in implementing the program thus far, and the potential costs of  implementing and operating the 100 percent scanning requirement\u2014 particularly non-financial costs such as reductions in the effectiveness of  existing container security programs like CSI and C-TPAT\u2014emphasize the  importance of such an analysis. This analysis could assist both the agency  and Congress in understanding CBP\u2019s ability to implement the 100 percent  scanning requirement as well provide Congress more complete  understanding of the scanning requirement\u2019s advantages and  disadvantages. Congress could then use this information in its role  providing oversight over the program or in considering alternatives for  enhancing cargo container security in a cost-efficient manner.", "Finally, regarding our fourth recommendation to provide results of the  feasibility analysis, U.S. program costs estimates, and cost-benefit analysis  to Congress, along with various cost-effective alternatives to implementing  the 100 percent scanning requirement, DHS commented that CBP  concurred with our recommendation, had already achieved it, and outlined  its intent to continue to explore the full range of costs associated with  scanning efforts at foreign ports. Specifically, CBP stated that in June  2008, it submitted to Congress the findings of the feasibility study required  under Section 231 of the SAFE Port Act. It added that this report and the  number of subsequent reports provided at 6-month intervals detailed CBP  and DOE expenditures under SFI, including the cost of scanning  equipment, as well as personnel expenditures for each potential scanning  site. While these reports have contained useful information, as mentioned  previously, our view is that they do not contain comprehensive analyses of  the feasibility or costs of the 100 percent scanning requirement or evaluate  potential program alternatives to determine which may be most feasible  and cost effective. We believe that feasibility and cost-benefit analyses are  critical to help ensure that DHS and CBP have the necessary information  to assist the Congress as it considers options for implementing the 100  percent scanning requirement or other alternatives to enhancing cargo  container security.  This information should include more definitive  information on the feasibility of the scanning requirement\u2014to include the  factors discussed in the SAFE Port Act such as infrastructure  requirements, impact on processing times, ability to meet forecasted  container volume, costs, and personnel needs\u2014across different alternative  implementation scenarios.", "As arranged by your offices we plan no further distribution until 30 days  after the date of this report.

While the results of these  site visits and interviews cannot be generalized across all ports that ship  cargo containers to the United States, by observing operations at six of the  seven ports involved with the SFI program to date\u2014Busan, South Korea;  Puerto Cortes, Honduras; Salalah, Oman; Southampton, United Kingdom;  Hong Kong; and Singapore\u2014we gained a critical understanding of the  factors and challenges associated with implementing SFI at these ports.  Due to ongoing security concerns, we did not conduct a site visit at Port  Qasim, Pakistan. Instead, we observed CBP\u2019s remote operation of the SFI  program in Qasim from the National Targeting Center-Cargo in Virginia. To  assess CBP\u2019s progress implementing SFI at individual ports, we compared  data on the number of containers scanned to the total volume of U.S.- bound containers at each SFI port, to the requirement set forth in the 9/11  Act. CBP was unable to provide container scan data based on container  arrival mode (e.g., truck, rail, and transshipment) due to system  limitations.

We compared CBP\u2019s planning efforts to best practices in A Guide to the  Project Management Body of Knowledge.", "To examine the estimated costs of implementing 100 percent scanning of  U.S.-bound cargo containers at foreign ports, we interviewed CBP and  Department of Energy (DOE) officials, international organization  personnel, foreign government officials, and terminal operators to obtain  their views as to the types of costs associated with implementing 100  percent scanning. To determine the costs to the U.S. government of  implementing, operating, and maintaining the SFI program, we reviewed  documentation on CBP\u2019s and DOE\u2019s expenditures to date. After reviewing  possible limitations of the cost data provided, we determined that the data  provided were sufficiently reliable for the purposes for which we have  used them in this report. We compared CBP\u2019s methods for developing cost  estimates to further implement 100 percent scanning with the best  practices outlined in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide.

To understand  the costs to entities other than the U.S. government, we spoke with  terminal operators and officials from foreign governments participating in  the SFI program. We also interviewed the World Customs Organization  (WCO) and the World Bank to further understand other costs that may  result from 100 percent scanning, such as changes in trade flow and  impacts on developing economies. We reviewed economic studies  conducted on the issue, including those conducted by the University of Le  Havre and Industrial Economics, Inc.

We observed how domestic CBP officers access and  review SFI scan data. To determine the impact of scanning on the  Container Security Initiative (CSI), we interviewed foreign government  officials at ports participating in both CSI and SFI on how the programs  operate simultaneously, and the resulting impact on collaboration between  U.S. and host government customs officials. We interviewed CBP\u2019s  Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) office and six  members of C-TPAT to determine what impact 100 percent scanning may  have on the benefits of membership and how this will affect participation  in C-TPAT. Our interviews with these trade industry representatives were  based on a nonprobability sample, so while their views are not  generalizable to the entire maritime trade industry, they provide  knowledgeable insight into the relationship between the SFI and C-TPAT  programs. We spoke with DOE officials responsible for implementing the  Megaports Initiative to understand the impact of 100 percent scanning on  efforts to expand the Megaports Initiative. We interviewed representatives  of the WCO, International Maritime Organization, International Chamber  of Shipping, European Commission, and foreign government officials to  obtain their views on the consistency of 100 percent scanning with  multilateral and bilateral efforts to promote supply chain security. With  these entities, we discussed how scanning may affect core principles of  the SAFE Framework, including the establishment of customs-to-business  partnerships and mutual recognition between countries of these  partnerships. While we obtained the perspective of all foreign  governments participating in the SFI program that intend to implement the  SAFE Framework, with the exception of Pakistan, these views are not  necessarily representative of all foreign governments intending to  implement the SAFE Framework. We interviewed State Department  officials in Washington D.C.; at the U.S. Mission to the European Union;  and the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, to discuss how the 100 percent  requirement affects the ability of the State Department to defend U.S.  interests. With foreign government officials and representatives of the  European Commission we discussed their intensions to require a  reciprocal 100 percent container scanning requirement of the United  States.
