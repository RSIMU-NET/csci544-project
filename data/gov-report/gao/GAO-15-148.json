One of the most complex  and vital tasks facing DOD is managing its supply chain to effectively and  efficiently provide spare parts, food, fuel, and other critical supplies in  support of U.S. military forces. Supply chain management encompasses  the processes and systems for accomplishing this goal. Because of long- standing weaknesses in DOD\u2019s supply chain management, we have  designated it as a high-risk area. We have found that limitations in asset  visibility\u2014including the visibility of assets in transit\u2014make it difficult to  obtain timely and accurate information about the assets that are present  in the theater of operations. DOD defines asset visibility as the ability to  provide timely and accurate information on the location, quantity,  condition, movement, and status of items in its inventory\u2014including  assets in transit. To achieve a seamless and effective supply chain, it is  important for DOD to have end-to-end visibility of its assets\uf8e7from  acquisition to disposal and all points in between. Further, it is critical to  maintain visibility of these assets in order to ensure that DOD meets its  stated goals and provides needed support to the warfighter.", "In our February 2013 high-risk update, we found that DOD had made  moderate progress in addressing weaknesses in its supply chain  management, but that several long-standing problems had not yet been  resolved. We found that DOD had met two of our five criteria for removal  from the High-Risk List in the supply chain management area.  Specifically, we found that DOD demonstrated top leadership support for  improving supply chain management, and the department had the  capacity (i.e., people and resources) to resolve risks in this area.  However, DOD had not yet fully met the remaining three criteria, which  include developing a corrective action plan for materiel distribution and  asset visibility, monitoring and independently validating the effectiveness  and sustainability of corrective measures, and demonstrating sustained  progress in implementing corrective measures. We also found that  although DOD had not established integrated, comprehensive  approaches for overseeing and addressing problems across the  department and implementing associated initiatives, it had begun  developing a strategy to coordinate efforts to improve asset visibility,  including in-transit visibility. We identified several actions that DOD  should take to improve asset visibility, including completing and  implementing its strategy for coordinating efforts to improve asset visibility  across the department. DOD concurred with our findings and  recommendations and issued a Strategy for Improving DOD Asset  Visibility (the Strategy) in January 2014, as discussed later in this report.", "We performed our work and prepared this report under the authority of  the Comptroller General to assist Congress with its oversight  responsibilities. This report discusses the extent to which DOD has (1) a  comprehensive strategy and implementation plans for improving asset  visibility, including in-transit visibility; and (2) made improvements in asset  visibility that meet our criteria for removal from the High-Risk List.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has a comprehensive strategy and  implementation plans for improving asset visibility, including in-transit  visibility, we reviewed DOD\u2019s Strategy\u2014which incorporates  implementation plans that DOD calls \u201csupporting execution plans\u201d  (SEP)\u2014and assessed whether they fully included, partially included, or  did not include the elements of a comprehensive strategic plan.

When a  plan did not explicitly cite any of the parts of an element, we determined  that the element was \u201cnot included\u201d in the Strategy. Additionally, we  discussed with officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Supply Chain Integration, Joint Staff, Defense Logistics  Agency (DLA), U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), and each  of the military services their roles in the development of the Strategy and  our preliminary analysis of the Strategy.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD has made improvements in meeting  the high-risk criteria for the asset visibility area, we reviewed DOD\u2019s  Strategy and the SEPs, and discussed with the components the initiatives  they had implemented or were implementing to improve asset visibility.  We also reviewed updates to those initiatives that the components had  provided to the Asset Visibility Working Group. We assessed these  actions against GAO\u2019s criteria for assessing agencies\u2019 actions and  determining whether performance and accountability challenges merit our  high-risk designation. Additionally, we reviewed our prior high-risk  reports to obtain information on the progress agencies have made to  address issues identified on our High-Risk List. Further, we evaluated  DOD\u2019s actions to improve asset visibility against each of our five high-risk  criteria for removal from the high-risk list (referred to as the \u201chigh-risk  criteria\u201d).

We initially  focused this high-risk area on inventory management including  requirements (or demand) forecasting. We subsequently determined, on  the basis of work we conducted related to U.S. operations in Iraq and  later Afghanistan, that weaknesses extended to other aspects of the  supply chain supporting the warfighter, including asset visibility and  materiel distribution. Additionally, based in part on our input and input  from the Office of Management and Budget in 2005, DOD identified  requirements forecasting, asset visibility, and materiel distribution as its  focus areas for improving supply chain management. Since that time,  DOD has made moderate progress in addressing weaknesses in its  supply chain management. For example, in our February 2013 High Risk  report we found that DOD had begun developing a strategy to coordinate  efforts to improve asset tracking and in-transit visibility. Although DOD  has made progress in these efforts, we also found that more work  remains to fully address the issues identified for this high-risk area.", "In February 2013, we reviewed DOD\u2019s draft strategy for in-transit visibility  and found that it included some, but not all, of the elements of a  comprehensive strategic plan.

Specifically, we  determined that the Strategy fully includes a comprehensive mission  statement; a problem definition, scope, and methodology; goals and  objectives; activities, milestones, and performance measures; and  organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination. For example, we  determined that the Strategy fully includes a comprehensive mission  statement because it included a comprehensive statement that  summarizes the main purpose of the Strategy. More precisely, as stated  in the Strategy, it was developed to guide and integrate department-wide  efforts to improve asset visibility, reduce supply chain risk, and improve  logistics decision making. Additionally, we determined that the Strategy  fully includes a problem definition, scope, and methodology because it  presents the issues to be addressed by the strategy, the scope the  strategy covers, and the process by which it was developed. Further, we  determined that the Strategy fully includes goals and objectives because  it lists each of the department\u2019s goals for improving asset visibility and  also lists the objectives that support achievement of those goals.  Specifically, the Strategy includes goals such as enhance visibility of  assets in-transit, in-storage, in-process, and in-theater, and increase  inventory existence and completeness in support of audit readiness. In  support of achieving these goals, the Strategy also establishes objectives  intended to be a foundation for identifying opportunities for improvement  across the supply chain, such as increase efficiencies to include delivery  accuracy or cycle times, and to provide better customer service by  changing or adjusting supply chain or asset movement processes. We  also determined that the Strategy fully includes activities, milestones, and  performance measures because the SEPs, which were issued along with  the Strategy, detail the initiatives (activities) intended to improve asset  visibility and include both milestones and performance measures for  monitoring their implementation. Lastly, we determined that the Strategy  fully includes organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination due  to the inclusion of a responsibilities and oversight discussion in the  Strategy that details the key players and their roles in implementing the  Strategy.", "However, not all of these elements were completely addressed in the  SEPs, as required by the Strategy, at the time the Strategy was issued. In  the Strategy, components were called to address resources and  investments and key external factors in their SEPs, which were  published as part of the Strategy.

For example, one of the metrics  TRANSCOM uses to monitor its Active Radio Frequency Identification  (RFID) technology initiative is the cost to procure an RFID tag. While this  is a useful metric as it tells TRANSCOM if the organization is reducing the  item cost for RFID tags, it is unclear whether this is also a useful metric  for determining how the department is progressing towards achieving any  related goals and objectives for improving asset visibility. DOD officials  agree that there needs to be a process for assessing progress towards  meeting the overarching goals and objectives in the Strategy. Assessing,  and refining, the existing performance measures as needed to help  ensure their alignment with the goals in the Strategy, would better  position DOD to develop the most relevant performance metrics and to  analyze and monitor performance data.

When assessing agencies\u2019 corrective actions,  consistent with GAO\u2019s criteria for determining high risk, we assessed the  effectiveness of DOD\u2019s corrective actions to address existing materiel  weaknesses. In this regard, we considered factors such as whether the  proposed remaining corrective action plans are appropriate and whether  effective solutions will be substantially completed in the near term, which  is generally considered to be within the 2-year period covered by the term  of the Congress to which a high-risk update report is addressed.", "In December 2004, we found that DOD\u2019s efforts to achieve total asset  visibility, which hinged largely on individual initiatives, were unlikely to  succeed without a long-term strategy that established outcome-oriented  goals, timelines, and performance measures. Therefore, we  recommended that the department develop a strategy for total asset  visibility that included, among other things, goals and performance  measures to gauge improvement. DOD\u2019s January 2014 Strategy  represents a positive step, and the preliminary efforts to develop and  implement initiatives to improve asset visibility look promising. Further, as  indicated in the Strategy, it will be updated annually and include new  SEPs outlining initiatives that have been developed by the components.  The Asset Visibility Working Group encourages components to continue  to develop new initiatives. Several initiatives are being developed and  may be included in the next annual update to the Strategy. For example,  the Air Force is developing a new initiative that will track the location and  status of aircraft, vehicles, ground support equipment, and aircraft parts in  real time. Also, the Marine Corps is developing an initiative to leverage  passive RFID and Global Positioning System advances to provide,  among other things, improved equipment accountability and enterprise  data sharing. While the components are implementing initiatives intended  to improve asset visibility and are working to identify new ones, it is too  early to tell whether the implementation of these initiatives will result in  measurable outcomes and progress toward meeting the goals and  objectives in the Strategy. Further, DOD has a process for continuing to  identify new initiatives. However, it is too early to tell whether these  combined efforts will result in measurable outcomes and progress in  realizing DOD\u2019s goals and objectives for improving asset visibility.  Further, the combined efforts may not be substantially completed in the  near term or within the 2-year period to demonstrate sustained progress  in resolving the high-risk area.

However, without  transparency on what resources and investments are required to  implement its asset visibility improvement initiatives, DOD cannot be sure  that the department will have the information it needs to make well- informed decisions about asset visibility, including setting budget  priorities. Additionally, establishing clear linkage between these  improvement initiatives and the goals and objectives in the Strategy as  well as a process to monitor performance and assess progress towards  achieving the goals and objectives in its Strategy will be an important step  to determining what, if any, effect these initiatives are having on  achievement of those goals and objectives.

Specifically, we reviewed the Strategy and plans and assessed  whether they included, partially included, or did not include the elements  of a comprehensive strategic plan, as outlined in our prior work. We  determined that the Strategy and plans \u201cfully included\u201d an element when  the plan described the entire element, and \u201cpartially included\u201d an element  when the plan described some, but not all, parts of that element. When a  plan did not explicitly cite any of the parts of an element, we determined  that the element was \u201cnot included\u201d in the Strategy. We then discussed  our assessment with officials from the Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Supply Chain Integration to confirm our  understanding of the documents and gain more insight, including whether  any elements were addressed in other departmental documents and  whether there were any plans or actions under way to update the  Strategy or address any of the missing elements.
