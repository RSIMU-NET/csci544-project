Employee misconduct incidents can detract from FEMA's mission, damage the agency's reputation, and hamper its ability to respond to disasters and maintain public trust.", "GAO was asked to review employee misconduct at FEMA. This report examines: (1) the extent to which FEMA developed policies and procedures for addressing misconduct; (2) available data on FEMA misconduct cases and the extent to which FEMA uses the data to identify and address trends; and (3) the extent that misconduct cases are shared within FEMA and with DHS OIG. GAO reviewed FEMA procedures, analyzed misconduct data, and interviewed officials from FEMA HQ and three regions (selected based on geographic dispersion and number of misconduct allegations). GAO also analyzed a random, non-generalizable sample of 20 complaints referred from DHS OIG to FEMA to determine whether they were addressed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has developed and documented misconduct policies and procedures for most employees, but not its entire workforce. Specifically, FEMA has developed policies and procedures regarding misconduct investigations that apply to all FEMA personnel and has also documented options to address misconduct and appeal rights for Title 5 (generally permanent employees) and Cadre of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (temporary employees who support disaster related activities). However, FEMA has not documented misconduct policies and procedures for Surge Capacity Force members, who may augment FEMA's workforce in the event of a catastrophic disaster. Additionally, FEMA's Reservist (intermittent disaster employees) policies and procedures do not outline disciplinary actions or the appeals process currently in practice at the agency. As a result, supervisors and Reservist employees may not be aware of all aspects of the process. Clearly documented policies and procedures for all workforce categories could help to better prepare management to address misconduct and mitigate perceptions that misconduct is handled inconsistently.", "FEMA records data on misconduct cases and their outcomes; however, aspects of this data limit their usefulness for identifying and addressing trends. GAO reviewed misconduct complaints recorded by FEMA's Office of the Chief Security Officer (OCSO) from January 2014 through September 30, 2016, and identified 595 complaints involving 799 alleged offenses, the most common of which were integrity and ethics violations. FEMA reported 546 disciplinary actions related to misconduct from calendar year 2014 through 2016. In addition to OCSO, two other FEMA offices involved in investigating and adjudicating misconduct also record data. However, limited standardization of data fields and entries within fields, limited use of unique case identifiers, and a lack of documented guidance on data entry across all three offices restricts the data's usefulness for identifying and addressing trends in employee misconduct. Improved quality control measures could help the agency use the data to better identify potential problem areas and opportunities for training.", "FEMA shares misconduct case information internally and with the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG) on a regular basis; however, FEMA does not have reconciliation procedures in place to track DHS OIG referred cases to ensure that they are reviewed and addressed. GAO reviewed a random sample of 20 cases DHS OIG referred to FEMA in fiscal year 2016 and found that FEMA missed 6 of the 20 complaints during the referral process and had not reviewed them at the time of GAO's inquiry. As a result of GAO's review, FEMA took action to review the complaints and opened inquiries in 5 of the 6 cases (1 case was closed for lack of information). In 3 of these cases, officials determined that the complaints did not involve FEMA employees. The 2 remaining cases were open as of April 2017. While the results from this review are not generalizable to the entire population of referrals from DHS OIG to FEMA, they raise questions as to whether there could be additional instances of misconduct complaints that FEMA has not reviewed or addressed. Procedures to ensure reconciliation of referred cases across FEMA and DHS OIG records could help ensure that FEMA accounts for all complaints."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations with which DHS concurred, including that FEMA document policies and procedures for addressing Surge Capacity Force and Reservist misconduct, improve the quality and usefulness of its misconduct data, and develop reconciliation procedures to consistently track referred cases."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a component of  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is responsible for  coordinating government-wide efforts in preparing for, protecting against,  mitigating the effects of, responding to, and recovering from all domestic  natural or man-made disasters, including acts of terror. To accomplish  this mission, FEMA relies on both permanent and disaster-related  temporary employees. FEMA\u2019s combined workforce tripled from fiscal  year 2005 through March 2017 (from approximately 7,500 to 22,600).  These employees play a key role in supporting communities and first  responders.

(2)  What data are available on FEMA employee misconduct cases  and their outcomes, and to what extent does FEMA use these  data to identify and address trends in employee misconduct?  (3)  To what extent is information regarding misconduct cases shared  within FEMA\u2019s personnel management offices and with the DHS  Office of Inspector General (OIG)?", "To address our first objective we reviewed, where available, FEMA\u2019s  documented policies and procedures for reporting, investigating, and  adjudicating allegations of misconduct across all of the agency\u2019s  workforce categories, including the following: Title 5 employees, Cadre  of On-Call Response/Recovery Employees (CORE), Reservists, Surge  Capacity Force members, and FEMA Corps members. To further  understand how these policies and procedures are implemented at the  headquarters level, we interviewed officials from FEMA offices with  responsibilities related to managing misconduct. We interviewed cadre  management officials from FEMA\u2019s three largest cadres \u2014 Public  Assistance, Individual Assistance, and Logistics \u2014 to discuss Reservist  misconduct policies and procedures, and spoke with union  representatives from two FEMA bargaining units to obtain employee  perspectives. To further obtain supervisor and management  perspectives on the misconduct process, we interviewed the Regional  Administrators or their designated representatives, five Federal  Coordinating Officers (FCO), and 11 Branch Chiefs from FEMA Regions  2, 4, and 6. We selected these three regions based on factors such as  geographic dispersion and regions that typically respond to different types  of disasters, as well as those with the highest number of misconduct  allegations from January 1, 2014, through September 30, 2016. The  results of these interviews are not generalizable to all 10 of FEMA\u2019s  regions or all of FEMA\u2019s cadres; however, they provided us with both  regional and Joint Field Office perspectives on policies and procedures  for addressing employee misconduct and supervisory misconduct  training.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed and analyzed available  2014 through 2016 data contained in three misconduct case tracking  spreadsheets maintained by FEMA. In order to summarize alleged  misconduct offenses, we created eight offense category definitions and  assigned alleged offenses to the categories. To assess the reliability of  these data, we reviewed the spreadsheets for any gaps and  inconsistencies and interviewed agency officials to discuss the  mechanisms in place to ensure data quality. While we identified  limitations which we discuss later in this report, overall we found the data  in the spreadsheets sufficiently reliable to provide some general  information on the nature and characteristics of employee misconduct. In  order to determine the extent to which FEMA currently uses these data to  identify and address trends in employee misconduct, we interviewed  FEMA headquarters officials, as well as supervisors and managers in  FEMA Regions 2, 4, and 6. Although the information obtained from  interviews with regional officials is not generalizable to all 10 FEMA  regions or all FEMA cadres, it provided insights on how misconduct  information is shared with FEMA field supervisors.", "To address our third objective, we reviewed FEMA and DHS OIG  employee misconduct directives and manuals to identify any  requirements for coordination among internal FEMA offices and with DHS  OIG. We interviewed FEMA headquarters officials with responsibilities  related to managing misconduct and DHS OIG officials to determine the  extent to which they coordinate and communicate misconduct  information, and to obtain their perspectives on information sharing  related to misconduct investigations and outcomes. We analyzed  documents, including case tracking spreadsheets, to determine what, and  how frequently, employee misconduct information is shared within FEMA  and with DHS OIG. Additionally, to review FEMA\u2019s case tracking system,  we used fiscal year 2016 data from DHS OIG\u2019s Enforcement Data System  to randomly select a non-generalizable sample of 20 FEMA employee  misconduct complaints that had been referred from DHS OIG to FEMA in  fiscal year 2016. We compared these complaints to a case tracking  spreadsheet provided by FEMA to determine the extent to which FEMA  had taken action to review or investigate the complaints. While not  generalizable to all complaints referred from DHS OIG to FEMA, the  results of our review provided insight about FEMA\u2019s procedures for  tracking referred complaints and ensuring that all allegations of  misconduct are addressed.

In 2014 and 2016, the  OCSO spreadsheet sometimes included information on the subject\u2019s  employee type embedded within narrative summary of allegation fields. In  2015, that information was sometimes included in the narrative fields and  sometimes listed in a subject type field unique to that year.", "There was also limited standardization of entries within fields. For  example, in all years the offense field in the OCSO spreadsheet consisted  of text entries that described similar offenses in different ways, such as  \u201cTravel Card Violation\u201d and \u201cTravel Policy Violation\u201d, or multiple offenses  related to a specific complaint, such as \u201cFraud / Travel Card Violation\u201d.  The LER spreadsheet also contained examples of fields with limited  standardization of entries. For example, the fields which described a  subject\u2019s pay grade consisted of varied text entries, such as \u201c9\u201d, \u201cGS-09\u201d,  and \u201cGS-9\u201d. The PLB spreadsheet had similar issues with other fields.

LER officials noted that they did not provide data dictionaries  or guidance because the original case tracker involved a simple Excel  spreadsheet rather than a more complicated database system. However,  a lack of documented guidance on data entry may make it more difficult to  maintain and verify the completeness and accuracy of the data. For  example, we identified variations in data entry into the LER case tracking  spreadsheet across LER specialists. In 2015, of the 9 LER specialists  who entered information into the case tracking spreadsheet, 6 specialists  did not enter information into the employee pay grade field, 2 specialists  sometimes entered information, and 1 specialist always entered  information.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government advises  management to process data into quality information which is appropriate,  current, complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a timely basis.  Additionally, management should evaluate processed information, make  revisions when necessary so that the information is quality information,  and use the information to make informed decisions. As described above,  FEMA employee misconduct data are not readily accessible and cannot  be verified as accurate and complete on a timely basis. These limitations  restrict management\u2019s ability to process the data into quality information  which can be used to identify and address trends in employee  misconduct. For example, an OCSO official stated that senior OCSO  officials recently requested employee misconduct information based on  employee type, such as the number of Reservists. However, the data are  largely captured in narrative fields, making it difficult to extract without  manual review. LER officials stated that LER specialists do not regularly  conduct trend analysis on employee misconduct cases, but if they notice  an apparent trend such as a number of cases involving misuse and non- payment of travel credit cards they will discuss it during quarterly  meetings with component management. Five supervisors and  management officials from each of the three regions we spoke with said  that information on trends and patterns in employee misconduct would be  useful. For example, supervisors could use trend analysis to identify  specific types of employee misconduct which have become more  common, allowing them to send out policy guidance or schedule targeted  trainings to help address the issue.", "LER and OCSO are taking steps to improve their case tracking  spreadsheets. Specifically, LER officials reported that they began using  Microsoft SharePoint software in January 2017 which includes drop-down  selections for all fields except the subject name and comments. The  officials stated that they switched to SharePoint in response to DHS  requests for specific misconduct information as well as our requests,  which raised their awareness of the LER spreadsheet\u2019s limitations.  Similarly, an OCSO official stated that OCSO planned to add new fields to  their spreadsheet which will make it easier to generate reports and show  trends. These are positive steps towards addressing the issues with  employee misconduct data quality identified above. However, it is not  clear that they will be sufficient to address each of the data limitations we  identified and improve the ability to conduct trend analysis. For example,  although the LER SharePoint spreadsheet does include an entry number  field, it was unclear whether that would allow officials to track the status  and outcomes of specific cases across all three case tracking  spreadsheets. New fields and increased use of drop-down selections in  the LER SharePoint spreadsheet may help improve standardization of  fields and entries within fields, but LER specialists may differ in how they  interpret fields without documented guidance on data entry. Additionally, it  is unclear whether OCSO\u2019s modifications will include increased use of  drop-down selections or other means to standardize entries. An OCSO  official stated that they are also exploring DHS OIG\u2019s database software,  and noted that, if it could be adapted for FEMA\u2019s purposes, it would be a  substantial improvement.", "There are a number of possible quality control measures that could be  implemented to help improve the usefulness of FEMA\u2019s data for use in  identifying and addressing trends in employee misconduct. At a minimum,  based on our analysis of FEMA\u2019s misconduct spreadsheets, the offices  could: add additional drop-down fields with standardized entries to make  fields easier to summarize; add unique case identifier fields to improve the ability to track cases  across the three program offices\u2019 case tracking spreadsheets; develop guidance documents to ensure standardized data entry within  each office, including a procedure for quality control checks; or  consider adopting the use of database software, which could improve  standardization and case tracking across offices.", "These actions, combined with routine reporting on misconduct trends,  could improve upon the initial steps already underway at LER and OCSO  and better enable FEMA to manage and report on misconduct  information."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Shares Misconduct Case Information Among Personnel Management Offices and with DHS OIG, but Does Not Accurately Track DHS OIG Referred Misconduct Complaints", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA Personnel Management Offices Meet Regularly to Discuss Misconduct Allegations and Ongoing Investigations and Send Monthly Status Updates to DHS OIG", "paragraphs": ["In accordance with FEMA\u2019s Administrative Investigations Policy directive,  officials from OCSO, LER, and PLB conduct weekly AID Committee  meetings to coordinate information on misconduct allegations and  investigations.

According to PLB officials, FEMA\u2019s process for addressing employee  misconduct was ad hoc and informal prior to the release of the directive in  2012. For example, officials from key offices did not always meet and  share information on a regular basis, as they do now. PLB officials noted  that a new FEMA Chief Counsel in 2010 drove changes calling for a  formalized directive and clear instructions for managing misconduct. In  addition to the weekly AID Committee meetings, LER and PLB officials  stated that they meet on a regular basis to discuss disciplinary and  adverse actions and ensure that any penalties are consistent and  defensible in court. Employee misconduct information is also shared  directly with FEMA\u2019s Chief Security Officer and Chief Counsel.

DHS OIG referred 3 of the 6 complaints to FEMA a year or more prior to  our review. As a result of our review, FEMA subsequently took action to  review the complaints. The AID Committee recommended that OCSO  open inquiries in 3 of the 6 cases to determine whether the allegations  were against FEMA employees, assigned 2 cases to LER for further  review, and closed 1 case for lack of information.

Given the broad scope of FEMA\u2019s mission  and the growth and different categories that make up its workforce, an  effective process is key to mitigating any negative employee misconduct  effects. FEMA has taken actions to manage the employee misconduct  investigation and adjudication process. Specifically, FEMA has developed  and documented misconduct policies and procedures for most of its  employees, and has established procedures for regular internal  communication and coordination, as well as information sharing with DHS  OIG. However, misconduct policies and procedures for Surge Capacity  Force members and outcome options and appeals policies and  procedures for Reservists are not documented, and FEMA does not  communicate the range of penalties for offenses to all employees. Clear  documentation establishing who is responsible for investigating and  adjudicating misconduct is especially important given FEMA\u2019s goal of  significantly expanding the Surge Capacity Force. Because the Reservist  disciplinary action options and appeals currently in practice are not  documented, FEMA supervisors and Reservist employees may not be  aware of all aspects of the process. Similarly, the lack of communication  on the range of penalties for specific offenses to FEMA\u2019s workforce limits  management\u2019s ability to set expectations about appropriate conduct in the  workplace and to communicate consequences of inappropriate conduct.  Clearly documented policies and procedures for all workforce categories  and communication about offenses and penalties could help to better  prepare management to address misconduct and to mitigate any  perceptions that misconduct is handled inconsistently across FEMA\u2019s  workforce.", "In addition, while several FEMA offices collect data on employee  misconduct allegations, investigations, and outcomes, limitations related  to how the data are collected and managed restrict their usefulness for  identifying and addressing trends in employee misconduct. Addressing  these limitations by implementing quality control measures could improve  FEMA\u2019s ability to track misconduct cases and to identify potential problem  areas and opportunities for targeted training.

Specifically, we reviewed investigation and discipline  directives and manuals, as well as program directives and manuals, and  interagency agreements related to FEMA Corps, to determine the extent  to which FEMA has developed misconduct policies and procedures. At  FEMA headquarters we interviewed senior officials from the Office of the  Chief Security Officer (OCSO), Office of the Chief Component Human  Capital Officer, Labor and Employee Relations Branch (LER), and Office  of the Chief Counsel, Personnel Law Branch (PLB).

We were  unable to identify and account for possible duplication of the same  complaints in the different spreadsheets. As such, we focused our  analysis on individual spreadsheets rather than on aggregating  information across all spreadsheets. Specifically, in order to summarize  alleged misconduct offenses recorded in the OCSO case tracking  spreadsheet, we first reviewed all of the data available on complaints  which were received from January 1, 2014 through September 30, 2016.  Next, we created eight offense category definitions based on prior GAO  reports, discussions with stakeholders, and our review of the summary of  allegations and offense fields.
