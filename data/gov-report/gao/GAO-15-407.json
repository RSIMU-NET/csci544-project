The 2012 act created FirstNet within the Department of Commerce to establish, for public safety use, a nationwide, interoperable, wireless broadband network, which will initially support data transmissions. The 2012 act established numerous responsibilities for FirstNet, provided $7 billion for network construction, and required FirstNet to be self-funding beyond this initial allocation. As part of the effort, FirstNet is working with five \u201cearly builder projects\u201d that are building local and regional public-safety broadband networks.", "GAO was asked to examine FirstNet's progress in establishing the network. GAO assessed (1) FirstNet's progress carrying out its responsibilities and establishing internal controls, (2) how much the network is estimated to cost and how FirstNet plans to become self-funding, and (3) what lessons can be learned from the early builder projects. GAO reviewed FirstNet documentation and public-safety network cost estimates, surveyed all state-designated FirstNet contacts, and interviewed FirstNet officials and public safety stakeholders selected for their telecommunications and public safety experience."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) has made progress carrying out its responsibilities established in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (the 2012 act) but lacks certain elements of effective internal controls. FirstNet is charged with the complex and challenging task of establishing a new, nationwide, wireless broadband network for public safety entities, in consultation with federal, state, local, and tribal stakeholders. The network will initially support interoperable data communications, and later integrate mission-critical voice capabilities as public safety standards for voice communications are developed. FirstNet has made progress establishing an organizational structure, planning for the network, and consulting with stakeholders. FirstNet has also begun establishing policies and practices consistent with federal internal control standards. Officials told GAO that they plan to continue to do so. However, FirstNet has not fully assessed its risks or established standards of conduct\u2014which is an important form of ethical guidance for its personnel . Given that FirstNet faces numerous risks to achieve its complex objectives, fully assessing risks could help FirstNet achieve its objectives and maximize use of its resources. Developing standards of conduct could also help FirstNet address any performance issues in a timely manner.", "A nationwide public-safety broadband network has been estimated by various entities to cost billions of dollars, and FirstNet faces difficult decisions determining how to fund the network's construction and ongoing operations. These estimates indicate the cost to construct and operate such a network could be from $12 to $47 billion over the first 10 years. The actual cost of FirstNet's network will be influenced by FirstNet's (1) business model, especially the extent of commercial partnerships; (2) use of existing infrastructure; (3) efforts to ensure network reliability; and (4) network coverage. For example, the cost of the network may be higher if FirstNet does not utilize partnerships and some existing infrastructure. To become self-funding, FirstNet is authorized to generate revenue through user fees and commercial partnerships. However, FirstNet faces difficult decisions in determining how to best utilize these revenue sources. For instance, widespread network coverage can attract more users and revenue, but is expensive to construct and maintain, especially in rural areas.", "FirstNet has taken steps to collect and evaluate information and lessons from the five \u201cearly builder projects\u201d that are developing local and regional public-safety networks, but could do more to ensure that the lessons are properly evaluated. For example, FirstNet has asked the projects to report on the experiences of their networks' users and has assigned contractors to collect and log lessons. However, FirstNet does not have a plan that clearly articulates how it will evaluate those experiences and lessons. Although FirstNet told GAO that it remains in close contact with early builder projects, GAO has previously found that a well-developed evaluation plan for projects like these can help ensure that agencies obtain the information necessary to make effective program and policy decisions. Given that the early builder projects are doing on a local and regional level what FirstNet must eventually do nationally, an evaluation plan can play a key role in FirstNet's strategic planning and program management, providing feedback on both program design and execution and ensuring FirstNet has not missed opportunities to incorporate lessons the projects have identified."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FirstNet should complete its risk assessment, develop standards of conduct, and develop an evaluation plan for early builder projects.

We previously reported on the  challenges to implementing a public-safety broadband network, including  ensuring the network\u2019s reliability and security and obtaining adequate  funds to build and maintain it. To inform its work, FirstNet is required to  consult with numerous federal, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions.  FirstNet is also working with five \u201cearly builder projects\u201d that received  federal funding to deploy local and regional public-safety broadband  networks similar to what FirstNet is required to establish on a national  scale.

It is intended that this network will be a  new, nationwide, broadband telecommunications network. Public safety  users, and potentially other \u201csecondary\u201d users, may be assessed fees to  use the network, much as they may currently pay for the use of  commercial wireless networks. In establishing this network, FirstNet must  issue open, transparent, and competitive Requests for Proposals  (RFP) to private sector entities for the purpose of building, operating,  and maintaining the public safety network; develop RFPs that include appropriate timetables for construction,  and network coverage areas and service levels, among other things; enter into agreements to use, to the maximum extent economically  desirable, existing commercial, federal, state, local, and tribal  infrastructure; promote competition in the public-safety equipment marketplace by  requiring that equipment for the public safety network be built to open,  non-proprietary standards; promote integration of the public safety network with public-safety address special considerations for areas with unique homeland or  require deployment phases that include substantial rural coverage  milestones; and develop the technical and operational requirements for the public  safety network, as well as the practices and procedures for managing  and operating it.", "In establishing the infrastructure for the public safety network, the 2012  act requires FirstNet to include the following network components, as  shown in figure 1:  core network of data centers and other elements, all based on  commercial standards;  connectivity between the radio access network (RAN) and the public  Internet or the Public Switched Telephone Network, or both; and network cell-site equipment, antennas, and \u201cbackhaul\u201d equipment,  based on commercial standards, to support wireless devices  operating on frequencies designated for public safety broadband.", "In developing the public safety network, FirstNet must work with a variety  of stakeholders. The 2012 act required FirstNet to be headed by a 15- member board with 3 permanent members (the Secretary of Homeland  Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of the Office of  Management and Budget) and 12 individuals appointed by the Secretary  of Commerce. The appointed members are required to have public safety  experience or technical, network, or financial expertise. The 2012 act  also required FirstNet to establish a standing public-safety advisory  committee to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities and consult with  federal, regional, state, local, and tribal jurisdictions on developing the  network. For state, local, and tribal planning consultations, FirstNet is  required to work with the state Single Points of Contact (SPOC) who have  been designated by each state, territory, and the District of Columbia  (hereafter, states).", "The 2012 act requires FirstNet to notify the states when it has completed  its RFP process for building, operating, and maintaining the public safety  network. Once a state receives the details of FirstNet\u2019s plans, it has 90  days either to agree to allow FirstNet to construct a RAN in that state or  notify FirstNet, NTIA, and FCC of its intent to deploy its own RAN. A state  that \u201copts out\u201d of FirstNet\u2019s plan to build that state\u2019s RAN has an  additional 180 days from that notification to develop and complete RFPs  for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the RAN within the  state; the state must send FCC an alternative plan for constructing,  operating, and maintaining its RAN. The plan must demonstrate that the  state\u2019s proposed RAN would comply with certain minimum technical  requirements and be interoperable with FirstNet\u2019s network. FCC shall  either approve or disapprove the plan. In addition, a state that opts out is  required to apply to NTIA for an agreement to use FirstNet\u2019s spectrum  capacity.", "Various federal agencies will provide assistance and support to FirstNet.  For example,", "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within the  Department of Commerce, in consultation with FCC, DHS, and the  Department of Justice\u2019s National Institute of Justice, is required to  conduct research and assist with the development of standards,  technologies, and applications to advance wireless public-safety  communications.", "The Public Safety Communications Research (PSCR) program, a joint  NTIA and NIST effort, performs research on behalf of FirstNet to  advance public-safety communications interoperability.", "DHS, through both the Office of Emergency Communications and the  Office for Interoperability and Compatibility, supports the  establishment of the public safety network and collaborates with  public safety and government officials at the federal, state, local, and  tribal levels to help ensure the network meets the needs and technical  requirements of users in the public safety community.", "The 2012 act also required FCC, the entity responsible for managing and  licensing commercial and non-federal spectrum use\u2014including spectrum  allocated to public safety\u2014to take certain steps to support FirstNet. It also  authorized FCC to provide FirstNet with technical assistance and to take  any action necessary to assist FirstNet in effectuating its statutory duties  and responsibilities. Radio frequency spectrum is an essential resource  for wireless communications, including the planned public-safety network.  The energy in electronic telecommunications transmissions converts  airwaves into signals to deliver voice, text, and images. These signal  frequencies are allocated for specific purposes, such as television  broadcasting or Wi-Fi, and assigned to specific users through licenses.", "Allocating sufficient spectrum for wireless emergency communications  has long been a concern for Congress. The 2012 act required FCC to  reallocate the \u201cD Block,\u201d a previously commercial spectrum block located  in the upper 700 megahertz (MHz) band, to public safety and to grant a  license to FirstNet for the use of both the existing public-safety broadband  spectrum in the upper 700 MHz band and the D Block. FirstNet now has  a license to operate the nationwide public-safety broadband network on  spectrum in the upper 700 MHz band, specifically 758-769 MHz and 788- 799 MHz (see fig. 2 below). In October 2013, FCC adopted consolidated  technical service rules governing the 700 MHz band of spectrum licensed  to FirstNet and was prepared to accept and process applications for  equipment certification in that spectrum band consistent with the newly  consolidated rules. FCC has conducted specified spectrum auctions, as  required by the 2012 act, so that auction proceeds could be used to fund  FirstNet. The 2012 act provides $7 billion from the spectrum auction  proceeds to FirstNet for \u201cbuildout\u201d of the public safety network, reduced  by the amount needed to establish FirstNet. The 2012 act requires  FirstNet to be self-funding beyond this initial $7 billion.", "Efforts to establish local and regional public-safety networks are also  ongoing, and predate the 2012 act. In 2009, public safety entities began  requesting waivers from FCC\u2019s rules to allow early deployment of  interoperable public-safety wireless broadband networks in the upper 700  MHz spectrum band authorized for public safety use. Through 2011, FCC  granted waivers to 22 jurisdictions for early deployment of such  networks.altered the regulatory landscape for the 700 MHz band\u201d and sought   However, FCC recognized that the 2012 act \u201cfundamentally  comment on the disposition of waiver jurisdiction deployments. In May  2012, NTIA partially suspended seven grant projects for the waiver  jurisdictions that received funding from the Broadband Technology  Opportunities Program (BTOP), a federal grant program to promote the  expansion of broadband infrastructure. NTIA suspended the projects in  part to ensure the projects supported the development of FirstNet\u2019s public  safety network. In July 2012, FCC decided to hold all waiver  authorizations ineffective as of September 2, 2012, and said it would  allow such jurisdictions to continue to deploy public-safety broadband  services in the existing public-safety broadband spectrum (later extended  to include the D Block) under certain limited circumstances consistent  with FirstNet\u2019s future use of the spectrum. FCC granted FirstNet the 700  MHz public-safety broadband-spectrum license in November 2012, and  in February 2013, FirstNet announced it would begin negotiations with the  original waiver jurisdictions on SMLAs. With FirstNet in control of the 700  MHz public-safety broadband-spectrum license pursuant to its FCC  license, the jurisdictions had to secure an SMLA with FirstNet to lift their  partial funding suspension and resume work. By August 2014, FirstNet  secured SMLAs with five original waiver jurisdictions; in this report, we  refer to these jurisdictions as early builder projects. Figure 3 shows  timelines for the early builder projects and the amount of federal funding  they received to deploy their networks. As part of their SMLAs with  FirstNet, the early builder projects agreed to report to FirstNet on their  use of the spectrum, their progress, and on key-learning conditions,  among other things. FirstNet has not yet determined if or how the early  builder project networks will be incorporated into its nationwide network.", "Three other original waiver jurisdictions were awarded BTOP funds to  deploy local and regional public-safety broadband networks, including the  State of Mississippi,  the San Francisco Bay Area in California, and the  City of Charlotte in North Carolina. However, for various reasons, these  jurisdictions were unable to reach SMLAs with FirstNet and the projects  were canceled.", "Even with the establishment of the public safety network, first responders  will continue to rely on their current LMR systems for mission-critical voice  communications. We previously reported that a major limitation of a  public-safety broadband network is that it will not provide first responders  with \u201cmission-critical\u201d voice capabilities\u2014that is, voice capabilities that  meet a high standard for reliability, redundancy, capacity, and flexibility  necessary during emergencies\u2014for several years.

In particular, in response to our survey, numerous SPOCs noted  either that FirstNet\u2019s placement within NTIA could create \u201cbureaucratic\u201d  obstacles or that FirstNet should be more independent from NTIA. One  survey respondent and another subject matter expert we interviewed also  noted that this placement creates conflicting expectations\u2014that is,  stakeholders expect FirstNet to behave like both a commercial wireless  carrier and a government entity, and these expectations can sometimes  be in conflict. However, FirstNet officials told us that while FirstNet has  leveraged its relationship with NTIA in administrative and legal matters, it  exercises strong independence in decisions that are directly program- related.", "Numerous stakeholders we surveyed and interviewed were also  concerned about the pace of FirstNet\u2019s hiring, noting that the federal  hiring process is too slow, has not allowed FirstNet to hire staff quickly  enough, and has delayed FirstNet\u2019s progress. For example, FirstNet hired  its management team for state plans, consultation, and outreach in late  2013 to early 2014, then hired State and Local, Tribal, and Federal  Outreach Leads in June and August 2014, almost 2 years after FirstNet\u2019s  board members were appointed.

To engage  with federal entities, FirstNet has hired a director of federal outreach,  designated DHS\u2019s Emergency Communications Preparedness Center  (ECPC) as the primary body to FirstNet for federal consultation, and  participated in meetings with ECPC and other agencies. To engage with  vendors interested in doing business with FirstNet, FirstNet has held  vendor meetings and appointed an industry liaison to coordinate vendor  outreach. In addition to this targeted outreach, FirstNet also launched a  public website in March 2014, where it regularly posts updates,  presentations, board-meeting minutes, a list of upcoming speaking  engagements, and other information. The 2012 act also created a State  and Local Implementation Grant Program (SLIGP), administered by NTIA,  to provide states with funds to plan for the public safety network and to  consult with FirstNet. Starting in July 2013, NTIA awarded $116 million  in SLIGP grants.", "We believe FirstNet\u2019s consultation and outreach activities generally align  with core principles for effective stakeholder participation that we have  developed and used in previous reports.

However, numerous stakeholders we  surveyed and interviewed said that they would like more new and detailed  information and that they would like FirstNet to focus more on certain  aspects of the public safety network during outreach. For example, in  response to our survey, SPOCs most frequently indicated that there  should be a \u201clarge increase\u201d in how much FirstNet focuses on various  technical aspects of developing the network in its state outreach.SPOCs also said that the lack of new information from FirstNet, such as  details about the network\u2019s design, hampers their ability to conduct local  outreach. However, in response to our survey many SPOCs also  acknowledged that the level of new and detailed information exchanged  will likely increase once they hold their initial state consultation meeting  with FirstNet. Additionally, officials from one federal agency with public  safety responsibilities said they would have liked to see more in-depth  outreach to federal entities, given that federal agencies will have a large  pool of potential network users.

In  previous work, we found that when an agency worked quickly to establish  a new program, it resulted in the agency\u2019s hastily designing an internal  control system that was not based on complete risk assessments and that  the agency responded to risks in a reactive, rather than a proactive,  manner. Thus, it was unclear whether the controls appropriately  responded to risk or were the best use of the agency\u2019s resources.  Additionally, we are concerned that the complexity of FirstNet\u2019s  responsibilities and objectives, makeup of FirstNet\u2019s Board of Directors,  and challenges that FirstNet will face attracting users to its network and  becoming self-funding illustrate the multitude of potential risks FirstNet  faces in achieving its objectives.

According to FCC estimates, capital costs would be 2.5 times greater  without this form of sharing. Given these potential financial savings, a few  public safety stakeholders we spoke with maintained that FirstNet should  use at least some existing infrastructure for the network. The use of  existing infrastructure can have limitations though. For instance, using  existing infrastructure can limit the design and coverage of the network,  since existing towers and buildings can only facilitate certain network  coverage given their physical location. Negotiating access to existing  infrastructure can also be a time-consuming process, especially with  government-owned or controlled facilities, and where contracts must by  executed with multiple owners, ultimately slowing down network  deployment. For example, when we spoke with Swedish officials about  the public-safety communications network in their county, they said that  they sought to use existing infrastructure, to save costs, when  constructing their network, but faced problems in their largest cities  convincing tower owners to allow the government to rent the towers.

According to the officials,  their project will not be able to charge their users enough to make the  operations sustainable without pricing the users out of the services. The  officials told us a possible way to address this challenge would be to  expand the service to public safety entities in neighboring metropolitan  areas and airport services areas that have established broadband  infrastructure. Similarly, officials from one of the projects said their  network will be in an \u201cuneasy\u201d financial position initially because the  number of users subscribing to the network will likely be low. Further, the  officials noted that a small user base could make it difficult to maintain the  network because user fees are expected to pay for a significant portion of  network operations and maintenance. According to a SPOC working with  one of the projects, determining user fees to cover ongoing maintenance  and administrative costs has been a financial challenge. To decide user  fees, project officials are considering factors including the potential for  public-private partnerships and how to define the scope of the user base.

Officials from one  project told us they learned specific lessons about site selection, permits  and site access agreements, and equipment choices. The officials also  told us they selected the RFP response that was the most economical in  its use of existing infrastructure. Officials from another project told us how  they chose to deploy in densely populated areas with high-crime rates,  where public safety coordination is typically challenging and in most need  of improvement. The officials also said they provided guidance to local  police departments that helped them avoid procuring communications  devices that would not be compatible with the project or FirstNet\u2019s public  safety network. An official from one of the canceled projects said his team  faced several challenges including local zoning conditions that affected  project schedule and cost, a newly passed city code that required towers  to withstand higher wind loads and that increased costs, and commercial  competitors lowering their subscription rates to compete with the planned  public-safety network. Officials from an ongoing project told us their  project initially identified \u201cbuildout\u201d sites but learned that environmental  assessments would need to be completed for each site. Doing these  assessments would threaten the project\u2019s ability to follow its project  schedule. To address the challenge, the project narrowed its buildout site  pool to exclude marshlands and other areas with obstructive tree lines  and to include publicly owned sites such as police and fire stations. With  the publicly owned sites identified, project officials worked with their  state\u2019s legislature to pass an exemption to state environmental reviews.  According to a SPOC we spoke with, the project\u2019s efforts on this issue will  reduce the project\u2019s overall build time.

We have previously found that a well-developed  evaluation plan for projects like the early builder projects can help ensure  that agencies obtain the information necessary to make effective program  and policy decisions. A well-developed evaluation plan should include,  at a minimum, several key features including the following: well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives;  criteria or standards for determining project performance; a clear plan that details the type and source of data necessary to  evaluate the project, methods for data collection, and timing and  frequency of data collection; and a detailed data-analysis plan to track performance and evaluate the  projects\u2019 final results. procedures and experiences. According to a SPOC involved in one of  the projects, FirstNet\u2019s key-learning conditions cover a comprehensive set  of issues and should provide valuable data for FirstNet. Under the  SMLAs, the projects also agree to provide FirstNet with quarterly  reporting on their project\u2019s use of FirstNet\u2019s spectrum, progress achieving  project milestones, and in some cases, the experiences of their network  users. In October 2014, FirstNet provided the projects with quarterly  report templates, instructions, and timing for completing the reports.  Additionally, FirstNet intends to gain knowledge from the projects through  contractors who have been assigned to each project to provide  information and collect formal and informal lessons.contractors are using an informal lessons log to track observed lessons  and whether they have been incorporated into the technical documents  used to guide FirstNet\u2019s acquisition of a comprehensive network solution.  FirstNet officials also told us that they hold weekly meetings to review  early builder project status, progress on SMLA key-learning conditions,  and informal key lessons. Finally, in April 2014 FirstNet authorized the  PSAC to establish an Early Builder Working Group to provide advice on  the strategies and lessons learned related to the early builder network  development, outreach, and consultation. As of January 2015, the PSAC  planned to submit the Early Builder Working Group\u2019s first series of  recommendations to FirstNet.", "Although FirstNet has taken these steps, we are concerned that it lacks a  detailed data-analysis plan to track the performance and results of the  early builder projects. For the early builder projects, their performance  and results are captured in the observations and lessons learned reported  to FirstNet and identified by consultants. Tracking the early builder  projects\u2019 observations and lessons against FirstNet technical  documentation is necessary to ensure that the lessons have been  addressed and also facilitates transparency and accountability for  FirstNet\u2019s decision-making. Even though FirstNet staff and contractors  remain in close contact with the early builder projects, without a data- analysis plan to track those projects it is unclear how FirstNet intends to  evaluate the projects\u2019 observations and lessons and determine whether or  how the lessons are addressed. As a result, we believe that FirstNet  could miss opportunities to leverage key lessons related to governance,  finance, outreach, and network deployment. Given that the early builder  projects are doing, in part, on a regional and local level what FirstNet  must eventually do on a national level, a complete evaluation plan that  includes a detailed data-analysis plan could play a key role in FirstNet\u2019s  strategic planning and program management, providing feedback on both  program design and execution.

The 2012 act provided FirstNet  with the basic resources necessary\u2014such as spectrum and initial  capital\u2014to establish an interoperable broadband network for all public  safety entities. However, there is no guarantee that FirstNet will be able to  successfully develop and operate this nationwide network. FirstNet is  tasked with a complex and challenging mission to establish the network,  which researchers have estimated could cost as much as $47 billion to  construct and operate over its first 10 years. Furthermore, FirstNet faces  a multitude of risks, significant challenges, and difficult decisions in  meeting its statutory responsibilities, including determining how to  become a self-funding entity. If FirstNet fails to generate enough revenue  to operate the network over the long-term, for example, it could  jeopardize the existence of this new public safety network. At this time,  the extent to which FirstNet can generate revenue through partnerships  with commercial carriers remains unknown, especially given that some  commercial carriers could choose to compete with FirstNet. However,  FirstNet is taking certain actions to help ensure that its public safety  network is successful. For instance, to date it has effectively consulted  with stakeholders and maintained a rigorous cost estimate.", "Although FirstNet has started to establish an internal control system to  help it meet its statutory responsibilities, we found FirstNet could  strengthen its internal controls. In particular, while FirstNet has begun  taking some steps to assess risks, it has not fully assessed the risks it  faces. Complete risk assessments would help FirstNet respond to risks in  a proactive manner and make the best use of its resources by  appropriately responding to the most pressing risks. FirstNet could also  strengthen its internal controls by fully establishing its control  environment, which is the foundation for an effective internal control  system. Currently, FirstNet has not established a cohesive standards of  conduct policy, which means FirstNet may not be able to address  deviations in conduct and performance and take corrective actions in a  timely manner. Establishing and evaluating adherence to standards of  conduct would help FirstNet ensure that all its personnel are held  accountable for their actions and foster stakeholder trust in FirstNet\u2019s  ability to meet its statutory responsibilities.", "Early builder projects have learned important lessons related to  governance, finance, outreach, and network deployment that could be  useful to FirstNet as it develops its plans to establish a nationwide  network.
