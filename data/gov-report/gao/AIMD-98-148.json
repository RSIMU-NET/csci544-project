First, we will provide an outline of OMB\u2019s wide-ranging management responsibilities and note that the question of whether to integrate or separate management and budget functions has been long debated. Second, we will discuss the effectiveness of OMB\u2019s management leadership which, in our view, has been uneven. Finally, we will discuss the factors that appear to contribute to progress in sustaining improvements in federal management. Our observations are made on the basis of work we are currently doing and have done at federal agencies and at OMB.", "As you know, OMB supports the president by preparing the president\u2019s budget, coordinating the president\u2019s legislative agenda, leading efforts to improve the management of the executive branch, and providing policy analysis and advice.

OMB is the lead agency for overseeing a framework of recently enacted financial, information resources, and performance planning and measurement reforms designed to improve the effectiveness and responsiveness of federal agencies. This framework contains as its core elements financial management improvement legislation, including the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996; information technology reforms, including the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996; and the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (the Results Act).", "OMB. In addition to serving as the government\u2019s key official for financial management, the DDM is to coordinate and supervise a wide range of general management functions of OMB. These functions include those relating to managerial systems, such as the systematic measurement of performance; procurement policy; regulatory affairs; and other management functions, such as organizational studies, long-range planning, program evaluation, and productivity improvement.", "OMB is responsible for providing guidance and oversight for various other laws and executive orders as well. For example, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) requires that executive agency heads set cost, performance, and schedule goals for major acquisition programs and that OMB report to Congress on agencies\u2019 progress in meeting these goals. Executive Order 12866 directs OMB to coordinate the review of agencies\u2019 rules and regulations to ensure that they impose the least burden, are consistent between agencies, focus on results over process, and are based on sound cost/benefit analysis. OMB also has been responsible since 1967, through its Circular A-76, for carrying out executive branch policy to rely on competition between the federal workforce and the private sector for providing commercial goods and services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Historically, There Have Been Questions About Whether to Integrate or Separate Management and Budget Functions", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u2019s perennial challenge is to carry out its central management leadership responsibilities in such a way that leverages opportunities of the budget process, while at the same time ensuring that management concerns receive appropriate attention in an environment driven by budget and policy decisions. Concern that OMB and its predecessor agency, the Bureau of the Budget, lacked the support and institutional capacity necessary to sustain management improvement efforts throughout the executive branch has prompted numerous calls for changes in the past. overwhelmed by\u2014the budget process. Some observers have advocated integrating the two functions, while others have proposed the creation of dedicated offices or a separate agency to provide governmentwide management leadership.", "Prior OMB reorganizations, reflecting these different points of view, have alternated between seeking to more directly integrate management into the budget review process and creating separate management offices. Previous congressional and OMB attempts to elevate the status of management by creating separate management units within OMB sought to ensure that an adequate level of effort was focused on management issues. Underscoring its concern that management issues receive appropriate attention, Congress established the DDM position to provide top-level leadership to improve the management of the federal government.", "In 1994, OMB reorganized to integrate its budget analysis, management review, and policy development roles, in an initiative called \u201cOMB 2000.\u201d This reorganization was the most recent of a series of attempts to bolster OMB\u2019s management capacity and influence. To carry out its responsibilities, OMB\u2019s Resource Management Offices (RMO) are responsible for examining agency budget, management, and policy issues. Linking management reforms to the budget has, at a minimum, provided the opportunity to include management issues as part of the president\u2019s yearly budget reviews\u2014a regularly established framework for making decisions. coordinate their activities with the statutory offices.

OMB has played a pivotal role in fostering ongoing financial management reforms ranging from improved financial systems and reporting to new accounting standards. We are seeing positive results from OMB\u2019s efforts. For example, eight agencies obtained unqualified opinions on their fiscal year 1997 audited financial statements, and OMB set a performance goal for it to assist 21 of the 24 CFO Act agencies to obtain unqualified and timely audit opinions on their annual financial statements for fiscal year 1999. In the 1997 Federal Financial Management Status Report and Five-Year Plan, OMB and the CFO Council discussed accomplishments and future plans in eight priority areas, such as improving financial management systems and implementing the Results Act. OMB also worked with the Department of the Treasury and GAO as part of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board to create a comprehensive set of accounting and cost accounting standards that establish a framework for financial reporting and accountability. In addition, as we reported on March 31, 1998, the federal government prepared consolidated financial statements that have been subjected to an independent audit for the first time in the nation\u2019s history. government\u2019s ability to adequately safeguard assets, ensure proper recording of transactions, and ensure compliance with laws and regulations.

OFPP has also been working to streamline the procurement process, promote efficiency, and encourage a more results-oriented approach to planning and monitoring contracts. OFPP is spearheading a multi-agency effort to revise parts of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. For example, a major revision to Part 15 completed last year will contribute greatly to a more flexible, simplified, and efficient process for selecting contractors in competitively negotiated acquisitions. OFPP also developed best practices guides to help agencies draft statements of work, solicitations, and quality assurance plans, as well as to aid in awarding and administering performance-based service contracts. OFPP issued a best practices guide for multiple award task and delivery order contracting to encourage agencies to take advantage of new authorities under FASA.

OMB has also implemented other policy and guidance changes to support new management decision-making requirements and the Chief Information Officers (CIO)", "Council has adopted the establishment of sound capital planning and investment management practices as one of its strategic goals. The development of the \u201cRaines\u2019 Rules\u201d\u2014requiring agencies to satisfy a set of investment management criteria before funding major systems investments\u2014can potentially serve to further underscore the link between information technology management and spending decisions.

The Committee, in turn, has developed a preliminary plan for addressing various aspects of the problem and taken steps to increase security awareness and improve federal incident-response capabilities. However, much more needs to be done to monitor agency performance in this area and to ensure that the various management, policy, technical, and legal aspects of information security are effectively addressed. Continuing reports of information security problems are disturbing because federal agencies rely on automated systems and related security controls to support virtually all of their critical operations and assets and to ensure the confidentiality of enormous amounts of sensitive data. Our recent audit of the government\u2019s fiscal year 1997 financial statements identified serious information security weaknesses at all 24 CFO agencies.

To date, however, progress has been slow, and agencies\u2019 schedules often leave no room for delay. Many major departments have already missed earlier deadlines.

Concerns have been raised by experts in regulatory issues that federal regulations are not sufficiently focused on the factors that pose the greatest risk and that, as a result, large amounts of money may be spent to accomplish only a slight reduction in risk.

We have pointed to the need to integrate the consideration of the various governmental tools used to achieve federal goals, such as loans, grants, tax expenditures, and regulations. Specifically, we recommended that OMB review tax expenditures with related spending programs during their budget reviews. In addition, our work has provided numerous examples of mission fragmentation and program overlap within federal missions, and we have suggested that OMB take the lead in ensuring that agency Results Act plans address fragmentation concerns. This effort may be hampered if efforts to resolve problems of program overlap and fragmentation involve organizational changes, because OMB lacks a centralized unit charged with raising and assessing government-organization issues. OMB has not had such a focal point since 1982 when it eliminated its Organization and Special Projects Division."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Sustaining Improvements in Federal Management", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman, the record of OMB\u2019s stewardship of management initiatives that we have highlighted today suggests that creating and sustaining attention to management improvement is a key to addressing the federal government\u2019s longstanding problems. In the past, management issues often remained subordinated to budget concerns and timeframes, and the leverage the budget could offer to advance management efforts was not directly used to address management issues. The experiences to-date suggests that certain factors are associated with the successful implementation of management initiatives, regardless of the specific organizational arrangement. and performance measurement issues gained considerable attention in the budget formulation process initially because of the clear commitment of OMB\u2019s leadership. However, top leadership\u2019s focus can change over time, which can undermine the follow-through needed to move an initiative from policy development to successful implementation. Thus, although top leadership\u2019s interest is an important impetus for the initiation of management policies, it alone is not sufficient to sustain these initiatives over time.", "Second, a strong linkage with the budget formulation process can be a key factor in gaining serious attention for management initiatives throughout government. Regardless of the location of the leadership, management initiatives need to be reflected in and supported by the budget and, in fact, no single organizational arrangement by itself guarantees this will happen. Many management policies require budgetary resources for their effective implementation, whether it be financial management reform or information systems investment. Furthermore, initiatives such as the Results Act seek to improve decision-making by explicitly calling for performance plans to be integrated with budget requests. We have found that previous management reforms, such as the Planning-Programming-Budgeting-System and Management By Objectives, suffered when they were not integrated with routine budget presentations and account structures.", "Third, effective collaboration with the agencies\u2014through such approaches as task forces and interagency councils\u2014has emerged as an important central leadership strategy in both developing policies that are sensitive to implementation concerns and gaining consensus and consistent follow-through within the executive branch. In effect, agency collaboration serves to institutionalize many management policies initiated by either Congress or OMB. In our 1989 report on OMB, we found that OMB\u2019s work with interagency councils were successful in fostering communication across the executive branch, building commitment to reform efforts, tapping talents that exist within agencies, keeping management issues in the forefront, and initiating important improvement projects. One example of this collaboration is the continuing success of CFOs and the CFO Council in leading agencies in addressing a wide range of financial and related management issues, such as their work, in concert with OMB, on a strategic plan to upgrade and modernize federal financial management systems.", "Finally, support from the Congress has proven to be critical in sustaining interest in management initiatives over time. Congress has, in effect, served as the institutional champion for many of these initiatives, providing a consistent focus for oversight and reinforcement of important policies. For example, Congress\u2019\u2014and in particular this Subcommittee\u2019s\u2014attention to the Year 2000 problem, information management, and financial management, has served to elevate the problem on the administration\u2019s management agenda.", "Separate from the policy decisions concerning how best to organize and focus attention on governmentwide federal management issues, there are some intermediate steps that OMB could take to clarify its responsibilities and improve federal management. For example, OMB could more clearly describe the management results it is trying to achieve, and how it can be held accountable for these results, in its strategic and annual performance plans. Many of OMB\u2019s strategic and annual goals were not as results-oriented as they could be. Continued improvement in OMB\u2019s plans would provide congressional decisionmakers with better information to use in determining the extent to which OMB is addressing its statutory management and budgetary responsibilities, as well as in assessing OMB\u2019s contributions toward achieving desired results. In our 1995 review of OMB 2000, we recommended that OMB review the impact of its reorganization as part of its planned broader assessment of its role in formulating and implementing management policies for the government. OMB has not formally assessed the effectiveness, for example, of the different approaches taken by its statutory offices to promote the integration of management and budget issues. We believe it is important that OMB understand how the reorganization has affected its capacity to provide sustained management leadership.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our statement.
