Test facilities include acoustic and thermal vacuum chambers. Some simulation chambers are capable of creating a vacuum of less than one billionth of atmospheric pressure. (See fig. I.4.)", "Arc-heated facilities are used for two fundamental purposes: aerothermal testing of materials and structures to simulate the aerodynamic heating environment of hypersonic flight, and aeropropulsion testing of engines that operate at high velocities and temperatures. NASA tests heating of Earth and planetary entry vehicles, and DOD tests heating of ballistic and other types of missiles. The arc heated facility illustrated in figure I.5 is capable of heating gas to more than 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit and directing it under pressure at an object or material to be tested.", "Heat Transfer And Pressure Gauges Electrical Power (-)", "Hypervelocity gas guns are used for impact testing. NASA tests meteoroid/orbital debris-sized particles impacting on space structures such as the international space station. DOD tests ballistic missile intercept systems. In figure I.6, a powder charge drives the piston into trapped hydrogen, compressing it. The petal valve ruptures, forcing the projectile and sabot down the launch tube. The sabot is machined plastic that protects the launch tube from the projectile."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Charter of National Rocket Propulsion Test Alliance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on DOD\u2019s letter dated December 23, 1997."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Refer to the \u201cagency comments and our evaluation\u201d section of the report. 2. We do not indicate that the alliances were not pursuing the intentions of their charters. 3. We did not review the basis of the Air Force\u2019s decision to upgrade some of Phillips Laboratory\u2019s test stands, nor did we evaluate the EELV program. The point of our discussion of EELV engine testing was to establish that the NASA/DOD relationship on rocket engine testing is defined by both competitive and cooperative behavior. We used EELV engine testing to illustrate the competitive aspect of this relationship. The congressional requirement for joint planning of rocket propulsion test facilities establishes the context of our discussion because joint planning is one possible way to manage the NASA/DOD relationship in this area. With respect to DOD\u2019s comment on the rocket propulsion alliance, we did not state that the alliance should have reviewed the decision to upgrade Phillip\u2019s test stands. Our point is that, in the opinion of some alliance members, a test of the alliance\u2019s future relevance is its determination and ability to evaluate investment issues of the type that had been made at Phillips and Stennis Space Center. 4. Determining test capacity of rocket engines was not an objective of our report. We note that when DOD states that \u201cBoth NASA and Air Force officials have challenged the assumption that there is excess rocket test capacity with the two agencies,\u201d it is, in fact, disagreeing with the conclusion of its own May 1996 report on NASA/DOD cooperative initiatives. DOD\u2019s response does not provide specific information as to why NASA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s perception changed from May 1996 to October 1996 when DOD says the rocket propulsion alliance determined that there was no excess test capacity in the alliance for the next 2 years. Subsequent to DOD\u2019s response, we analyzed the minutes of the October 1996 meeting of the rocket propulsion alliance and concluded that these minutes do not clearly reflect that a discussion on test capacity took place or that a determination about capacity was made. 5. We share DOD\u2019s concern about the premature expansion of joint strategic management to other types of test facilities. As we stated in the report, ultimately, if joint strategic management of aeronautics test facilities is successfully established, its adaption to other types of test facilities could be considered."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Denver Field Office", "paragraphs": ["Ambrose McGraw Jeff Webster The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
