However, because its data gathering and reporting processes have been limited, the Army historically has been unable to fully identify how much depotlevel maintenance takes place outside its five public depots. As a result, it has not been able to determine with precision how well it was meeting statutory requirements to limit contracted depot-level maintenance work to 50 percent of the program budget. In the House report on the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Act, Congress directed the Army to report on the proliferation of depot-level maintenance work at nondepot facilities and asked GAO to review that report. GAO examined the extent to which (1) the Army's report identifies the amount of depot-level maintenance work done outside public depots; (2) the Army can account for its depot-level maintenance workload, as required by statute; and (3) the corrective actions in the report are likely to address the proliferation issue and enhance the Army's reporting."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army's proliferation report, issued in September 2003, did not fully identify the extent of depot-level maintenance work performed outside the Army's public depots. The report estimated that the Army underreported its fiscal year 2001 $2.7 billion depot-level maintenance program by $188.6 million but indicated that this was a rough estimate and that further analysis is needed. It attributed this underreporting largely to work performed in two categories--work that met the criteria for depot-level maintenance work but was not reported as such and work at nondepot field facilities that involved depot-level maintenance tasks. GAO's prior reviews also identified these categories as key contributors to underreporting. While the report noted that the Army has an extensive maintenance infrastructure with redundant capabilities, it did not address the extent of this redundancy. The lack of complete information on the extent of depot-level maintenance workloads limits the Army's ability to fully account for this work in the Department of Defense's (DOD) annual report to Congress on the allocation of public- and private-sector depot-level maintenance spending. The 2003 proliferation report identified key Army limitations, including inconsistencies in applying the congressionally mandated definition of \"depot maintenance,\" weaknesses in its management information systems, and the failure to follow established policies and procedures for authorizing depot-level maintenance work at nondepot facilities. GAO's current analysis and prior work confirmed that these limitations make it difficult for the Army to fully account for its maintenance workload as it moves closer to the 50 percent ceiling for work performed by contractors. GAO's most recent report on the Army's 50-50 reporting for fiscal year 2002 showed that, after adjustments for known underreporting, the percentage of private-sector work increased to 49 percent. If implemented, the 29 recommendations in the 2003 report could enhance the Army's ability to report on its 50-50 data and to evaluate the proliferation of depot-level maintenance work at nondepot facilities. The recommendations, which are consistent with those that GAO has previously made, are focused on key problem areas, such as the need for an improved understanding about the 50-50 rule and for compliance with reporting policies and procedures. Efforts have been undertaken to address some of the problem areas. However, the Army has not yet developed an action plan that identifies priorities, time frames, roles and responsibilities, evaluation criteria, and resources for managing the implementation of the recommendations. Until the Army does this, it will be difficult to assess to what extent the Army is likely to meet its desired objectives. While improvements should be accomplished, the complexity and vastness of the Army's maintenance system and continuing questions about such issues as the definition of \"depot maintenance\" and changing maintenance strategies could continue to present challenges in fully recording all maintenance work that should be captured."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year the Department of Defense (DOD) submits a report to Congress  showing that billions of dollars have been spent on depot maintenance and  repairs for Army weapons systems and support equipment. In recent  years, depot-level maintenance and repair work has expanded from the  traditional fixed-location public depots to numerous nondepot repair  facilities in the field. This shifting of depot-level maintenance workload to  field facilities has contributed to uncertainty about the magnitude of  depot-level maintenance capabilities and the distribution of work between  public and private facilities. In October 1999, we reported on the Army\u2019s  first congressionally directed report on the proliferation of depot-level  maintenance activities at nondepot facilities, noting that the Army faced  a number of continuing challenges in attempting to address the  fragmentation of depot-level maintenance work and the proliferation of  depot-level maintenance facilities.

The Army  formally submitted its report in September 2003. The committee\u2019s report  also requested that we provide a review of the Army\u2019s report, including an  assessment of the Army\u2019s ability to comply with 10 U.S.C. 2466, which  governs the distribution of depot-level maintenance funds between public  and private facilities. Our review addresses the extent to which (1) the  Army\u2019s report identifies the amount of depot-level maintenance work  performed outside the public depots, (2) the Army can account for its  depot-level maintenance workload as required by 10 U.S.C. 2466, and  (3) the corrective actions in the Army report are likely to address the  proliferation of depot-level maintenance activities and enhance the  accuracy and completeness of 50-50 reporting.", "To address these objectives, we drew largely from the body of work we  have done in the past on the Army\u2019s depot-level maintenance issues. In  addition, we interviewed officials at Army headquarters, Army major  commands, and maintenance facilities at selected field installations to  gain a better understanding of the implications of the Army report\u2019s  findings and recommendations.

Legislative requirements\uf8e7which play  an important role in managing the allocation of depot-level maintenance  work\uf8e7mandate that DOD provide Congress with annual reports on the  distribution of funding for depot-level maintenance workloads in the  public and private sectors.", "The Army assigns maintenance work to four categories\u2014unit support,  direct support, general support, and depot-level support. Unit and direct  support workloads, which are limited to routine or recurring requirements,  such as oil changes and the removal and replacement of components, are  performed at military units in field locations and funded by direct  appropriations for operations and maintenance.", "General support, which consists of the repair and overhaul of parts and  assemblies and some end items such as trucks, is generally performed at  fixed (nonmobile) industrial facilities located on Army posts, camps, and  stations, and it is funded by direct appropriations for operations and  maintenance. Military personnel, government-employed civilians, or  contractor employees may perform this maintenance.", "Depot-level support, which includes the overhaul; upgrading; and  rebuilding of parts, assemblies, and subassemblies; and testing and  reclamation of equipment, is the most intensive category of maintenance  and requires the highest level of skilled workers and more sophisticated  test and plant equipment. It traditionally has been performed by  (1) government-employed civilians working at government-owned  industrial facilities under the command and control of the Army Materiel  Command (currently five public depots) or (2) contractor personnel  working in contractor owned and operated facilities performing work  specified by Army Materiel Command-managed maintenance contracts.  The Army\u2019s five government-operated maintenance depots are managed  within the Army Working Capital Fund. Contract depot-level maintenance  work is not managed under the working capital fund.", "The Army has two categories of depot-level maintenance activities:    Activities that have been designated and organized by design and  purpose to primarily perform depot-level maintenance and repair tasks.  These activities would include the Army Materiel Command\u2019s public  depots; the Army\u2019s forward deployed maintenance depots; and  contractor depots, primarily located at both the national and  installation levels.", "Activities below the depot level that have been granted approval to  perform specific depot-level tasks through a special or one-time  authorization or that have been designated as a source of repair.  These activities include Army National Guard Readiness Sustainment  Maintenance Sites and Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depots,  Army Reserve Installation Materiel Maintenance Activities, and Army  Forces Command Contract Maintenance Facilities. These activities are  primarily located at the installation level, and the work may be done by  either government or contractor personnel.", "Operations of the Army depots are guided by legislative requirements  that divide the amount of depot work between the public and private  sectors and add specificity to how such work is to be defined. For  example, 10 U.S.C. 2464 provides for a government owned and operated  core logistics capability that is sufficient to ensure an effective and timely  response to a mobilization or other national emergency. Also, 10 U.S.C.  2466 generally prohibits the use of more than 50 percent of the funds made  available in a fiscal year for depot-level maintenance and repair by  nonfederal personnel.", "In addition, 10 U.S.C. 2460 defines depot-level maintenance to encompass  material maintenance or repair requiring the overhaul, upgrading, or  rebuilding of parts, assemblies, or subassemblies and the testing and  reclamation of equipment, regardless of the source of funds for the  maintenance or repair or the location where maintenance or repair work  is performed. Depot-level maintenance also encompasses software  maintenance, interim contractor support, and contractor logistics  support to the extent that work performed in these areas is depot-level  maintenance. The statute excludes from depot-level maintenance the  nuclear refueling of an aircraft carrier, the procurement of major  modifications or upgrades of weapons systems that are designed to  improve program performance, and the procurement of parts for safety  modifications, although the term \u201cdepot maintenance\u201d does cover the  installation of parts for safety modifications. Congress has made changes  to various depot-level maintenance requirements over the years. For  example, the 1998 Defense Authorization Act established a statutory  definition of depot-level maintenance and repair and increased DOD\u2019s  authority to use its depot-level maintenance funds for the private sector\u2019s  performance of the work from 40 to 50 percent.", "On the basis of statutory language defining depot-level maintenance, the  Office of the Secretary of Defense issues annual guidance to the military  departments for reporting their public-private workload allocations. The  military departments also issue internal instructions to manage the data  collection and reporting process tailored to their individual organizations  and operating environments.", "As we have reported in recent years in examining DOD\u2019s compliance with  its so-called \u201c50-50 requirement\u201d under 10 U.S.C. 2466, all of the military  departments have continuing data errors and inconsistencies in reporting  and problems in documenting and independently validating their annual  reports. We also have recognized the limitations of their financial systems,  operations, and controls, as well as their continuing inability to capture  and report the full costs of depot-level maintenance programs. Some of  our most recent reports on depot-level maintenance issues are listed in the  Related GAO Products section of this report.", "We previously reported that the Army had not sufficiently identified the  extent of depot-level maintenance work performed at nondepot facilities  in its April 14, 1999, report to the House Committee on Armed Services on  depot proliferation. While the Army\u2019s report indicated that 40 staff years  of depot-level maintenance work was performed outside of the formal  depot system by nondepot maintenance providers operating under  specialized repair authorities, it also recognized that the figure was likely  understated for a variety of reasons to include limitations in systems and  procedures to fully quantify such work. We agreed. We also noted that in  July 1999 the Army designated its Army Materiel Command as its National  Maintenance Manager with responsibility for overseeing the Army\u2019s  logistics and maintenance support programs and managing maintenance  facilities. In doing so, we noted then that while the Army recognized that it  needed to modify and standardize Army data systems to fully account for  depot-level maintenance work at all locations, it had not established clear  action plans, milestones, and funding requirements for doing so.", "Our September 2003 report on DOD\u2019s compliance with the 50-50  requirement found that the Army\u2019s latest reporting on depot-level  workloads for fiscal years 2001 and 2002 had utilized a new, more  centralized financial system to collect 50-50 data that corrected some of  the transcription errors we had found the previous year but that we  continued to find errors, omissions, and inconsistencies in its data.", "Moreover, we reported that, as in prior years, the Army underreported  public- and private-sector depot-level maintenance work at field locations  as it continues unfinished efforts to consolidate maintenance activities and  better control the proliferation of depot-level tasks at nondepot facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s 2003 Proliferation Report Did Not Fully Identify Depot-Level Maintenance Performed outside Public Depots", "paragraphs": ["Although the mandate directed the Army to identify the proliferation of  depot-level maintenance performed outside the public depots, the Army\u2019s  report on depot-level maintenance proliferation did not fully identify the  extent of depot-level maintenance work performed at nondepot facilities.

As illustrated by table 1,  most of the unidentified amount occurred in field-level facilities that  perform depot-level maintenance tasks. According to the report, two  categories of work accounted for about 75 percent of the $188.6 million.  These were facilities that performed field-level maintenance under the  National Maintenance Program with embedded depot tasks and those  under One-Time Repair authorizations.

For example, in our most recent report, we  identified work categories such as unreported one-time repair actions  and unreported work by commands that did not receive Army reporting  guidance, which contributed to the Army\u2019s inability to fully account for its  depot-level maintenance work in 2002. We noted that, as in past years,  the Army did not fully identify public- and private-sector depot-level  maintenance work at field locations as it continued unfinished efforts to  consolidate maintenance activities and better control the proliferation of  depot-level tasks at nondepot locations. While neither we nor the Army  can precisely identify the amount of depot-level maintenance work being  performed in nondepot maintenance facilities, our prior work and the  Army\u2019s latest report suggest that the $188.6 million estimate should not be  construed as fully representing the amount of depot-level maintenance  work performed at nondepot facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Has an Extensive Maintenance Infrastructure, but Capacity for Depot Maintenance Activities at Nondepot Locations Has Not Been Fully Addressed", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s proliferation report pointed out that the Army\u2019s maintenance  infrastructure has redundant capabilities and capacities that could be  consolidated and streamlined to be more cost-effective.

Moreover, the Army\u2019s full implementation of  its National Maintenance Program\uf8e7another report recommendation\uf8e7is  also intended to address streamlining the Army\u2019s maintenance  infrastructure.", "While we did not attempt to identify the full extent of this maintenance  infrastructure as part of this review, our analysis supports the Army  report\u2019s contention that the Army has extensive nondepot facilities, some  of which have the capability and capacity for depot-level maintenance  tasks and are performing depot-level maintenance work. At the Army sites  we visited, we observed maintenance activities involved with all levels of  maintenance for ground and aviation systems. Similar to the Army\u2019s public  depots, these activities occupied large facilities that included machine  shops, automobile and heavy- equipment repair shops, paint and body  shops, and sandblasting areas.

We noted that a key challenge that the Army faced was  determining and overseeing the amount of depot-level maintenance  capabilities controlled by major commands in the active Army and the  Army National Guard. For various reasons, these commands were  reluctant to reduce their present capability for performing depot-level  maintenance workloads. For example, Reserve and National Guard  Bureau officials said that having local maintenance facilities capable of  performing some depot-level tasks was a readiness issue in that such  facilities allowed their units more rapid turnaround time on equipment  requiring this type of repair.", "In July 2003 we reported that work performed in the Army\u2019s public depots  had declined by 36 percent from fiscal year 1987 through fiscal year 2002,  while the total depot-level maintenance program grew.

Among the host of factors that contributed to this decline were  (1) DOD\u2019s policy for greater reliance on the private sector for depot-level  support of new weapons systems and major upgrades and (2) its increased  reliance on the use of regional repair activities and private-sector  contractors for work that might otherwise be done in the depots. We  noted that neither DOD nor the Army had a comprehensive and current  depot-level maintenance strategic plan, which was an essential aspect of  ensuring future depot efficiency and viability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Army Cannot Provide Congress with a Complete Accounting of Its Depot-Level Maintenance Work", "paragraphs": ["Without complete information on the extent of depot-level maintenance  work performed in nondepot facilities, DOD\u2019s annual report to Congress  cannot fully account for the allocation of depot-level maintenance funds  between the public and private sectors.

For example,  one-time depot repair actions at unit-level facilities went unreported.  Other nondepot work was not reported because some commands did not  receive 50-50 instructions and others misapplied the guidance. Contractors  performed some of this work, and military or civilian government  employees performed some of it.

In addition, the definition is open to  interpretation, and the reporting guidance is not always well defined.", "At most of the commands and installations we visited, maintenance  officials said that, in determining whether a maintenance task is  depot-level maintenance, they follow the guidance found in the  Army\u2019s Maintenance Allocation Charts; technical manuals; and source,  maintainability, and recovery codes for reparable components rather  than apply the congressionally mandated definition. They expressed  concerns that the congressional definition is not always consistent with  this guidance, is too broad, and is subject to too much interpretation over  what maintenance tasks should be counted as depot-level tasks. For  example, officials at the National Guard Bureau said that applying the  definition to repair work performed by direct support and general support  activities caused uncertainty in that the bureau considered most of the  work at these levels to be nondepot-level work and to identify what work  should be considered depot-level work required subjective decisions.  Officials at the Reserve Command said that, while only maintenance  work defined by the Army\u2019s technical manuals as depot-level work  should be reported as such, under the expanded definition of depot-level  maintenance, some work defined as below depot-level could involve  depot-level tasks such as changing and swapping out engines and  transmissions for wheeled vehicles. Officials at the installation  maintenance sites we visited made similar comments.", "In commenting on the proliferation report, the Army Materiel Command  said that the application of the definition of depot-level maintenance  contributed to the report\u2019s findings that depot-level maintenance tasks at  nondepot facilities were being underreported. The command added that  tasks performed by these facilities were not distinguished as depot-level  tasks in the Army guidance but, in the aggregate, these tasks may be  equivalent to depot-level maintenance. Finally, the command said that the  Army could only approximate the extent of work performed at nondepot  facilities because it currently does not have a system to precisely capture  information on maintenance work for DOD\u2019s 50-50 report.", "In prior reports, we have concluded that the Army had not revised its  maintenance policies and technical manuals to reflect the expanded  definition of depot-level maintenance and, as a result, any attempt to  estimate its extent at local facilities would be misleading. We also  recently reported that some Army commands did not receive 50-50  instructions and that others misapplied the guidance. The Army\u2019s 2003  report indicates that the Army will have to make these changes in its  maintenance policies and technical manuals. For example, in recognizing  that the Army had not yet incorporated the expanded definition into its  policies and procedures for 50-50 reporting, the Army\u2019s report suggested  that the Army (1) provide more explicit guidance for 50-50 reporting to  help ensure that its commands better understood reporting requirements  and (2) develop an easy-to-use reference guide to help the commands  better determine what maintenance work should be included in the  50-50 report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s Management Information Systems Are Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["Inadequate Army management information systems are a second key  factor inhibiting the Army\u2019s ability to fully capture depot-level  maintenance work performed in nondepot facilities.

More recently, an official from the Army Materiel  Command said that, for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the Army experienced  a 3 to 5 percent increase in its contract requirements for depot-level  maintenance because increased operational requirements made the public  depots unable to meet the total demand for depot-level maintenance work.  She pointed out that, if this trend were to continue, the Army might have  to seek a waiver from the Secretary of Defense, possibly as early as fiscal  year 2004, to exceed the 50 percent limitation for work performed by the  private sector. Another official at the Army Materiel Command said that  the Army\u2019s depot-level maintenance work in 2004 might increase by about  $2.5 billion because of operational requirements for Army equipment  deployed in the Middle East. He also said that, in an effort to keep up with  maintenance demands, the Army\u2019s five public depots have used extensive  overtime, added second work shifts, hired temporary employees, and  allowed some retirees to return to work.

For example, in  September 2003, we recommended that the 50-50 reporting guidance be  appropriately disseminated to reporting organizations and individuals and  that staff be properly trained in a timely way to apply the guidance. In  October 1999, we recommended that the Army address the following  challenges:  Improving its management information systems. Our  recommendation was that the Army identify requisite action items,  time frames, and funding requirements for improving the Army\u2019s  information management systems to fully identify the magnitude and  cost-effectiveness of depot-level maintenance work at various locations  within the Army.", "Finding opportunities to consolidate maintenance activities. We  recommended that the Army establish (1) clear time frames and action  plans for assessing requirements for the various types of depot-level  maintenance facilities and (2) plans for achieving necessary  consolidations and reductions of excess capabilities.", "Enhancing the National Maintenance Program.

However, the report pointed  out that the Army needed to implement the report\u2019s recommendations  before it can claim with complete confidence that it is meeting the 50-50  requirement. Headquarters officials responsible for the report told us  that the Army maintenance organizations concurred with the report\u2019s  recommendations. The Army has already begun implementing some of its  report\u2019s recommendations such as holding annual workshops and revising  its guidance to include the congressional definition of depot-level  maintenance. However, it has not yet developed an overall action plan for  managing the implementation of all of the recommendations and, in  particular, for setting priorities for the more-critical recommendations.", "As the report indicates, corrective actions are essential to improving  the Army\u2019s ability to better manage the proliferation of maintenance  facilities and capture data for 50-50 reporting. Some of the critical  recommendations, such as the need to identify opportunities for  consolidating depot-level maintenance facilities, set up a single integrated  management information system capable of capturing all depot-level  maintenance data, and develop a National Maintenance Program to better  manage depot-level maintenance work have been in process for several  years. Thus, the identification of specific actions would appear  necessary to help the Army accomplish the implementation of these  recommendations more timely. A plan would include (1) the Army\u2019s  priority for implementing the recommendations, (2) the Army  organizations accountable for implementation, (3) the specific time frames  for accomplishment, (4) whether the benefits of accomplishment support  the cost of implementation, (5) the funding required and the source of  funds, and (6) the criteria to determine the effectiveness of the  recommendations once they are implemented.", "Officials at the Army Communications-Electronics Command said that  streamlining maintenance facilities is a good idea, but they do not have the  tools that would enable the command to fully implement the proliferation  report\u2019s recommendations in this area. They said that updating Army  Regulation 750-1 (Army Materiel Maintenance Policy) and conducting  50-50 workshops were a step in the right direction, but that both actions  need to be more comprehensive in educating field-level personnel  on policy and requirements. For example, they pointed out that just  reiterating the congressional definition of depot-level maintenance  in Army Regulation 750-1 did little to add clarity to the definition.  Additionally, the last two workshops were spent largely on training for the  Depot Maintenance Operations Planning System, a new system to be used  by all Army major commands and acquisition managers to capture and  report annual 50-50 workload data. According to these personnel, this  system appears extremely complex and training should be aimed at those  who are actually responsible for reporting maintenance data. Officials at  the National Guard Bureau generally disagreed that the Army report\u2019s  recommendations will ensure accurate 50-50 reporting\u2014especially in view  of the apparent disconnect between the recommendations and the Army\u2019s  maintenance transformation process, and the Army\u2019s plans for moving to  two-level maintenance.", "Army Communications-Electronics Command officials also suggested  that, for timely and effective implementation, the Army establish a  working group of representatives with subject matter expertise from all  levels within the Army to oversee the implementation.

The magnitude of long-term  improvements likely to be realized remains uncertain, given prior delays in  instituting solutions and the inconsistent understanding and application of  50-50 reporting criteria.", "During our review, we observed that several actions related to the  recommendations had been under way for a number of years but that  completion dates had slipped and funding had become uncertain. For  example, the recommendation that the Army continue efforts to establish  a fully integrated national maintenance requirements determination  process that includes all depot-level maintenance requirements refers to a  program known as the National Maintenance Program. The Army initiated  the program in July 1999 and planned to implement it by fiscal year 2004.  However, full implementation has slipped to fiscal year 2006. Additionally,  required funding to complete the program is uncertain. Army Materiel  Command officials said that the program\u2019s goal is to centrally coordinate  and control depot-level maintenance work by developing standards for  items being repaired at qualified repair sources. They said that (1) the  program is helping to better identify and manage facilities that perform  depot-level maintenance outside the public depots; (2) the number of  maintenance facilities in the program has declined from 60 in fiscal year  2000 to 45 in fiscal year 2003, and these are expected to further decline to  25 in fiscal year 2005 as the Army decides which facilities will be qualified  to perform depot-level maintenance work; and (3) the command was  working with other commands to reduce the number of nondepot  maintenance facilities.", "Full implementation of the National Maintenance Program appears to be  a key initiative in addressing the proliferation of depot-level maintenance  facilities. At the same time, our analysis indicates that, although the  concept of the National Maintenance Program could help improve future  annual reporting and eliminate some of the current fragmented and  duplicative depot-level maintenance workload assignments, it is too early  to assess the program\u2019s full impact. The extent to which the program can  resolve all the problems related to the proliferation and inaccurate and  incomplete identification of depot-level maintenance work performed  in nondepot facilities is unclear. The Army\u2019s 2003 report noted that the  Army\u2019s schedule for completing the implementation of the National  Maintenance Program has slipped to fiscal year 2006. During our review,  we noted that, as of October 2003, the Army had completed standards for  only 737\uf8e7about 18 percent\uf8e7of the 4,148 candidates for the program.", "While an estimated development cost of about $120 million has already  been spent, the Army is a long way from having the required standards that  are needed for the program. An Army Materiel Command official said that  the Army was not planning to provide any additional funding for the  further development of these standards.", "In a prior report, we observed that, while the program is intended to  consolidate and distribute overhaul work for components returned to the  supply system, the evolving management framework will continue to allow  local maintenance facilities to repair items returned directly to using  organizations\u2014maintenance-to-maintenance transactions that could meet  the statutory definition of depot-level maintenance. Additionally, the  program did not include some other depot-level maintenance work. For  example, it does not address the allocation of depot-level maintenance  requirements for overhauling, rebuilding, or upgrading major end items  such as tactical wheeled vehicles that are currently being overhauled in  field-level maintenance facilities or by contracts managed by field-level  organizations even though this work meets the statutory definition of  depot-level maintenance work.", "With regard to resolving deficiencies in management information systems,  it is uncertain when the required changes that will be capable of capturing  and reporting depot-level maintenance workloads performed in nondepot  facilities will be operational. In October 2003, the Army began testing the  transition of its database for Specialized Repair Authority and One-Time  Repair authorizations into an automated system referred to as the Joint  Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistic Support system. The Army\u2019s  2003 report described this as an interim initiative to capture and report on  maintenance work performed under these two types of authorizations.  While this initiative will automate the capturing of this work, it will not  identify all depot-level maintenance work that may be performed in field- level facilities. For example, it will not capture depot-level maintenance  actions performed on equipment that will be returned directly to the user  without going through the Army\u2019s supply system. A single integrated  management information system is hoped for when the Army\u2019s evolving  Logistics Modernization Program is fully implemented. Testing at the first  site, the Tobyhanna Army Depot, is ongoing, but problems have occurred.  Earlier estimates of completion are about 18 to 24 months, but some  delays are expected.
