This report discusses (1) the extent to which federal stakeholders have identified security concerns; (2) how the CSP addresses courthouse security concerns; and (3) what actions federal agencies could take, if any, to improve courthouse security. GAO reviewed agency documents, AOUSC security scores, and interviewed officials from the Marshals Service, FPS, GSA, and AOUSC.

However, only AOUSC develops information that can be used to understand security concerns across the courthouse portfolio. In contrast, the Marshals Service and FPS collect information on security concerns on a building-by-building basis in varied ways, but the manner in which the information is collected prevents it from being used to understand portfolio-wide security concerns. This is inconsistent with GAO's risk management framework. Both agencies are taking steps to improve their information, but it is not clear whether these improvements will provide the portfolio-wide information stakeholders need to make risk-informed decisions.", "The General Services Administration (GSA) has initiated 11 projects at 10 courthouse locations nationwide, as part of its Judiciary Capital Security Program (CSP); two projects have been completed. Local officials said that these projects have already improved or will improve security at the selected courthouses once completed. CSP improvements have been aimed at separating the paths of judges, prisoners, and the public, so that trial participants only meet in the courtroom. Transparency and collaboration issues have emerged among federal stakeholders as the program has been implemented. For example, not all key stakeholders GAO spoke to were clear on the eligibility of specific locations for CSP projects and varied in their views about how collaborative the process to select CSP projects has been. Although stakeholders have taken some steps to improve CSP transparency and collaboration as the program has evolved, some issues remain. Taking additional steps to improve documentation of decision-making and sharing this document with stakeholders could further enhance transparency and collaboration and better assure that all of the agencies and policy makers have the same understanding of how the program is supposed to work, that it is addressing the most urgent courthouse security needs, and that the expertise of all stakeholders is being used to ensure program efficiency.", "GAO found that agencies could take additional actions to enhance security at federal courthouses by addressing a related GAO open recommendation, and establishing a formal mechanism such as a working group or forum to enhance coordination and information sharing. Specifically, in 2011, GAO recommended that the agencies update a 1997 memorandum of agreement to clarify their roles and responsibilities. This action has not been done although FPS has taken some steps to start the process. In addition, GAO found that GSA, AOUSC, the Marshals Service, and FPS had not routinely met to address courthouse security issues at a national level where decision-making authority exists. This lack of a formal meeting mechanism inhibits their ability to communicate regularly about their roles and responsibilities and share information about security concerns.", "This is a public version of a law enforcement sensitive/limited official use report issued in October 2016."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that (1) the Marshals Service and FPS improve the courthouse security information they collect; (2) GSA and AOUSC improve the CSP's transparency and collaboration through better documentation; and (3) GSA establish a working group or other forum to enhance coordination.

AOUSC collects security information in a way that  provides a picture of portfolio-wide concerns and can be used to  comprehensively understand security concerns across the portfolio of  federal courthouses. AOUSC assesses and scores courthouses on the  security features of court operations, in accordance with the U.S. Courts  Design Guide as part of their long-range capital-planning process,  according to AOUSC officials. Through this process, AOUSC develops  security scores for courthouses that range from 0 to 100, with 100 being  an ideal courthouse that meets all assessed security factors, as  determined by the judiciary.

FPS officials recognize the value  of being able to analyze countermeasures across courthouses and other  federal buildings. They said that this information would provide a greater  understanding of which countermeasures were consistently accepted or  rejected, which could help FPS make better recommendations for all  federal buildings, not just courthouses, in its facility security assessments.

FPS officials said that absent the capability to track  countermeasure status in an automated way, obtaining information on  whether countermeasure recommendations are accepted or rejected  across all courthouses (or analyzing it by other variables) would be a  labor-intensive process because relevant data are not easy to retrieve  and would have to be done so manually.

AOUSC officials told us that having three  separate paths of circulation is important so that judges are protected  from being influenced or threatened by parties to court proceedings, their  families, or other members of the public when entering and circulating  through a courthouse. They also told us that criminal defendants pose a  security risk to co-defendants, witnesses, and the general public.

With each round, the  transparency of selection evolved as more criteria were added for  selection and more people were involved in the selection process. More  specifically:", "During the first round of selections, for fiscal year 2012 only,  according to AOUSC officials, AOUSC selected four project locations  using professional judgment informed by the expertise of GSA and the  Marshals Service to get them started quickly because a report and  spending plan on program implementation had to be submitted within  90 days of the enactment of the Consolidated Appropriations Act,  2012. For example, one location was chosen because it had an  existing concept study that could be used as a basis for the project,  and another was prioritized, in part, because of a threat to a judge at  that location, according to AOUSC officials.", "For the second round of project location selections, for projects  funded in fiscal years 2013 through 2017, criteria were developed for  selection following a two-step process. First, the judiciary developed a  preliminary list of project location candidates following a set of \u201cGo/No  Go\u201d factors. For example, only courthouse facilities that were federally  owned and had resident judges were eligible for selection. Second,  AOUSC conducted what it referred to as a \u201cdeep dive analysis\u201d that  involved a number of factors. While this allowed greater insight into  how locations were selected, from our review of AOUSC documents,  we noted that there was still a lack of clarity about how some of these  factors would be measured. For example, one factor was \u201ctype of  caseload and proceedings\u201d meaning that a \u201csignificant\u201d number of  criminal proceedings are conducted in the facility, but it was not clear  how locations were evaluated on these criteria. As a result, for the  CSP projects selected in round two, we were unable to determine how  the criteria were used to prioritize project locations amongst each  other and why certain project locations were ultimately selected over  others because the decisions (such as why some were selected and  others were eliminated from contention) were not documented and it  was not clear how all criteria were defined and applied.", "The process for the third round of potential CSP project location  selections (for projects 2018 and beyond) contained additional  improvements. AOUSC and federal stakeholders added refinements  to the existing two-step process and some additional steps after the  \u201cGo/No Go\u201d factors and \u201cdeep dive analysis\u201d including: (a) a series of  internal judiciary review meetings that further narrowed the list of  candidates based on first-hand knowledge and observations; (b)  meetings between AOUSC, the Marshals Service, and GSA in March  2016 to narrow the remaining potential locations into three tiers based  on security scores as well as other factors; (c) reviews of the  feasibility of a project at the top eight locations, and (d) selecting four  of those locations for consideration. From our review of AOUSC  documents, we noted that this round of project location selections  provided important transparency improvements. For example, during  this round the CSP had a greater emphasis on buildings with poor  security scores\u2014quantitative information that can be objectively  reviewed. In round three, only locations with poor security scores  (below 60) were considered for the program, and the Judiciary\u2019s  Space and Facilities Committee approved four locations for a CSP  study in June 2016 that have security scores less than 30 (only 4 of  the 10 previous locations chosen for CSP projects had security scores  less than 30, see Table 1).", "In addition to transparency improvements related to the selection  process, federal stakeholders have enhanced their collaboration during  CSP project execution. GSA officials said that they were not involved in  developing the scopes of work for the original four projects in fiscal year  2012 and the corresponding cost estimates for them. As a result, the  project concept studies did not consider GSA\u2019s mechanical, engineering,  and plumbing standards, which are considered for concepts in other  capital projects. GSA officials said that this led to inaccurate estimates  and delays in the execution of some 2012 projects. For example, GSA  officials said that during one 2012 funded project, they were not consulted  on the concept and estimate, and that the estimate was under by about  30 percent, which they said is a significant deviation. After AOUSC  conferred with stakeholders on needed improvements in the second  round of CSP project selections (fiscal years 2013\u20132017), GSA officials  said that they began reviewing the cost estimates and providing  comments to AOUSC.

For example, headquarters Marshals Service officials  told us that they requested that one particular federal courthouse be a  part of the CSP, specifically to add certain features to improve  circulation. This courthouse was not included as a potential CSP  project location, and the Marshals Service moved forward with the  design of the project. GSA officials told us that the judiciary developed  a process for identifying CSP projects and subsequent studies  resulted in a priority list of locations, and that this courthouse was not  put forth by the judiciary to be studied.", "During the third round of project selections, that same courthouse was  one of four locations removed by the judiciary during the internal  judiciary meetings due to having Marshals Service-funded projects, or  joint projects, but no Marshals Service officials participated in this  discussion.

However, local judicial, Marshals  Service, and GSA officials told us when we visited that a circulation  project was not planned for the location, and Marshals Service  officials provided a document that showed that the project has not yet  been funded, (project design has been funded). Although the judiciary  removed this courthouse from consideration for a project, Marshals  Service officials maintain that it could have been a CSP project.", "There continues to be a lack of clarity about how key deep-dive  analysis factors were applied during the most recent round of project  selection. For example, one of these factors (as conceptualized in  round three) was the number of criminal defendants the courthouse  processed. But there is no description of what number of defendants  would be too low for a court to be considered further for a CSP  project, and the reasons that some locations were removed for a low  number of criminal defendants, while others with the same number  were put forward, were not clearly documented. For example  according to AOUSC documentation, a certain potential location was  removed as a candidate during the latest round of CSP selections  during internal judiciary meetings because it had zero criminal  defendants.

Marshals  Service officials said that in the first year of project selections (2012),  the corresponding Marshals Service costs were covered, but that  since then, GSA has told them that they would need to provide the  funding.", "Key stakeholders hold varying views about how collaborative the  process to select CSP projects has been. AOUSC officials said they  believe that CSP selection process has been collaborative and that no  project was or is approved for CSP funding without the concurrence of  the Marshals Service and GSA. However, Marshals Service officials  said that they have not found the process of selecting projects to be  collaborative, but rather, from their point of view, the CSP projects are  selected by the judiciary based on its view of security concerns. GSA  officials said that they were not involved in project selection during the  first two rounds of CSP project selection, but that during the third  round of project selections, the process was more collaborative.  Similarly, FPS has generally not been included in the planning or  execution of CSP projects. FPS was only included in CSP planning  and implementation for one of six CSP project locations we visited,  where the local Marshals Service sought FPS\u2019s expertise in  placement of security equipment. At these locations, CSP projects  may alter the perimeter of the building and could affect FPS\u2019s  equipment. For example, local FPS officials in one location we visited  said that they did not know about the impending CSP project until we  notified them of our visit to tour the project site. They said they would  need new security equipment and that they could possibly add their  expertise to other aspects of the project early in the process to avert  unnecessary costs if they were consulted on this CSP project.  AOUSC officials told us that moving forward, FPS will be included in  the CSP.", "As our prior work has shown, the interests of multiple\u2014and often  competing\u2014stakeholders may not align with the most efficient use of  government resources and can complicate decision making. Better  transparency about how projects are selected, could help to ensure that  the CSP is not subjected to competing stakeholder interests.  Furthermore, as we have also reported, effective collaboration can help  maximize performance and results, particularly for issues that cut across  more than one agency, as is the case with courthouse security. CSP  projects involve multiple stakeholders, and projects have multiple phases,  so it can be difficult to ensure that all stakeholders fully understand all  program procedures and are involved at the right time and to the right  degree throughout the life of the project. An internal control for efficient  and effective operations is to ensure that all transactions and other  significant events are clearly documented in a manner that allows the  documentation to be readily available for examination. With clearer  documentation of the process shared with all stakeholders, transparency  and collaboration could also be enhanced in the CSP. By developing  approaches to provide stakeholders information that clearly describes  how all selection criteria are to be applied, how to put forth a location for  consideration, what specific costs are eligible for funding within a project,  how collaboration is to occur during project selection and execution, and  when and how to include all relevant agencies in each phase of the  project, stakeholders could be better assured that they all have the same  understanding of how the program is supposed to work, that the program  is addressing the most urgent needs and that the expertise of all  government stakeholders is being used to help ensure that the program is  as efficient as possible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Can Take Additional Actions to Address Previous Issues and Improve Coordination and Information Sharing", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Previously Identified Issues Continue to Impair a Comprehensive Approach to Courthouse Security", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on coordination issues facing the security of  courthouses.

At that time,  we recommended that FPS and the Marshals Service, in conjunction with  the judiciary and GSA, jointly lead an effort to update a 1997 MOA that  outlines stakeholders\u2019 roles and responsibilities. Implementation of this  recommendation was key to addressing the issues in our view. Since  then, FPS officials said that they took the initiative on updating the MOA,  working with each party individually and sharing iterative updates based  on comments. FPS officials said that they took the lead in this effort  because they wanted to address the recommendation and no other  agency was moving forward with it. However, despite these efforts, nearly  5 years after the recommendation, the updated MOA still has not been  signed. FPS officials told us that the MOA had been set aside at different  times since the recommendation was made, in part, due to staff turnover  at each agency that in some instances resulted in major revisions to the  draft that necessitated additional vetting.

We found the same type  of situation in another location and officials were unsure how that  arrangement came to be. In addition, headquarters Marshals Service  officials told us that overall there is fragmentation between FPS and the  Marshals Service in ensuring that security equipment is operational. In  one location FPS local officials also said that duplicative security efforts\u2014  such as when both the Marshals Service and have FPS have equipment  in the same building or part of the building\u2014can create confusion.", "We found that the level of coordination can be site-specific and  personality-driven which can make executing roles and responsibilities  difficult. For example, one local FPS official told us that FPS has a very  strong relationship with the local Marshals Service officials and judges  and are always included in court security meetings. However, at another  courthouse, an FPS inspector did not complete all sections in the 2014  facility security assessment, noting that an individual with the Marshals  Service would not answer all FPS questions during the interview and that  FPS could not be sure that all security equipment was working because  that individual would not permit the FPS inspector to conduct testing. FPS  and the Marshals Service both have new staff in those roles and officials  see the relationship improving; however, another facility security  assessment will not be completed until 2017.", "Some local Marshals Service officials said that in certain locations, it is  difficult and time consuming for FPS to execute their role of repairing  equipment. For example, local Marshals Service officials at one location  we visited told us about a recent problem they encountered regarding  malfunctioning equipment at another location they serve. Initially, the  Marshals Service security contractor assessed that it needed a small,  inexpensive part, but the contractor could not fix it because the equipment  was owned by FPS.

Further, information that  agencies already collect is not readily shared with the other agencies. For  example, AOUSC officials said that they have had difficulty getting facility  security assessments from FPS and have been told by some FPS  inspectors that AOUSC officials are not entitled to receive a copy of the  assessment, as they are not tenants in the building. Further, FPS officials  said that if AOUSC and the Marshals Service shared the information they  collect on security concerns with FPS, they could coordinate more with  those agencies, but FPS does not routinely have access to information  collected by these agencies.", "Without sharing existing information on security concerns, federal  stakeholders do not have complete information to help them look for  strategic ways to achieve efficiencies and to address the risks to federal  courthouses more comprehensively. Further, if the agencies worked  together to gather and understand all of the available security information,  they could better understand what information is not collected at a  portfolio level, and work on a coordinated strategy to obtain needed  information efficiently. GSA officials told us that if more comprehensive  information was available and shared regarding deficiencies in  courthouses, federal agencies could develop joint acquisition strategies to  address widespread deficiencies more efficiently. For example, if FPS  develops the capability to track the status of countermeasure  recommendations across courthouses in an automated way, as  discussed earlier, and the results show that a particular countermeasure  is recommended often, but rarely accepted because is it cost-prohibitive,  federal agencies could leverage the buying power of the federal  government to drive down the cost of the countermeasure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accountability for Security at Individual Courthouses", "paragraphs": ["Of the eight locations we visited, three did not have an active facility  security committee even though they have other federal tenants in the  building.

The  federal government has prioritized the protection of federal facilities  through directives to address the changing nature of threats to federal  facilities, including federal courthouses. Through these documents, the  federal government has consistently presented a common vision for  critical infrastructure protection: agencies involved in the security of  federal facilities should work together cooperatively to provide security to  our critical infrastructures in an efficient manner that maximizes the  federal government\u2019s limited resources, for example:", "The National Infrastructure Protection Plan notes the importance of  obtaining a shared vision with stakeholders with similar missions,  saying that \u201cfor the critical infrastructure community, leadership  involvement, open communication, and trusted relationships are  essential elements to partnership.\u201d", "The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical  Infrastructures and Key Assets states that protecting our critical  infrastructures and key assets calls for a transition to a national  cooperative approach across federal agencies.", "However, the continuing issues related to cooperation that continue to  hinder effective courthouse security\u2014in the areas of executing roles and  responsibilities, collecting and sharing information on security concerns,  and accountability for participating in coordination mechanisms like  security committee meetings\u2014illustrate that more could be done to align  with the priorities that the federal government has established in these  documents. Also, the delays in updating the MOA further illustrate that the  cooperative approach described in the National Strategy has not been  fully developed. Without a more cooperative approach to securing  courthouses, such as through a working group or similar forum,  challenges across the portfolio of federal courthouses will likely persist.  The physical security of government assets is one of the most challenging  aspects of real property management. In fact, one of the reasons that  managing federal property is an area that we have designated as high  risk is due to the challenges involved with protecting federal facilities.  Under the Homeland Security Act of 2002, except for law enforcement  and security related functions transferred to DHS, GSA has the  responsibility to protect buildings it holds or leases.

Addressing courthouse security concerns begins with good information  regarding the risks to each courthouse, but the federal government does  not have this comprehensive information. The only portfolio-wide  information that the federal government has is collected by AOUSC;  however, these scores are only part of the story because comprehensive  information related to security concerns identified by the Marshals Service  and FPS is not currently used portfolio-wide. While both agencies have  plans to enhance their processes, it is unclear whether these  improvements will lead to the ability to assess security concerns across  the portfolio of courthouses. With better portfolio-wide information from  the Marshals Service and FPS, decision makers can be better equipped  to make risk-informed decisions.", "Addressing courthouse security concerns can be a costly undertaking,  especially in older courthouses that were not designed for modern day  security threats, particularly with regard to meeting current standards that  call for the separate circulation of judges, prisoners, and the public. The  CSP was designed to be a less costly alternative to building new federal  courthouses and provides a way to add key security features. Since 2012,  the CSP has demonstrated the potential to address security problems for  less than the cost of a new courthouse. Transparency and collaboration  have improved, showing that the CSP is generally moving in the right  direction, but some concerns remain. Stakeholders do not have the same  understanding about how the CSP program works at key stages,  including project selection, and on how collaboration will occur.", "While the CSP has the potential to address security concerns at  courthouses that are selected for the program, issues persist related to  cooperation and information sharing that we have found in the past.  Creating greater cooperation\u2014as the National Strategy suggests\u2014to  address courthouse security concerns can help GSA, AOUSC, the  Marshals Service, and FPS to systemically identify risks, the resources  needed to address those risks, and investment priorities when managing  security at these facilities. This effort would involve all relevant  stakeholders working together, having quality information to work with,  and using it to manage risk and find efficiencies in their efforts.

We limited our scope to information collected by these federal  stakeholders, and we did not independently determine what constitutes a  physical security concern.

We analyzed  AOUSC\u2019s March 2016 security scores, but we did not analyze the scores  of non-resident courthouses and bankruptcy-only courthouses due to  differences in security requirements of the different court operations and  facilities, differences that limit the comparability of security scores, leaving  267 courthouses for our analysis. We believe that AOUSC\u2019s security  scores, developed as part of the judiciary\u2019s long-range capital-planning  process, are sufficiently reliable for our purposes based on answers that  AOUSC provided to our questions on data reliability.
