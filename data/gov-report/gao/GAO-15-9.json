GAO obtained usage data from agencies and OPM's annual reports. For this study, GAO selected 10 agencies (National Science Foundation, Railroad Retirement Board, Social Security Administration, and the Departments of Commerce, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Labor, Treasury, Transportation, and Veterans Affairs) representing 47 percent of BU employees covered by OPM's report. GAO's selection was based on factors such as agency size, number of BU employees, and official time rate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The ten agencies GAO reviewed reported using 2.5 million official time hours in fiscal year 2013 compared to about 2 million hours in fiscal year 2006. Although the total number of hours charged increased by 25 percent, 7 of the 10 selected agencies reported lower official time rates in fiscal year 2013 as compared to fiscal year 2006. Three agencies reported increased official time rates over the same period. Official time rates indicate the number of official time hours expended per bargaining unit (BU) employee and allow for meaningful comparisons over time. Declines in official time rates per BU employee ranged from about 30 minutes or less at several agencies to 2-1/2 fewer hours per BU employee at one agency. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) attributed changes in the number of hours, in part, to changes in the number of BU employees and the amount of collective bargaining negotiations. In total for fiscal year 2013, the 10 selected agencies reported that less than 2 percent of employees charged official time. During the same year, eight of the 10 agencies reported having employees who charged 100 percent of their duty time to official time; a total of 386 employees combined. Two agencies reported having no employees who charged 100 percent official time in fiscal year 2013.", "OPM has historically estimated annual official time costs by using a simple computation\u2014multiplying each agency's average salary as reported in its Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) database for BU employees covered by official time activities by the agency's total reported official time hours. GAO computed its own cost estimate using an alternative methodology that used actual salary data of BU employees who in fact charged official time and multiplied this amount by the agency total reported official time hours used for each individual. GAO computed a cost estimate for the 6 of our 10 selected agencies that report through EHRI. GAO found that its cost estimate for these 6 agencies yielded an estimate that was about $5 million more than the estimate using OPM's methodology ($61 million versus $56 million, or a difference of about 9 percent). Further, cost estimates using GAO's methodology at 4 of the 6 agencies were higher by 15 percent or more than the estimates using OPM's methodology. A government-wide cost estimate could be higher or lower if this methodology was applied to all agencies. OPM said reporting on official time is not a priority at this time and they have used the same methodology for preparing its cost estimate since fiscal year 2002. Use of other methodologies may result in a more representative estimate of actual cost.", "OPM issues reports on official time to assist agencies with ensuring accountability in labor-management relations. It reports on official time usage government-wide. OPM asks agencies to verify data that OPM obtains through its EHRI database. According to OPM, at least half of the about 50 agencies that report official time data through EHRI report differences with the EHRI data and provide revised official time data to OPM. While OPM reports the corrected data, it does not follow-up with agencies to determine the source of data differences. Its guidelines state the importance of pursuing high quality data, reliable data on program costs. By not following up with agencies on data differences, OPM may be missing an opportunity to improve data quality on agency reporting through EHRI and enable a less labor intensive and more efficient process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that OPM (1) consider other approaches to developing its cost estimate and (2) work with agencies to identify opportunities to increase efficiency of data collection and reporting through EHRI.

According to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),  federal unions, because their memberships are entirely voluntary for  federal employees, rely on the volunteer work of bargaining unit (BU)  employees, rather than paid union business agents to represent  employees on matters such as collective bargaining and grievances. The  statute allows for the use of official time for union representational  activities in the federal government. Official time is time spent by federal  employees performing representational work for a BU in lieu of their  regularly assigned work. Employees on official time are treated as if they  are in a duty status when they are engaging in representational activities  and are paid accordingly. Union representational activities generally  include (1) term bargaining for a collective bargaining agreement (CBA);  (2) mid-term bargaining over changes in working conditions during the  term of an existing CBA; (3) filing and processing of grievances against  management; and (4) discussions between management and employees  concerning grievances, among other things.", "Agencies have been managing the use of official time since the late  1970s. OPM\u2019s most recent reporting on official time covers fiscal year  2012 and shows that unions at 62 agencies represented more than 1.2  million employees and that certain BU employees spent over 3.4 million  hours performing representational activities on official time.estimated the total payroll costs (salary and benefits for all BU  employees) for fiscal year 2012 official time hours at just over $156  million. According to OPM, in fiscal year 2012 this represented one-tenth  of 1 percent of the total cost of salary and benefits for all federal  employees. In addition to official time, unions may also negotiate to  receive other support from agencies, such as office space, supplies,  equipment, and some travel expenses. In reporting on the use of official  time within federal agencies, OPM noted that agency management and  labor share responsibility to ensure official time is authorized and used  appropriately. While not addressed in OPM\u2019s 2012 reporting, OPM\u2019s 2011  report on official time stated that the increased amount of official time  used by agencies can depend on a number of factors, such as the timing  of term negotiations, number of grievances, and involvement of unions in  labor management decisions.", "Reflecting longstanding congressional interest since the enactment of the  Statute, we reported in 1979 on how agencies accounted for and  monitored the amount of official time employees spent on  representational activities.

We reviewed  relevant agency documentation, interviewed agency officials charged with  administering agency official time processes, and reviewed  documentation to better understand the data systems each agency used  to collect and report such data as well as the quality of data entered into  their systems. We began our analyses with fiscal year 2006 because that  was the first year in which OPM consistently reported all data elements  for each of our 10 selected agencies. These include: (1) total official time  hours; (2) count of BU employees; (3) rate of official time; (4) official time  hours by four categories, including term negotiations, mid-term  negotiations, dispute resolution, and general labor-management relations;  (5) reported salary costs; and (6) total costs.

We assessed the reliability of EHRI data through electronic  testing to identify missing data. We also interviewed OPM officials  knowledgeable about the EHRI data to discuss the data\u2019s accuracy and  steps OPM takes to ensure reliability.

Official time for, both, collective bargaining and Federal Labor  Relations Authority (FLRA)-related activities, such as negotiations,  attendance at impasse proceedings, and participation in proceedings  before the FLRA, is provided as a statutory right. Official time for other  purposes must be negotiated between the agency and the union in an  agreed-upon amount deemed reasonable, necessary, and in the public  interest. However, activities that relate to internal union business, such  as the solicitation of members or the election of union officials, must be  performed when in a non-duty status; that is, not on official time.", "In a 1979 report, we recommended that OPM (1) clarify its recordkeeping  requirements then in effect for capturing time spent on representational  activities, and (2) direct agencies to comply with those requirements.  Following our report, in 1981, OPM issued Federal Personnel Manual  Letter 711-161. The letter stated that, no later than January 1, 1982,  federal agencies activate a recordkeeping system to capture official time  charges to representational activities. But the letter did not require  agencies to report the yearly time charges to OPM, as we had  recommended. As a result, OPM never consolidated the amount of time  charged government-wide to union activities and has no information on  agencies\u2019 compliance with the recordkeeping requirement. When the  Federal Personnel Manual was abolished in 1994, all recordkeeping  requirements regarding time spent on union activities were rescinded.", "In a 1997 report accompanying an appropriations bill, the House  Appropriations Committee requested that OPM provide a one-time report  on the total hours of official time spent on representational activities,  number of employees who used official time, and related costs (salary,  office space, equipment, and telephone) covering the first 6 months of  calendar year 1998. In response, OPM reported that a total of 23,965  federal employees used approximately 2.2 million hours during the 6- month sample period. OPM estimated the cost of this time at about $48  million. OPM also reported that 946 of these employees (or 4 percent)  worked 100 percent of the time in a representational capacity.

The remaining three  agencies\u2014including DHS, DOT, and SSA\u2014reported increased official  time rates.

In fiscal year 2013, the 10  selected agencies in our review reported that BU employees charged a  total of 2,485,717 hours to official time, an increase of 25 percent  compared to the 1,991,089 hours these agencies reported for fiscal year  2006. We found that half of the agencies reported using more official time  hours in fiscal year 2013 than in fiscal year 2006 (see figure 1 for the  interactive graphic, which represents each individual agency\u2019s official time  rate and hours reported for fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2013).", "OPM and agencies attributed changes in usage to several reasons.  According to OPM, factors that have contributed to the changes in official  time use in previous years include: an emphasis by agencies on accurately documenting official time  changes in the number of BU employees;  changes in the amount of mid-term and term collective bargaining;  variation in the use of labor-management forums; and  hours.", "A number of agencies cited similar factors. For example, RRB attributed  changes in usage to the age of its CBA with the American Federation of  Government Employees labor union, which is almost 30 years old. Thus,  the agency has not had any nationwide negotiations during the time  period which might have required a large number of official time hours.  NSF reported a lower number of charged official time hours in mid-term  negotiations (284 to 110), dispute resolution (203 to 93), and general  labor-management relations (978 to 691). NSF officials informed us that  their official time tally of hours was incomplete for fiscal years 2012 and  2013 because the agency transitioned to a different time and attendance  system, which we will explain more fully later in this report.", "Other agencies cited factors such as increases in the amount of  negotiations or general labor-management relations areas impacting  changes in use of official time. For example, DOT officials pointed out that  the increase in official time charges per BU employee was spent  improving labor management relations and internal business processes,  and not litigating disputes. They noted that the agency\u2019s spike in official  time rate between fiscal years 2006 and 2007 may be related to possible  underreporting in fiscal year 2006. This made a subsequent return to  better accuracy appear to be a sharp increase in fiscal year 2007. Most of  DOT\u2019s increased reporting of official time was also in the general labor- management relations category. The agency reported 66,736 hours in  fiscal year 2006 compared to 230,080 hours reported in that category for  fiscal year 2013. According to DOT, the agency\u2019s increase since fiscal  year 2006 in the use of official time in the general labor-management  relations category resulted in turn from increased collaboration between  the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its unions, primarily the  National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA). NATCA is FAA\u2019s  largest BU and accounts for the majority of official time used by FAA\u2019s  union representatives. In 2009, FAA and NATCA renegotiated their 2006  CBA.", "DHS, with the highest percentage increase of official time hours charged,  also had the biggest percentage increase of BU employees. DHS  reported its largest increases in official time hours in the general labor- management relations category, from 25,785 hours in fiscal year 2006 to  185,509 hours in fiscal year 2013, and also in the mid-term negotiations  category, from 3,416 to 11,045. According to DHS, several factors  contributed to the agency\u2019s increased use of official time hours during the  period. For the first time, the recognition of a BU within the Transportation  Security Administration increased the overall DHS number of BU  employees by more than 40,000 from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2012.  In addition, DHS officials said that the establishment of labor- management forums contributed to official time usage fluctuations during  the period. Agency officials explained that as more forums were  established and became more active, the hours expended grew. DHS  also cited budget reductions, sequestration, and furloughs as factors that  led to increases in the general labor-management relations hours  reported, as briefings and meetings with the unions were necessary to  keep them informed of how DHS components would address shortfalls,  avoid or mitigate planned furloughs, and contingency plans for the  potential lapse of future appropriations. In addition, DHS explained that  there was also a corresponding increase in mid-term bargaining hours  reported as unions exercised their right to negotiate based on the notices  they received regarding these matters.", "Agency officials told us of instances where agencies may have  underreported the number of official time hours. Several agencies  explained particular internal circumstances that impacted agencies\u2019 ability  to accurately record the number of official time hours charged. For  example, NSF officials told us that the agency transferred its official time  reporting to a different time and attendance system during the middle of  fiscal year 2012. Because of the transition, it did not capture all official  time charges for parts of fiscal year 2012 and fiscal year 2013. NSF does  not have a mechanism to retroactively collect incomplete official time data  for these years. A Commerce official told us that one of its components  does not report official time using the same transactional codes as other  components use. As a result, the component had more than 24,000 hours  of official time for fiscal year 2013 that was not accounted for in EHRI.  According to the official, Commerce is negotiating a change in the CBAs  with the three affected unions to report official time using the same  transactional codes that the other components use. In addition, a recent  GAO report found that official time activities at VA were recorded as  administrative leave because the agency\u2019s current time and attendance  system does not have a code to capture official time separately. VA  officials told us that the agency is implementing a new time and  attendance system, the Veterans Affairs Time and Attendance System  (VATAS), which will capture official time usage. According to a VA official,  the agency has not collected official time data through VATAS because of  system issues they are addressing. The officials said VA does not have a  time frame for when VATAS will be in use department-wide.", "In addition, we found that some agencies, such as DHS, SSA, and  Commerce, vary in how they report hours charged to labor management  forum meetings conducted under Executive Order 13522. Executive  Order 13522 was designed to establish a cooperative and productive  form of labor-management relations but does not specify how agencies  should treat labor management forum meetings for time and attendance  purposes. Some agencies consider this time as official time and others as  duty time. For example, DHS reported that it advises its components that  time used in relationship to these meetings is to be included as official  time under the general labor management category. On the other hand,  we were told by an SSA official that SSA considers time spent on labor  management forum meetings as duty time. Commerce reported that time  spent at labor management forum meetings, depending on the particular  agency component, is sometimes charged to official time and other times  charged as regular duty time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Reported Relatively Small Numbers of Employees Charged Official Time in Fiscal Year 2013", "paragraphs": ["In total for fiscal year 2013, the 10 selected agencies reported that less  than 2 percent of BU employees from the 10 agencies charged official  time hours.

Similar to agency approaches for managing official time, agency  internal controls practices for monitoring official time varied at the eight  agencies because they are negotiated at the exclusive level of  recognition, such as components, bureaus, operating administrations,  and facilities. As shown in table 9, agency practices may include: (1)  comparing authorized versus actual individuals charging official time; (2)  comparing requests for official time versus actual official time used; (3)  verifying that actual official time use does not exceed authorized amounts  through internal reports used by agency management to monitor usage;  and (4) verifying accuracy of official time usage by sharing internal reports  with authorized individuals, such as union representatives. DHS and VA  reported that they do not use any additional practices besides the  monitoring performed by the immediate supervisor.", "Of the four practices, agencies we reviewed most often used the list of  authorized union representatives to compare it against those who  charged official time. For example, DOT, HHS, NSF, and Treasury  reported that they provide a list of authorized official time users to  supervisors who are responsible for ensuring that their employees are  authorized to charge official time prior to approving timesheets. SSA\u2019s  internal official time tracking system has built-in capabilities that would  only allow authorized union representatives to request official time and  enter the actual amount used. Commerce partially addressed this practice  because only some of its bureaus reported that they used the list to  cross-verify. For example, Census reported that officials pull reports each  pay period to verify whether an employee should have charged the official  time category while the National Institute of Science and Technology\u2019s  Labor Relations Manager spot checks time and attendance records of  union representatives, using the most recent list of authorized employees  on file with the agency.", "Internal reports used to verify that authorized individuals did not exceed  their authorized amounts were the second most-often-used practice  reported by agencies to monitor official time use. For example, NSF used  internal reports to ensure that the total amount of official time hours was  appropriately credited towards the bank as outlined in its CBA. SSA used  internal reports generated from its official time tracking system, which was  programmed to ensure that the time requested by union representatives  and approved by immediate supervisors matches the actual time used. In  addition, the system does not allow users to exceed their authorized  amounts of official time as negotiated in the CBAs. Commerce and DOT  used this practice as well but not all of their bureaus or operating  administrations reported that they used internal reports for cross- verification. For example, one of Commerce\u2019s bureaus, the United States  Patent and Trademark Office, reported that it periodically runs internal  reports on usage and tracks overall use through the official time  categories. Unions that have an allotted bank of hours typically authorize  who can use official time and the amount. According to DOT, only one of  its operating administrations reported using internal reports to verify that  authorized individuals did not exceed their authorized amounts because  official time is drawn from a bank of hours. DOT reported that internal  reports were unnecessary for other operating administrations that use the  reasonable time approach. Regardless of the approaches used, having  internal reports would enable agencies to gauge overall usage, ensure  that individuals did not exceed what they were authorized to use, and  provide reasonable assurance that use of official time is as intended.", "OPM is a member of a forum of agencies that exchange information on  issues related to labor management relations.

Similar benefits were also cited in our September 1997  report, which surveyed 30 federal agencies on how resources were used  for employee union activities. First, according to both management and  union officials, official time has helped improve labor-management  relations between management and unions because they work jointly to  develop solutions or improvements to address workplace challenges. For  example, some of the Treasury union officials we met with said that  management involved their unions early on in the process when making  suggestions to streamline or fine tune workplace processes, such as  installing a new performance management system and updating existing  procedures. In addition, they also told us that official time has helped to  create an environment where the workforce can be more engaged and  have their voices heard. Treasury officials told us that official time  improves the agency\u2019s efficiency and accomplishment of the mission  because union officials communicate goals to the organization. SSA  management officials told us that allowing official time provides a stable  work environment for SSA employees while SSA union officials said that  official time has played a critical role in improving SSA as a workplace.  For example, they explained that SSA unions were able to negotiate  \u201cflexi-place\u201d arrangements with agency management using official time to  allow employees to work from home. VA union officials told us that official  time has allowed them to help agency management establish workforce  policies related to telework.", "Second, according to both management and union officials, the use of  official time by union representatives to address issues, such as potential  unfair labor practices, equal employment opportunity complaints, and  grievances with employees, has led to agency cost savings. For example,  management and union officials at Treasury and VA told us that having  official time has resulted in fewer unfair labor practices and grievances  filed by employees because they are usually resolved at the lowest level  of management. Specifically, VA union officials told us that a VA union  conducted a study of its 22 local chapters and found reductions in  grievances and unfair labor practices because of official time. In addition,  VA management officials said that having on-site union representation  and support helps lessen and resolve disputes more quickly, thereby  assisting the department in moving forward with its mission.

OPM has produced  reports on agencies\u2019 use of official time and estimated government-wide  costs on its own initiative for most years since 2002 while emphasizing  that agency labor and management are both accountable for ensuring  official time is used appropriately. There has been longstanding  congressional interest in official time usage as well as some concern  about the amount, type, accuracy, and timeliness of information available  to help ensure an appropriate level of congressional oversight. The scope  and level of official time use reinforces the need for oversight and  accountability with more than 1.2 million BU employees eligible to use  official time and over 3.4 million hours charged for representational  activities in fiscal year 2012, the latest year for which OPM has reported  this information.", "Within this overall context, it is important that sufficient controls,  processes, and guidance are in place for reporting and monitoring to  provide reasonable assurance that official time  is used as intended;  is consistent with the statute and applicable agency policies and  procedures; enables congressional oversight; informs management and labor decision making; and provides public transparency.", "OPM has historically estimated official time costs using a methodology  that uses the average salary of all employees in a BU. An alternative  methodology using actual salary data of BU employees who charged  official time would yield a different estimate than OPM\u2019s methodology.  The use of alternative cost estimation methodologies may result in a more  representative estimate of actual costs. Since OPM recognizes  weaknesses in data collected through its EHRI database, OPM must  expend additional resources to validate official time data. OPM reports  that on any given year, about half of about 50 agencies reporting change  their submissions during the validation process. OPM\u2019s attempt to  improve the reliability of official time data by having agencies validate  their data is noteworthy but labor intensive and time consuming. By not  following up with agencies on data differences, OPM may be missing an  opportunity to improve data quality on agency reporting through EHRI and  enable a less labor intensive and more efficient process.

We do not generalize the results of our analysis to  agencies outside of this review.", "We performed a content analysis of 173 CBAs covering active BUs at the  10 selected agencies to create a unique database of official time  provisions. To ensure that we received the appropriate CBAs for all active  BUs, we cross-verified them using information, such as bargaining unit  status (BUS) codes, from OPM\u2019s FLIS and a list of active BUs provided  by OPM. We also followed up with all of our selected agencies to verify  that we correctly matched their CBAs to active BUs using the BUS codes.  In addition, to ensure consistency and accuracy of our analysis of various  agency approaches, analysts independently analyzed CBAs and then  compared their results through a double blind review for all 173 CBAs. In  cases where there were discrepancies, analysts reconciled their  differences for a final determination of an agency\u2019s approach used to  manage official time.", "To describe reported benefits of official time, we interviewed agency  management and union officials from 3 of our 10 selected agencies,  including SSA, Treasury, and VA, to obtain their viewpoints.agencies reflected a large proportion of BU employees and also utilized  different approaches for capturing and reporting official time. Because  they are not tangible, we could not independently verify benefits cited by  agency management and union officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2013 to October 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Official Time Hours and Rates Reported by 10 Selected Agencies for Fiscal Years 2006 Through 2013", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: OPM Reporting on Official Time, Fiscal Years 2002 - 2012", "paragraphs": ["OPM reported an overall decrease in government-wide official time hours  between fiscal years 2002 and 2012 with a slight rise between fiscal  years 2006 and 2012 (see figure 12).
