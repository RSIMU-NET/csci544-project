To research payment allocation problems, DFAS Columbus reported that it incurred costs of about $34 million in fiscal year 2002. This represents about 35 percent of the total $97 million that DFAS Columbus spent on contract pay services. DFAS Columbus bills DOD activities for contract pay services based on the number of accounting lines on an invoice. Consequently, all DOD activities pay the same line rate, regardless of whether substantial work is needed to reconcile problem contracts and adjust payment records. GAO's analysis of two contracts showed that the contracts were complex because of the (1) legal and DOD requirements to track and report on the funds used to finance the contracts, (2) substantial number of modifications made on the contracts to procure goods and/or services, and (3) different pricing provisions on the contracts. GAO's review of $160 million of adjustments showed that the adjustments were made for four reasons. The Army made an error in accounting for obligations, resulting in about $127 million in payment allocation adjustments. DFAS Columbus did not follow its internal procedures for allocating payments to accounts on an Army contract containing multiple pricing provisions, resulting in about $5 million in adjustments. DFAS made over $2 million in adjustments to correct recording errors on an Army contract due to complex and changing payment instructions. The Air Force frequently changed payment instructions after payments were made on an Air Force contract, resulting in about $26 million in adjustments. DOD has initiated a major long-term effort to improve its business operations, including its acquisition and disbursement activities. If implemented successfully, this initiative may help correct many of the contract payment allocation problems. In the interim, DOD has initiatives under way to address payment allocation problems, including (1) billing DOD contracting offices for contract reconciliation services, (2) providing DOD activities information on the correct method for presenting payment instructions, and (3) establishing a working group to develop options for presenting standard contract payment instructions.

These errors occurred because the  examiners did not follow the complex, frequently changed, and  nonstandard payment instructions correctly.

DFAS Columbus officials recognized this  shortcoming in establishing their billing rates and have informed us that  they plan to use a separate billing rate, based on DFAS contract  reconciliation costs, to bill customers for reconciling, adjusting, and  correcting contract payments beginning in fiscal year 2004.  According to  the officials, the direct billing hour rate for reconciliation services will be  $74.55 in fiscal year 2004 and will be billed to the contracting offices  responsible for writing the contracts that require reconciliation.  According  to the Deputy Director of DFAS Columbus\u2019s Commercial Pay Services,  separately billing contracting offices for the reconciliation work should  provide an incentive to those offices to reduce the number of payment  allocation problems that result in adjustments.

The working group\u2019s results were incorporated into  a broader DOD initiative to identify needed improvements and reductions  to procurement policies, procedures, and processes in DFARS.  The  working group completed the first phase of its work by researching the  types of payment instructions that have caused payment allocation  problems and developing proposed changes to DFARS.  The working group  concluded that payment allocation errors at DFAS Columbus (1) were  often the result of problems experienced with confusing payment  instructions and (2) were further compounded because DOD did not have  payment allocation options for including standard contract payment  instructions for use on DOD contracts.  As illustrated earlier in this report,  payment instructions can be unique to each contract.  For example, DFAS  Columbus made $2.4 million in payment allocation errors on the Army  contract because the voucher examiners made errors when they manually  applied payment amounts to ACRNs following complex, nonstandard  payment instructions that changed several times.  This makes it difficult for  DFAS Columbus personnel\u2014who must process the payments and make the  adjustments manually\u2014to properly allocate the payments to the correct  ACRNs.", "In the second phase of this effort, the working group developed proposals  for regulatory changes to address the types of standard payment  instructions applicable to specific contracting situations.  Depending on  their specific requirements, contracting officers would be able to choose a  contracting option that would include the standard payment instructions  applicable to that particular situation.  For example, the working group is  evaluating several different standard payment instructions that DOD  contracting offices may use on contracts, including standard payment  instructions (1) for ensuring that funds are used before they are no longer  available for expenditure and (2) for ensuring that funds can be allocated to  the various contract ACRNs based on the balance available on each  contract ACRN.  The group\u2019s consensus was that such standardization  should enable DFAS Columbus to substantially increase its level of  automated payments.", "During phase three, the final phase that began in May 2003, the working  group\u2019s proposals will be presented to the Defense Acquisition Regulations  Council and other experts for review.  The results from this review  process will eventually determine whether the working group\u2019s proposals  will be accepted.  DOD has not yet established a milestone date for  completing the third phase of this effort and has not yet made the final  decision to implement the options for presenting standard payment  instructions.  While the working group did not study the possibility of  automating the standard payment instructions, it informed us that  automating them would be the next logical step if they were implemented.", "Our analysis of the working group initiative to develop standard payment  instructions showed that it is a good first step because it should reduce  some of the payment allocation errors that were the result of DFAS  Columbus voucher examiners misinterpreting contract payment  instructions.  However, even with the standard payment instructions, DFAS  Columbus will still manually allocate payments to contract ACRNs on  complex contracts such as the two mentioned in this report.  As we  previously stated, manual payment allocations increase the opportunity for  errors.  In order to eliminate payment allocation errors, DFAS should take  the next step and automate the standard payment instructions so that  DFAS Columbus can electronically process the payments with minimal  manual intervention."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Resolving DOD\u2019s long-standing contract payment problems will require  major improvements to its processes and systems.  One key element of  DOD\u2019s efforts to improve its business operations is its effort to develop an  enterprise architecture to guide and constrain its ongoing and planned  investments in business systems.  Another key element to resolving  contract payment problems would be to determine whether DOD can  reengineer the way its contracts are written, including the length of time  covered by a contract as well as the number of modifications made to the  contract.  If successful, these efforts could result in reengineered business  processes and financial management systems that could address many of  DOD\u2019s long-standing contract payment allocation problems that have  required DFAS Columbus to undertake time-consuming and costly  reconciliations to correct allocation errors.  However, these reengineered  processes and systems are years from becoming reality.", "In the interim, DOD is addressing some of the fundamental weaknesses  that have resulted in billions of dollars of adjustments to correct contract  payment allocations annually.  However, DOD has not yet completed its  work to (1) provide information to the procuring activities on the correct  methods for presenting payment instructions on contracts, (2) develop and  implement standardized payment instructions to be used DOD-wide, and  (3) fully automate the payment process using these instructions.  Without  standardized and automated payment instructions, DOD will continue to  spend millions of dollars each year to process payments manually and then  adjust those payments.  Further, DOD activities must follow existing  regulations and procedures covering payment instructions to help ensure  that payment data are accurately recorded against the correct obligations.   Until DOD successfully modernizes its business operations, these interim  steps will help avoid the inaccurate contract payment data that have  hindered DOD\u2019s ability to accurately account for and report on contract  disbursements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics) to  develop payment allocation options for presenting standard payment  instructions in contracts containing multifunded contract line items and   issue guidance to the contracting community reiterating the  requirement in DFARS that all contracts containing multifunded  contract line items contain payment instructions and that these  instructions be revised when additional ACRNs are added.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) to direct the Director of the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service to   automate the standardized payment instructions in MOCAS once the  standard payment instructions are adopted and  issue guidance reiterating DFAS\u2019s internal requirement that when a  contract does not contain payment instructions and the contractor  invoice does not contain payment instructions, the payments for costs  and services must be allocated to ACRNs financed on a cost  reimbursable basis in accordance with DFAS\u2019s desk procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report.

In addition, DOD  agreed that it would, as part of the working group effort referred to in this  report, evaluate the feasibility of developing and automating payment  allocation options to include in standard payment instructions.  However,  until the coordination and review process within DOD is complete, DOD  stated that it could not commit to the development and automation of  standard payment instructions.", "We understand that actions to develop and automate standard payment  instructions must be coordinated with interested parties throughout DOD.   At the same time, a clear commitment to completing this effort in a timely  manner is critical if DOD is to resolve its long-standing problem of  spending tens of millions of dollars each year to make tens of billions of  dollars in adjustments to correct the payment allocation problems.  When  $1 out of every $4 in contract payment transactions continues to be for  adjustments to previously recorded payments, decisive steps towards a  lasting solution are essential.  One concern that we have is that DOD has  not indicated any time frame for completing the coordination and review  process referred to in its response.  As we recently testified, cultural  resistance to change, military service parochialism, and stovepiped  operations have played a significant role in previous failed attempts to  implement management reforms at DOD.  Breaking down these barriers  will be critical to successfully reforming DOD\u2019s contract payment  processes and saving the millions of dollars currently spent annually on  inefficient and inaccurate manual processes.", "In addition, DOD stated that our findings were based on a review of only  two contracts that had known problems.  DOD recommended that the  report specifically state that, due to the nature of this review, the results  cannot be extrapolated to other DOD contracts.  The draft report already  included such a statement.  The report states that the two contracts we  reviewed are not representative of all DOD contracts but, based on our  experience, have characteristics similar to other complex contracts.  DFAS  Columbus provided these contracts as examples of complex contracts with  which they had encountered problems in correctly allocating payments to  ACRNs.  We selected these two contracts so we could identify the root  cause of payments not being properly allocated to ACRNs and to determine  what actions DOD is taking to address the problem.
