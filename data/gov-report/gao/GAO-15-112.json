For example, in 2002, a former FBI agent alleged she suffered retaliation after disclosing that colleagues had stolen items from Ground Zero following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. DOJ found in her favor over 10 years after she reported the retaliation. GAO was asked to review DOJ's process for handling such complaints.", "GAO examined (1) the time DOJ took to resolve FBI whistleblower retaliation complaints, (2) the extent to which DOJ took steps to resolve complaints more quickly, and (3) the extent to which DOJ complied with certain regulatory reporting requirements.", "GAO reviewed all DOJ case files for FBI whistleblower retaliation complaints DOJ closed from 2009 to 2013, and interviewed whistleblower attorneys, advocates, and government officials about the complaint process. The interview results are not generalizable."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Justice (DOJ) closed 44 of the 62 (71 percent) Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) whistleblower retaliation complaints we reviewed within 1 year, took up to 4 years to close 15 complaints, and took up to 10.6 years to close the remaining 3. DOJ terminated 55 of the 62 complaints (89 percent) and awarded corrective action for 3. (Complainants withdrew 4.) We found that DOJ terminated many (48 of 62) complaints we reviewed because they did not meet certain regulatory requirements. For example, DOJ terminated at least 17 complaints in part because a disclosure was made to someone in the employee's chain of command or management, such as a supervisor, who was not one of the nine high-level FBI or DOJ entities designated under DOJ regulations to receive such disclosures. Unlike employees of other executive branch agencies, FBI employees do not have a process to seek corrective action if they experience retaliation based on a disclosure of wrongdoing to their supervisors or others in their chain of command who are not designated officials. This difference is due, in part, to DOJ's decisions about how to implement the statute governing FBI whistleblowers. In 2014, DOJ reviewed its regulations and, in an effort to balance competing priorities, recommended adding more senior officials in FBI field offices to the list of designated entities, but did not recommend adding all supervisors. DOJ cited a number of reasons for this, including concerns about the additional resources and time needed to handle a possible increase in complaints if DOJ added supervisors. However, DOJ is already taking other steps to improve the efficiency of the complaint process. More importantly, dismissing retaliation complaints made to an employee's supervisor or someone in that person's chain of command leaves some FBI whistleblowers\u2014such as the 17 complainants we identified\u2014without protection from retaliation. By dismissing potentially legitimate complaints in this way, DOJ could deny some whistleblowers access to recourse, permit retaliatory activity to go uninvestigated, and create a chilling effect for future whistleblowers.", "We also found that DOJ and FBI guidance is not always clear that FBI employees reporting alleged wrongdoing to a supervisor or someone in their chain of command may not be a protected disclosure. Ensuring that guidance always clearly explains to whom an FBI employee can report wrongdoing will help FBI whistleblowers ensure that they are fully protected from retaliation.", "DOJ took from 2 to 10.6 years to resolve the 4 complaints we reviewed that DOJ adjudicated, and DOJ did not provide complainants with estimates of when to expect DOJ decisions throughout the complaint process. Providing such estimates would enhance accountability to complainants and provide additional assurance about DOJ management's commitment to improve efficiency.", "Further, DOJ offices responsible for investigating whistleblower retaliation complaints have not consistently complied with certain regulatory requirements, such as obtaining complainants' approvals for extensions of time. One investigating office does not track investigators' compliance with specific regulatory requirements and does not have a formal oversight mechanism to do so. Effectively monitoring investigators' compliance with such requirements could help assure complainants that their cases are making progress and that they have the information they need to determine next steps for their complaints."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress may wish to consider whether FBI whistleblowers should have means to seek corrective action if retaliated against for disclosures to supervisors, among others. Further, GAO recommends that DOJ clarify guidance to clearly convey to whom employees can make protected disclosures, provide complainants with estimated complaint decision timeframes, and develop an oversight mechanism to monitor regulatory compliance. DOJ and the Office of the Inspector General concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Whistleblowers play an important role in safeguarding the federal  government against waste, fraud, and abuse, and their willingness to  come forward can contribute to improvements in government operations.  However, whistleblowers also risk retaliation from their employers,  sometimes being demoted, reassigned, or fired as a result of their  actions. In 1998, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued regulations that  set forth the process for Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  whistleblowers to report complaints of retaliation for their disclosures.  These regulations require that FBI whistleblower retaliation complaints be  directed to DOJ\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) or Office of  Professional Responsibility (DOJ-OPR) for investigation and provide  specific timeliness and reporting requirements for these offices to meet as  they manage these complaints. The regulations also establish roles for  the Director of DOJ\u2019s Office of Attorney Recruitment and Management  (OARM) and the Deputy Attorney General (DAG). In some instances, the  total process for resolving a complaint\u2014including investigation,  adjudication, and appeals\u2014has taken several years. For example, in  2002, former FBI agent Jane Turner filed a whistleblower complaint with  DOJ alleging that her colleagues had stolen items from Ground Zero after  the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. After making this whistleblower  disclosure, she was given a \u201cdoes not meet expectations\u201d rating, placed  on leave, and given a notice of proposed removal. According to Ms.  Turner\u2019s attorneys, she retired from the FBI in order to avoid formal  termination being placed on her record. Ms. Turner filed a whistleblower  retaliation complaint that DOJ ultimately found in her favor in 2013\u2014over  10 years later. Members of Congress and whistleblower advocates have  raised questions about the length of time it takes DOJ to investigate and  adjudicate FBI whistleblower retaliation complaints.", "To assist Congress in overseeing DOJ\u2019s efforts to protect FBI  whistleblowers, you asked us to examine DOJ\u2019s process for handling FBI  whistleblower retaliation complaints. Specifically, our report examines: how long DOJ has taken to resolve FBI whistleblower retaliation  complaints and what factors have affected these time frames;  the extent to which DOJ has taken steps to resolve complaints more  quickly and determine the impact of any such efforts; and  the extent to which DOJ\u2019s OIG and DOJ-OPR have complied with  regulatory reporting requirements.", "To determine how long DOJ has taken to resolve FBI whistleblower  retaliation complaints and the factors that affected these time frames, we  reviewed DOJ case files for all FBI whistleblower retaliation complaints  closed within the last 5 calendar years (from 2009 through 2013), and  calculated the duration of each complaint from initial filing to appeal, as  applicable; the length of time between interim steps throughout this  process; and factors affecting the time frames in each case, among other  things. Specifically, we reviewed a total of 62 closed cases representing  62 complaints. In addition, we reviewed documentation, such as internal  procedures and memos, and interviewed senior DOJ officials in each of  the four offices responsible for investigating or adjudicating whistleblower  retaliation complaints\u2014OIG, DOJ-OPR, OARM, and the Office of the  Deputy Attorney General (ODAG)\u2014about the factors that affected these  time frames and DOJ\u2019s process for handling these complaints and  compared aspects of this process against standards in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. Because of the sensitivity of  FBI whistleblowers\u2019 identities, to obtain whistleblower perspectives on  these issues, we met with representatives of five whistleblower advocacy  groups knowledgeable about DOJ\u2019s process and attorneys who have  represented three FBI whistleblowers through this process. We identified  the representatives of five whistleblower advocacy groups using an  iterative process often referred to as snowball sampling. At each  interview, we solicited names of additional groups to interview and  selected for interviews those that were most widely recognized as  knowledgeable about DOJ\u2019s process. The information we gathered from  these groups and attorneys\u2014referred to throughout our report collectively  as eight whistleblower advocates and attorneys\u2014is not generalizable, but  provides perspectives on whistleblowers\u2019 experiences with DOJ\u2019s  process.", "To determine the extent to which DOJ has taken steps to resolve  complaints more quickly, we interviewed DOJ officials responsible for  handling these complaints about the factors that affect the timely  processing of these complaints and steps DOJ has taken to address  them. In addition, to identify any practices that have improved timeliness  in comparable federal settings, we interviewed senior officials in the  Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General (DOD-OIG) as  well as the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the U.S. Merit  Systems Protection Board (MSPB)\u2014federal agencies that handle  whistleblower retaliation complaints for other federal employees\u2014about  those agencies\u2019 processes for handling whistleblower retaliation  complaints.

Specifically, for each case file, we reviewed the office\u2019s  documented communication with the complainant including initial and  ongoing outreach, and any interim and final notices that the agency  closed or declined the case, as applicable. We also reviewed  documentation and interviewed OIG and DOJ-OPR officials responsible  for handling these complaints about any oversight mechanisms to ensure  compliance with regulatory requirements. Further, we interviewed eight  whistleblower advocates and attorneys, as noted above, to obtain  whistleblower perspectives on the extent and effects of DOJ\u2019s compliance  with regulatory requirements. In addition, because OSC serves a  comparable function to that of OIG and DOJ-OPR in handling  whistleblower complaints for most other federal employees and has  similar regulatory reporting requirements, we interviewed OSC officials  about their processes and mechanisms for ensuring compliance with  OSC\u2019s requirements.", "Additional details on our scope and methodology are discussed in  appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 through  January 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Under these provisions, most federal employees pursue whistleblower  retaliation complaints with OSC and MSPB. However, the FBI, as well as  other intelligence agencies, is excluded from this process. Instead, the  Attorney General is required to establish regulations to ensure that FBI  employees are protected against retaliation for reporting wrongdoing,  consistent with certain statutory processes of OSC and MSPB. Since the  Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 was enacted, numerous amendments  have been made to the provisions governing most executive branch  whistleblowers, but corresponding amendments have generally not been  made to the statutory provision governing FBI employees. Provisions  providing recourse for employees of intelligence community elements  who are retaliated against for making disclosures of protected information  were established by Presidential Policy Directive 19 in 2012, and in  statute in 2014.", "In order to implement the statute governing FBI whistleblower protections,  in 1998, DOJ issued regulations to protect FBI whistleblowers from  retaliation for reporting alleged wrongdoing, and established the process  for handling FBI whistleblower retaliation complaints. regulations prohibit DOJ employees from taking or failing to take (or  threatening to take or fail to take) a personnel action with respect to any  FBI employee as a reprisal for a protected disclosure (i.e., retaliation).", "The regulations also define what disclosures by FBI employees qualify as  protected disclosures, entitling the employees to recourse should they  experience retaliation. Specifically, the regulations state that disclosures  are protected if the complainants   1.  reasonably believe that they are reporting wrongdoing, defined as a  violation of any law, rule, or regulation; mismanagement; a gross  waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific  danger to public health or safety, and 2.  report the alleged wrongdoing to one of nine designated officials or  offices (e.g., the Attorney General, the DAG, and OIG, among other  entities).", "28 C.F.R. pt. 27.", "If the FBI employee does not meet either of these two criteria, then that  person\u2019s disclosure is not protected and the person does not have a right  to recourse if the individual should experience retaliation as a result. That  is, for example, if the person reports wrongdoing to a nondesignated  entity and then experiences retaliation, the person will not be eligible for  corrective action for that retaliation. Further, once the employee reported  to a nondesignated entity and experienced retaliation as a result, the  employee cannot subsequently report the alleged wrongdoing to a  designated entity and obtain corrective action for the retaliation that has  already taken place."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Division of Responsibility for FBI Whistleblower Retaliation Complaints", "paragraphs": ["The regulations lay out DOJ\u2019s process for handling FBI whistleblower  retaliation complaints and describe various offices\u2019 responsibilities for  investigating, adjudicating, and reviewing appeals related to these  complaints.

The  office that investigates the complaint (referred to as the investigating  office) first reviews the complaint to determine whether it meets  threshold regulatory requirements. A complaint that did not meet  threshold regulatory requirements means a complaint where DOJ\u2019s  decision to terminate the complaint was not based on whether there  was a reprisal taken because of a disclosure, but on whether the  allegations met threshold requirements. For example, the  investigating office may determine that the complaint does not meet  threshold regulatory requirements because the complainant did not  make his or her underlying disclosure to one of the nine entities  designated in the regulations; or because the alleged retaliatory  personnel action occurred before the complainant made a protected  disclosure and therefore could not have been caused by the protected  disclosure. If the complaint does not meet threshold regulatory  requirements, then the investigating office closes the complaint.  However, if the investigating office determines that the complaint met  threshold regulatory requirements, then the office investigates the  merits of the complaint by, for example, conducting interviews and  requesting and reviewing documentation, such as employee  statements and records from the FBI. At the conclusion of an  investigation, if OIG or DOJ-OPR finds that there are reasonable  grounds, it then forwards its investigative report with any  recommended actions to OARM for adjudication. In cases in which  OIG or DOJ-OPR has not found in the complainant\u2019s favor or has not  completed its investigation, the complainant may go directly to OARM  to request corrective action.", "Adjudication: OARM is responsible for adjudicating FBI  whistleblower retaliation cases. OARM receives these cases from OIG  or DOJ-OPR where either office has determined there are reasonable  grounds to believe that there has been or will be reprisal for a  protected disclosure, or else directly from the complainant. As with  the investigating offices, when OARM receives the complaint, OARM  first determines whether the complaint meets threshold regulatory  requirements, before proceeding to review the merits of the complaint.  For OARM, considering the merits of the complaint entails reviewing  the supporting evidence (e.g., documents and testimony), as well as  the arguments each party\u2014the complainant and the FBI\u2014submits,  and then determining, based on all of the evidence, if the individual  substantiated the claim of retaliation. If the complaint is substantiated  and the FBI is unable to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it  would have taken the same personnel action even if the complainant  had not made the protected disclosure, OARM will order that the FBI  take corrective action, such as providing the complainant back pay or  reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees.", "Appeals: DOJ\u2019s DAG is responsible for reviewing and ruling on  parties\u2019 appeals of OARM decisions.

Instead the law required the  Attorney General to develop regulations to ensure that FBI employees are  not retaliated against for disclosures of wrongdoing.", "When issuing its interim and final regulations in 1998 and 1999,  respectively, DOJ considered which individuals and offices the Attorney  General would designate to receive protected disclosures from FBI  employees. DOJ officials who developed these regulations included eight  designated entities but did not include supervisors at that time because  the officials maintained that Congress intended DOJ to limit the universe  of recipients of protected disclosures, in part because of the sensitive  information to which FBI employees have access.rule, DOJ responded to commenter suggestions to add additional entities  to receive such disclosures\u2014including FBI-INSD, supervisors, and  coworkers. Among other things, DOJ stated its view that Congress  contemplated that recipients for whistleblower disclosures would be a  relatively restricted group and \u201cto designate a large (and in the case of  supervisors, arguably ill-defined) group of employees as recipients would  be inconsistent with Congress\u2019s decision, given the sensitivity of  information to which FBI employees have access.\u201d In addition, DOJ\u2019s rule  explained that \u201cdesignating the highest ranking official in each field office,  but not all supervisors, as recipients of protected disclosures . . . provides  a way to channel such disclosures to those in the field who are in a  position to respond and to correct management and other problems while  also providing an on-site contact in the field for making protected  disclosures.\u201d", "In October 2012, the President issued Presidential Policy Directive 19,  which established whistleblower protections for employees serving in the  intelligence community, including, among other things, explicitly providing  protection to employees who are retaliated against for reporting  wrongdoing \u201cto a supervisor in the employee\u2019s direct chain of command  up to and including the head of the employing agency.\u201d Presidential  Policy Directive 19 excluded the FBI from the scope of these protections,  and instead required DOJ to report to the President on the efficacy of its  regulations pertaining to FBI whistleblower retaliation and describe any  proposed revisions to these regulations to increase their effectiveness.", "In response to this requirement, ODAG officials led an effort to review FBI  whistleblower retaliation complaints filed from January 1, 2005, through  March 15, 2014, and, consistent with our review, found that DOJ had  terminated a significant portion of complaints because they were not  made to the proper individual or office. In addition, DOJ officials met with  whistleblower advocates and OSC officials to solicit their views and found  that these individuals and officials recommended that DOJ broaden its  regulations to protect disclosures to any supervisor in the employee\u2019s  chain of command. According to DOJ\u2019s April 2014 report in response to  Presidential Policy Directive 19, the whistleblower advocates noted that  the directive instructs intelligence community elements to protect  disclosures to any supervisor in the employee\u2019s direct chain of command  and that this is consistent with whistleblower protection laws that similarly  protect other civil service employees. Further, DOJ\u2019s report notes that  OSC officials believe that to deny employees protection unless their  disclosure is made to the high-ranked supervisors in the office would  undermine a central purpose of whistleblower protection laws.", "In response to PPD-19, DOJ officials led by ODAG revisited their 1999  regulations and in April 2014 recommended expanding the persons to  whom individuals can make protected disclosures to include\u2014in addition  to the highest-ranking official in FBI field offices, who is already  included\u2014the second highest ranking tier of officials in these field offices,  which includes the two or three assistant special agents in charge in 53  field offices and the special agents in charge in the 3 largest field offices.  Senior DOJ officials told us that DOJ leadership has approved this  change and the agency is beginning the public notice and comment  process; as of December 2014, DOJ has not issued any notice of  proposed rulemaking or publicly moved forward on these stated plans.  DOJ officials reported that they plan to evaluate the impact of this  expansion, and they may choose subsequently to further expand the set  of persons to whom an employee can make a protected disclosure, if  DOJ determines that such expansion is warranted. However, as of  December 2014, senior FBI and ODAG officials report that they do not  have an estimated date or specific plans for this evaluation and could not  provide specifics on how this evaluation would be conducted.", "DOJ officials gave us several explanations about why DOJ did not  recommend expanding the list to include supervisors and others in the  employee\u2019s chain of command, a change that would bring the FBI into  line with other executive branch agencies. First, in DOJ\u2019s April 2014  report, DOJ officials state that \u201cthe Department believes the set of  persons to whom a protected disclosure can be made is extensive and  diverse, and has seen no indication that the list has impeded disclosures  of wrongdoing.\u201d However, when we asked officials how they arrived as  this conclusion\u2014particularly in light of our and DOJ\u2019s previous findings  that numerous complainants had at least one claim dismissed for making  a disclosure to someone in management or their chain of command\u2014 they could not provide supporting evidence or analysis for their  conclusions. Rather, these officials cited concerns about striking the right  balance between the benefits of an expanded list and the level of  resources the department would have to expend assessing more  complaints if the department added more designated officials, and the  potential impact of these additional complaints on the timeliness of the  process. While DOJ\u2019s focus on the timeliness of complaint processing is  important, dismissing retaliation complaints made to an employee\u2019s  supervisor or someone in his or her chain of command who is not a  designated entity leaves some FBI whistleblowers with no recourse if they  experience retaliation. We found at least 17 whistleblowers whose cases  were dismissed\u2014at least in part\u2014for making a disclosure of wrongdoing  to someone in their chain of command or management. Our findings are  similar to those of the ODAG-led review in which the department found  that in a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of OIG cases the claim was closed because  it was not made to a proper individual or office under the regulations.  This means that these employees had no recourse for retaliation they  may have experienced for making those disclosures. Moreover, with  respect to DOJ\u2019s concerns about resources and timeliness, DOJ has  discretion in determining its regulatory process for enforcing protections  for FBI whistleblowers and, as described in more detail later this report, is  taking other steps to improve the timeliness of the process.", "Senior FBI and ODAG officials also explained that the department plans  to provide FBI employees with additional training on the list of entities  designated to receive whistleblower complaints. While training could help  provide information on how to make a protected disclosure, this planned  training would have little effect for employees who initially raise a concern  to their supervisors not expecting that this action would ever be a  whistleblower disclosure. All seven of the whistleblower advocates and  attorneys we interviewed who had relevant personal and professional  experience stated that it is common practice for employees to report  wrongdoing to their supervisors before reporting it to a more senior  official, such as those designated in DOJ\u2019s regulations. Further, two  advocates we met with stressed that very few people intend to become  whistleblowers. Rather, it is typical for employees who become aware of a  problem to report it to their supervisors, expecting to resolve the issue at  that level. In one FBI whistleblower case file we reviewed, the  complainant wrote that \u201cthere is a practice in the FBI that a person is to  go through his or her chain of command first.\u201d Further, senior FBI officials  we spoke with emphasized that FBI policy encourages employees to  report allegations of wrongdoing to a broader group of entities than those  designated in regulation as recipients of protected disclosures\u2014including  any supervisor in the chain of command of the person reporting.", "Last, senior FBI and ODAG officials noted that the statute establishing  whistleblower protections for FBI employees differs from the statute  governing protections for other federal employees, so there is no legal  requirement that DOJ designate supervisors or others in an employee\u2019s  chain of command to receive protected disclosures. The separate  statutory provision for the FBI has existed since enactment of the CSRA  in 1978, but has generally not been revisited by Congress when passing  amendments to legislation governing other executive branch  whistleblowers. Over the years, Congress has passed amendments to the  legislation covering employees in other executive branch agencies that  explicitly strengthen and expand protections for other federal  whistleblowers. For example, Congress added language clarifying that  disclosures to supervisors who participated in the misconduct are  protected disclosures. The Whistleblower Act of 1989 provides, among  other things, that employees should not suffer adverse consequences as  a result of prohibited personnel practices. The Senate report  accompanying the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2012  explained that, with regard to whistleblower retaliation matters, the focus  should not be on whether or not disclosures of wrongdoing were  protected, but rather whether the personnel action at issue in the case  occurred because of the protected disclosure. However, changes to  laws affecting other executive branch whistleblowers did not automatically  extend to the FBI since the law governing FBI employees was in a  separate provision of the original legislation. DOJ\u2019s current regulations  and its recommended changes deny FBI employees protection provided  to employees of other executive branch agencies\u2014including those in the  intelligence community. Thus, DOJ risks dismissing, and potentially not  addressing, instances of actual retaliation against individuals who  reported their disclosure to their supervisors, or another entity not  designated in the regulations. Dismissing these whistleblower retaliation  complaints could deny whistleblowers access to recourse, could permit  retaliatory activity to go uninvestigated, and may have a chilling effect on  other potential whistleblowers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Guidance Is Not Always Clear", "paragraphs": ["In the course of our review, in addition to several DOJ and FBI guidance  documents that accurately describe DOJ\u2019s FBI whistleblower regulations,  we also found instances of DOJ guidance that could lead FBI employees  to believe that reporting an allegation of wrongdoing to a supervisor in  their chain of command would be a protected disclosure when that is not  the case. First, FBI\u2019s guidance\u2014the FBI Domestic Investigations and  Operations Guide, specifically\u2014states that, in general, the FBI requires  employees to report known or suspected failures to adhere to the law,  rules, or regulations to any supervisor in the employees\u2019 chain of  command, or others, but does not clarify that such disclosures are  protected only if reported to certain designated individuals or offices.  Second, an April 2014 memo from the DAG to all DOJ employees\u2014 including FBI employees\u2014encouraged employees to watch a video on  whistleblower rights and protections and stated that employees may  report waste, fraud, or abuse within the department to supervisors within  their offices or the OIG, or outside the department to OSC. The memo  did not clarify that FBI employees who report such allegations to their  supervisors or OSC may not have the right to pursue corrective action  should they experience retaliation for their disclosure. Senior ODAG  officials acknowledged that if taken in isolation, this memo could cause  some confusion for FBI employees but stressed that FBI employees  should already be familiar with the FBI-specific policy from FBI-offered  training and resources. However, we reviewed the two trainings FBI  officials cited as educating FBI employees on the procedures to follow  when making a whistleblower complaint, and neither training mentions  DOJ\u2019s regulations related to FBI whistleblower retaliation or the specific  steps FBI employees need to take to ensure their disclosures are  protected. OIG and FBI officials report that they are currently developing  a training video that will address FBI-specific issues and will be required  for all FBI employees. This planned training could improve employee  awareness of the FBI-specific procedures, but such an effort could be  undercut if unclear written policies and communications continue to be  provided to FBI employees.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides that  agencies should distribute pertinent information so employees may  efficiently carry out their duties.

OARM  officials report that given the length of these cases, it is too early to  assess whether the efforts implemented thus far are having the desired  impact on the timeliness of OARM\u2019s adjudication process, but they  explained that in the future, they could use their case docket to determine  impact. For example, they could review the number of cases resolved  through mediation and whether the revised procedures from 2011 have  made a difference in the time needed to adjudicate large cases. OARM\u2019s  stated plans to monitor the impact is a good first step by one of the  relevant offices, but assessing the impact on timeliness and quality  throughout the entire investigation, adjudication, and appeal process to  determine the impact on total complaint-processing time will require a  joint effort among OIG, DOJ-OPR, OARM, and ODAG.", "In DOJ\u2019s April 2014 report to the President, DOJ stated plans to evaluate  the impact of two policy changes to increase the effectiveness of DOJ\u2019s  regulations, but stated no such plans for the policy changes intended to  improve DOJ\u2019s timeliness in handling these complaints.

Two of the whistleblower advocates we spoke with  said that it is generally beneficial to the complainant to wait for OIG or  DOJ-OPR to complete their investigations so that these offices can obtain  a complete factual record, which is helpful if the complainant pursues his  or her case with OARM. However, according to these whistleblower  advocates, if the complainant is not satisfied with the investigating office\u2019s  progress, the complainant may prefer to go directly to OARM.

According to senior OIG  officials and a DOJ-OPR official responsible for managing these  complaints, managers regularly discussed individual complaints with the  investigator assigned to the complaint, but the investigator was  responsible for setting due dates to ensure compliance with the  regulations. The OIG and DOJ-OPR officials we spoke with said that their  investigators were frequently in communication with complainants, but  these communications were not always documented within their case  files. Without documentation of these communications, managers could  not verify that investigators had communicated with complainants, as  required. In addition, senior OIG officials and the DOJ-OPR official said  that they maintained information on the dates whistleblower retaliation  complaints were opened and closed within their case management  systems; however, these systems were not specific to whistleblower  retaliation complaints and did not contain dates of interim  communications. As a result, managers could not use these systems to  oversee investigators\u2019 compliance with requirements to provide status  updates within prescribed time frames or obtain the complainant\u2019s  approval for an extension, if required.", "OIG has taken steps to begin tracking compliance with these  requirements; however, DOJ-OPR has not yet taken similar action.  Specifically, in July 2014, during the course of our review, an OIG  manager informed staff responsible for these complaints of the  importance of documenting status updates within case files to ensure  documentation of OIG\u2019s compliance with regulatory requirements to  update complainants within prescribed time frames. Further, over the last  2 years, OIG has developed a database it now uses as a management  tool to oversee investigators\u2019 compliance with requirements for  communicating with complainants. According to senior OIG officials we  spoke with, OIG decided to develop this database to help ensure that OIG  meets its regulatory requirements. OIG managers use the database to  track dates of interim communications, such as status updates, and the  database calculates regulatory deadlines for subsequent updates and for  closing the complaint. In addition, according to senior OIG officials,  managers can use the database to run reports, such as to see upcoming  deadlines for all open complaints. Although it is too soon to tell how  effective this database will be, if used consistently, this database could  help OIG managers ensure investigators communicate with complainants  in accordance with regulatory requirements.", "According to a DOJ-OPR official responsible for managing these  complaints, DOJ-OPR could place an even greater emphasis on the  deadlines for these complaints and take additional steps to oversee  communications with complainants. This official stated that DOJ-OPR  investigators may lose track of deadlines for status updates in FBI  whistleblower retaliation cases because similar requirements are not in  place for other cases DOJ-OPR typically handles. Further, as discussed  previously, in many of the case files we reviewed we did not see evidence  of communication between the DOJ-OPR investigator and the  complainant within required time frames.

Seven of these 15 reports indicated that OIG found that the complaint did  not meet threshold regulatory requirements under the FBI whistleblower  regulations, but the report did not communicate why. For example, in one  instance, OIG\u2019s report to the complainant explained the general finding  that the allegations, even if accepted as true, did not demonstrate a  personnel action in retaliation for a protected disclosure. Information we  reviewed elsewhere in this case file specified that OIG found that the  complainant had not made the underlying disclosure to a designated  entity under the regulations. However, OIG did not include this  information in its final report to the complainant. In the 8 other complaints,  OIG\u2019s final report to the complainant stated that another office should  review the complaint, such as the FBI Inspections Division, but did not  indicate the reason for this decision. In particular, the report did not  indicate that OIG had considered the complaint as a whistleblower  retaliation matter and determined the complaint did not meet threshold  regulatory requirements for OIG to conduct an investigation.", "In contrast, DOJ-OPR generally provided complainants proposed  termination reports before closing their complaints and included required  information in its final termination reports, including in complaints DOJ- OPR closed without conducting an investigation.

According to two senior OSC officials we  spoke with about their process for reviewing whistleblower retaliation  complaints for most federal employees, OSC provides the complainant a  letter when OSC intends to close a complaint that does not meet  threshold requirements without conducting an investigation. In some  instances, according to these officials, the complainant\u2019s response to  OSC\u2019s proposed termination report has caused OSC to reconsider its  initial decision to terminate the complaint. As with OIG and DOJ-OPR, if  OSC intends to terminate a whistleblower retaliation investigation, OSC is  required to provide the complainant a written statement including the facts  and OSC\u2019s conclusions and provide the complainant an opportunity to  provide comments.

DOJ has  established a process by which FBI whistleblowers can seek recourse  should they experience such retaliation, and DOJ generally has the  discretion to revise this process, as needed. We found that DOJ has  terminated many FBI whistleblower complaints based on complainants\u2019  failure to meet threshold regulatory requirements rather than whether the  retaliation occurred. In particular, FBI employees are protected if they  report wrongdoing to certain high-level FBI or DOJ officials and other  specified entities, and\u2014unlike employees of other executive branch  agencies\u2014are not protected if they report wrongdoing to their  supervisors. DOJ officials have stated plans to partially address this by  adding several more senior officials in FBI field offices to the list of  individuals to whom complainants may report protected disclosures, but  the timing and outcome of this stated plan are uncertain. DOJ officials  said they do not plan to expand the list to include supervisors or others in  an employee\u2019s chain of command in part because of their concerns about  the additional resources that would be needed to handle a possible  increase in complaints and the potential effect on the timeliness of DOJ\u2019s  process to handle these complaints. While DOJ officials\u2019 concern about  timeliness is important, they are already taking other steps to improve the  efficiency of this process. More importantly, dismissing retaliation  complaints made to an employee\u2019s supervisor or someone in that  person\u2019s chain of command leaves some FBI whistleblowers with no  recourse if they allege retaliation, as our review of case files  demonstrated. Training that DOJ officials plan to provide to FBI  employees could help provide information on how to make a protected  disclosure; however, this planned training will not address the fact that  some employees report alleged wrongdoing first to their supervisors or  others in their chain of command without ever expecting that this will lead  to retaliation and a whistleblower claim.", "As a result, congressional consideration of whether the purposes of 5  U.S.C. \u00a7 2303, which prohibits a personnel action taken against an FBI  employee as a reprisal for a protected disclosure, are being met\u2014in  particular, whether FBI employees should, like employees of other  executive branch agencies, have a means to obtain corrective action for  retaliation for disclosures of wrongdoing made to supervisors and others  in the employees\u2019 chain of command\u2014could help ensure that DOJ\u2019s  process for handling these complaints is consistent with congressional  action to strengthen and expand protections for other federal  whistleblowers.

Further, with regard to guidance provided to  FBI employees, the OIG fully supports providing clear and comprehensive  guidance as to all aspects of whistleblower rights and protections. To this  end, OIG\u2019s letter stated that the office is working with the FBI to create a  specialized training program that highlights the specific requirements and  procedures for FBI whistleblowers and on enhancements to OIG\u2019s  website to include additional information specific to FBI employees.", "The OIG letter also raised several additional issues. First, OIG\u2019s letter  stated that, with regard to the total duration of Jane Turner\u2019s complaint,  for example, the GAO draft does not distinguish between the  responsibilities of OIG and the department. We appreciate the differing  roles and responsibilities of each office and describe these in our report.  In reporting our findings, we clearly distinguish between the separate  offices\u2019 timeframes and records of compliance with certain regulatory  requirements. However, it is important for us to also consider the total  length of cases, which is particularly important to the whistleblowers.  Second, the OIG letter mentioned that GAO\u2019s analysis excluded more  recent complaints. Given the sensitive nature of open cases, we reviewed  only complaints closed as of December 31, 2013. Third, the OIG letter  commented that the GAO report failed to fully acknowledge the high  priority and personal attention OIG senior staff give to FBI whistleblower  retaliation matters. We disagree. Our report explains that the Inspector  General personally reviews each complaint, but also recognizes that  competing priorities for this high level of attention has resulted in delays.  Fourth, OIG\u2019s letter noted that in many instances OIG has relied on  telephone contact with complainants to meet regulatory notification  requirements and because such contacts were not consistently  documented, we would not always have identified them in our case file  review. In our review of both DOJ and OIG case files, we noted all  evidence of contact with the complainants, including evidence of written  and oral communication, but it is correct that we would not have identified  undocumented contact with complainants. As OIG acknowledged in its  letter, it is important that evidence of contact be documented in case files  to demonstrate compliance with the regulations. As discussed in our  report, OIG has taken steps to address this.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Attorney General, the  DOJ Inspector General, appropriate congressional committees, and other  interested Member of Congress. In addition, the report will be available at  no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-8777 or maurerd@gao.gov.

Specifically, we reviewed the case files for a total of 62 closed  whistleblower retaliation complaints to calculate the duration of each  complaint from initial filing to DOJ\u2019s final decision, including, for example,  the length of time from initial filing to the investigating office\u2019s final  decision; the length of time from filing a request for corrective action with  the Office of Attorney Recruitment and Management (OARM) to OARM\u2019s  decision; and the length of the appeals process. We did this by creating  a data collection instrument to identify the key characteristics of  whistleblower retaliation cases, determine the completeness of the files,  and assess time frames for each case in accordance with DOJ\u2019s  regulations. We also gathered information on the outcome of each  complaint and factors that could affect timeliness, such as the length and  frequency of parties\u2019 requests for extensions of time. In addition, to better  understand DOJ\u2019s process for handling these complaints, we reviewed  relevant documentation, including DOJ\u2019s whistleblower regulations and  internal guidance on the process for making a protected disclosure. To  obtain DOJ officials\u2019 perspectives on DOJ\u2019s process, time frames for  handling these complaints, and factors affecting these time frames, we  also interviewed senior agency officials from offices responsible for  investigating\u2014OIG and DOJ-OPR\u2014or adjudicating\u2014OARM and the  Office of the Deputy Attorney General (ODAG)\u2014FBI whistleblower  retaliation complaints. We compared aspects of DOJ\u2019s process against  standards in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government to  identify the extent to which DOJ\u2019s process was in alignment with these  standards.", "Because of the sensitivity of FBI whistleblowers\u2019 identities, to obtain  whistleblower perspectives about DOJ\u2019s process and time frames, we met  with representatives of whistleblower advocacy groups knowledgeable  about DOJ\u2019s process and attorneys who have represented FBI  whistleblowers through this process. Specifically, we identified and  interviewed representatives of five whistleblower advocacy groups using  an iterative process often referred to as snowball sampling. At each  interview, we solicited names of additional groups to interview and  selected for interviews those that were most widely recognized as  knowledgeable about DOJ\u2019s process. We also interviewed attorneys who  had represented FBI whistleblowers in three of five cases where  complainants have alleged retaliation and obtained corrective action.  These attorneys discussed their experience with DOJ\u2019s process and  factors affecting the length of their cases. We analyzed the results of all of  these interviews to distill themes and patterns. The information we  gathered from these groups and attorneys\u2014referred to throughout our  report collectively as eight whistleblower advocates and attorneys\u2014is not  generalizable, but provides perspectives on whistleblowers\u2019 experiences  with DOJ\u2019s process.", "To determine the extent to which DOJ has taken steps to resolve  complaints more quickly, we interviewed senior DOJ officials in each of  the four offices responsible for investigating or adjudicating whistleblower  retaliation complaints\u2014OIG, DOJ-OPR, OARM, and ODAG. We asked  about the factors that affect the timely processing of these complaints and  any efforts to address them. In addition, to identify any practices that have  improved timeliness in comparable federal settings, we interviewed senior  officials in the Department of Defense\u2019s Office of the Inspector General as  well as the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and the U.S. Merit  Systems Protection Board (MSPB)\u2014federal agencies that handle  whistleblower retaliation complaints for other federal employees\u2014about  those agencies\u2019 processes for handling whistleblower retaliation  complaints. To identify the extent to which DOJ officials have taken steps  to determine the impact of their efforts to improve timeliness, we  interviewed DOJ officials and reviewed DOJ\u2019s April 2014 report to the  President and compared DOJ\u2019s stated plans with standards in Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To determine the extent to which OIG and DOJ-OPR have complied with  regulatory reporting requirements, we compared evidence we saw in  DOJ\u2019s case files with DOJ\u2019s regulations and analyzed the extent of any  discrepancies. Specifically, for each case file, we reviewed OIG\u2019s and  DOJ-OPR\u2019s documented communications with the complainants,  including initial and ongoing outreach, and recorded the dates of all  communications in our data collection instrument. We calculated the  length of time between all documented communications to determine the  number of complaints in which OIG and DOJ-OPR complied with the  deadlines for reporting requirements in DOJ\u2019s regulations. In addition, we  reviewed the content of the investigating office\u2019s final notice to the  complainant that the office had closed its investigation or declined to open  an investigation, as applicable, as well as the content of any interim  notices stating the office\u2019s decision. We compared the content of these  communications with DOJ\u2019s regulatory requirements. We also reviewed  documentation and interviewed OIG and DOJ-OPR officials responsible  for handling these complaints about any oversight mechanisms to ensure  compliance with regulatory requirements. For example, we reviewed an  electronic copy of an OIG spreadsheet for tracking regulatory deadlines  for these complaints. We then compared these mechanisms against  standards in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government to  determine the extent to which OIG and DOJ-OPR met the relevant  standards related to oversight. Further, we interviewed eight whistleblower advocates and attorneys, as noted above, to obtain  whistleblower perspectives on the extent of DOJ\u2019s compliance with  regulatory requirements and the effects of this compliance. In addition,  because OSC serves a function comparable to those of OIG and DOJ- OPR in handling whistleblower complaints for most other executive  branch employees and has similar regulatory reporting requirements, we  interviewed OSC officials about OSC\u2019s processes and mechanisms for  ensuring compliance with its requirements.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 to January  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

These 62 complaints  represent the universe of FBI whistleblower retaliation complaints that  were closed within the last 5 calendar years (from 2009 through 2013) by  the final DOJ office to review the complaint. We reviewed case files at  both of the offices responsible for investigating these complaints\u2014the  Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and the Office of Professional  Responsibility (DOJ-OPR)\u2014as well as at the office responsible for  adjudicating these complaints\u2014the Office of Attorney Recruitment and  Management (OARM)\u2014and identified the final outcome in each  complaint.", "The DOJ office reviewing a whistleblower retaliation complaint may close  the complaint before conducting an investigation (in the case of OIG and  DOJ-OPR) or considering the merits of the complaint (in the case of  OARM) if the office determines that the complaint does not meet  threshold requirements under the FBI whistleblower regulations. If the  investigating office finds that a complaint meets threshold regulatory  requirements, the office will open an investigation to determine if there  are reasonable grounds to believe that a personnel action had been taken  or will be taken in retaliation for a protected disclosure. If OARM first  determines that a complaint meets threshold requirements, OARM  adjudicates the complaint to determine whether the disclosure was a  contributing factor in the personnel action based on a preponderance of  the evidence and whether the FBI has demonstrated by clear and  convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action  in the absence of such disclosure. If the complaint is substantiated and  the FBI is unable to meet its burden of proof, OARM will order that the  FBI take appropriate corrective action. In addition complainants may  voluntarily withdraw their complaints. Table 1 summarizes the final  outcome of the 62 complaints we reviewed, sorted by the final DOJ office  to review the complaint and the overall length of the complaint.", "In addition to determining the final outcome in each complaint, we  reviewed the case files to determine the reasons for the final DOJ office\u2019s  decision to close the complaint. For example, in some complaints, the  final office determined that the complaint did not meet threshold  regulatory requirements because the complainant\u2019s underlying disclosure  had been made to an individual or entity not designated in the regulations  and therefore the disclosure was not protected. In other complaints, the  investigating office found that there were not reasonable grounds to  believe the personnel action had been taken in reprisal for a protected  disclosure because the evidence indicated that the personnel action  would have been taken in the absence of the disclosure.
