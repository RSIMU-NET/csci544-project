To mitigate this threat, TSA is to review the security procedures carried out by all air carriers with U.S.-bound flights and at foreign airports servicing those air carriers. In addition, TSA assesses the commensurability of foreign countries' air cargo security programs.", "GAO was asked to evaluate TSA's progress in assessing and mitigating air cargo security risks. This report addresses (1) steps TSA takes to help ensure that U.S-bound air cargo is secure, (2) the status of TSA's efforts to recognize and monitor foreign governments' air cargo security programs, and (3) the extent to which TSA measures the effectiveness of its efforts to secure U.S.-bound air cargo.

GAO observed 17 air carrier inspections and found that TSA inspectors consistently followed TSA procedures. Further, GAO's analysis of TSA data found air carriers were in full compliance with cargo security requirements in 84 percent of the nearly 5,000 cargo inspections conducted during fiscal years 2012 through 2017. TSA officials were able to resolve a majority of the violations identified during the inspection process.", "Foreign airport assessments . GAO analysis of TSA data found that about 75 percent of the foreign airport assessments that TSA conducted during fiscal years 2012 through 2017 fully complied with international air cargo security standards. As of the end of 2017, foreign officials had addressed about 40 percent of the non-compliance issues. TSA continues to work with foreign officials to address the remaining non-compliance issues.", "As of June 2018, TSA had recognized the national cargo security programs (NCSP) of the European Union and 12 other countries as commensurate with TSA's, and TSA uses a variety of mechanisms to monitor NCSP implementation. TSA's process for NCSP recognition, which is voluntary, involves comparing air cargo security requirements to TSA's and conducting visits to the countries to validate their use. Once TSA determines a program is commensurate with TSA's, it monitors NCSP implementation through regular air carrier inspections, foreign airport assessments, and dialog with government officials. TSA may decide not to recognize a country's NCSP but, instead, make recommendations for improving air cargo security. In countries where TSA has not recognized their NCSP, all U.S.-bound cargo is subject to TSA security requirements.", "TSA's performance measures do not allow it to specifically determine the effectiveness of its efforts to secure U.S.-bound air cargo. For example, TSA measures whether foreign airports take actions to address all noncompliance issues identified during airport assessments, but such a broad measure could obscure progress made in resolving cargo-specific vulnerabilities. Similarly, TSA officials stated that they are developing a measure to gauge the effectiveness of air carrier inspections, but they do not plan to differentiate efforts to secure air cargo from those for securing passengers. Developing and monitoring outcome-based performance measures that separately account for cargo noncompliance issues and violations could help TSA better determine the extent to which its foreign airport assessments and air carrier inspections improve the security of U.S.-bound air cargo. In addition, TSA measures the number of countries it has recognized in the NCSP Recognition Program, but this metric does not address the effectiveness of the program. Developing and monitoring outcome-based performance measures for the NCSP Recognition Program would help TSA better determine whether the resources invested are yielding the intended results.

TSA\u2019s responsibilities with respect to cargo transported on U.S.- bound flights include establishing security requirements governing U.S.  and foreign-flagged air carrier operations and overseeing implementation  of such requirements, which it does through conducting air carrier  inspections and security assessments of foreign airports, among other  things. Foreign governments also establish national cargo security  programs (NCSP) and may impose their own security requirements on air  cargo operations within their jurisdictions\u2014including screening  requirements that may differ from TSA-established requirements\u2014that  apply to cargo bound for the United States from their airports.

Although the information provided in  this report is more limited, the report addresses the same objectives as  the sensitive report and uses the same methodology.", "To describe the steps TSA takes to help ensure that U.S-bound air cargo  is secure, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations, TSA security  policies and procedures, and screening program requirements. We also  reviewed annual air carrier inspection and airport assessment Master  Work Plans for fiscal years 2012 through 2018\u2014which TSA uses to track  its overseas air carrier inspection and foreign airport assessment  schedule\u2014to better understand how TSA schedules inspections and  assessments and the types of inspections it conducts. In addition, we  conducted site visits to two foreign airports\u2014one in South America and  one in Asia\u2014to observe TSA inspectors conducting air carrier cargo  inspections. At one airport, we also observed the cargo portion of an  airport assessment. We selected these locations based on their  designation by TSA as airports of relatively high risk level, as well as high  volume of U.S.-bound air cargo, TSA\u2019s inspection schedule, and  geographic dispersion. We also chose airports in these countries because  it would allow us to observe an inspection in one country where TSA has  recognized the NCSP and one country where TSA has not recognized the  NCSP. Further, we obtained data on and analyzed the results of all air  carrier cargo inspections (close to 5,000) and assessments at airports  that are last points of departure for cargo bound for the United States  (about 570) conducted by TSA inspectors and then entered by them into  TSA\u2019s databases. We analyzed TSA data from fiscal years 2012 through  2017, to cover the period since our previous air cargo security review and  to include the 5 most recent years for which data were available at the  time of our review. We also analyzed fiscal years 2012 through 2017  TSA data on the status of noncompliance issues TSA inspectors  identified during foreign airport assessments. To assess the reliability of  TSA\u2019s air carrier and airport assessment data, we reviewed program  documentation on system controls, interviewed knowledgeable TSA  officials, and analyzed TSA\u2019s data for any potential gaps and errors. We  concluded that TSA\u2019s data on air carrier inspections and foreign airport  assessments were sufficiently reliable to provide a general indication of  the level of compliance for TSA\u2019s air carrier inspections and foreign  airport assessments over the period of our analysis. In addition, we  interviewed TSA headquarters and field officials to discuss TSA\u2019s efforts  to ensure the security of U.S.-bound air cargo prior to being transported  to the United States. We also interviewed other stakeholders, such as  representatives from 11 air carriers\u2014selected based on the relatively high  volume of U.S.-bound cargo they transport; their operation of flights at the  foreign airports we visited; and to obtain a range of coverage regarding  geographical regions of operation, passenger and all-cargo air carriers,  and U.S. and foreign-flagged air carriers\u2014and officials at the European  Commission (EC) and from the civil aviation authority from the country in  Asia that we visited to discuss their experiences in coordinating with TSA  on air cargo security issues.

Further, we analyzed letters that TSA provided  since 2012 to governments it determined had commensurate air cargo  security programs and NCSP information TSA officials compiled  specifically for our review to better understand TSA\u2019s terms of recognition  with each government and the timeframes for revalidating NCSP  recognition. We also analyzed data from TSA\u2019s Security Policy and  Industry Engagement Policy Inventory to determine how the level of  NCSP participation has changed over time. Specifically, we reviewed the  number of air carriers participating in the NCSP Recognition Program  from fiscal year 2012\u2014when the NCSP Recognition Program began\u2014 through fiscal year 2017, which is the most recent complete fiscal year  available at the time of our review. Finally, we conducted interviews with  TSA and foreign government officials from two countries, and with  representatives of the 11 air carriers described previously to better  understand TSA\u2019s ongoing efforts to recognize and monitor foreign  governments\u2019 air cargo security programs.

Among other things, ATSA requires, in general, that  TSA provide for the screening of all passengers and property, including  cargo transported by air carriers. ATSA further requires that a system  be in operation to screen, inspect, or otherwise ensure the security of the  cargo transported by all-cargo aircraft to, from, and within the United  States, but did not establish a firm deadline for the implementation of  such a system. Further, to help enhance civil aviation security, the  Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  (9/11 Commission Act), mandated that DHS establish a system within 3  years of enactment (enacted August 3, 2007) to screen 100 percent of air  cargo transported on all passenger aircraft operated by an air carrier  traveling to, from, within, or overflying the United States. TSA reported  that it met the mandate to screen 100 percent of domestic air cargo  transported on passenger aircraft in August 2010 and U.S.-bound air  cargo transported on passenger aircraft from foreign airports in August  2013.", "There is no comparable 100 percent screening requirement in statute for  cargo transported to the United States on all-cargo air carriers. However,  TSA requires that all cargo transported on U.S.-bound flights be screened  or subjected to security controls that prevent the introduction of  explosives, incendiaries, or other destructive devices. If the cargo comes  from known consignors or regulated agents, TSA\u2019s all-cargo security  program does not require any additional screening unless the cargo piece  exceeds a certain weight. On the other hand, all-cargo air carriers must  screen all cargo that they accept from unknown consignors or  nonregulated agents.", "Air carriers are responsible for implementing TSA security requirements  predominantly through TSA-approved security programs that describe the  security policies, procedures, and systems the air carriers are to  implement and maintain in order to comply with TSA security  requirements. These requirements include measures related to the  acceptance, handling, and screening of cargo; training of employees in  security and cargo screening procedures; testing employee proficiency in  cargo screening; and access to cargo areas and aircraft. If threat  information or events indicate that additional security measures are  needed to better secure the aviation sector, TSA may issue revised or  new security requirements in the form of security directives or emergency  amendments when more immediate action on behalf of air carriers is  necessary. Air carriers must implement the requirements set forth in  applicable security directives or emergency amendments (unless  otherwise approved by TSA to implement alternative security measures)  in addition to requirements already imposed and enforced by TSA in  order to remain compliant with their respective security programs.", "Under TSA regulations, air carriers are responsible for ensuring the  security of the air cargo they transport, and TSA requirements specify  methods and technologies that may be used to secure U.S-bound air  cargo through screening procedures. Specific screening methods outlined  in the 9/11 Commission Act, for example, include X-ray systems,  explosives detection systems (EDS), explosives trace detection  (ETD), explosives detection canine teams certified by TSA, and physical  search together with manifest verification. The 9/11 Commission Act,  however, requires that screening involve a physical examination or non- intrusive method of assessing whether cargo poses a threat to  transportation security and not solely performing a review of information  about cargo contents or verifying the identity of the cargo\u2019s shipper, when  not performed in conjunction with the screening methods outlined above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Carrier Inspections and Foreign Airport Assessments", "paragraphs": ["To assess whether air carriers properly implement security regulations,  TSA conducts regulatory compliance inspections of U.S. and foreign- flagged air carriers at all foreign airports with U.S.-bound flights.

TSA reported at least one instance of  noncompliance, or violation, for the remaining 16 percent of cargo  inspections. Based on the TSA data, the percentage of inspections with  violations has generally trended downward during this time period. TSA  officials attributed this downward trend to a number of factors including:  (1) TSA\u2019s emphasis on assisting air carriers (through its international  industry representative) in implementing new air cargo security  requirements after the 2010 printer ink cartridge plot; (2) increases in the  number of TSA inspectors to ensure compliance; (3) TSA\u2019s outreach to  foreign governments for improved cargo security under the NCSP  Recognition Program; and (4) TSA efforts to engage with air carriers,  including regional industry summits that included a cargo security focus.", "According to TSA officials, if a TSA inspector finds that an air carrier is  not in compliance with any applicable security requirements, additional  steps are to be taken to correct and record those specific violations,  which can include providing on-the-spot counseling for minor violations or  opening an investigation if the violation is potentially more serious. Upon  conclusion of the investigation, TSA is to make a determination whether  to issue a warning notice, letter of correction, or notice of proposed civil  penalty. For example, based on TSA data, we determined that TSA  inspectors provided counseling (specific guidance) in certain instances  when they found that an air carrier had failed to obtain multiple views of  cargo screened using an X-ray machine.

TSA officials  added that they may consider options other than civil penalties, since  their objective is to encourage compliance through capacity-building  efforts with air carriers, not to generate revenue.

TSA officials also stated  that the transportation of air cargo occurs at all hours of the day and  night, and TSA inspectors must sometimes choose which security  measures to observe. For example, the TSA officials stated that  screening may occur many hours prior to the loading of that cargo on an  aircraft. At both foreign airports we visited, we observed TSA inspectors  working late night or early morning hours to observe air carriers\u2019 cargo  operations.", "Out of the 17 air carrier cargo inspections we observed at the two foreign  airports we visited, TSA inspectors were not able to observe cargo  acceptance procedures for 11 air carriers and cargo screening for 9 air  carriers because these carriers did not receive or screen cargo during the  time of the inspections or the inspectors were busy conducting other  inspections. Because regulated agents screen the vast majority of the  cargo before transporting it to the airport in the NCSP country we visited,  TSA did not observe cargo screening in eight of the nine air carrier cargo  inspections they conducted at that airport. For inspections where TSA  inspectors cannot observe security measures, we observed (and TSA  inspectors confirmed) that they rely on interviews with officials  responsible for cargo security and screening and document reviews (such  a reviewing cargo screening logs) to determine whether air carriers are  complying with TSA air cargo security requirements. At the request of  TSA, air carriers must provide evidence of compliance with applicable  security requirements and its security programs, including copies of  records.", "TSA inspectors also do not inspect air carriers at all foreign airports from  which air carriers transport U.S.-bound cargo. As we reported in May  2018, challenges prevent TSA from completing 100 percent of required  air carrier inspections in Cuba at the frequency established in its standard  operating procedures, including external factors, such as foreign  government requests to reschedule TSA inspections, and limitations in  the data TSA uses to schedule inspections. Further, TSA officials stated  that most all-cargo carriers do not have scheduled flights. Instead, they  wait until they have sufficient cargo to ship and then complete their  routes, which can make it difficult for TSA to schedule inspections\u2014 planned 3 months in advance\u2014during times that the carrier will be flying  cargo to the United States.

Specifically, TSA  inspection teams assess the foreign airports using 44 ICAO standards  and recommended practices, including nine standards or practices that  are specific to the transport of cargo and mail. These standards include  measures for the acceptance, screening, and protection of air cargo. At  the end of each foreign airport assessment, TSA inspectors are to  prepare a report detailing findings on the airport\u2019s overall security posture  and security measures that may also contain recommendations for  corrective actions.", "We observed TSA inspectors conducting the cargo portion of an airport  assessment at one airport we visited and confirmed their use of this  process.

However, TSA inspectors found at least one instance of cargo  noncompliance in about 140 airport assessments (25 percent). Based  on TSA data, the percentage of airport assessments in which TSA  inspectors identified cargo noncompliance issues has generally trended  upward during fiscal years 2012 through 2017. TSA officials attributed this  upward trend to the introduction of a new ICAO standard in 2014 for  ensuring that all cargo shipments designated as higher-risk undergo  enhanced screening.", "TSA assigns a vulnerability score to each ICAO standard and  recommended practice assessed using a rating system, ranging from a  category \u201c1,\u201d which represents full compliance with ICAO standards and  recommended practices, to a \u201c5,\u201d which involves the most serious or  egregious issues. For example, in a fiscal year 2017 foreign airport  assessment, TSA inspectors recorded an instance of noncompliance of  ICAO standard 4.6.3 (that requires protection of cargo from the point of  screening until departure of the aircraft) as a \u201c3\u201d when they identified  holes in a facility perimeter barrier allowing direct access to secured  cargo. Further, during a 2014 airport assessment, TSA inspectors  assessed an instance of noncompliance of the same standard as a \u201c5\u201d  when they observed two unescorted individuals in a security restricted  area without airport identification. Based on the results of TSA\u2019s foreign  airport assessments conducted during fiscal years 2012 through 2017,  TSA inspectors assessed most noncompliance issues identified as a \u201c2\u201d  or \u201c3.\u201d", "As of December 2017, TSA officials reported that certain foreign airports  took corrective actions to address noncompliance issues.

As part of assisting foreign airports, TSA  inspectors educate foreign airport officials on how to mitigate identified  airport security deficiencies. Specifically, TSA provides on-the-spot  counseling, training, technical assistance, security consultations, and  security equipment. In addition, TSA representatives\u2014the primary  liaisons between the U.S. government and foreign governments on  transportation security issues\u2014are responsible for monitoring the  progress made by foreign officials in addressing security deficiencies  identified during TSA airport assessments. Our 2017 review found,  however, that TSA representatives did not always update key information  in TSA\u2019s database for tracking the resolution status of security  deficiencies, including the security deficiencies\u2019 root causes and  corrective actions. To help strengthen TSA\u2019s analysis and decision  making, we recommended that TSA fully capture and specifically  categorize data on the root causes of security deficiencies and the status  of corrective actions to be taken. TSA concurred with our  recommendations and is taking steps to address them, as discussed  below. In addition to working with foreign airports to address deficiencies,  TSA sometimes requires air carriers to adopt security procedures through  security directives or emergency amendments to compensate for serious  vulnerabilities that TSA identified during the foreign airport assessment.  For example, at one airport in Africa, passenger air carriers must hold all  cargo for 24 hours prior to transport.", "In response to our 2017 recommendations, TSA officials told us that they  are in the process of developing a vulnerability resolution tool to capture  the vulnerabilities associated with a specific location, such as a foreign  country or airport. According to TSA officials, the tool will be used to  identify and categorize root causes of vulnerabilities identified during air  carrier inspections and foreign airport assessments, as well as  incorporate other country specific information. TSA officials added that,  once completed, TSA hopes to be able to use the tool to develop  vulnerability mitigation options to, among other things, address security  vulnerabilities identified during air carrier inspections and foreign airport  assessments. For example, if TSA inspectors identify a cargo screening  vulnerability during an air carrier inspection or airport assessment, they  may determine that the root cause is a lack of national-level training  courses. In an example such as this, although TSA does not have the  authority to require a foreign government to take corrective actions, TSA  officials may develop a training curriculum that foreign governments could  deploy, if they choose, to address the identified vulnerability. According to  TSA officials, TSA inspectors and TSA representatives would  subsequently determine whether the training resolved the vulnerability  and, if necessary, consider what additional measures may be appropriate.

Therefore, this report omits sensitive information about  TSA\u2019s risk methodology, the standards that TSA uses to assess foreign  airports, the specific results of TSA\u2019s air carrier inspections and foreign  airport assessments, and information on the types of NCSP recognition  TSA has granted to other countries. Although the information provided in  this report is more limited, the report addresses the same objectives as  the sensitive report and uses the same methodology.", "To describe the steps TSA takes to help ensure that U.S-bound air cargo  is secure, we reviewed relevant laws and regulations, TSA security  policies and procedures, screening program requirements, and security  directives and emergency amendments relevant to air cargo. For  example, we reviewed relevant air carrier security programs and  associated cargo inspection job aids that TSA transportation security  specialists (inspectors) are to use during each air carrier cargo inspection  to ensure that requirements for air carrier security programs are fully  evaluated during each inspection. We also reviewed fiscal years 2012  through 2018 air carrier inspection and airport assessment Master Work  Plans\u2014which TSA uses to track its overseas air carrier inspection and  foreign airport assessment schedule\u2014to better understand how TSA  schedules inspections and assessments and the types of inspections it  conducts. We chose these fiscal years because they cover the time  period since our previous air cargo security review. In addition, we  conducted site visits to two foreign airports that operate flights that  transport air cargo directly to the United States\u2014one in South America  and one in Asia\u2014to observe a nongeneralizable sample of TSA  inspectors conducting a total of 17 air carrier cargo inspections. At one  airport, we also observed the cargo portion of an airport assessment. We  selected these locations based on their designation by TSA as airports of  relatively high risk level, as well as high volume of U.S.-bound air cargo;  TSA\u2019s air carrier inspection schedule; and geographic dispersion. We also  chose these countries to allow us to observe an inspection in one country  where TSA has recognized the NCSP and one country where TSA has  not recognized the NCSP. In addition, we reviewed the final reports TSA  inspectors completed for the air carrier cargo inspections and airport  assessment we observed.", "Further, we obtained and analyzed the results of all air carrier cargo  inspections (close to 5,000) and assessments at foreign airports that are  last points of departure for cargo bound for the United States (about 570)  conducted by TSA inspectors and then entered by them into TSA\u2019s  databases. The Performance and Results Information System (PARIS)  database contains security compliance information on TSA-regulated  entities, including air carriers, and the Global Risk Analysis and Decision  Support (GRADS) system vulnerability tracking sheet contains the results  of foreign airport assessments. We analyzed PARIS and GRADS data  from fiscal years 2012 through 2017, to cover the period since our  previous air cargo security review and to include the 5 most recent years  for which data were available at the time of our review. Specifically, we  analyzed the frequency with which air carriers and foreign airports  complied with TSA air cargo security requirements and select cargo- related International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation security  standards and recommended practices, including the seriousness of  ICAO noncompliance issues TSA inspectors identified. TSA also uses GRADS to populate the Open Standards and Recommended Practices  Finding Tool (OSFT), which tracks efforts taken by TSA and host  governments to address noncompliance issues identified during foreign  airport assessments. We analyzed fiscal years 2012 through 2017 OSFT  data to determine the status of noncompliance issues TSA inspectors  identified. We also reviewed 2017 PARIS data on the number of known  consignor and regulated agent assessments TSA inspectors conducted.", "To assess the reliability of TSA\u2019s air carrier and airport assessment data  captured in PARIS and GRADS tracking sheet and OSFT, we reviewed  program documentation on system controls, interviewed knowledgeable  TSA officials, and analyzed TSA\u2019s data for any potential gaps and errors.  During our assessment, we found some inconsistencies in the tool TSA  uses to follow up on airport noncompliance issues. We rounded airport  compliance information to the nearest 10 for reporting purposes. We also  aggregated ICAO standards and recommended practices within the  Measures Related to Cargo, Mail, and Other Goods category for reporting  purposes because their numbering has changed over time. We  concluded that TSA\u2019s data on air carrier inspections and foreign airport  assessments were sufficiently reliable to provide a general indication of  the level of compliance for TSA\u2019s air carrier inspections and foreign  airport assessments over the period of our analysis.", "In addition, we conducted interviews with TSA officials, foreign  government representatives, and air cargo industry stakeholders, as  follows:", "We interviewed senior TSA officials, inspectors, TSA representatives  stationed overseas, and international industry representatives located  at TSA headquarters and in the field. For example, we met with the  Director of Global Compliance as well as managers and inspectors  from all six TSA regional operations centers who are responsible for  planning and conducting air carrier inspections and assessments of  foreign airports. During our interviews with TSA staff, we discussed  TSA\u2019s efforts to ensure the security of U.S.-bound air cargo prior to  being transported to the United States and air carriers are in  compliance with the applicable TSA cargo security requirements.", "We also interviewed officials at the European Commission (EC) and  from the civil aviation authority in the country in Asia that we visited to  discuss air cargo security standards and their experiences in  coordinating with TSA. We judgmentally selected these foreign  government entities because they (1) aligned with TSA\u2019s inspection  site visit in the country in Asia that we observed and (2) represent  different models of recognition (i.e., TSA recognizes both the  passenger and all-cargo portions of the European Union national  cargo security program (NCSP) but only passenger operations in the  NCSP for the country in Asia that we visited).", "Further, we met with representatives from 2 aviation associations and  11 air carriers that include U.S. and foreign-flagged air carriers, as  well as passenger and all-cargo carriers. One of the international  aviation associations includes air carriers that comprise over 80  percent of the world\u2019s air traffic and the other aviation association  includes the 5 air carriers that transported the largest individual  amounts of U.S.-bound air cargo, by tonnage, in fiscal year 2017. We  based our selection of the 11 air carriers on the relatively high volume  of U.S.-bound cargo they transport; their operation of flights at the  foreign airports we visited; and to obtain a range of coverage  regarding their geographical regions of operation, passenger and all- cargo air carriers, and U.S. and foreign-flagged air carriers.", "Results from these meetings with foreign governments and aviation  industry officials are not generalizable, but provided us with information  on stakeholders\u2019 experiences and perspectives regarding air cargo  security issues.", "To describe the status of TSA\u2019s efforts to recognize and monitor foreign  governments\u2019 air cargo security programs, we reviewed TSA\u2019s policies  and procedures for its NCSP Recognition Program. For example, we  reviewed TSA memos from 2012, 2013, and 2016 that documented the  recognition standards and any subsequent revisions to the NCSP  Recognition Program; as well as TSA\u2019s process for monitoring NCSP  recognition requirements. Additionally, we analyzed letters that TSA  provided since 2012 to the 13 governments it determined had  commensurate air cargo security programs and NCSP information TSA  officials compiled specifically for our review to better understand TSA\u2019s  terms of recognition with each government and the timeframes for  revalidating NCSP recognition. We also reviewed letters TSA provided to  governments it had determined did not have commensurate air cargo  security programs, which provided us with insights into the recognition  process and the criteria applied to TSA\u2019s reviews. Further, we reviewed  the NCSP Recognition Program\u2019s fiscal years 2017 and 2018 work plans,  as well as summaries of TSA\u2019s annual meetings with foreign governments  to better understand TSA\u2019s efforts to engage with recognized  governments.", "We also analyzed the air carrier cargo inspection and airport assessment  data discussed above to determine the number of cargo inspections and  assessments TSA completed in recognized countries from fiscal years  2015 through 2017. We chose this time period because it represents the  3 most recent complete fiscal years, and TSA last recognized a country\u2019s  NCSP in 2015. We also analyzed data from TSA\u2019s Security Policy and  Industry Engagement Policy Inventory on the number of air carriers  participating in the NCSP Recognition Program from fiscal year 2012\u2014 when the NCSP Recognition Program began\u2014through fiscal year 2017\u2014 the most recent complete fiscal year available at the time of our review\u2014 to determine how the level of participation has changed over time. In  addition, we analyzed fiscal year 2017 Department of Transportation  Bureau of Transportation Statistics T-100 data bank, which contains data  on U.S.-bound departures from foreign airports, among other things, to  determine the percentage of overall U.S.-bound air cargo shipped from  NCSP countries. To assess the reliability of the T-100 data, we reviewed  documentation on system controls, interviewed knowledgeable officials  from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and analyzed the data for  any potential gaps and errors. We determined that the T-100 data were  sufficiently reliable for our intended purposes. Finally, we conducted  interviews with TSA and foreign government officials from two countries,  and with representatives of the 11 air carriers described previously to  better understand TSA\u2019s ongoing efforts to recognize and monitor foreign  governments\u2019 air cargo security programs. We also confirmed the status  of countries\u2019 NCSP recognition, as of June 2018, with TSA officials.", "To analyze the extent to which TSA measures the effectiveness of its  various efforts to secure U.S.-bound air cargo, we reviewed documents  that contain information on TSA\u2019s air cargo security objectives, goals, and  performance measures, including (1) information reported to the Office of  Management and Budget in annual budget documents from fiscal years  2014 through 2019, and (2) TSA\u2019s Global Strategies directorates  Operational Implementation Plans from fiscal years 2014 through 2018\u2014 the most recent years available at the time of our review. These plans  include annual objectives and milestones for U.S.-bound air cargo  security programs. We also reviewed the measures in the annual budget  documents and Operational Implementation Plans and compared them  with requirements in TSA\u2019s Global Strategies\u2019 Fiscal Year 2016 Strategy  and Fiscal Year 2018 Strategy Program and applicable laws governing  performance reporting in the federal government, including the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as updated  and expanded by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA). For  example, we assessed whether the performance measures provide  information on the effectiveness of TSA\u2019s various air cargo security  efforts. Although GPRA and GPRAMA requirements apply to those goals  reported by departments (e.g., DHS), we have previously reported that  they can serve as leading practices at other organizational levels, such as  component agencies (e.g., the TSA) for performance management.  Further, we assessed TSA\u2019s performance measures against risk  management principles in the DHS National Infrastructure Protection Plan  and the Transportation Systems Sector-Specific Plan. In addition, we  obtained additional information on how TSA measures the performance of  its air cargo security efforts during our interviews with TSA headquarters  officials.", "The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted  from July 2017 to October 2018 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  subsequently worked with TSA from September 2018 to November 2018  to prepare this public version of the original sensitive report for public  release. This public version was also prepared in accordance with these  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Processes for Conducting Air Carrier Cargo Inspections", "paragraphs": ["Air carrier cargo inspections are conducted by a team of Transportation  Security Administration (TSA) security specialists (inspectors) at foreign  airports who review passenger and all-cargo air carriers\u2019 implementation  of requirements in their TSA-approved security programs, any  amendments or alternative procedures to these security programs, and  applicable security directives or emergency amendments. The frequency  of air carrier cargo inspections at each airport depends on a risk-informed  approach and is influenced, in part, by the airport\u2019s vulnerability to  security breaches, since the security posture of each airport varies,  according to TSA. In general, TSA procedures require TSA to inspect air  carriers with TSA-approved security programs at each airport annually or  semiannually depending on the vulnerability level of the airport, with some  exceptions. The inspection teams\u2014based out of TSA regional operations  centers\u2014generally include one team leader and one team member and  typically take 1 or 2 days, but can involve more inspectors and take  longer to complete depending on the extent of service by the air carrier.  TSA inspectors may spend several days at a foreign airport inspecting air  carriers if there are multiple air carriers serving the United States from  that location. During air carrier cargo inspections, TSA inspectors are to  review applicable security manuals, procedures, and records; interview  air carrier personnel; and are to observe security measures, such as  cargo acceptance and screening, among other activities. Air carriers are  subject to inspection in six key areas of cargo supply chain security, as  described in table 2.", "After completion of an air carrier inspection, TSA inspectors are to record  the results into TSA\u2019s Performance and Results Information System  (PARIS), a database containing security compliance information on TSA- regulated entities. If an inspector finds that an air carrier is in violation of  any applicable security requirements, the inspector is to take additional  steps to record the specific violation(s) and, in some cases, pursue them  with further investigation. For example, TSA inspectors may choose to  resolve violations that are minor or technical in nature, such as an  employee not displaying their identification, through on-the-spot feedback  and instruction, referred to as \u201ccounseling.\u201d For more serious violations,  such as inadequate screener training, TSA inspectors may pursue  administrative actions, including issuing a warning notice, or initiating an  investigation and requiring air carriers to inform TSA of the specific steps  they will take to address the issue. For more egregious violations, such  as failure to screen cargo, TSA inspectors may recommend a civil  penalty. In extreme cases, TSA may withdraw its approval of an air  carriers\u2019 security program and suspend the air carriers\u2019 operations.  According to TSA officials, they rely on a system of progressive  enforcement and carefully consider whether a civil penalty is warranted  based on the compliance history of an air carrier, among other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Processes for Conducting Foreign Airport Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Through its foreign airport assessment program, TSA determines whether  foreign airports that provide passenger or all-cargo air carrier service to  the United States are maintaining and carrying out effective security  measures. To determine the frequency of foreign airport assessments,  TSA uses a risk-informed approach to categorize airports into three risk  tiers, with high risk airports assessed more frequently than medium and  low risk airports. TSA\u2019s assessments of foreign airports are generally  scheduled during the same site visit as air carrier inspections for a certain  location, and the same team of inspectors generally conducts both the  airport assessment and air carrier inspections. According to TSA, it  generally takes 3 to 7 days to complete a foreign airport assessment.  However, the amount of time and number of team members required to  conduct an assessment varies based on several factors, including the  size of the airport and the threat level to civil aviation in the host country.", "TSA uses a multistep process to plan and conduct assessments of  foreign airports. Specifically, TSA must obtain approval from the host  government to conduct an airport assessment, and schedule the date for  the on-site assessment. After conducting an entry briefing with host  country and airport officials, the TSA team conducts an on-site visit to the  airport. During the assessment, the team of inspectors uses several  methods to determine a foreign airport\u2019s level of compliance with 39  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards and five ICAO  recommended practices, to include conducting interviews with airport  officials, examining documents pertaining to the airport\u2019s security  measures, and conducting a physical inspection of the airport. ICAO  standards and recommended practices address operational issues at an  airport, such as ensuring that passengers and cargo are properly  screened and that unauthorized individuals do not have access to  restricted areas of an airport. ICAO standards and recommended  practices also address non-operational issues, such as whether a foreign  government has implemented a national civil aviation security program for  regulating security procedures at its airports and whether airport officials  that are responsible for implementing security controls are subject to  background investigations, are appropriately trained, and are certified  according to the foreign government\u2019s national civil aviation security  program.", "At the close of an airport assessment, TSA inspectors are to brief foreign  airport and government officials on the results. TSA inspectors also  prepare a report in TSA\u2019s Global Risk Analysis and Decision Support  System (GRADS) detailing their findings on the airport\u2019s overall security  posture and security measures, which may contain recommendations for  corrective actions and must be reviewed by TSA field and headquarters  management. As part of the report, TSA assigns a vulnerability score to  each ICAO standard and recommended practice assessed, as well as an  overall vulnerability score for the airport, which corresponds to the level of  compliance for each ICAO standard and recommended practice TSA  assesses. Further, according to TSA officials, cargo experts in TSA  headquarters review the cargo portion of each airport assessment before  the assessment report is finalized. Afterward, TSA shares a summary of  the results with the foreign airport and host government officials. In some  cases, TSA requires air carriers to implement security procedures, such  as requiring air carrier employees to guard the aircraft while on the  tarmac, to address any deficiency that TSA identified during a foreign  airport assessment through the issuance of security directives and  emergency amendments. If the Secretary of Homeland Security  determines that an airport does not maintain and carry out effective  security measures, he or she shall, after advising the Secretary of State,  take action, which generally includes notification to the appropriate  authorities of the country of security deficiencies identified, notification to  the general public that the airport does not maintain effective security  measures, and modification of air carrier operations at that airport."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Nathan Anderson, (206) 287-4804 or andersonn@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact above, Christopher Conrad (Assistant Director),  Paul Hobart (Analyst-in-Charge), Hiwotte Amare, Charles Bausell,  Dominick Dale, Pamela Davidson, Wendy Dye, Mike Harmond, Eric  Hauswirth, Ryan Lester, Benjamin Licht, and Tom Lombardi made key  contributions."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["How does the TSA ensure that explosives aren't hidden in the cargo holds of commercial aircraft?
