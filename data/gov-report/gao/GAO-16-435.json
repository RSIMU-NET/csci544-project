The majority of the funding (99.5 percent) was provided to Egypt through the Department of State's (State) Foreign Military Financing (FMF) account. The funds from this account were used to purchase and sustain a wide variety of military systems, including F-16 aircraft, Apache helicopters, and M1A1 tanks.", "The Departments of Defense (DOD) and State implemented end-use monitoring for equipment transferred to Egyptian security forces, but challenges including obtaining Egyptian government cooperation hindered some efforts. DOD completed all required end-use monitoring inventories and physical security inspections of storage sites for missiles and night vision devices (NVD) in fiscal year 2015, but DOD lacked documentation showing that it completed physical security inspections for these sensitive items in prior years. Despite agreeing to give access, the Egyptian government prevented DOD officials from accessing a storage site to verify the physical security of some NVDs prior to 2015, according to DOD officials and documents. State conducted 12 end-use checks of U.S. equipment exported to Egypt in fiscal years 2011 to 2015, but State data indicate that the Egyptian government's incomplete and slow responses to some inquiries limited U.S. efforts to verify the use and security of certain equipment, including NVDs and riot-control items. Despite this lack of cooperation, since 2008, State has not used outreach programs in Egypt that are intended to facilitate host country cooperation and compliance with State's monitoring program. According to State officials, this was due to the small number of end-use checks conducted in Egypt and the lower priority assigned to Egypt than to other countries.", "The U.S. government completed some, but not all, human rights vetting required by State policy before providing training or equipment to Egyptian security forces.

Moreover, State has not established specific policies and procedures for vetting Egyptian security forces receiving equipment. Although State concurred with a 2011 GAO recommendation to implement equipment vetting, it has not established a time frame for such action.

According to the  OMC-E official responsible for implementing the Golden Sentry program  in Egypt, OMC-E communicated our request to the Egyptian government  along with a list of serial numbers for NVDs subject to annual inventory  requirements. However, the NVD storage facility that the Egyptian  government arranged for us to visit did not house these NVDs, but rather  NVDs that did not require annual inventories. As a result, we were unable  to complete the planned inventory of NVDs subject to enhanced end-use  monitoring requirements. According to the OMC-E official responsible for  Golden Sentry in Egypt, Egyptian government officials may have been  confused by our request and arranged for us to visit this facility because  the NVDs stored there were subject to annual inventory requirements  until December 2014."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Completed Required Annual Physical Security Inspections for Sensitive Equipment Subject to Enhanced End-Use Monitoring in Fiscal Year 2015", "paragraphs": ["Under Golden Sentry enhanced end-use monitoring, DOD personnel also  are required to conduct annual physical security inspections of storage  sites where sensitive equipment subject to enhanced end-use monitoring  is housed.

OMC-E updated its  operating instruction in June 2015 to note, among other things, the  requirement to maintain records of completed physical security checks.", "According to OMC-E officials and documentation, on at least two  occasions before fiscal year 2015, Egyptian officials prevented U.S.  personnel from conducting required physical security inspections at a  storage site housing many of Egypt\u2019s U.S.-origin NVDs that at the time  were subject to Golden Sentry enhanced end-use monitoring. In each  instance, Egyptian officials brought the NVDs to a central location,  enabling DOD personnel to conduct serial number inventories. While  Egypt, as a sovereign nation, is not subject to U.S. government  requirements unless it has agreed to them with the U.S. government, the  Egyptian government has committed in writing to permit inspections of  NVD storage facilities. The Security Assistance Management Manual  includes standard terms and conditions that must be included in a Letter  of Offer and Acceptance, including a provision in which the purchaser  agrees to permit scheduled inspections or physical inventories upon the  U.S. government\u2019s request, except when other means of end-use  monitoring verification shall have been mutually agreed. Five of the six  Letters of Offer and Acceptance covering NVDs subject to enhanced end- use monitoring physical security inspections as of December 1, 2014,  included such a provision. According to the manager of the Golden Sentry  program at the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, one Letter of Offer  and Acceptance did not contain this provision because the NVDs were  provided on a grant basis and the Egyptian government agreed to permit  observation of the items under a separate exchange of letters. In addition  to the terms and conditions in the Letters of Offer and Acceptance, a June  2012 control plan for the physical security and accountability of NVDs  signed by the Egyptian Ministry of Defense notes that NVD storage  facilities will be subject to compliance assessments, audits, and  inventories by U.S. representatives.", "Nonetheless, during a February 2012 Compliance Assessment Visit,  Egyptian officials prohibited DOD inspectors from accessing an NVD  storage facility, which prevented the inspectors from assessing whether  the proper physical security measures were in place, according to DOD  officials. This contributed to DOD\u2019s assessment that Egypt\u2019s procedures  to comply with the conditions of the transfer agreements for U.S.-provided  defense articles needed improvement. In October 2014, Egyptian officials  again prohibited OMC-E personnel from accessing the same NVD  storage facility to verify physical security, according to DOD  documentation. A senior OMC-E official stated that he asked Egyptian  officials to comply with the requirement to permit physical inspections of  NVD storage facilities but the officials did not comply. According to  another OMC-E official responsible for Golden Sentry end-use monitoring  in Egypt, the Egyptian Armed Forces told OMC-E officials that they  brought the NVDs to a central location to be inventoried for OMC-E\u2019s  convenience and security because the NVDs were deployed with units  located around the country, including some unsafe locations. The same  official noted that the OMC-E explained to its Egyptian counterparts that  DOD\u2019s policy required them to either verify the physical security of the  facilities where the NVDs were housed or review the Egyptian Armed  Forces\u2019 log books to confirm that the NVDs were deployed with military  units in the field and were no longer in storage.

Embassy Cairo completed 2 of 12 Blue Lantern checks in Egypt  from fiscal years 2011 through 2015 within State\u2019s recommended time  frames. According to the Blue Lantern Guidebook, prelicense checks are  requested to be completed within 30 days and postshipment checks are  requested to be completed within 45 days. In fiscal years 2011 through  2015, Embassy Cairo conducted 1 of its 8 prelicense checks within  State\u2019s 30-day goal, and completed 1 of 4 postshipment checks within  State\u2019s 45-day goal.

According to State guidance, State should defer making a  decision on a license application until the results of prelicense checks are  received. We found that State generally complied with this guidance for  prelicense checks in Egypt. Lengthy delays in completing prelicense  checks can be costly to U.S. exporters and foreign end users and  ultimately harm U.S. competitiveness, according to State guidance.", "According to State officials, some of the delays in completing Blue  Lantern checks in Egypt were due to the Egyptian government\u2019s slow  responses to State\u2019s inquiries. For example, in one postshipment check  requested in June 2013, the Egyptian government did not respond to  questions related to this Blue Lantern check for over 8 months, according  to our analysis of State cables. This check involved thermal imagers,  which are considered to be sensitive night vision equipment. As a result,  State experienced substantial delays verifying the location, security, and  end use of these items. According to our analysis of State data, in  another postshipment check requested in October 2013 involving satellite  components, State did not receive information it deemed sufficient to  close the check from the Egyptian government for more than 6 months  and, according to State officials, the satellite was launched before State  was able to complete the Blue Lantern check. Another two Blue Lantern  checks requested in May and June 2013 took over 100 days to complete.  According to State officials, political instability in Egypt and tensions in the  U.S.-Egypt relationship at the time affected the timeliness of the Egyptian  government\u2019s response to these four checks. In the two most recent  Blue Lantern prelicense checks, both of which involved NVDs going to the  Egyptian Ministry of Interior, a State official noted that there were delays  in obtaining a response because inquiries first had to be routed through  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. For one of these checks, State did not  receive a response to two of its initial Blue Lantern inquiries, and as a  result, completing the check took 4 months.", "State officials also noted that Embassy Cairo was under ordered  departure status from July to November 2013, which limited staffing at the  embassy, and a staffing transition in 2014 also contributed to delays in  completing some checks. For instance, limited staffing at Embassy Cairo  during the latter half of 2013 affected the timeliness of four Blue Lantern  checks active during that period. According to State officials, the lack of  available staff at Embassy Cairo during the ordered departure caused  embassy officials to request additional time to complete Blue Lantern  checks and to request that at least one Blue Lantern check be put on a  temporary hold during that period. As a result of the hold and the  Egyptian government\u2019s slow response time, this check took 8 months to  complete. A State official also noted that a staffing transition in the  summer of 2014 affected another check. In this case, Embassy Cairo  took 52 days to contact the Egyptian government after receiving the Blue  Lantern cable requesting the prelicense check, and as a result, the check  took more than 60 days to complete.", "Incomplete responses to some Blue Lantern checks. During fiscal  years 2011 through 2015, the Egyptian government provided complete  responses to 4 of 12 Blue Lantern checks. For 6 of the 12 checks, it  provided partial responses to the questions asked by State officials from  Embassy Cairo. For 1 of the 12 checks, the Egyptian government did not  provide any response. For another 1 of the 12 checks, State officials from  the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls did not receive a response  from Embassy Cairo officials, so we were unable to determine whether  Embassy Cairo made inquiries with the Egyptian government and  whether the Egyptian government responded to any inquiries that may  have been made. Directorate of Defense Trade Controls officials closed  the 2 cases for which it received no response, both prelicense checks, as  unfavorable and recommended that the license applications not be  approved. In the 6 Blue Lantern cases where the Egyptian government  partially responded to the questions asked by State officials at Embassy  Cairo, State closed the cases as favorable in 5 of the 6 cases. In one  prelicense check, the Egyptian government did not respond to questions  about the physical security of the storage site where they planned to store  NVDs, nor did it specify the branch of the Ministry of Interior\u2014an  organization identified by State as having security force units of concern  for human rights violations\u2014that would be the end user of the NVDs. In  another prelicense check, State asked the Egyptian government to  confirm the involvement of intermediaries from two other countries in the  transaction as well as the specific type and quantity of the items it had  ordered; however, the Egyptian government only confirmed the  involvement of one of the intermediaries and did not provide any  information about the type and quantity of items ordered. In a  postshipment check involving the transfer of riot control items, such as  rubber ball cartridges and smoke grenades, to the Egyptian Ministry of  Interior, the Egyptian government did not respond to a question about the  disposition and use of the items, according to a cable from Embassy  Cairo. State closed each of these three checks as favorable. Table 8  shows a breakdown of the response-completeness status for the 12 Blue  Lantern checks and the corresponding count of favorable and unfavorable  results.", "State officials offered various reasons to explain why the Egyptian  government provided partial responses to Blue Lantern inquiries and why  State did not make greater efforts to obtain complete responses.  According to State officials, the Egyptian government is sensitive to  questions that it views as possibly infringing on its sovereignty, including  questions about its purchases of U.S. military equipment. In addition, one  State official who has conducted Blue Lantern checks in Egypt noted that  the Egyptian government may not entirely understand Blue Lantern  inquiries. According to State officials, a response to every question posed  in a Blue Lantern check is not necessary for a licensing determination.  These officials also noted that if their key concerns have been addressed,  they are generally comfortable closing the check. However, as previously  noted, because State officials at Embassy Cairo do not conduct optional  site visits, written responses from the Egyptian government provide the  only available information on the use and security of equipment  purchased through direct commercial sales.

However,  unlike its required process for vetting individuals and units nominated to  receive U.S.-provided training (see fig. 1), State does not have policies or  procedures specifically requiring vetting of Egyptian security forces slated  to receive U.S.-funded equipment. State policy encourages the use of the  INVEST system to conduct vetting for equipment recipients but allows  posts the flexibility to use other methods to comply with the Leahy laws.  For Egypt, State uses memos to attest to its compliance with the Leahy  laws for equipment provided to Egyptian security forces. While the  memos declare State\u2019s compliance with the Leahy laws, State officials  acknowledged that there is no required process used to support the  statements in the memos and that INVEST is not used to vet Egyptian  recipients of U.S. equipment.", "We reviewed the eight memos that State drafted for fiscal years 2011  through 2015 that covered all FMF assistance allocated for Egypt during  this period. The purpose of these memos is to request the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s approval for the apportionment of FMF funds  allocated for Egypt. In each of the memos, State included a statement  that it was not aware of any credible information of gross violations of  human rights by any unit to which assistance would be provided. More  recent memos also included a statement that State would ensure that  FMF assistance for Egypt would be provided only to units the department  had positively determined not to have been linked to human rights  violations. None of the memos we reviewed specified particular Egyptian  units that were authorized to receive the FMF assistance covered by the  memo. However, two of the eight memos we reviewed identified particular  Egyptian security forces that would not be receiving assistance covered  by the memo. For example, a September 2013 memo requesting the  apportionment of approximately $584 million in fiscal year 2013 FMF  funds stated that no funds would be used to support the Cairo military  police. State\u2019s three memos requesting the apportionment of fiscal years  2014 and 2015 funds noted that violent incidents in Egypt in July and  August 2013 and the Egyptian military\u2019s operations in the Sinai remained  under review.", "State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs is responsible for drafting the  FMF memos for Egypt, including the statements regarding compliance  with the Leahy laws; however, the bureau said that it does not play a role  in supporting the statements in the memos and that this was the  responsibility of DRL. The DRL official responsible for reviewing these  memos told us that he may check the unit names of the prospective  equipment recipients if that information is available at the time the memos  are drafted, to see if he is aware of human rights concerns with any of the  recipient units; however, State officials told us that the specific items to be  financed and the specific units or individuals to receive the items are not  generally known at the time the memos are circulated and may not be  known until many months or even years later. According to State  officials, this is due to the Foreign Military Sales process, which can  involve lengthy negotiations with Egypt and other partner countries about  their requirements and extended contracting processes for complex  military systems. Also, according to State officials, the receipt of sale and  transfer of equipment is often concluded in the United States, with the  Egyptian government then responsible for freighting the equipment to  Egypt. This can result in delays in the final Egyptian recipients receiving  the equipment, according to State officials. In addition, State does not  currently have policies or procedures in place to require vetting after the  equipment has been furnished to the Egyptian government and the  ultimate end-user unit or individual is known, according to State officials.  State officials noted that in some cases, Egyptian security forces receive  training in association with equipment that they are provided and are thus  vetted through INVEST before receiving the training. Finally, State  officials said that in cases where there is no direct recipient for U.S.  assistance, such as when bulk equipment and other forms of assistance  (e.g., ammunition, uniforms, radios, spare parts) are provided to a  country\u2019s military services or the armed forces as a whole for general use,  it is a challenge for State to verify the identity of the final recipients of this  equipment.", "Additionally, key officials with information about human rights violations in  Egypt are not involved in drafting and reviewing these memos. Embassy  Cairo officials who are responsible for managing Leahy vetting at the post  stated that they do not play a role in the development of these memos.  These Embassy Cairo officials stated that it was not clear what role, if  any, the post should be playing in ensuring Leahy law compliance for  Egyptian equipment recipients and that more guidance from State  headquarters on this issue would be beneficial. NEA and DRL officials in  State headquarters who were responsible for conducting human rights  vetting for Egyptian training recipients also stated that they do not play a  role in ensuring Leahy law compliance for equipment provided to  Egyptian security forces.", "We previously reported on State\u2019s use of memos to comply with Leahy  law requirements for equipment in a 2011 report examining human rights  vetting in the Persian Gulf countries. In that report, we found that State  did not conduct comparable human rights vetting for recipients of  equipment as it did for recipients of training. We recommended that State  implement individual- and unit-level human rights vetting for recipients of  U.S.-funded equipment to reduce the risk that U.S.-funded equipment  might be used by violators of human rights in the Persian Gulf countries.  State concurred with our recommendation, but as of November 2015,  State had not implemented it. DRL officials we interviewed acknowledged  that the current approach to complying with the Leahy laws for equipment  needs to be strengthened to ensure that equipment will not be provided to  security forces that have committed gross violations of human rights.  According to DRL officials, State is continuing to work to develop and  implement a comprehensive policy on equipment vetting that is different  from the current, memo-based procedure, but it has not established a  specific time frame for doing so. In addition, a DRL official noted that DRL  is working on a revised version of the INVEST system, to be completed in  May 2016, that is expected to help facilitate equipment vetting. However,  the DRL official stated that DRL has not made specific determinations  about what functions related to equipment vetting will be included in the  updated system or about time frames for developing agency policies and  procedures that would require use of the updated system for equipment  vetting. Standard practices in program management include, among other  things, developing a plan to execute projects within a specific time  frame.", "Because State has not developed policies or procedures specifically  requiring vetting for Egyptian recipients of U.S. equipment, it is more  difficult to reasonably ensure that U.S. equipment will not be provided to  Egyptian security forces for whom there may be credible information that  a unit has committed gross violations of human rights.

For example, U.S. officials said that  more detailed organizational charts for the Egyptian Ministry of Interior  (MOI) would help the U.S. government differentiate between, on one  hand, MOI subunits that were of concern for gross violations of human  rights and thus were not able to receive U.S. assistance and, on the other  hand, those MOI subunits that were not likely involved in the incidents for  which State had credible information that human rights violations had  occurred.", "The State Leahy law requires that State develop procedures to ensure  that when an individual is designated to receive U.S. training or other  assistance, the individual\u2019s unit is vetted as well as the individual.

State guidance  directs embassies to work with host-country counterparts to identify units  for the purposes of vetting and notes the importance of host-country  cooperation.", "Embassy Cairo officials noted that issues related to Leahy vetting have  been a significant source of tensions with the Egyptian government. In  some cases, Egyptian agencies refused to allow any of their members to  attend training events if any individuals from their organizational unit  failed to clear vetting. In addition, embassy officials acknowledged that  they stopped proposing training to the Egyptian government under certain  programs, such as NADR ATA, because they did not want to risk causing  further strain in the bilateral relationship if Egyptian officials were not  approved through the vetting process. U.S. officials noted that this  cessation in submitting candidates for training was one of the reasons  that, since fiscal year 2013, no Egyptian security forces had been rejected  through the Leahy vetting process due to credible information of a gross  violation of human rights.", "We requested to meet with several Egyptian government ministries to  obtain their perspective on the Leahy vetting program during our fieldwork  in Egypt, but the Egyptian government did not respond to our request,  according to State officials.

In February 2015, State  and DOD issued a joint remediation policy that outlined standards for  exercising these exceptions in the Leahy laws and allowing assistance to  resume to units previously deemed ineligible. However, State officials we  interviewed said that if a larger unit is rejected in INVEST, it is possible for  smaller units within that larger unit to be subsequently approved for  training without having to meet the standards in the February 2015 State- DOD guidance, if it can be demonstrated that these smaller units were  not implicated in the gross violation of human rights. This is consistent  with State\u2019s 2012 Leahy vetting guide, which states that the relevant unit  for vetting purposes is the lowest deployable organizational element of a  security force capable of exercising command and discipline over its  members. State officials said the policy allows State to approve training  for smaller units or individuals within a larger unit that is ineligible to  receive assistance, if it can be demonstrated that the smaller units or  individuals, by the nature of their duties, geographic location, or other  circumstances, would not have been involved in the gross violation of  human rights. According to U.S. officials, this approach has been used in  Egypt on certain occasions. State has also used this approach in cases  where units have not been officially rejected in INVEST but have been  suspended because State has identified human rights concerns with the  unit and there is a lack of sufficient information to complete vetting for the  nominated individuals or units.", "While this approach has been used in Egypt, and although State\u2019s policy  allows smaller units to be identified as discrete units for purposes of  Leahy vetting, State has not established specific procedures for clearing  smaller units within a larger security force organization that has been  rejected due to credible information of a gross violation of human rights.  For example, State\u2019s Leahy vetting guide, Embassy Cairo\u2019s standard  operating procedures, and State and DOD\u2019s joint remediation guidance  do not specifically discuss the ability to clear such units and do not  establish procedures for doing so.

However, gaps in the implementation of  these end-use monitoring programs\u2014in part due to limited cooperation  from the Egyptian government\u2014hampers DOD\u2019s and State\u2019s ability to  provide such assurances. For instance, the Egyptian government\u2019s  incomplete and slow responses to U.S. inquiries hindered State\u2019s efforts  to ensure that equipment sold through direct commercial sales is used as  intended. State has recently made funding available for activities to foster  greater host government cooperation with Blue Lantern requirements in  some countries. However, such activities have not been used in Egypt to  help improve the completeness and timeliness of these end-use  monitoring checks targeting U.S. arms and other military items sold  through direct commercial sales.", "The United States has a policy interest in leveraging U.S. assistance to  encourage Egypt and other foreign governments to prevent their security  forces from committing human rights violations and to hold their forces  accountable when violations occur. However, the U.S. government has  not consistently vetted all individuals and units in the Egyptian security  forces for human rights concerns before providing training, as required by  its policies. State also does not have policies or procedures for vetting  specific individuals and units before it provides equipment, even though  military equipment constitutes the vast majority of U.S. assistance to  Egypt. Without such vetting, the U.S. government risks providing U.S.  equipment, in violation of the Leahy laws, to Egyptian security forces that  have committed human rights abuses. Additionally, gaps in  documentation and procedures may limit the effectiveness of State\u2019s  process for vetting prospective recipients of training. The absence of  certain training rosters for Egyptian security forces that received U.S.  training limits the ability of U.S. agencies and third parties to verify  whether these forces were properly vetted in accordance with State\u2019s  policies. This also limits accountability over U.S. efforts to train and equip  Egyptian security forces. State\u2019s lack of procedures for determining when  individuals or subunits may be eligible to receive training, despite being  part of larger entities prohibited from receiving assistance under the  Leahy laws, increases the likelihood that these determinations may be  applied inconsistently.

We determined that the  INVEST data State provided were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report.", "To assess the extent to which the U.S. government conducted required  vetting of Egyptian security officials before they received U.S.-funded  training, we collected rosters of Egyptian security forces that received  U.S.-funded training from State and DOD in fiscal year 2011 through  March 31, 2015. In total, we received rosters for training funded through  seven appropriations accounts. These seven accounts included four  State accounts\u2014FMF, IMET, INCLE, and Peacekeeping Operations\u2014 and three DOD accounts\u2014the Countering Terrorism Fellowship Program,  the DOD Regional Centers, and Joint Combined Exchange Training.  Using these training rosters, we developed a generalizable random  sample of 166 names from a population of 3,743 Egyptian security forces  that received training funded through these seven accounts during this  period. The sample included names from the roster for each of the seven  accounts. We then cross-checked the names in our sample with human  rights vetting data from the INVEST system to verify that the Egyptian  security forces were vetted before receiving the training. In addition to  receiving rosters for training funded through the seven accounts, we also  requested training rosters from State on Egyptian security forces that had  received training funded through the NADR account. However, State told  us that it was unable to provide this information. As a result, we were not  able to include the NADR account in our sample and we were not able to  assess the extent to which State had completed required human rights  vetting for Egyptian security forces that received training funded through  this account.", "To gather additional information on how State ensures compliance with  the Leahy laws for equipment that it provided to Egyptian security forces,  we also reviewed eight State apportionment memos covering all FMF  assistance for Egypt in fiscal years 2011 through 2015. We assessed the  extent to which each of these memos addressed Leahy vetting  compliance in Egypt. Finally, we assessed State\u2019s actions to ensure  compliance with the Leahy laws against standards in its Foreign Affairs  Manual related to creating records and management controls. We also  assessed State\u2019s actions against established internal control standards in  the federal government and against standards established by the Project  Management Institute.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2015 to April 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
