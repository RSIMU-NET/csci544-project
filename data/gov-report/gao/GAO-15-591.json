However, some said creating such an organization could duplicate existing standards, codes of conduct, or the services provided by other professional organizations. Some said that establishing a professional organization without evaluating the effectiveness of SEC's new regulations (which became effective in June 2015) would be premature. These rules require each NRSRO to establish training, experience, and competence standards to ensure analysts produce accurate ratings and to periodically test analysts' knowledge of the NRSRO's procedures and methodologies.

In addition, successful professional organizations require  personnel\u2014whether paid staff, contractors, or volunteers\u2014with  experience leading and managing professional organizations and the  technical knowledge and leadership to help ensure the organization\u2019s  relevance. As we noted earlier, the three largest NRSROs employ 88  percent of credit rating analysts. Some NRSRO representatives, analysts,  and experts commented that this might require an organization to take  additional steps to ensure it considers the experience and needs of  members from both larger and smaller NRSROs in determining its  organizational structure and personnel decisions.", "According to most representatives of existing professional organizations,  a number of steps can be taken to safeguard an organization\u2019s  independence from dominance by certain elements in an industry. For  example, an organization can help balance members\u2019 interests through  the composition of its board. Several existing professional organizations  have nonindustry representation on the board and MSRB officials noted  the Dodd-Frank Act modified MSRB\u2019s board structure to require the  majority of the board members be independent public representatives.representative of one professional organization explained that seeking  stakeholder input or allowing for public comment before announcing new  policies or rules also could help ensure that a variety of views and  experiences were taken into account. Another representative of a  professional organization noted that the organization requires  professionals who volunteer to participate in the organization\u2019s activities\u2014 such as the development or oversight of standards or the development of  educational and testing programs\u2014to attest that they will engage with the  professional organization independently of their engagement with their  employer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Meaningful Activities", "paragraphs": ["Creating and operating any professional organization requires developing  core activities and services, such as professional standards, education  and training curricula, certification tests, and structures to oversee  member compliance. According to most analysts and NRSRO  representatives, the proprietary methodologies used to conduct ratings  and the specialization of credit rating analysts\u2019 knowledge might make  developing a meaningful credential or set of professional standards  challenging. According to representatives from existing professional  organizations, developing these services is a time- and labor-intensive  process that requires extensive stakeholder involvement and buy-in.  However, most NRSRO representatives and some analysts with whom  we spoke noted that opportunities to share information about credit rating  activities to develop those standards could be limited due to concerns  about safeguarding confidential information and proprietary ratings  methodologies. In addition, they explained that conducting ratings is  highly technical, varies greatly depending on the specific asset class and  the types of ratings being provided in that class, and relies on the  individual NRSRO\u2019s methodology. For example, the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) recently led an exercise that found the ratings results  diverged widely among six credit rating agencies that conducted  hypothetical ratings of identical pools of mortgage loans. A few NRSRO  representatives noted that they had individually identified core knowledge,  including information on financial market operations that their analysts  needed to know. This core knowledge could provide the basis for an  examination or credentialing process or the development of professional  standards, but the extent to which it would promote higher quality ratings  was unclear. For example, most credit rating analysts with whom we  spoke noted that this core knowledge was a valuable foundation for  conducting ratings, but producing ratings also required specialized  knowledge and experience. As a result, some NRSRO representatives  and analysts stated that a relatively limited set of standardized knowledge  or activities was applicable across all NRSROs or asset classes.", "According to representatives of existing professional organizations, one  approach to bridging differences among actors in a profession is to  develop principle-based standards, rather than rules. Principle-based  standards provide a broad framework on the types of behavior and  approaches to certain activities expected of members. For example, the  AICPA Code of Professional Conduct identifies specific principles to  guide certified public accountants\u2019 activities, including the responsibility to  conduct work with integrity and in the public interest. Under a principle- based approach, individual professionals are expected to apply the  principles to assess the unique factors and circumstances that arise  during their work. However, these standards may stop short of providing  specific details on acceptable actions or activities.

SEC could expand its oversight of analysts  by defining minimum experience or knowledge requirements for  analysts or requiring all analysts to pass an examination before  conducting ratings. One expert and SEC officials noted that SEC  might require additional resources to implement any additional  activities or requirements.", "Engage a third party. A third party (such as an existing professional  organization, a private business, or a taskforce of regulatory and other  experts) could be engaged to develop and communicate professional  standards for credit rating analysts and oversee application of the  standards. Some experts noted this approach might be more  efficient than creating a new organization because it could leverage  existing resources and mitigate concerns about larger NRSROs  dominating an organization. SEC considered public comments  regarding this type of approach after proposing its new rule for the  training and testing of credit rating analysts, but did not adopt this  approach because it did not allow NRSROs sufficient flexibility to  design standards tailored to their business model, size, and  methodologies.", "Broaden the potential member base. According to some analysts,  an organization with a broader membership base (all credit analysts,  not just those that determine credit ratings) would have a larger  potential membership base and could provide services, such as a  credential, which were valued outside of the credit rating profession.  Representatives of one NRSRO noted that this might be developed  within an existing organization, such as CFA Institute.", "However, as we noted earlier, a few analysts and some NRSRO  representatives and experts did not see a need for a professional  organization and some analysts and NRSRO representatives and one  expert did not identify any alternative structures to establish or oversee  standards and a code of conduct for credit rating analysts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SEC for review and comment.

This report describes views on (1) the potential merits of and need for a  professional organization for credit rating analysts; and (2) identified  components of and challenges associated with creating and operating  such an organization, and possible alternatives for establishing and  overseeing professional standards and a code of ethical conduct.", "To address both objectives, we conducted a literature review. We used  Internet search techniques and keyword search terms to identify available  information about the credit rating industry, including the definition of a  credit rating; number and nature of companies that serve as credit rating  agencies, or NRSROs; and relevant laws and regulations, including the  Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) recent rules requiring  NRSROs to establish standards of training, experience, and competence  for rating analysts. We also identified sources describing the founding,  development, and assessment of professional organizations (or  associations) and professional designations. From research databases  such as ProQuest and LexisNexis, we obtained information from publicly  available documents, such as financial reports, journals, trade  publications, periodicals, studies, white papers, and aggregated  databases relevant to professional organizations and the credit rating  industry.", "To address the first objective, we collected and analyzed information on  existing organizations that develop and oversee professional standards  and codes of conduct, including the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants (AICPA); American Society of Association Executives  (ASAE); CFA Institute; Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA);  Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA); Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board  (MSRB); and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).  We interviewed representatives of these organizations to obtain  information on the merits of creating a professional organization, in  general, as well as the potential merits of creating an independent  professional organization for credit rating analysts. We also obtained  available information on the advantages and disadvantages of a  professional organization, why such organizations are generally formed  (the perceived need, pertaining to the specific industry, profession, or the  public), as well as the need for professional standards and codes of  conduct for members.", "We obtained information from transcripts of SEC\u2019s roundtable on credit  ratings held on May, 14, 2013, in which participants, including NRSROs,  international regulators, academics, and other industry experts, discussed  ethics training and possible certification requirements for credit rating  analysts. We also obtained information from comments submitted in  response to SEC\u2019s 2011 proposed rules to enhance oversight of  NRSROs.  We obtained and analyzed information on existing NRSRO  professional standards and codes of conduct, including information on  each NRSRO\u2019s Code of Conduct/Ethics submitted to SEC as part of their  annual certification on \u201cForm NRSRO\u201d for calendar year 2014 (the most  recent filings to date). We also analyzed the International Organization of  Securities Commissions (IOSCO) Code of Conduct Fundamentals for  Credit Rating Agencies as well as SEC\u2019s new rule requiring NRSROs to  establish standards for training, experience, and competence of credit  rating analysts. Additionally, we reviewed the 2014 Summary Report of  Commission Staff\u2019s Examinations of Each Nationally Recognized  Statistical Rating Organization and the 2014 Annual Report to Congress  on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for reported information on NRSRO professional standards and codes of conduct.", "To address the second objective, we held semi-structured interviews with  representatives of the professional organizations we identified, and  reviewed their websites and publicly available documents. We obtained  and analyzed information on the operational structure and approaches  used to provide services to members including the organizations\u2019  membership requirements, funding channel, government role, and source  of authority. We also obtained information on the resources and actions  needed to create and operate a professional organization for credit rating  analysts and possible organizations that could serve as models for such  an organization. We used the information we obtained through interviews  and the results of our literature review to develop a working definition of  an independent professional organization and identify three potential  models of a professional organization for credit rating analysts (see fig. 3,  app. II). We defined an independent professional organization as a  membership-based organization that is established to help protect the  integrity of the profession, provide safeguards for investors and the  general public, and take steps to safeguard independence through the  composition of a governing board. To ensure the validity of our results,  we provided our definition and models to the existing organizations for  comment and adjusted our results based on their input. We also obtained  information on other structures or instruments (regulatory or otherwise)  that could be used to establish standards and a code of ethical conduct  for governing and overseeing the profession. For example, we obtained  and analyzed information on international regulatory organizations in four  jurisdictions (Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and Turkey) identified  by SEC as having established various structures for oversight, such as  direct registration and licensure for credit rating analysts and related  professional standards and codes of conduct for the profession.", "To gather a diverse set of perspectives, we interviewed SEC officials;  NRSRO representatives; industry experts and stakeholders\u2014including  investors, academics, representatives of credit rating and analysis firms  not registered with SEC, representatives of the Software and Information  Industry Association, representatives of a research institute, and officials  with the European Securities and Markets Authority and IOSCO\u2014and  leadership or governing bodies of existing professional organizations.We obtained their views about (1) the advantages and disadvantages (for  regulators, credit rating agencies, rating analysts, investors, and the  public) of creating a professional organization for credit rating analysts,  and (2) how a professional organization would fit within the existing  structure of regulation and oversight of credit rating agencies and credit  rating analysts. We also obtained their views on the nature and common characteristics of professional organizations,  including organizational structure, relationship to members, and  regulatory body (such as SEC); professional certifications for members; resources and actions needed to create and operate a professional  organization for rating analysts; organizations that could serve as an appropriate model in evaluating  the feasibility and merits of a professional organization for rating  analysts; and how and to what extent professional organizations develop and  oversee professional standards and a code of ethical conduct for  members.", "We also obtained their views on the potential challenges involved in  creating and operating an organization, such as obtaining funding,  attracting and retaining membership, developing professional standards  and a code of ethical conduct, and overseeing rating analysts. We  obtained their views on the need for an independent professional  organization for credit rating analysts; the circumstances under which  analysts and other stakeholders would use the services of such an  organization; and how, or whether, an independent professional  organization for credit rating analysts would address some of the current  challenges facing the credit rating industry.", "We used a modified Delphi approach to identify and confirm the most  important issues for each objective. In doing so, we conducted an initial  round of interviews with officials in SEC\u2019s Office of Credit Ratings,  representatives of select NRSROs and professional organizations, and  select industry experts to discuss the information collected through our  literature search. In our second round of interviews, we held semi- structured interviews with senior management from all NRSROs, and  select industry experts and stakeholders to obtain a depth of  understanding and a variety of perspectives, as well as to corroborate the  information obtained in the research and initial interviews. The criteria for  selecting these interviewees consisted of factors such as participation in  prior SEC events, including roundtables; recommendations from GAO  stakeholders, industry experts, and other external stakeholders;  participation in prior congressional hearings or industry conferences;  appearance in our literature reviews and Internet searches; and  bibliographies of relevant papers and studies where they were mentioned.", "Finally, to ensure that we obtained the perspectives of credit rating  analysts in particular, we conducted a series of 11 focus groups with  approximately 100 credit rating analysts, at 6 of the 10 NRSROs. We  judgmentally selected 6 of the 10 NRSROs based on the size of the firm  (number of ratings performed and number of analyst staff) to ensure a  mix of large, medium, and small firms were represented. At five of these  firms, we held two separate focus groups\u2014one with analysts and one  with supervisory analysts (analyst staff with supervisory responsibilities).  We contacted NRSROs to request data to identify and select a  judgmental sample of analysts. To promote widespread NRSRO  participation, we generally provided three options to NRSROs for  identifying analysts for selection to participate in our focus group  discussions: (1) provide a complete list of all analysts; (2) provide names  of 25 analysts and 25 supervisory analysts; (3) identify and self-select  approximately 8-12 analysts. Additionally, we requested that the  NRSROs provide information on analysts\u2019 years of service with the organization, credit rating specialization, geographic location.", "We tailored our requests to account for the number of analyst staff. For  example, for the smaller NRSROs (60 or fewer analyst staff), we  requested that they provide a complete list of all analysts. After receiving  the information from NRSROs, we selected from 8 to 15 analysts to  participate in the focus groups. (We allowed at least two analysts to serve  as alternates, if necessary.) We selected credit rating analysts to obtain a  range of years of experience, job title, and class of ratings for which they  participated in credit rating determinations. We grouped each list by class  of ratings and ordered the groups by years of experience. We verified the  total number of analysts and supervisory analyst names provided, divided  the total number by 15 to come up with a selection number (the \u201cnth\u201d  number), and selected every nth name to participate in the focus groups.  In addition, to ensure that every asset class represented had a participant  in the focus group, where necessary, we selected alternates with similar  titles, years of service, and credit rating specialization. We also selected  fewer than 8-15 analysts at the smaller NRSROs. For example, one   In one case, we slightly  NRSRO had less than 10 supervisory analysts.adjusted our methodology to accommodate one NRSRO management\u2019s  request that they be able to select alternate analysts to participate in the  focus groups, if alternates were needed. The management noted that  they needed some flexibility in the event that any analysts we selected  were unable to participate due to vacation, training, or other scheduling  conflicts.", "In facilitating each focus group, we focused our discussions on the  following topics:  current training received and any certifications held by credit rating  analysts; extent to which credit rating analysts currently have access to the  services typically offered by a professional organization, such as  education, professional standards and a code of ethical conduct for  governing the profession, professional certification or license,  oversight, and public education, outreach, or advocacy; extent to which there is a need for a professional organization for  credit rating analysts and any potential challenges in operating an  organization for analysts; potential advantages and disadvantages of creating a professional  organization for credit rating analysts based on the three models we  developed; and  feasibility of developing and overseeing professional standards for  credit rating analysts.", "Based on records of these discussions, we analyzed the content to define  overall themes and develop our findings. We also used the results from  the focus groups to corroborate information we obtained in our interviews  on the merits and need for an independent professional organization for  analysts; potential requirements for creating and operating a professional  organization; associated challenges; and potential alternatives to creating  a professional organization. These results led to our synopsis of the  feasibility and merits of a professional organization for credit rating  analysts.

Finally, as of  May 2015, three organizations (AICPA, FINRA, and the State Bar of  California) required members to receive a certain number of periodic  continuing education hours to maintain membership.", "Standard development. All the organizations had or were establishing  professional standards, in particular rules or requirements for ethical  conduct. According to representatives of professional organizations, the  organizations need to consider the extent to which they utilize principle- based standards\u2014broad guidance about the behavior expected of  members\u2014rather than rule-based guidance that details specific  requirements or prohibitions. According to one representative, the extent  of the organization\u2019s resources and information about members\u2019 activities  helps determine the type of standards it might adopt. For instance,  members tend to ask for more detailed rules and guidance if they must  undergo rigorous enforcement or inspections for their certifications or  jobs. Principle-based standards may be more appropriate when  organizations have limited resources and access to information on  members. Finally, representatives of one organization noted that  organizations also need to educate members about standards to help  members understand the standards and implement them in challenging  situations.", "Overseeing standards. Approaches for overseeing member compliance  with professional standards varied depending on the authority provided to  organizations. Organizations with mandatory membership that derived  their authority from regulators or legislation tended to have robust  examination and inspection processes. For instance, the State Bar of  California reviews formal allegations of misconduct and determines any  disciplinary actions. FINRA and MSRB engage in formal supervisory  review of members.rely on voluntary compliance with the standards, such as periodic  reaffirmation of compliance and voluntary reporting.

All six organizations have certain  requirements for members\u2014based on years or type of education or  professional experience, agreement to adhere to standards or rules of  professional conduct, or payment of annual dues. In addition, all the  organizations offer a required or voluntary examination. For example,  CFA Institute, FINRA, MSRB, and the State Bar of California require  members to pass an examination to become a member. Other  professional organizations, including IIA, offer members the opportunity to  pass an examination to receive a voluntary credential. One organization,  AICPA, did not register public accountants or certify them in the  profession; however, it develops and administers the Uniform Certified  Public Accountant Examination that most states require for licensing.", "Public education, outreach, or advocacy. The organizations have used  differing approaches to communicating information with the public about  the industries or professions. All six have public websites, make speakers  available, or produce information to increase public awareness of their  industries. AICPA, CFA Institute, and IIA also engage in advocacy to  educate and influence key stakeholders, such as federal and state  officials, about policies and issues that affect the profession.
