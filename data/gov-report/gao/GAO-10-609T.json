Depository institutions have been concerned about the resources required to file SARs and the extent to which SARs are used. The Subcommittee asked GAO to discuss our February 2009 report on suspicious activity reporting. Specifically, this testimony discusses (1) factors affecting the number of SARs filed, (2) actions agencies have taken to improve the usefulness of SARs, (3) federal agencies' use of SARs, and (4) the effectiveness of the process used to revise SAR forms. To respond to the request, GAO relied primarily on the February 2009 report titled Bank Secrecy Act: Suspicious Activity Report Use Is Increasing, but FinCEN Needs to Further Develop and Document Its Form Revision Process (GAO-09-226), and updated it with additional information provided by FinCEN. In that report, GAO recommended that FinCEN work to further develop a strategy that fully incorporates certain GAO-identified practices to enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies into the forms-change process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2000 through 2008, total SAR filings by depository institutions increased from about 163,000 to 732,000 per year; representatives from federal regulators, law enforcement, and depository institutions with whom GAO spoke attributed the increase mainly to two factors. First, automated monitoring systems can flag multiple indicators of suspicious activities and identify significantly more unusual activity than manual monitoring. Second, several public enforcement actions against a few depository institutions prompted other institutions to look more closely at client and account activities. Other factors include institutions' greater awareness of and training on BSA requirements after September 11, 2001 and more regulator guidance for BSA examinations. FinCEN and law enforcement agencies have taken actions to improve the quality of SAR filings and educate filers about their usefulness. Since 2000, FinCEN has issued written products with the purpose of making SAR filings more useful to law enforcement. FinCEN and federal law enforcement agency representatives regularly participate in outreach on BSA/anti-money laundering, including events focused on SARs. Law enforcement agency representatives said they also establish relationships with depository institutions to communicate with staff about crafting useful SAR narratives. FinCEN, law enforcement agencies, and financial regulators use SARs in investigations and financial institution examinations and have taken steps in recent years to make better use of them. FinCEN uses SARs to provide public and nonpublic analytical products to law enforcement agencies and depository institution regulators. Some federal law enforcement agencies have facilitated complex analyses by using SAR data with their own data sets. Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies collaborate to review and start investigations based on SARs filed in their areas. Regulators use SARs in their examination process to assess compliance and take action against abuse by depository institution insiders. After revising a SAR form in 2006 that could not be used because of information technology limitations, in 2008, FinCEN developed a new process for revising BSA forms, including SARs, that may increase collaboration with some stakeholders, including some law enforcement groups concerned that certain of the 2006 revisions could be detrimental to investigations. Available documentation on the process did not detail the degree to which the new process would incorporate GAO-identified best practices for enhancing and sustaining federal agency collaboration. For example, it did not specify roles and responsibilities for stakeholders or depict monitoring, evaluating, and reporting mechanisms. According to FinCEN officials, it is taking some additional steps toward obtaining greater collaboration with law enforcement agency representatives, prosecutors, and multi-agency law enforcement teams and others to determine the contents of the form, but it is too soon to determine the effectiveness of the process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the use of suspicious  activity (SAR) reports by federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies  and the U.S. Department of the Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network\u2019s (FinCEN) recent efforts to implement a new process to revise  SARs and other Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) forms.

FinCEN develops policy and provides guidance to  other agencies, analyzes BSA data for trends and patterns, and pursues  enforcement actions when warranted. It also relies on other agencies in  implementing the BSA framework. These activities include (1) ensuring  compliance with BSA requirements to report suspicious activity, (2)  collecting and storing reported information, and (3) taking enforcement  actions or conducting investigations of criminal financial activity.", "The Secretary of the Treasury delegated BSA examination authority for  depository institutions to five banking regulators\u2014the Federal Reserve,  OCC, OTS, FDIC, and NCUA. The regulators conduct periodic on-site  safety and soundness and compliance examinations to assess an  institution\u2019s financial condition, policies and procedures, adherence to  BSA regulations (for example, filing of SARs and other BSA-related  reports), and compliance with other laws and regulations.", "Financial institutions must report any suspicious transaction relevant to a  possible violation of a law. In 1996, FinCEN required banks and other  depository institutions to report, on a SAR form, certain suspicious  transactions involving possible violations of law or regulation, including  money laundering. In the same year, federal banking regulators required  depository institutions to report suspected money laundering and other  suspicious activities using the SAR form. IRS\u2019s Enterprise Computing  Center\u2013Detroit serves as the central point of collection and storage of  these data. Figure 1 summarizes the process for filing and accessing  SARs.", "Federal regulators and FinCEN can bring formal enforcement actions,  including civil money penalties, against institutions for violations of BSA.  Formal enforcement actions generally are used to address cases involving  systemic, repeated noncompliance; failure to respond to supervisory  warnings; and other violations. However, most cases of BSA  noncompliance are corrected within the examination framework through  supervisory actions or letters that document the institution\u2019s commitment  to take corrective action. In addition, DOJ may bring criminal actions  against individuals and corporations, including depository and other  financial institutions, for money laundering offenses and certain BSA  violations. The actions may result in criminal fines, imprisonment, and  forfeiture actions. Institutions and individuals willfully violating BSA and  its implementing regulations, and structuring transactions to evade BSA  reporting requirements, are subject to criminal fines, prison, or both.", "Law enforcement agencies housed in DOJ and the Department of  Homeland Security use SARs for investigations of money laundering,  terrorist financing, and other financial crimes. Agencies in DOJ involved in  efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing include FBI;  DEA; the Department\u2019s Criminal and National Security Divisions; the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; the Executive  Office for U.S. Attorneys; and U.S. Attorneys Offices. The Secret Service  and ICE (in Homeland Security) also investigate cases involving money  laundering and terrorist activities. IRS-CI uses BSA information to  investigate possible cases of money laundering and terrorist financing  activities.

According to FinCEN data,  SAR filings by depository institutions increased from approximately  163,000 in 2000 to more than 732,000 in 2008. In our report, our analysis of  SAR and banking data from 2004 through 2007 indicates that the growth  rates in SAR filings varied over time among depository institutions of  different asset sizes. For example, the greatest increase in SARs filed  during this period by the largest depository institutions occurred from  2004 to 2005, and SARs filed by small credit unions nearly doubled from  2005 to 2006.", "Representatives of federal banking regulators, law enforcement agencies,  and depository institutions most frequently attributed the increase to two  factors: technological advances and the effect of public enforcement  actions on institutions. According to the representatives, automated  transaction monitoring systems can flag multiple indicators of suspicious  activity and identify much more unusual activity than could be identified  manually. At the largest depository institutions, these systems conduct  complex analyses incorporating customer profiles. The representatives  also said that issuance of several public enforcement actions in 2004 and  2005 with civil money penalties and forfeitures up to $40 million against a  few depository institutions prompted many institutions to file more SARs.  FinCEN and the federal banking regulators took the actions because of  systemic BSA program noncompliance, which included failures to meet  SAR filing requirements. More recently in March 2010, government actions  taken against one depository institution for BSA violations, including SARs  violations, included $160 million in penalties and fines.", "Depository institution representatives with whom we spoke cited a third  factor for increases\u2014concerns they would receive criticisms during  examinations about decisions not to file SARs. To avoid such criticism,  they said their institutions filed SARs even when they thought them  unnecessary\u2014a practice sometimes called \u201cdefensive SAR filing.\u201d  However, according to the federal regulators and some law enforcement  officials with whom we spoke, there is no means of determining what, if  any, portion of the increase in filings could be attributed to defensive  filing. The representatives suggested additional factors as contributing to  the increase, including greater awareness of BSA requirements after  September 11, 2001, more regulator guidance for BSA examinations, and  more BSA-related training at the institutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FinCEN and Law Enforcement Agencies Have Acted to Educate Filers about The Usefulness of SARs and Improve the Quality of Their Filings", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN and law enforcement agencies have taken multiple actions to  educate filers about SARs usefulness and improve the quality of SAR  filings.

These include (1) a regularly issued publication that gives tips on topics  such as the preparation of SARs and (2) guidance for depository  institutions and other SAR filers. For example, in its SAR Activity Review:  Trends, Tips and Issues\u2014FinCEN regularly provides information on  suspicious activity reporting, trends, and data analyses, law enforcement  cases assisted by BSA data, and other issues. In 2008 and in 2009, the  publication included information on suspicious activity reviews by a state  banking regulator and securities regulators, respectively. In 2009, FinCEN  issued guidance on filing SARs for mortgage loan modification and  foreclosure rescue scams and in 2010 began an effort to promote  electronic filing of BSA forms targeted at current paper filers.

FinCEN uses SARs to provide a  number of public and nonpublic analytical products to law enforcement  agencies and depository institution regulators. In 2004 and 2005, several  federal law enforcement agencies signed memorandums of understanding  with FinCEN to receive bulk BSA data, including SARs. They combined  these data with information from their law enforcement databases to  facilitate more complex and comprehensive analyses. Different team  structures have been established to better analyze SARs. For example, in  2000 and again in 2003, DOJ issued guidance that encouraged the  formation of SAR review teams with federal, state, and local  representation. Each month, these teams review SARs filed in their areas  to determine which would merit additional investigation. In 2006, DOJ and  IRS-CI collaborated on a pilot to create task forces and augment SAR  review teams with federal prosecutors in selected districts. These task  forces specifically investigate possible BSA violations with potential for  seizures or forfeitures. The regulators also use SARs for scoping their  depository institution examinations and review SARs relating to known or  suspected unlawful activities by current and former institution-affiliated  parties, including officers, directors, and employees.", "Although law enforcement agency representatives generally were satisfied  with their ability to access BSA data, various agencies and multiagency  teams we interviewed said that formatting and other issues related to the  data system slowed their downloads and reviews. In 2009, FinCEN  officials described how features of FinCEN\u2019s planned modernization effort  for information technology could address these issues.

However, the available information on the process was  limited and did not fully indicate how FinCEN would avoid or address  some of the problems previously encountered. In 2006, FinCEN and the  federal banking regulators issued proposed substantive and formatting  revisions to the SAR form. The revisions were finalized but, because of  technology limitations with IRS\u2019s data management system, the revised  form has not been implemented. Law enforcement agency officials we  interviewed had mixed views on the proposed revisions. They generally  supported most of the proposed revisions, but some felt they had been  insufficiently consulted and also expressed concerns that some revisions  could affect their work negatively. For example, one change would replace  the name and title of a person with personal knowledge about the  suspicious activity reported on the form with a contact office, possibly  increasing the time it would take law enforcement investigators to reach a  person knowledgeable about the activity. However, banking regulators  supported this change because of concerns that a SAR listing a named  contact could jeopardize the safety and privacy of that person if it were  inappropriately disclosed.", "In 2008, FinCEN developed a new process that it planned to use in future  revisions of BSA forms, including SARs. Early documentation for the  process suggested some greater stakeholder involvement at early stages,  but subsequent documentation we reviewed did not indicate that FinCEN  fully incorporated certain GAO-identified practices that can enhance and  sustain collaboration among federal agencies. Such practices include  defining a common outcome; agreeing on respective roles and  responsibilities, including how the collaborative effort will be led; and  creating the means to collect information on, monitor, evaluate, and report  efforts.", "In our 2009 report, we determined that if FinCEN more fully incorporated  some of these practices it might achieve some potential benefits\u2014such as  greater consensus from all stakeholders on proposed SAR form revisions.  We recommended that the Secretary of the Treasury direct the Director of  FinCEN to further develop and document its strategy to fully incorporate  certain of these practices into the revision process and distribute that  documentation to all stakeholders. In written comments on the report, the  FinCEN Director generally agreed with our recommendation and noted  that FinCEN recognized the need to work with a diverse range of  stakeholders to revise BSA forms.", "Recent implementation of FinCEN\u2019s process suggests greater  collaboration with stakeholders on defining a common outcome and  establishing roles and responsibilities and planned steps, which could  result in more sustained collaboration. According to FinCEN officials,  FinCEN\u2019s implementation of the process generally would involve three  phases. The initial phase has involved collaboration with a wider range of  stakeholders than in the past. For example, in addition to collaboration  with IRS information technology staff we previously identified, current  documentation indicates that FinCEN has collaborated in more detail with  federal law enforcement agency representatives, federal financial  regulators, representatives from SAR review teams and other multiagency  law enforcement teams, and prosecutors to determine the content of a  revised SAR form. FinCEN also obtained and adopted input from other  stakeholders, such as banking industry representatives, in the Bank  Secrecy Act Advisory Group. FinCEN officials plan to obtain and adopt  input from its Data Management Council (DMC), after providing its  members the opportunity to consult with colleagues at their respective  agencies. They also plan to conduct a focus group of DMC members to  obtain feedback on how the new forms revision process is working and  use that feedback to modify the process.
