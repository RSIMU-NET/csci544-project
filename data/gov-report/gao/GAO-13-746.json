About 78 percent of obligated funds were from mandatory HCFAC appropriations (budgetary resources provided in laws other than appropriation acts), 11 percent of obligated funds were from discretionary HCFAC appropriations (budgetary resources provided in appropriation acts), and 12 percent were obligated funds from other appropriations that HHS, HHS-OIG, and DOJ used to support HCFAC activities. HCFAC funds were obligated to support a variety of activities, including interagency Medicare Fraud Strike Force Teams--which provide additional investigative and prosecutorial resources in geographic areas with high rates of health care fraud--located in 9 cities nationwide.", "HHS, HHS-OIG, and DOJ use several indicators to assess HCFAC activities, as well as to inform decision-makers about how to allocate resources and prioritize those activities. For example, in addition to other indicators, the United States Attorneys' Offices use indicators related to criminal prosecutions, including the number of defendants charged and the number of convictions. Additionally, many of the indicators that HHS, HHS-OIG, and DOJ use--such as the dollar amount recovered as a result of fraud cases--reflect the collective work of multiple agencies since these agencies work many health care fraud cases jointly. Outputs from some key indicators have changed in recent years. For example, according to the fiscal year 2012 HCFAC report, the return-on-investment--the amount of money returned to the government as a result of HCFAC activities compared with the funding appropriated to conduct those activities--has increased from $4.90 returned for every $1.00 invested for fiscal years 2006-2008 to $7.90 returned for every $1.00 invested for fiscal years 2010-2012.", "Several factors contribute to a lack of information about the effectiveness of HCFAC activities in reducing health care fraud and abuse. The indicators agencies use to track HCFAC activities provide information on the outputs or accomplishments of HCFAC activities, not on the effectiveness of the activities in actually reducing fraud and abuse. For several reasons, assessing the impact of the program is challenging. For example, it is difficult to isolate the effect that HCFAC activities, as opposed to other efforts such as changes to the Medicare provider enrollment process, may have in reducing health care fraud and abuse. It is also difficult to estimate a health care fraud baseline--a measure of the extent of fraud--that is needed to be able to track whether the amount of fraud has changed over time as a result of HCFAC or other efforts. HHS has a project under way to establish a baseline of probable fraud in home health care, and will determine whether this approach to estimating a baseline of fraud should be expanded to other areas of health care. Results from this project and other studies could provide HHS and DOJ with additional information regarding which activities are the most effective in reducing health care fraud and abuse, and could potentially inform agency decisions about how best to allocate limited resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["GAO has designated Medicare and Medicaid as high-risk programs  because their size, scope, and complexity make them particularly   According to the Department of Health  vulnerable to fraud and abuse.and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG), common  health care fraud schemes include providers or suppliers billing for  services or supplies not provided or not medically necessary, purposely  billing for a higher level of service than that provided, and paying  kickbacks to providers for referring beneficiaries for specific services or to  certain entities.

However,  several HHS and DOJ agency officials told us that they do not consider  these indicators to be measures of the performance or the effectiveness  of the HCFAC program in reducing health care fraud. The return-on- investment is an example of an indicator that describes program results  but does not measure program effectiveness. We found that the return- on-investment provides information on the accomplishments of HCFAC  activities in relationship to the amount of funds appropriated for these  activities, but does not provide information on the extent to which the  HCFAC program reduces health care fraud.", "Additionally, most of the indicators used to track HCFAC activities do not  have targets or goals associated with them. Although standard practices  for internal controls indicate that ongoing performance monitoring should  include comparison of performance indicator data against planned  targets, our previous work has recognized that establishing measures and  setting specific targets in the law enforcement area can be challenging.  Officials from HHS, HHS-OIG, and DOJ told us that they intentionally do  not set performance targets for indicators such as the number of health  care fraud investigations or prosecutions undertaken because such  targets could cause the public to perceive law enforcement as engaging  in \u201cbounty hunting\u201d or pursuing arbitrary targets merely to meet particular  goals.law enforcement actions that are based on merit and avoid the  appearance that they strive to achieve certain numerical quotas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Make Assessing the Effectiveness of the HCFAC Program Challenging", "paragraphs": ["HHS, HHS-OIG, and DOJ officials, as well as literature we reviewed,  indicate that there are several factors that make assessing the  effectiveness of the HCFAC program in reducing health care fraud and  abuse challenging.", "It is difficult to establish if the HCFAC program has a direct relationship to  changes in the amount of health care fraud and abuse. HHS, HHS-OIG,  and DOJ officials told us that HCFAC activities\u2014as well as other efforts  by federal agencies and others, including non-government entities\u2014may  have helped reduce health care fraud; however, the effect that any of  these actions may have had on health care fraud and abuse is difficult to  isolate. For example, HHS-OIG officials stated that compliance training  and guidance provided by the HHS-OIG to health care organization  directors\u2014an activity conducted with HCFAC funding\u2014may have had an  effect on health care fraud but that it is difficult to isolate how much of an  effect the activity has had. However, according to HHS-OIG officials, a  rise in the number of provider compliance programs established by  hospital organizations in response to shareholder interest in improving  compliance with federal and state health care program requirements may  also contribute to reductions in health care fraud. Moreover, many efforts  within CMS aim to reduce health care fraud and abuse, in addition to  those identified as HCFAC activities, and it is difficult to know which CMS  program or activity has had an effect on the incidence of fraud. For  example, CMS has implemented a number of initiatives to prevent health  care fraud and abuse that are not funded with HCFAC funds. One such  effort is a change to the provider enrollment process, which is designed to  better ensure that only legitimate providers and suppliers are allowed to  bill Medicare. However, it is difficult to isolate the effect that either HCFAC  activities or broader CMS efforts may have had in reducing health care  fraud and abuse.", "Another factor that limits understanding of the effectiveness of the  HCFAC program in reducing health care fraud and abuse is the difficulty  in quantifying the HCFAC program\u2019s effect in deterring health care fraud  and abuse. DOJ officials provided anecdotal evidence that HCFAC  activities help to deter would-be offenders. For example, a Justice  Management Division official asserted that DOJ prosecutions that result  in doctors being sentenced to prison for health care fraud and abuse  deter other doctors who are contemplating committing fraud. Other DOJ  officials reported that cooperating witnesses in health care fraud  investigations have told officials of instances where a provider committing  potentially fraudulent acts had ceased operations because of the  pressure brought on by Strike Force prosecutions. DOJ officials stated  that they could recall about a dozen examples of specific individuals who  have said they were deterred from committing fraud or ceased a  fraudulent operation because they saw another individual get caught.  However, these examples are anecdotal and DOJ and HHS-OIG officials  stated that it is difficult to know how much health care fraud is deterred as  a result of HCFAC activities.", "Research on the effectiveness of health care fraud and abuse  interventions, and on ways to measure the effectiveness of health care  fraud and abuse interventions has been limited. We found that none of  the 49 articles we selected to review for this study evaluated the  effectiveness of the HCFAC program specifically, and few studies  examined the effectiveness of health care fraud and abuse interventions  in general. A recent review of literature conducted by experts in the field  found similar results.", "Another challenge that limits the ability to determine whether HCFAC  activities are effective in reducing health care fraud and abuse is the lack  of a baseline for the amount of health care fraud that exists at any point in  time. Having such a baseline could provide information on the amount of  health care fraud and how much it has changed in a given year or over  time. We have previously reported that there currently is no reliable  baseline estimate of the amount of health care fraud in the United  States. Several experts told us or have written about the importance of  establishing a baseline in assessing the effectiveness of law enforcement  programs. A baseline estimate could provide an understanding of the  extent of fraud and, with additional information on program activities,  could help to inform decision-making related to allocation of resources to  combat health care fraud.", "HHS and CMS have taken steps to try to establish a health care fraud  baseline because, according to the fiscal year 2012 HCFAC report, they  appreciate that a baseline would allow the agencies to evaluate the  success of fraud prevention activities. HHS officials stated that the  Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation initiated work to establish  a baseline measurement, and that work was subsequently transferred to  CMS\u2019s Center for Program Integrity. According to the fiscal year 2012  HCFAC report, the project is designed to measure probable fraud in  home health care agencies and will pilot test a measurement approach  and calculate an estimate of probable fraud for specific home health care  services. CMS and its contractor will collect information from home health  care agencies, the referring physicians, and Medicare beneficiaries  selected in a national random sample of home health care claims. The  pilot will rely on the information collected along with a summary of the  service history of the home health care agency, the referring provider,  and the beneficiary to estimate the percentage of total payments that are  associated with probable fraud, and the percentage of all claims that are  associated with probable fraud for Medicare fee-for-service home health  care. CMS reports that after completion of the pilot, it will determine  whether the measurement approach should be expanded to other areas  of health care. Officials from the Center for Program Integrity stated that  as of May 2013, they were beginning the data collection phase of the  fraud baseline measurement pilot, which they expect will last two years.", "Some HCFAC-funded agencies have attempted to determine the effect of  HCFAC activities on specific types of fraud in certain locations. DOJ  officials provided examples of reductions in billings for certain services in  specific locations and told us that they believe these reductions are  associated with the work of the Strike Force teams. For example, DOJ  officials reported assessing the amount of home health care billings in  certain Strike Force cities before the Strike Force began operations and  then again after the Strike Force had begun operations. Since the  amount of home health care billing was measured before and after the  Strike Force was implemented, HHS, HHS-OIG, and DOJ officials are  able to estimate some effect that the Strike Force team had on the  amount of billing in that area. For example, in a May 14, 2013 press  conference, the Attorney General noted that after the Detroit Strike Force  began investigating cases of potential group-psychotherapy fraud, claims  for this type of treatment in Detroit dropped by more than   70 percent since January 2011."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Making progress in preventing and reducing health care fraud and abuse  is an essential yet challenging task. HHS and DOJ use a number of  indicators to assess the activities they conduct to reduce health care  fraud and abuse.

While  positive results on the program\u2019s return-on-investment can be seen as an  indication of program success, the return-on-investment does not indicate  the extent to which the program is reducing fraud. For example, the  increasing returns from the fraud that is being investigated and  prosecuted may indicate that HCFAC programming is effective in  detecting or deterring potentially fraudulent schemes or indicate that there  is simply an increase in potentially fraudulent activity. CMS\u2019s recent  efforts to establish a home health care fraud baseline is a good first step  to understanding the extent of the problem and, if implemented as  planned, could provide policymakers with information on how much fraud  exists and in coming years, how potentially fraudulent activity has  increased or decreased over time. However, CMS has not yet determined  whether the methodology used to establish a baseline of probable fraud  in home health care could be used to assess the amount of fraud in other  health care services. Additionally, even with a baseline estimate of the  total amount of probable fraud, there will likely be continuing challenges in  understanding the effectiveness of the HCFAC program, such as isolating  the program\u2019s ability to reduce or prevent fraud and abuse. Despite these  inherent challenges, if a health care fraud baseline is established more  broadly, it may become feasible to study how individual HCFAC activities,  and possibly the program as a whole, affects changes in health care  fraud.
