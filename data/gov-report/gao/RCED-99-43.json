For fiscal year 1997, the federal grants available to the states totaled $16.7 billion and ranged from $21.8 million in Wyoming to over $3.7 billion in California. With respect to state funding, the Welfare Reform Act included a \u201cmaintenance-of-effort\u201d provision requiring the states to provide 75 to 80 percent of their historic level of funding.", "Because of congressional concern that welfare had become a way of life for some participants, a key purpose of the new law is to promote work over welfare and self-reliance over dependency. In support of this goal, the law provides that the states must require able-bodied participants to engage in work or work-related activities and must impose a 5-year lifetime limit on federal assistance. The states must require adults in families receiving TANF assistance to participate in work or work-related activities after receiving assistance for 24 months, or sooner, as defined by the state. If recipients fail to participate as required, the states must at least reduce the families\u2019 assistance and may opt to terminate it entirely.", "To avoid financial penalties, the states must ensure that a certain specified minimum percentage of their beneficiaries are participating in work or work-related activities each year. These percentages are referred to as \u201cminimum mandated participation rates.\u201d To count toward these mandated rates, adults in families receiving welfare must participate for a certain minimum number of hours in work or a work-related activity as prescribed in the Welfare Reform Act\u2014such as job readiness workshops; on-the-job training; and, under certain circumstances, education. The required number of hours of participation and the percentage of a state\u2019s caseload that must participate to meet mandated rates increase over time are shown in table 1.", "Instead of prescribing in detail how the states should structure their TANF programs, the Welfare Reform Act authorizes the states to use their block grants in any manner that is reasonably calculated to accomplish the purposes of TANF. For example, the states are allowed to set forth their own criteria for defining who will be eligible and what assistance and services will be available, provided they ensure fair and equitable treatment. The states may opt to deny assistance altogether for noncitizens, drug felons, minor teen parents, or those they determine are able to work.

U.S. citizens and some legal immigrants who are admitted for permanent residency may qualify for food stamps.

FNS is responsible for approving state plans for operation and ensuring that the states are administering the program in accordance with regulations. The program is administered at the local level by either a state agency or a local welfare agency, depending on the state. Local office staff are responsible for determining eligibility and the level of benefits issued to participating households. The federal government pays the full cost of benefits and shares administrative costs with the states. The federal cost to administer the program was about $1.7 billion in fiscal year 1997, and the average monthly household food stamp benefit was $169.", "The Welfare Reform Act requires most able-bodied adult participants receiving food stamps to work in return for their benefits. Able-bodied participants ages 18 to 50 with no dependent children may receive food stamp benefits for only 3 months in every 36-month period unless they are engaged in work or work programs. Qualifying work includes participating in a work program for a monthly average of 20 hours or more a week. Exclusions to the work requirement vary by program.

However, Arkansas\u2019 simplified program uses a state-defined TANF rule that exempts the total value of the vehicle from the resource limit.

As figure 2 shows, the states that have not implemented a simplified program cited a number of concerns that have discouraged its adoption.", "The most frequently cited concern for 34 of the states that had not implemented a simplified program was increasing caseworker burden because of an additional set of program criteria. The additional criteria would be produced by the states\u2019 merging of TANF and food stamp provisions under their simplified program. For example, under the simplified program, a state may replace the regular food stamp provision exempting single parents with children under age 6 from work with a TANF provision exempting single parents with children under age 1. Such changes can produce a distinct set of simplified program work requirements not found in either TANF or the regular Food Stamp Program.", "The next most frequently cited concern for 28 of the states was that the program\u2019s cost-neutral provision restricted the states\u2019 options for simplifying the program. That is, a simplified program that incorporates eligibility or benefit determination criteria that result in higher food stamp benefit costs must be offset by other program features that reduces benefit costs to what they would have been under the regular Food Stamp Program\u2014in effect, requiring the states to make program design trade-offs to achieve cost neutrality.", "Finally, the third most frequently cited factor discouraging program implementation for 24 of the states was that other Welfare Reform Act requirements had a higher priority.

In contrast, the states were under no deadline or requirement to develop and implement a simplified program.", "Some of the other frequently cited concerns that discouraged states from implementing the program included the states\u2019 difficulties in aligning food stamp requirements with TANF, the absence of state automation to support program implementation, and the potential increase in the states\u2019 food stamp error rates, which would result in financial penalties.

First, the barriers to implementing the program cited by the states as being of most concern, such as it\u2019s cost neutral provision, are imposed by the program\u2019s authorizing legislation, not by the Food and Nutrition Service or the Food Stamp Program. Second, it will be difficult to identify legislative changes that balance the states\u2019 desire for more flexibility with the Congress\u2019s concern for cost containment and the Food Stamp Program mission of ensuring the nutritional security for low-income families. We agree that the barriers of most concern to the states originate in the program\u2019s authorizing legislation and that legislative actions effectively satisfying both state and congressional concerns may be difficult to develop. Nonetheless, we continue to believe that the actions we identified as matters for congressional consideration, such as granting the states a grace period from financial penalties due to increased error rates, offer the promise of making the program more useful to the states without necessarily increasing federal costs.

Also, under the regular Food Stamp Program, a household without elderly or disabled members receives a deduction for the portion of shelter expenses exceeding 50 percent of net income, not to exceed the capped amount. Households containing elderly or disabled members are entitled to subtract the full value of their shelter costs when those costs exceed 50 percent of their adjusted income. In fiscal year 1996, the limit on the excess shelter expense deduction for a household without elderly or disabled members was generally $247.", "Arkansas\u2019 proposed simplified program would have changed how shelter costs are considered in determining food stamp benefits. Specifically, Arkansas would have applied a county\u2019s average shelter costs to both pure- and mixed-TANF households. Arkansas wanted to use the average shelter cost because, in keeping with the goal of creating a \u201cseamless\u201d process, each county could then be assigned a standard shelter cost.", "However, using each county\u2019s average shelter costs in calculating simplified program benefits would have reduced the food stamp benefits, particularly for the mixed-TANF households, especially those containing elderly or disabled members, according to an FNS contractor\u2019s analysis.While benefit amounts for pure-TANF households would increase an average of less than 1 percent, benefits for mixed-TANF households would decrease an average of more than 8 percent. Furthermore, approximately one-half of all the mixed-TANF households participating in the simplified program would lose benefits, and about one-third of the households would lose more than 20 percent.
