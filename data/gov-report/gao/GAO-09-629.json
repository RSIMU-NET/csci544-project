Conducting investigations based on worker complaints is WHD's priority. On March 25, 2009, GAO testified on its findings related to (1) undercover tests of WHD's complaint intake process, (2) case study examples of inadequate WHD responses to wage complaints, and (3) the effectiveness of WHD's complaint intake process, conciliations (phone calls to the employer), and other investigative tools. To test WHD's complaint intake process, GAO posed as complainants and employers in 10 different scenarios. To provide case study examples and assess effectiveness of complaint investigations, GAO used data mining and statistical sampling of closed case data for fiscal year 2007. This report summarizes the testimony (GAO-09-458T) and provides recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found that WHD frequently responded inadequately to complaints, leaving low wage workers vulnerable to wage theft and other labor law violations. Posing as fictitious complainants, GAO filed 10 common complaints with WHD district offices across the country. These tests found that WHD staff deterred fictitious callers from filing a complaint by encouraging employees to resolve the issue themselves, directing most calls to voicemail, not returning phone calls to both employees and employers, and providing conflicting or misleading information about how to file a complaint. An assessment of complaint intake processes would help ensure that WHD staff provide appropriate customer service. To hear clips of undercover calls illustrating poor customer service, see http://www.gao.gov/media/video/gao-09-458t/ . According to WHD policies, investigators should enter all reasonable complaints into WHD's database. However, even though all of GAO's fictitious complaints alleged violations of the laws that WHD enforces, 5 of 10 complaints were not recorded in WHD's database. In addition, WHD policy in one region instructs staff not to record the investigative work done on small cases in which the employer refuses to pay, making WHD appear better at resolving these cases than it is. Reassessing its processes for recording complaints would help WHD ensure that all case information is available. Similar to the 10 fictitious scenarios, GAO identified 20 cases affecting at least 1,160 real employees whose complaints were inadequately investigated by WHD. Five of the cases were closed based on false information provided by the employer that could have been verified by a search of public records, such as bankruptcy records, but WHD investigators do not have access to publicly available or subscription databases. In another case, the employer claimed that the company did not meet the income requirement to be covered under federal law but did not provide documentary evidence. WHD investigators do not have access to income information collected by the Internal Revenue Service and were unable to verify the employer's claim. Obtaining more research tools and implementing information sharing processes with other agencies would assist WHD in verifying employer-provided information. GAO's overall assessment found ineffective complaint intake and investigation processes. WHD officials often told GAO that WHD lacks the resources to conduct an investigation of every complaint, allowing employers in some small cases to avoid paying back wages simply by refusing to pay. GAO found that WHD's investigations were often delayed by months or years. Monitoring the extent to which WHD staff are able to handle the volume of complaints would provide assurance that WHD has sufficient resources available. Under FLSA, the statute of limitations is 2 years from the date of the violation, meaning that every day that WHD delays an investigation, the complainant's risk of becoming ineligible to collect back wages increases. However, in several offices, backlogs prevent investigators from initiating cases within 6 months. Suspending the statute of limitations during a WHD investigation would prevent employees from losing back wages due to delays."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On March 25, 2009 we testified before the committee on findings related to  our investigation of the Department of Labor\u2019s (Labor) Wage and Hour  Division (WHD) processes for investigating and resolving labor  complaints. As we previously reported, over 100 million workers are  covered under labor laws enforced by WHD, including the Fair Labor  Standards Act (FLSA), the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker  Protection Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, Davis-Bacon and  related acts, and other federal labor laws. By law, WHD investigators and  technicians enforce labor laws governing issues such as minimum wage,  overtime pay, child labor, and family medical leave. Conducting  investigations based on complaints is WHD\u2019s first priority.", "WHD investigators can take actions ranging from making phone calls to  the complainant\u2019s employer (known as conciliations) to taking other, more  resource-intensive actions such as interviewing the employer and related  witnesses, reviewing employer payroll records, and requesting copies of  self audits conducted by the employer. Conciliations are generally limited  to a single, minor violation, such as a missed paycheck or an issue  affecting a single worker. A conciliation is used to resolve a complaint  quickly and with minimal resources on the part of WHD. Investigative  work for conciliations is generally limited to a telephone conversation in  which the WHD investigator explains the specific complaint against the  employer, describes applicable laws, and requests that the employer  comply with the law and pay any back wages due. In investigations, when  WHD determines that violations have occurred and computes back wages  owed to workers, it can assess back wages to be paid to the employees  and can impose monetary penalties against employers with repeated or  willful violations. Our testimony had findings related to (1) undercover  testing of WHD\u2019s complaint intake and conciliation processes, (2) case  study examples of inadequate WHD responses to complaints, and (3) the  effectiveness of WHD\u2019s complaint intake process, conciliations, and other  investigative tools. This report summarizes our testimony, which is  reprinted in appendix I, and offers a matter for congressional  consideration and makes specific recommendations to Labor for  corrective actions.", "To test the effectiveness of WHD\u2019s complaint intake process and  conciliations, undercover GAO investigators posed both as complainants  and employers. Using 10 fictitious scenarios including minimum wage, last  paycheck, and overtime violations, investigators called WHD offices in  Alabama, California, Florida, Maryland, and Texas posing as complainants.  These field offices handled 13 percent of all cases investigated by WHD in  fiscal year 2007. When WHD investigators attempted to follow up on the  complaints, different undercover investigators posed as the employers and  followed a variety of scripted scenarios to test how WHD investigators  would respond. For more information, refer to  http://www.gao.gov/media/video/gao-09-458t/.", "To identify case studies of inadequate investigations conducted in  response to actual employees\u2019 allegations of wage theft, we obtained  Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Investigative Support and Reporting Database  (WHISARD) and data-mined for closed cases in which it took WHD more  than one year to complete an investigation, an employer could not be  located, or the case was dropped when an employer refused to pay. We  analyzed WHD\u2019s WHISARD database and determined it was sufficiently  reliable for purposes of our audit and investigative work. We also obtained  and analyzed WHD case files, interviewed WHD officials, and reviewed  publicly available data to gather additional information about these cases.", "To determine the effectiveness of WHD\u2019s complaint intake process,  conciliations, and other investigative tools, we used the results of our  undercover tests, case studies, interviews, and discussions of the  processes with management, and two statistical samples. We selected a  random statistical sample of 115 cases from 10,855 conciliations and 115  cases from 21,468 non-conciliations recorded by WHD in WHISARD that  were concluded between October 1, 2006, and September 30, 2007. We  obtained and reviewed WHD\u2019s case files for the selected cases and  performed tests to determine whether the investigations conducted were  adequate. We subsequently determined through our interviews that the  population of conciliations sampled was substantially incomplete.  Therefore, we were only able to project sample results to conciliations  that WHD chose to enter into its database rather than the entire population  of conciliations. See appendix I for more information on our methodology.  In addition, we reviewed relevant laws and policies and conducted  interviews with agency officials.", "We conducted our forensic audit and related investigations from July 2008  through May 2009. We conducted our audit work in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We conducted our investigative work in accordance with  the standards prescribed by the Council of the Inspectors General on  Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Undercover Tests Reveal Inadequate Investigations and Poor Complaint Intake Process", "paragraphs": ["In our testimony, we stated that the results of our undercover tests  illustrated flaws in WHD\u2019s responses to wage theft complaints, including  delays in investigating complaints, failure to use all available enforcement  tools, failure to follow up on employers who agreed to pay, an ineffective  complaint intake process, and complaints not recorded in the WHD  database. WHD successfully investigated 1 of our 10 fictitious cases,  correctly identifying and investigating a business that had multiple  complaints filed against it by our fictitious complainants.", "Our undercover tests revealed that WHD\u2019s complaint intake process is  time-consuming and confusing, potentially discouraging complainants  from filing a complaint. Of the 115 phone calls we made directly to WHD  field offices, 87 (76 percent) went directly to voicemail. While some offices  have a policy of screening complainant calls using voicemail, other offices  have staff who answer the phone, but may not able to respond to all  incoming calls. In one case, WHD failed to respond to seven messages  from our fictitious complainant, including four messages left in a single  week. In other cases, WHD delayed over 2 weeks in responding to phone  calls or failed to return phone calls from one of our fictitious employers.  One of our complainants received conflicting information about how to  file a complaint from two investigators in the same office, and one  investigator provided misinformation about the statute of limitations in  minimum wage cases. In one case, a WHD investigator lied to our  undercover investigator about confirming the fictitious businesses\u2019 sales  volume with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and did not investigate  our complaint any further. WHD management told us that their  investigators do not have access to IRS databases, and WHD does not have  the legal authority to obtain information about a business from IRS  without the owner\u2019s consent. WHD would be able to check employer- provided information against IRS records if the business owner signed an  IRS consent form, however, WHD managers told us that they were  unaware of this form and that investigators in the field do not use it. To  hear selected audio clips of undercover calls illustrating poor customer  service to our fictitious callers, refer to  http://www.gao.gov/media/video/gao-09-458t/.", "Although all of our fictitious complaints alleged violations of laws that  WHD enforces, 5 of our 10 complaints were not recorded in WHD\u2019s  database. These complaints were filed with four different field offices and  included three complaints in which WHD performed no investigative work  and two complaints in which WHD failed to record the investigative work  performed. According to WHD policies, investigators should enter  reasonable complaints into WHD\u2019s database and either handle them  immediately as conciliations or refer them to management for possible  investigation. However, several of our undercover complaints were not  recorded in the database, even after the employee had spoken to an  investigator or filed a written complaint. In one of these cases, WHD failed  to investigate a child labor complaint alleging that underage children were  operating hazardous machinery and working during school hours, and did  not record the complaint in its database. The number of complaints that  are not entered into WHD\u2019s database is unknown, but this problem is  potentially significant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Case Studies Show That WHD Inadequately Investigated Complaints", "paragraphs": ["Similar to our 10 fictitious scenarios, in our testimony we identified 20  cases affecting at least 1,160 workers whose employers were inadequately  investigated by WHD. We performed data mining on WHD\u2019s database to  identify 20 inadequate cases closed during fiscal year 2007. For several of  these cases, WHD (1) did not respond to a complainant for over a year, (2)  did not verify information provided by the employer, (3) did not fully  investigate businesses with repeat violations, and (4) dropped cases  because the employer did not return telephone calls. Five of the cases we  investigated were closed based on unverified information provided by the  employer. In each case, the information could have been verified by a  search of public records, such as bankruptcy records, but the case files  contain no evidence that the investigators attempted to perform these  searches. WHD officials told us that investigators rely on internet searches  to collect information about employers and generally do not have access  to other publicly available or subscription databases. Examples include:  In November 2005, WHD received a complaint alleging that a boarding  school in Montana was not paying its employees proper overtime. Over 9  months after the complaint was received, the case was assigned to an  investigator and conducted as an over the phone self-audit because,  according to the investigator, WHD did not have the resources to conduct  an on-site investigation. The employer agreed to pay over $200,000 in back  wages to 93 employees, but WHD was subsequently unable to make  contact with the business for over 5 months. In June 2007, one week  before the 2-year statute of limitations on the entire back wage amount  was to expire, the employer agreed to pay $1,000 of the $10,800 in wages  due for which the statute of limitations had not yet expired. The  investigator refused to accept the $1,000, and WHD recorded the back  wages computed as over $10,800 rather than $200,000, greatly understating  the true amount owed to employees. WHD determined that the firm had  begun paying overtime correctly based on statements made by the  employer but did not verify the statements through document review. No  further investigative action was taken and the complainant was informed  of the outcome of the case.", "In another case, the complainant alleged that the company employed 15- year-old children, failed to pay its employees minimum wage, and did not  properly report income to IRS. The employer claimed that the company  did not meet the income requirement to be covered under federal labor  law but did not provide documentary evidence. When the employer failed  to return WHD\u2019s telephone calls or attend a conference with the  investigator, WHD concluded the case."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WHD\u2019s Complaint Intake Process, Conciliations, and Other Investigative Tools Do Not Provide Assurance of a Timely and Thorough Response to Wage Theft Complaints", "paragraphs": ["WHD\u2019s complaint intake processes, conciliations, and other investigative  tools are ineffective and often prevent WHD from responding to wage theft  complaints in a timely and thorough manner, leaving thousands of low  wage workers vulnerable to wage theft.", "As discussed above, our undercover tests showed that some WHD staff  deterred callers from filing a complaint by encouraging employees to  resolve the issue themselves, directing most calls to voicemail, not  returning phone calls to both employees and employers, accepting only  written complaints at some offices, and providing conflicting or  misleading information about how to file a complaint. We also found that  WHD does not have a consistent process for documenting and tracking  complaints, resulting in situations where WHD investigators lose track of  the complaints they have received.", "WHD\u2019s conciliation process is ineffective because in many cases, if the  employer does not immediately agree to pay, WHD does not investigate  complaints further or compel payment. When an employer refuses to pay,  investigators may recommend that the case be elevated to a full  investigation, but several WHD District Directors and field staff told us  WHD lacks the resources to conduct an investigation of every complaint  and focuses resources on investigating complaints affecting large numbers  of employees or resulting in large dollar amounts of back wage  collections. WHD investigators are allowed to close conciliations when the  employer denies the allegations, and WHD policy does not require that  investigators review employer records in conciliations. In one case study,  the employee stated that he thought the business was going bankrupt. As a  result, WHD closed the case; however, we used a publicly available online  database, Public Access to Court Electronic Records, to determine that the  employer had never filed for bankruptcy. WHD management told us that  the agency does not provide training on how to use public document  searches and investigators do not have access to databases containing this  information. In addition, WHD\u2019s poor record-keeping makes WHD appear  better at resolving conciliations than it actually is. For example, WHD\u2019s  southeast region, which handled 57 percent of conciliations recorded by  WHD in fiscal year 2007, has a policy of not recording investigative work  performed on unsuccessful conciliations in the database. WHD staff told  us that if employers do not agree to pay back wages, cannot be located, or  do not answer the telephone, the conciliation work performed will not be  recorded in the database, making it appear as though these offices are  able to resolve nearly all conciliations successfully. Inflated conciliation  success rates are problematic for WHD management, which uses this  information to determine the effectiveness of WHD\u2019s investigative efforts.  Without information on the outcomes of failed conciliations, WHD cannot  identify employers showing a pattern of violations.", "Finally, we found WHD\u2019s processes for handling investigations and other  non-conciliations were frequently ineffective because of significant delays.  For example, 5.2 percent of the investigations in our statistical sample  were not initiated until over 6 months after the complaint was received,  and 6.6 percent took more than one year to complete. See page 26 of  appendix I for more information on the methodology of our sample.  Timely completion of investigations by WHD is important because the  statute of limitations for recovery of wages under the FLSA is 2 years from  the date of the employer\u2019s failure to pay the correct wages. FLSA, unlike  some other laws, does not permit the suspension of the statute of  limitations during a federal investigation. Specifically, this means that  every day that WHD delays an investigation, the complainant\u2019s risk of  becoming ineligible to collect back wages increases. Labor has not sought  additional authority to suspend the statute of limitations during an  investigation, yet in several district offices, a large backlog prevents  investigators from initiating cases within 6 months. One office we visited  has a backlog of 7 to 8 months, while another office has a backlog of 13  months. Additionally, our analysis of WHD\u2019s database shows that one  district office did not initiate an investigation of 12 percent of complaints  until over one year after the complaint was received, including a child  labor complaint affecting over 50 minors. Once complaints were recorded  in WHD\u2019s database and assigned as a case to an investigator, they were  often adequately investigated. One example of a successful investigation  involved a complaint alleging that a firm was not paying proper overtime.  The case was assigned to an investigator the same day it was filed in April  2007. The WHD investigator reviewed payroll records to determine that  the firm owed the complainant back wages. The case was concluded  within 3 months when the investigator obtained a copy of the  complainant\u2019s cashed check, proving that he had been paid his gross back  wages of $184.", "In response to our testimony, the Secretary of Labor announced on March  25, 2009, that WHD would hire an additional 250 investigators to  \u201creinvigorate the work of this important agency, which has suffered a loss  of experienced personnel over the last several years.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our work clearly shows that Labor has left thousands of actual victims of  wage theft who sought federal government assistance with nowhere to  turn.
