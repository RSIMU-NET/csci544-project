This report (1) describes the federal grant workforce at selected agencies and analyzes the challenge of identifying the workforce government-wide and (2) examines selected good practices agencies use and challenges, if any, in grants training and the potential implications for developing government-wide grants training standards. GAO obtained government-wide information on grants training through a questionnaire to chief learning officers at 22 federal agencies. For in-depth illustrative examples of grants training practices and challenges, GAO selected four agencies--Education, HHS, State, and DOT--based on factors such as total grant obligations and the number and type of grant programs administered. GAO also reviewed documentation and interviewed officials at OMB and OPM."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Identifying the federal grant workforce presents challenges due to differences in how agencies manage grants and the wide range of job series that make up the grant workforce. Some agencies manage grants by using a combination of program specialists (subject-matter experts) and grants management specialists, while other agencies use program specialists to manage the entire grant process. In the four agencies that GAO focused on for this review--the Departments of Education (Education), Health and Human Services (HHS), State (State), and Transportation (DOT)--agency officials identified over 5,100 employees who were significantly involved in managing grants, spanning more than 50 different occupational job series. Recognizing the need for a classification that would more accurately capture the work of federal employees who manage grants, in 2010 the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) created the \"Grants Management Specialist\" job series. However, due to the different ways that agencies manage grants, the extent to which agencies have adopted this series varies widely. More than half of the 22 federal grant-making agencies GAO surveyed make limited or no use of the job series. The Council on Financial Assistance Reform (COFAR), established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 2011 to provide recommendations on grants policy and management reforms, has announced plans to develop government-wide grants training standards, but it has not released information on how it plans to define the grant workforce. Defining the grant workforce is an important step in developing an effective government-wide grants training strategy.", "Agency officials identified three key practices to develop the grant workforce: (1) competencies, (2) agency-specific training, and (3) certification programs. First, some agencies developed their own competency models in order to better reflect the way they assigned grants management responsibilities. Officials at these agencies told GAO that OPM's grants management competency model was not directly applicable to employees carrying out the program specialist role in their organizations. For example, rather than apply OPM's competency model, a component of HHS developed a separate competency model tailored to program specialist employees responsible for managing grants. Second, agencies addressed their grants training needs through courses and other training mechanisms designed to provide knowledge of agency-specific policies and procedures. Officials reported challenges finding grants training that met all the needs of the grant workforce, and responded to this by customizing grants training courses. For example, Education customized commercial courses to include agency-specific policies and procedures and a component of HHS developed its own grants management courses to achieve the same goal. Third, to ensure a minimum level of proficiency in grants management, some agencies established grants management certification programs and tailored the certifications to fit the different roles within the grant workforce. For example, State tailored separate certification programs after recognizing two distinct roles played by its employees who manage grants. These agencies' experiences have implications for COFAR's plans to develop government-wide training standards, including creating grants management competencies, delivering training for those competencies, and establishing certification standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to the Director of OMB regarding the importance of including both types of grants management roles--grants management specialists and program specialists--when developing government-wide grants management competencies and certification standards.", "OMB staff concurred with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Grants are a key tool used by the federal government to achieve a wide  variety of national objectives such as providing medical, financial,  housing, and foreign assistance, as well as constructing and maintaining  our nation\u2019s highways, bridges, and mass transit systems. Federal outlays  for grants to state and local governments totaled approximately $545  billion in fiscal year 2012, comprising over 15 percent of all federal  outlays. The value of these grants has grown considerably over the  years, rising from $91 billion in fiscal year 1980 (about $225 billion in  fiscal year 2012 constant dollars)\u2014a real, inflation-adjusted increase of  more than 140 percent.", "Given the role federal grants play in achieving national objectives, as well  as grants\u2019 considerable growth in value and complexity over the past  three decades, it is important that the federal workforce that manages  these grants has the necessary knowledge and skills to do its job. In this  regard, the government\u2019s approach to another tool it uses to achieve  goals\u2014purchasing goods and services through federal contracts\u2014 provides an interesting contrast. In fiscal year 2012, the federal  government spent approximately $28 billion more on grants to state and  local governments than it did on federal acquisitions. Under federal  acquisitions law, there are clear government-wide training requirements  for the acquisitions workforce intended to help ensure its quality and  effectiveness. However, similar government-wide training requirements  do not exist for the grant workforce.", "In light of this, you asked us to examine how the federal government  trains its grant workforce and what challenges, if any, exist. In this report,  we (1) describe the federal grant workforce at selected agencies and  analyze the challenge of identifying the workforce government-wide and  (2) examine selected good practices agencies use and challenges they  face, if any, in training the grant workforce, and the potential implications  of these practices and challenges for a government-wide approach  toward developing grants management competencies, training, and  certification. You were also interested in the federal acquisitions  workforce, which we reported on separately.", "To accomplish our objectives, we gathered information both government- wide and at four specific agencies. To obtain a government-wide  perspective, we reviewed federal employee data from the Office of  Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) online FedScope information system  that supports statistical analyses of federal human resources data,  administered a questionnaire to the chief learning officers (CLO) at 22  federal agencies with an active grant workforce, and reviewed  documentation and interviewed officials from the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) and OPM. To obtain illustrative examples of  experiences, challenges, and good practices in training the grant  workforce, we selected four agencies\u2014the Departments of Education  (Education), Health and Human Services (HHS), State (State), and  Transportation (DOT). The four agencies we selected account for 84  percent of total grant dollars and 61 percent of total discrete grants  awarded in fiscal year 2012. In addition, these agencies manage a variety  of grant types, including formula, block, and project grants, and cover a  broad range of areas including health, education, and transportation,  among others. To examine good practices that agencies use in training  the grant workforce, we used criteria from our work on strategic training  and workforce planning in the federal government, internal control  standards for training, and OPM guidance.", "To describe the federal grant workforce and analyze challenges related to  workforce identification, we reviewed employee data from FedScope,  collected workforce information through our 22-agency questionnaire and  from our four case example agencies, and we reviewed documentation  and interviewed knowledgeable officials at OMB, OPM, Education, HHS,  State, and DOT. To describe how the federal grant workforce is trained  and to identify challenges and good practices, we reviewed relevant  federal laws and administrative guidance, collected information on  training policies and practices in our questionnaire and in interviews with  training officials at selected sub-agency components of our four case  example agencies, and reviewed agency documents and collected  information on training courses and their costs at Education, HHS, State,  and DOT. To obtain information on government-wide policies and  initiatives in this area, we reviewed documentation and interviewed  officials at OMB and OPM. Since the focus of our work was on describing  how the federal government trains its grant workforce, we conducted the  individual agency reviews in order to identify illustrative examples of  grants training experiences, challenges, and good practices and not to  assess the specific grants training programs at these selected agencies.

Between 2004  and 2011, a work group within the administration\u2019s Grants Policy  Committee (GPC) studied the issue of training and certifying the grant  workforce, which led to a number of recommendations. However, the  work group\u2019s recommendations were never formally adopted by the GPC.  In 2011, OMB formed the Council on Financial Assistance Reform  (COFAR), an interagency group of executive branch officials, to replace  the GPC and another federal board\u2014the Grants Executive Board\u2014with  the stated aim of creating a more streamlined and accountable structure  to coordinate financial assistance, including grants. In November 2012,  just over a year after it was created, COFAR identified the need to  develop a qualified and professional workforce as one of five priorities to  guide its work on grants management reform in the coming years. To  accomplish this, COFAR set five goals:", "Establish core competencies for grants managers by September  2013.", "Develop a baseline body of knowledge as a shared resource by  September 2013.", "Establish a government-wide resource repository for federal grants  professionals by September 2013.", "Provide training for core competencies by September 2014.", "Establish certification standards by September 2015.", "In developing proposals for grants training, COFAR considered the  process and requirements that are in place for training the federal  acquisitions workforce. Federal agencies generally do not need explicit  statutory authority to make particular acquisitions of goods or services.  However, for the procurement of goods and services, federal executive  agencies are governed by a set of requirements specified in the Federal  Acquisition Regulation. Congress has recognized the need for a  professional acquisitions workforce by requiring executive agencies to  establish management policies and procedures for the effective  management of this workforce\u2014including education, training, and career  development. Several governmental organizations play critical roles in  assisting agencies to build and train their acquisitions workforce. These  organizations include OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy, which  provides government-wide guidance on managing the acquisitions  workforce, and the Federal Acquisition Institute, which promotes the  development of the civilian acquisitions workforce.", "In contrast to acquisitions, federal agencies do not have inherent authority  to enter into grant agreements without affirmative authorizing legislation.  Consequently, each federal grant program has legislation that identifies  the types of activities that it can fund and the purposes it is to accomplish.  Frequently, the authorizing legislation that establishes a particular grant  program will define the program objectives and leave the administering  agency to fill in the details through regulation. In addition to specific  statutory requirements, OMB issues administrative requirements in the  form of circulars. These circulars provide government-wide guidance that  sets standards for a range of grants management activities, including  grant application forms, cost principles, audits, and financial reporting.  However, training is not one of the issues for which specific government- wide guidance is provided.", "While many differences exist among grant programs, a basic distinction  can be made between two broad grants management roles. The first role  is grants management specialist\u2014employees who generally possess  detailed knowledge of OMB grants administration requirements, specific  agency policies and procedures for grants management, and relevant  laws and regulations to help ensure accountability of the grant funds.  Grants management specialists are responsible for performing many of  the daily grants management tasks from the pre-award phase through  closeout. The second role is program specialist\u2014employees who  possess expert knowledge in the specific area necessary to meet a  grant\u2019s goals. Reflecting the wide variety of federal programs that grants  support, individuals performing this role typically possess a specialized  program or subject-matter expertise. These specialists can be involved in  several stages of the grant process including announcing the terms and  conditions of a grant, recommending potential grantees, and monitoring  grantees\u2019 progress in achieving the grant\u2019s goals. Although these  categories describe separate focus areas and many employees involved  with grants concentrate on one or the other, the categories are not  mutually exclusive.

However, identifying these skills, as well as the roles,  responsibilities, and training needs of individuals in the federal grant  workforce at a government-wide level remains a challenge.

In the absence of a specific job  classification, officials at selected agencies told us that they classified  these employees under a variety of other job series that did not focus on  grants, such as general, administrative, and subject-matter job titles.  OPM recognized the need for a classification that would more accurately  capture the work of federal employees who manage grants, and in  November 2010 the agency established a \u201cgrants management specialist\u201d  (series 1109). Since then, the extent to which agencies have adopted the  1109 job series has varied greatly. As of December 2012, there were  1,414 federal employees in the 1109 series in the 22 grant-making  agencies we included in our survey. More than half of these employees  worked at HHS. In contrast, 5 of these agencies do not have any series  1109 employees and an additional 7 have fewer than 20 (see figure 1).", "The way that an agency manages grants may explain whether, and to  what extent, it has adopted the grants management specialist job series  1109. In the four agencies we selected for further review, we saw  differences in the extent to which they adopted the 1109 series, partly  because of different grants management approaches. At HHS, where  grants management specialists work alongside program specialists,  officials told us that they embraced the 1109 job series. Shortly after OPM  introduced the series, HHS began moving hundreds of employees, who  were classified in several general or miscellaneous administrative series  and whose primary work responsibilities focused on carrying out  managerial and administrative tasks, to the new 1109 series. In contrast,  both Education and DOT\u2014where program specialists primarily manage  grants\u2014largely chose not to use the new series. Officials at these  agencies told us that this decision resulted from their grants management  approach where program specialists, who have expert subject-matter  knowledge in the grant program area, also carry out the functions of  grants management specialists. These officials also had concerns about  transitioning program specialists such as engineers or educational  specialists, who have specific educational requirements, to the 1109  series which has no such requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Assign Employees in a Wide Variety of Job Series to Manage Grants Other than the Grants Management Specialist Job Series", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the 1109 grants management specialist series, the federal  grant workforce includes a wide range of employees in other job series,  many of whom function as program specialists.

For example, at DOT, the employees  responsible for managing federal airport safety and improvement grants  are typically civil engineers (series 810), who are familiar with airport  runway construction standards. Similarly, HHS employs social scientists  (series 101) with expertise in child and family services as well as doctors  and nurses (series 602 and 610, respectively) to manage and support  grants that fund health care and related services to needy families. Some  agencies, like DOT, typically rely upon program specialists to carry out  both the grants management and program specialist functions, while  others, such as HHS, employ individuals whose primary responsibility is  to administer daily grants management tasks while working alongside  program specialists.", "With such a diverse range of job series across federal grant-making  agencies and given the considerable variation in how agencies assign  individuals to grants management roles, it is difficult to identify all the staff  responsible for managing federal grants other than on an agency-by- agency basis. We asked the four agencies we focused on in this review\u2014 Education, HHS, State, and DOT\u2014to identify the number of employees  they considered to be in their grant workforce and provide us with  breakdowns by job series. They identified over 5,100 employees,  spanning more than 50 different occupational job series. These include  grants management specialists, program specialists (e.g., public health  program specialists, education program specialists, civil engineers,  transportation specialists, and Foreign Service officers), auditors, and  financial managers, among others. See figure 2 for a visual  representation of the relative frequency of more than 90 percent of these  occupational job series.

The program  specialists, accountants, contracting officers, and other individuals  identified as part of the grant workforce generally comprised a relatively  small subset of the total number of agency employees in those  associated job series.

In  a town hall meeting held in December 2012 with grant-making agencies  to discuss COFAR priorities, COFAR officials recognized that  government-wide efforts to develop training and certification standards  will need to consider how to reach members of the grant workforce who  are not in the 1109 series.

Competencies describe measurable patterns of  knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and other characteristics that an  individual needs to perform work roles or occupational functions  successfully. Understood another way, competencies specify what the  person needs to do the job successfully. While there are other ways to  identify training needs, such as through individual development plans or  needs assessments, grants management competency models can be  used to establish an overall framework to guide agencies\u2019 training efforts  as well as to provide a basis for agencies to identify critical skills gaps in  the workforce and training to address these gaps.", "There have been previous efforts to develop government-wide grants  management competencies, and another is planned by COFAR for 2013.  These efforts date back to 2004 when the Chief Financial Officers  Council\u2019s now defunct GPC formed a work group on training and  certifying the grant workforce which, according to officials in this group,  developed an initial draft set of competencies. However, after holding  discussions with OPM, the work group decided not to pursue this effort  because OPM decided to take on the task. Subsequently, in 2009, OPM  released a government-wide grants management competency model.", "According to OPM officials who were involved in the effort, the model  describes functional competencies that apply across multiple job series or  occupations, similar to OPM\u2019s crosscutting leadership competencies. In  addition to numerous general competencies, the model identified five  technical competencies specific to grants management (see table 1).  See appendix IV for the full set of OPM\u2019s grants management  competencies. OPM\u2019s model has served as a framework to support a  government-wide effort to assess critical skills gaps among the federal  workforce. Through that effort, the administration identified seven mission  critical competencies, and three were related to grants management.  OPM officials told us that they are consulting with OMB staff and COFAR  officials to determine a strategy for assessing skills gaps in these  competencies.", "Following the release of OPM\u2019s grants management competencies in  2009 not all grant-making agencies have embraced them. In response to  our survey, half of agency CLOs (11 of 22) reported using the OPM  competencies for purposes of identifying or developing grants training.  The agency experiences described below may provide some insight into  why some agencies have not used OPM\u2019s competencies and also raise  questions about the sufficiency of OPM\u2019s competencies in meeting the  needs of program specialists.", "At HHS, several grant-making operating divisions told us that while they  found OPM\u2019s competency model useful for grants management  specialists, they also needed a separate competency model for staff who  function as program specialists working with their grants management  specialists to manage grants. For example, officials in HHS\u2019s Health  Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) noted that OPM\u2019s  competencies were not appropriate for program specialists, so they  developed a set of program specialist competencies. While these  incorporate elements similar to OPM\u2019s technical competencies, they also  include others that are more directly related to the employee\u2019s specific  role in the HRSA grant program. HRSA highlights the role and authority of  program specialists in the agency as distinct from that of the grants  management specialist (series 1109 employees). In addition to  competencies specifically related to grants management, HRSA also  includes competencies related to policy analysis, research and  evaluation, and technical assistance. For example, under the \u201cpolicy  analysis\u201d competency, program specialists must be able to apply public  health knowledge to HRSA\u2019s programs, perform policy analysis, and use  this information to develop recommendations for improving HRSA  programs or grantee performance. Under the \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d  competency, program specialists need to be able to plan and conduct  training and other activities that help grant applicants and grantees  understand and comply with grant objectives and policies. In June 2013,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) finalized a set of  competencies for program specialists which, like HRSA\u2019s program  specialist competencies, includes competencies directly related to the  employee\u2019s specific role in CDC grant programs.", "At Education, an official told us that OPM\u2019s single overarching grants  management competency model did not fit the agency\u2019s culture or the  way it managed grants. Unlike HHS, Education employs program  specialists to manage grants through the entire process. Of the six job  series under which the grant workforce is classified, five are mission  critical occupations and the agency incorporates grants management  competencies into the competency models for these occupations. For  example, competencies for management and program analysts (series  343) include elements similar to the five OPM technical competencies.  Education also includes competencies demonstrating leadership in the  field and programmatic understanding and knowledge as well as technical  assistance for both management and program analysts and education  research analysts/education program specialists (series 1730/1720). An  Education official explained that the agency\u2019s culture was resistant to a  single, one-size-fits-all approach, and that staff were concerned that such  a model would not adequately account for the technical and  programmatic expertise needed to achieve program goals. Education  used these grants management competencies as part of an agency-wide  competency gap assessment, and is using the results to develop training  to close these gaps.", "A recent effort to develop government-wide grants management  competencies provides further confirmation of the importance of  developing competencies based on how agencies manage grants. In  June 2012, senior executives from across the federal government  gathered at the first meeting of the group Leading Executives Driving  Government Excellence (Leading EDGE) to examine a variety of  government-wide management issues and one issue the group selected  to address was grants training. In November of that year, the group  issued a report recommending a set of grants management  competencies. The Leading EDGE report recognized that federal  agencies target and structure their grants training depending on how they  manage grants and that this varied across agencies. Further, the report  acknowledged that some agencies assign grants management specialists  to work in conjunction with program specialists while others assign an  individual to perform both of these roles, and that grants training  competencies needed to account for this variation.", "Despite its recognition of the importance of considering the different ways  that agencies manage grants when formulating a grants management  competency model, the competency model the Leading EDGE report  proposes is not significantly different from the model developed by OPM  in 2009. In fact, the Leading EDGE model consists of the same  competencies, defined in the same way, as those in OPM\u2019s model. The  only change to the competencies is how Leading EDGE categorizes two  competencies\u2014\u201cplanning and evaluation\u201d and \u201cproject management.\u201d In  the OPM model these are listed as \u201cgeneral\u201d competencies, whereas  under the Leading Edge proposal, they become \u201ctechnical\u201d competencies.  The Leading EDGE report does not specifically explain how making such  a change would provide a meaningful alternative to the status quo that led  agencies like HRSA and Education to explore other approaches. This is  particularly true in light of the fact that, according to OPM officials, it is not  uncommon for agencies to reclassify competencies as appropriate for  their needs under existing competency models. So, while the Leading  EDGE report represents a useful step forward in its recognition of the  need to more fully integrate considerations related to program specialists  when thinking about grants management competencies, its proposal,  much like the current OPM model itself, is not likely to sufficiently address  the need for competencies that are more responsive to the program  specialist role.", "We believe that these agency experiences, and that of Leading EDGE,  provide important information for COFAR\u2019s consideration when  developing government-wide grants management competencies.  According to planning documents, COFAR expects to produce  government-wide grants management competencies by September 2013.  Toward this end, OMB staff told us that they have held three town hall  meetings with agency officials between August 2012 and April 2013 in  order to review COFAR\u2019s priorities, such as developing grants  management competencies, and to obtain feedback from all federal  grant-making agencies on what COFAR should consider as it moves  forward on its priorities. Also, they engaged other stakeholders such as  professional grants associations at meetings, conferences, and on  conference calls. In addition, OMB staff said that COFAR plans to build  on Leading EDGE\u2019s work as it develops new grants management  competencies for the federal workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Adapted Grants Training Courses and Developed Other Training Mechanisms to Address Agency-Specific Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that agencies need to provide their  workforce with training and development that is aligned with their  missions, goals, and cultures. We found that agencies provide formal  and informal grants training through classroom instruction, online  webinars, and meetings or briefings. The source of this training was  generally a combination of direct agency provision and external vendors.  According to our agency CLO survey, 7 of 22 agency CLOs responded  that all or most of their grants training was provided by their agency. In  addition, 9 of the 22 agency CLOs said they receive all or most of their  grants training from commercial or non-profit sources, and the most  common commercial provider by far was a single vendor. This vendor  offers a set of core grants management courses designed to provide  general knowledge that can be applied across the federal grants  environment. Among these is an introductory course on grants as well as  courses on cost principles, administrative requirements, and grants  monitoring.", "Agencies also reported difficulties finding grants training that met all of the  needs of their grant workforce. Specifically, 13 of 22 agency CLOs  responding to our survey said that they found the availability of training  that met agency needs was at least a moderate challenge in training the  grant workforce. For example, an agency said it was challenging to find  courses that include instruction on specific statutes that authorize grant  programs. In addition, in our interviews at selected agencies, officials told  us that while external training courses were often useful in providing staff  with general grants management knowledge, it was challenging to find  courses that addressed agency or program-specific policies and  procedures.", "Of the four agencies we selected for a more detailed review, some  responded to this challenge by customizing or supplementing  foundational grants training courses provided by a commercial vendor or  by developing training mechanisms, other than formal courses, for  distributing agency-specific guidance to employees. For example,  Education worked with a commercial vendor to tailor the vendor\u2019s grants  training courses to reflect Education\u2019s policies and procedures and  include examples and exercises specific to the agency. Although these  courses were taught by the vendor\u2019s instructors, Education provided  subject-matter experts to guide the customization of the courses to  include agency policies and procedures. According to Education officials,  the decision to tailor these external courses was based on participant  feedback as well as their understanding of how adults process  information while learning. The agency offered the courses to one cohort  of employees in fiscal year 2011, to another cohort in fiscal year 2012,  and to two cohorts in fiscal year 2013. Each cohort consisted of 35  employees.", "In contrast, at HHS, officials chose to supplement commercially available  grants training courses by developing their own grants training courses.  For example, in addition to offering program specialists a core of vendor- provided courses, during the course of this review HRSA began requiring  these employees to take three courses that the operating division  specifically developed for its own grant policies and procedures. HRSA  officials told us that while they found the commercial courses offered  beneficial foundational knowledge on grants management, the courses  did not fully address how the grants process operated at HRSA. For  example, although the commercial courses cover administrative  requirements for grants management as set by OMB, a goal of the HRSA  program specialist training is to help program specialists understand how  HHS policy relates to OMB guidance. The program specialist course  manual uses practice scenarios with specific HRSA examples to present  the reasoning behind when and which policies should supersede others.  HRSA officials told us that the program specialist training was developed,  in part, with the goal of improving customer service to grantees by  ensuring that staff receive specific training on how to manage HRSA  grants.", "Each of the agencies that we selected for a detailed review also used  other approaches to impart agency-specific guidance on grant policies  and procedures to the grant workforce. For example, State used a  number of training mechanisms in addition to formal courses to train its  grant workforce both domestically and overseas. These included informal  training sessions and a variety of online information sharing. Informal  training included roundtable discussions facilitated quarterly by State\u2019s  central grant policy office. These discussions allowed employees to share  knowledge and perspectives with their peers on topics such as monitoring  grant programs through site visits. State has several methods for sharing  information, including an online platform where employees can find the  latest information on policy guidance and regulations, grant reports, and  grant systems as well as online repositories for frequently asked  questions on agency grants policy and financial management of grants.", "State officials told us that because OMB administrative guidance  generally does not apply to the overseas grant environment, the agency  has developed training for the grant workforce on agency-specific policies  and procedures. Using the training mechanisms described above,  among other training methods, agency officials said they were able to  provide employees with agency-specific training as issues arose and,  through the use of online information sharing, easily reach those in the  overseas bureaus.", "On a government-wide level, COFAR plans to provide training on grants  management core competencies by September 2014. Toward that end,  OMB staff told us that COFAR has solicited feedback in town hall  meetings with grant-making agencies, explored potential options for  training venues, and is having HHS take the lead for COFAR in this effort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Experiences with Establishing Grants Management Certification Programs Illustrate the Usefulness of Tailoring Certification to Fit Roles and Responsibilities and the Value of Leadership Commitment", "paragraphs": ["Certification programs are designed to ensure that individuals attain the  knowledge and skills required to perform in a particular occupation or role  by establishing consistent standards. Requirements for certification often  include some amount of professional experience, continuing education,  and successful completion of an assessment process that measures an  individual\u2019s mastery of knowledge and skills against a set of standards.  Internal control standards for agencies state that management should  identify the appropriate knowledge and skills, provide training, and  establish a mechanism to help ensure that all employees receive  appropriate training as part of establishing a control environment. One  internal control mechanism agencies have used is to develop certification  programs to help ensure that staff demonstrate a level of competence in a  particular field critical to the agencies\u2019 missions and goals.", "Although not required government-wide, many agencies require or  recommend grants management certifications in order to help ensure  sound management practices across the agencies\u2019 grant workforce.  Twenty-three percent (5 of 22) of agency CLOs responding to our survey  reported that their agency requires some type of grants management  certification and 73 percent (16 of 22) either require or recommend  certification. The 16 agencies that either require or recommend grants  management certification most often chose the following as one of the top  three reasons why they do so:  to ensure compliance with grants management regulations (15 of 16  agencies);  to ensure accountability of grant funds (12 of 16 agencies); and  to ensure uniform knowledge (11 of 16 agencies).", "The experiences of agencies that have established certification programs  suggest some broader lessons for establishing grants management  certification standards government-wide that apply to the entire grant  workforce. Two of the four agencies we selected for a more detailed  review\u2014State and HHS\u2014have developed certification programs. State  has implemented certification programs for all grants officers and, as of  January 2013, for all grants officer representatives. To earn the grants  officer certification employees must complete grants training, possess  specific levels of education or experience, and comply with a continuing  education requirement. To earn the grants officer representative  certification employees must complete specific grants training and comply  with a continuing education requirement.  HHS developed an agency- wide certification program for grants management specialists, but only  some of its operating divisions have implemented it. The certification  program has four levels for grants management specialists, each of which  requires staff to either complete specific training or to obtain an increasing  amount of on-the-job experience. Several operating divisions also require  that program specialists take some grants training, and one operating  division is proposing a separate required certification program for  program specialists.", "One lesson that agency experiences suggest is the importance of clearly  defining the roles and responsibilities of a diverse grant workforce and  then appropriately tailoring certification standards in order to ensure that  all key personnel in the grant workforce have appropriate and consistent  knowledge to fulfill their roles. For example, State identified two key roles  in its grants management process\u2014grants officers and grants officer  representatives\u2014and tailored separate certifications for these roles.", "Certified grants officers (e.g., grants management specialists) issue  federal grant awards up to a specified value depending on the level of  certification. As the value of grant awards increases, the amount of  training required for the certification also increases. All levels of grants  officer certification require completion of a certain number of training  hours every 3 years in order to renew the certification. Grants officer  representatives are program specialists who oversee the programmatic  and technical aspects of the grant. They are appointed by grants officers  and must complete two grants management courses before obtaining the  grants officer representative certification. All grants officer representatives  must update their training with additional grants training every 3 years. In  2007, we reported that State had inconsistent training and skills  requirements for the grant workforce, and that State officials were  concerned about the agency\u2019s ability to effectively manage its grants and  other foreign assistance. Agency officials told us that the grants officer  representative certification was implemented in January 2013, to address  inconsistencies in training for grants officer representatives across the  agency.", "In another example, HHS\u2019s guidance on its agency-wide certification  program recognizes the important role that program specialists play in the  technical, scientific, and programmatic aspects of grants. The guidance  states that since program specialists work in partnership with grants  management specialists, they should complete an orientation course in  grants administration that emphasizes the program specialist\u2019s role in the  grants management process. Completion of this orientation course in  conjunction with joint nomination by the supervising program and grant  officials results in certification as a program specialist. The guidance  encourages program specialists to take further grants training, but does  not require them to complete the grants management certification.", "Another lesson illustrated by agency experiences in this area is the  importance of ongoing leadership commitment and having a mechanism  in place to track the implementation of training requirements. HHS  developed an agency-wide professional certification program for the grant  workforce in 1995, but the program was not fully implemented even  though operating divisions were required to do so by guidance and an  agency policy directive. We found that a limited number of grant-making  operating divisions (4 of the 13) had taken action to implement the  required certification program. Grant officials in HHS\u2019s operating  divisions told us that the program was inconsistently implemented  because of changes in agency-level leadership and lack of enforcement.  Other officials said that without enforcement of the certification  requirement or updated agency-wide training guidance for grants  management it was a challenge to obtain the resources needed and  identify courses for training the grant workforce. Another potential factor  contributing to uneven implementation was that HHS did not track most  staff completion of the grants management certifications agency-wide,  although operating divisions tracked staff completion where the  requirement was enforced. Agency officials told us that they did track  certification completion for those meeting the requirements of the highest  certification level reserved for chief grants management officers, a  position typically filled by members of the Senior Executive Service.  According to these officials, the operating divisions at HHS nominate staff  to receive the chief grants management officer certification and the  agency-level grants policy division authorizes it. In contrast, State tracked  whether staff completed requirements for its grants certifications in a  database maintained by the Office of the Procurement Executive. Officials  told us the system\u2019s visibility is a useful monitoring tool that encourages  staff to complete the certification program in a timely manner.", "We believe that the lessons from these two agencies that have developed  certification programs provide important information for COFAR\u2019s  consideration. On a government-wide level, COFAR has identified the  need to ensure a consistent knowledge base and professionalize the  grant workforce through developing certification standards by September  2015. OMB staff told us that they are looking into a multi-agency effort to  develop a grants management certification that is being led by the  Departments of Commerce and Energy. OMB staff also said they have  had initial discussions on certification standards with professional grants  associations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the importance of grants as a tool to achieve federal objectives and  the large outlays the federal government makes to fund them each year, it  is critical that the people who manage these grants\u2014the federal grant  workforce\u2014be well-trained to handle their responsibilities. A key first step  in this process is to have a clear understanding of the different ways  agencies manage their grant processes and the wide variety of  employees involved. A robust understanding of the diverse types of  employees that make up the grant workforce and the key roles they carry  out provides a foundation for the development of an effective  government-wide grants training strategy.", "In November 2012, COFAR identified the federal government\u2019s need to  develop a qualified and professional grant workforce as one of its top  priorities in the coming years. Toward that end, it announced a series of  goals including the creation of government-wide grants competencies,  training, and certification standards. As COFAR moves forward with plans  to develop such standards, its efforts would benefit from considering the  experiences of federal agencies in areas such as the development of  grants management competencies and certification programs. Several  agencies we reviewed found competencies to be a useful tool for  structuring and identifying training needs. However, to fully support the  agencies\u2019 grant-making missions and goals, the competencies need to  address two key roles in the grant workforce: grants management  specialists and program specialists. Although OPM\u2019s competency model  appears to largely address the former, the experiences of agencies we  reviewed suggest that the model was not directly applicable for program  specialists involved in the grants process. Recognizing this gap, agencies  took a variety of approaches including developing their own competency  models for program specialists or finding ways to incorporate specific  grants management competencies into existing competency models.  Based on these agency experiences, future government-wide  competencies that do not address the program specialist role will likely  not be fully adopted by grant-making agencies.", "Similar to agency experiences with competencies, some agencies have  developed certification programs that have unique requirements  depending on the role of the individual as either a grants management  specialist or a program specialist. At one agency, for example, by  developing a certification program that specifies a standard training  curriculum and other requirements for both key roles in the grant  workforce, the agency helped to ensure that key members of its grant  workforce have appropriate levels of proficiency. Future government-wide  certification standards that do not distinguish between the grants  management specialist role and the program specialist role will likely not  be fully adopted for the entire grant workforce by all grant-making  agencies. As COFAR crafts government-wide standards for grants  training, agency experiences highlight the importance of defining the roles  of the grant workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["As COFAR works to professionalize the federal grant workforce, we  recommend that the Director of OMB, in collaboration with COFAR, take  the following two actions:  1.

The survey questionnaire included  questions on grants-specific training, certification, administration and  development of training, and challenges and good practices in training the  grant workforce. Two agencies, the General Services Administration and  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), were dropped from our  survey after officials in those agencies stated that they did not have any  personnel actively working on grants. Each of the remaining 22 agencies  responded to the survey, resulting in a 100 percent response rate from  CFO Act agencies with an active grant workforce. The questionnaires  were sent to the CLOs but they were asked to share them, as needed,  with other knowledgeable agency staff in order to provide an informed  response. Agencies were asked to return a single questionnaire that best  represented their practices and challenges as a whole. Four agencies  returned multiple questionnaires from sub-agency components. To  address this, we developed a methodology for combining responses in  order to formulate an agency-wide response. We also conducted follow- up conversations with agencies to clarify responses or collect additional  details.", "To obtain illustrative examples of experiences, challenges, and good  practices in training the grant workforce, we conducted additional reviews  at four agencies. We selected these agencies from among the 22 CFO  Act agencies with an active grant workforce after considering the  agencies\u2019 total grant obligations, number of grant programs, and number  of discrete grants awarded (using fiscal year 2011 USASpending.gov  data). In addition, in making our selections we considered whether an  agency had grants training or certification requirements, any good grants  training practices as identified by its CLO, the existence of significant  issues regarding grants or training as reported in our prior work, the  number of grant-making operating divisions, the variety of grant types  (formula, block, and project), major grant issue areas (such as health,  education, and transportation) and functional areas (such as service  delivery, construction, and research). The scope of this review was limited  to federal grants and did not include cooperative agreements or other  types of federal assistance. We selected agencies that administered a  large majority of federal grant obligations and also collectively  represented a range of positions on these other criteria. The four  agencies we selected\u2014the Departments of Education (Education), Health  and Human Services (HHS), State (State), and Transportation (DOT)\u2014 account for over 84 percent of the federal government\u2019s total grant dollars  obligated in fiscal year 2012, manage all three major grant types, and  cover a broad range of grant issue areas. At each of these agencies, we  reviewed documents including training materials and grants policy  directives and interviewed training officials. We interviewed agency-level  grants and training officials at each agency, and at the agencies we  selected where grants training is generally managed at the sub-agency  level\u2014HHS, Education, and DOT\u2014we also interviewed officials at  selected sub-agencies. These sub-agency components were selected  using criteria similar to that detailed above for agency selection. We also  collected information on training courses, their costs, and the grant  workforce at both the agency-level as well as all grant-making sub- agency components.", "Since the focus of our work was to better understand and provide  information on how the federal government trains its grant workforce, we  conducted our reviews at each selected agency to identify examples of  grants training experiences, challenges, and good practices, and not to  audit their grants training programs. Accordingly, we did not seek to make  an evaluative judgment of the specific grants training programs at the four  selected agencies nor assess the prevalence of the practices or  challenges we cite either within or across the four agencies. Agencies  and sub-agency components other than those cited for a particular  practice may or may not also be engaged in the same practices. While  the responses and comments provided on our survey reflect the views of  the CLOs at 22 of the CFO Act agencies, the examples of good training  practices and challenges we identified are from the four selected  agencies and are therefore not generalizable to other agencies. To  examine good practices that agencies use in training the grant workforce,  we used criteria from our work on strategic training and workforce  planning in the federal government, internal control standards for training,  and OPM guidance.", "To describe the federal grant workforce and the challenge of identifying  the workforce government-wide, we collected workforce data from the  four case example agencies, reviewed data on the grants management  specialist job series 1109, and interviewed officials at OPM. We  requested data from our four case example agencies on the makeup of  their grant workforce. To identify their grant workforce, cognizant grant  officials at the agency or sub-agency component level generally made  judgments regarding which employees to include and then used agency  personnel databases to access job series data associated with those  identified. To assess the reliability of these data, we examined the  workforce data provided by the agencies for anomalies. This included  obtaining data on the total number of federal employees in the 1109  grants management specialist series for each of the four selected  agencies from FedScope. We then compared the numbers of 1109  series employees reported by the agencies to the data in FedScope in  order to confirm the data collected from the agencies for the 1109 series.  Only minor differences in the total number of series 1109 employees were  noted and this was expected due to the 4-month difference in the time  frames covered by the data. We also interviewed officials at OPM to  discuss the development of the 1109 job series for grants management  specialists and challenges associated with grant workforce identification.  Based on our tests and discussions with agency officials, we determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.

A/OPE sets  training requirements for the grant workforce and collaborates with the  Foreign Service Institute to help ensure that training courses are  appropriately developed and delivered. Additional training on financial  management of grants is developed by the Office of Federal Assistance  Financial Management. Training and certification is required for all grants  officers and grants officer representatives. While training for grants is  centrally managed, each grant may be managed by a single or multiple  bureaus depending on the type of assistance being provided. For  instance, for grants that support a particular country or region, such as  Iraq Assistance Programs, multiple bureaus may manage the funds to  support a range of assistance programs. On the other hand, if the grant  supports assistance in a particular program, such as educational  exchanges, a single bureau, the Bureau of Educational and Cultural  Affairs, may manage most or all of the funds.", "At State, agency policy states that grants are managed by warranted  grants officers who are authorized to award grants up to a specified  amount. Grants officers appoint grants officer representatives (GOR) to  assist with technical and programmatic aspects of the grant. These two  positions correspond to the grants management specialist and program  specialist, respectively, as described in our report. In addition, financial  management officers assist with fiscal management aspects of the grants  process. State estimated that there are approximately 605 grants officers,  most of whom are stationed overseas. In addition, 280 positions,  including financial management officers, support those grants officers at  overseas posts and in bureaus domestically. The GOR certification  program was effective as of January 2013 and GORs had up to six  months to meet the certification requirements, thus State did not yet have  a complete accounting of all certified GORs at the time of publication. A  full accounting is expected by late summer 2013 when all GORs are  required to be certified and registered in State\u2019s database that tracks both  certified grants officers and GORs.", "The grant workforce consists primarily of Foreign Service officers serving  in posts around the world. State officials explained that, at these posts,  not all Foreign Service officers work on grants, but those that do are  responsible for multiple tasks, including managing grants. As a result,  there are a lot of personnel that work on grants, and for many of the 740  Foreign Service officers identified as part of the grant workforce, grant- related tasks are a part-time responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Grants Management Training Practices", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Grants Management Competencies and Assessing Training Needs", "paragraphs": ["State officials told us that, during the time of this review, they did not use  grants management competencies for the purposes of identifying training.

For instance, after  review of grants administration at the Bureau of Educational and Cultural  Affairs, it was determined that the grant workforce was lacking expertise  in several areas. To address the specific training needs of the bureau\u2019s  employees, A/OPE developed training for the bureau that augmented the  formal training courses.", "State requires all grants officers and GORs to complete training in grants  management. Course topics include an introduction to grants and  cooperative agreements, an introduction to monitoring grants, and ethics.  As State officials explained, some of the required training courses were  developed within the agency because the general training available from  commercial vendors did not meet the needs of their staff. For example,  most of State\u2019s grant recipients are foreign organizations, and the training  from commercial vendors does not include specific grants management  scenarios that staff are likely to encounter with foreign grant recipients.  State officials told us that because OMB administrative guidance does not  apply to the overseas grant environment the agency trains the grant  workforce on agency-specific policies and procedures. After designing its  own courses, State was also able to offer the course through a distance- learning system that allowed grants officers and GORs overseas to  access the training.", "In addition to formal training courses, State offers informal training to its  grant workforce through a variety of mechanisms. These include informal  training sessions and a variety of online information sharing. For example,  officials told us that, at quarterly meetings facilitated by State\u2019s central  grants policy office, roundtable discussions allow employees to share  knowledge and perspectives with their peers on topics such as monitoring  grant programs through site visits. Officials told us that State has several  methods for sharing information, including an online platform where  employees can find the latest information on policy guidance and  regulations, grant reports, and grant systems as well as online  repositories for frequently asked questions on agency grants policy and  financial management of grants.", "As described in the agency\u2019s grants policy directives, State has  implemented two certification programs\u2014one for grants officers and the  other for GORs. Both certifications require completion of specific grants  training and have continuing education requirements. The grants officer  certification also requires certain levels of education or experience.  Certified grants officers are warranted to issue federal grant awards up to  a specified value depending on the level of certification. As the value of  grant award increases, the amount of training required for the certification  also increases. All levels of grants officer certification require completion  of a certain number of training hours every 3 years in order to renew the  certification. GORs must complete two grants management courses  before obtaining the grants officer representative certification. After  certification the GOR is eligible to be designated to a specific agreement  by the grants officers. In addition, all GORs must update their training with  additional grants training every 3 years. The grants officer representative  certification was implemented in January 2013 to help address  inconsistencies in the level of training for grants officer representatives  across the agency.
