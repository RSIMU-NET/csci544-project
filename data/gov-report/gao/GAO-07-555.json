The benefit also offers a subsidy administered by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to assist certain low-income Medicare beneficiaries with out-of-pocket costs. GAO was asked to review (1) SSA's progress in identifying and soliciting applications from individuals potentially eligible for the subsidy; (2) SSA's processes for making eligibility determinations, resolving appeals, and redetermining beneficiaries' eligibility; and (3) how the subsidy has affected SSA's workload and operations. To conduct this study, GAO reviewed the law, assessed subsidy data, and interviewed SSA and other officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["SSA approved about 2.2 million Medicare beneficiaries for the low-income subsidy as of March 2007, despite barriers it faced in identifying the eligible population and soliciting applications; however, measuring the success of SSA's outreach efforts is difficult because there are no reliable data on the size of the eligible population. In 2005, SSA mailed 18.6 million subsidy applications to Medicare beneficiaries who were potentially eligible for the subsidy. SSA knew that this mailing was an overestimate, but took this approach to ensure that all who were eligible would be contacted. SSA had hoped to more specifically identify the eligible population using IRS tax data, but current law restricts the use of taxpayer data unless an individual has already applied for the subsidy. Further, SSA conducted a campaign of about 76,000 events held nationwide to educate people about the subsidy and how to apply for it. Since the initial campaign ended, however, SSA has not developed specific performance goals and measures to assess the progress of its continuing outreach efforts. SSA's efforts to solicit applications were hindered by beneficiaries' confusion about the difference between the subsidy and the Medicare Part D prescription drug plan, and the reluctance of some individuals to share personal financial information, among other factors. While the early subsidy participation rate compares favorably to those of some other low-income programs, the lack of reliable data on the size of the eligible population means that the extent to which SSA has signed up the eligible population for the benefit is unknown. While SSA has established processes for making subsidy eligibility determinations, resolving appeals, and conducting redeterminations, it has not established some key management tools to monitor the progress of all of its efforts, as specified in GAO's internal control standards. For example, while SSA tracks various results from its appeals process, it does not currently have a performance goal to assess the timeliness of appeals decisions, but agency officials told us that SSA plans to establish a goal of processing 75 percent of appeals in 60 days. Also, while SSA tracks the status of its redetermination decisions, officials do not believe that it is necessary to measure the time for processing individual redetermination decisions because they said that the time to complete the overall redeterminations cycle provides adequate information. SSA's implementation of the low-income subsidy did affect the agency's workload and operations, but according to SSA officials, the additional workloadhas been manageable overall as a result of increased funding that the agency received to carry out MMA activities. SSA hired 2,200 field office staff, and 500 headquarters staff to handle its new subsidy workload, as well as to carry out other activities for the program. In 2006, SSA staff spent the equivalent of 2,190 work years on low-income subsidy implementation activities, with about 50 percent of the time spent on subsidy applications. While there were periods of high subsidy application activity, SSA officials told us that subsidy program activities did not have an adverse impact on other SSA workloads. The officials attributed the minimal impact of Part D to several factors, including the highly automated subsidy application process and the $500 million congressional appropriation that SSA spent on MMA start-up costs. SSA estimates that its costs for low-income subsidy activities are $175 million annually."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["High prescription drug costs can have a detrimental effect on low-income  seniors and the disabled, who are more likely than others to suffer from  chronic medical problems requiring prescription drugs.

To help the elderly and disabled  with these costs, the Congress passed the Medicare Prescription Drug,  Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, which created a  voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit (Medicare Part D).

We reviewed available documentation on  SSA\u2019s processes for making eligibility determinations, resolving appeals,  and making redeterminations. While we were generally able to verify some  data on the processing time for eligibility determinations, based on  electronic data provided to us, we did not have all the information needed  to verify the validity of other data. We also interviewed SSA management  and staff in eight SSA field offices in Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and  Texas to obtain their views on the implementation, as well as client  feedback they received regarding the subsidy application process. We  selected SSA offices in those states because of the large number of subsidy  applications that had been mailed to individuals potentially eligible for the  subsidy. We visited SSA offices in Pennsylvania and Texas in particular  because counties in these states had the most applicants for the subsidy as  of June 2006. We interviewed CMS officials and obtained available  documentation on the agency\u2019s involvement with SSA\u2019s outreach efforts.  We also interviewed officials at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  concerning legal restrictions on its ability to release tax data to SSA for the  purposes of determining the population eligible for the subsidy and their  concerns if these restrictions were lifted. We also met with various  advocacy groups that represent low-income and disabled beneficiaries to  obtain their perspectives on SSA\u2019s implementation of the low-income  subsidy. In addition, we interviewed officials in the five state Medicaid  offices discussed earlier and two state health insurance programs  (Pennsylvania and Texas) to obtain information on their efforts in  assisting clients in applying for the subsidy and their perspectives on SSA\u2019s  implementation efforts.

The  objectives of the task force included determining the affected population;  the number of staff, locations, and material resources needed; and  agreeing on specific responsibilities with other federal government  agencies. Under the MMA, the Congress provided SSA with a $500 million  appropriation from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the  Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund to pay for the  initiation of SSA\u2019s Part D responsibilities for fiscal years 2004 and 2005,  but later extended the appropriation to fiscal year 2006.

SSA took  this approach because there were no reliable data on the size of the  eligible population. SSA developed the targeted population to which to  mail the subsidy applications by screening out Medicare beneficiaries  whose income made them ineligible for the Part D subsidy using income  data from its benefit records, as well as income data from the Office of  Personnel Management, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Railroad  Retirement Board, and the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). SSA realized that using  these data sources would result in an overestimate of the number of  individuals who might qualify for the subsidy. While the data provided  information on individuals\u2019 income, it provided limited information on  individuals\u2019 assets or nonwage income, which is needed to determine  eligibility for the subsidy. Because of the lack of such information, SSA  proceeded with a more generalized targeting of Medicare beneficiaries to  ensure that all individuals who were potentially eligible for the subsidy  were made aware of the benefit and had an opportunity to apply for it. SSA  officials said that they would have preferred to specifically target Medicare  beneficiaries who were more likely to be eligible for the subsidy by using  tax data from IRS on individuals\u2019 wage, interest, and pension income,  which would be needed to determine individuals\u2019 level of income and  assets. Without such data, SSA can neither estimate how many individuals  might qualify for the subsidy nor identify individuals to target for more  direct outreach. The officials said that their prior experience with other  low-income-based programs had shown that more targeted outreach  efforts helped to elicit a higher response rate. Current law permits SSA to  obtain income and asset data from IRS to assist in verifying income and  asset data provided by individuals who have applied for the subsidy.  However, to protect the privacy of taxpayer information and enhance tax  compliance, the law prohibits disclosures of such information to identify  individuals who may be eligible for the subsidy, but have not applied.", "In a November 2006 report, the HHS Office of Inspector General reported  that legislation is needed to provide SSA and CMS access to income tax  data to help the agencies more effectively identify beneficiaries potentially  eligible for the subsidy. While SSA uses various sources of information to  identify individuals\u2019 income, it does not have access to income data that  could assist in imputing an individual\u2019s level of assets, which it believes  could be provided through IRS income tax data. SSA estimates individuals\u2019  assets because IRS income tax return and other tax data do not contain  asset information. However, IRS officials told us that its data have many  limitations that could affect their usefulness. For example, IRS officials  said that they have limited data on assets for individuals whose income is  less than $20,000, because these individuals do not typically have interest  income, private pensions, or dividend income from stocks that could assist  SSA in estimating an individual\u2019s potential asset level. Also, the officials  said that many people with low incomes are not required to file taxes, and  therefore IRS would have only limited information on them. IRS officials  also explained that tax data could most likely identify individuals who  would not qualify for the subsidy, rather than those who would.  Conversely, the officials stated that tax data might incorrectly eliminate  some people who might qualify for the subsidy, which could result in SSA  not contacting them. Moreover, the IRS officials said that the data it  provides to SSA to determine eligibility could be almost 2 years old and  may not reflect an individual\u2019s current income. For example, for subsidy  applications in 2007, the last full year of tax data the IRS could provide  would be for 2005. Given these various factors, IRS officials stated that  summarily sharing private taxpayer data to identify individuals who could  qualify for the subsidy, and the potential cost of systems changes, would  have to be weighed against the added value of the data. Despite IRS\u2019s  position on the limitations of its data on low-income taxpayers, SSA  officials believe that IRS data can still help to better target the eligible  population. However, no effort has been undertaken to determine the  extent to which IRS income data could benefit SSA in this effort, or  improve estimates of the eligible population. Legislation is currently  pending before the Congress to permit IRS to share taxpayer data with  SSA to assist the agency in better identifying individuals who might be  eligible for the subsidy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers That Limited SSA\u2019s Solicitation Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Although SSA has approved 2.2 million applicants for the subsidy, it  initially faced difficulties in soliciting applications.

SSA worked  with various focus groups to develop the application, which included  questions about applicants\u2019 income and resources, the value of life  insurance policies, and household size. Appendix II provides the total  number of subsidy applications mailed by state. After the subsidy  applications were mailed, a contractor then made phone calls to   9.1 million beneficiaries who had not responded to the initial mailing, and  SSA made 400,000 follow-up calls to the beneficiaries who requested SSA  assistance. SSA also conducted other follow-up efforts, including sending  follow-up notices to individuals whom the contractor was unable to  contact and to specific subgroups that it identified as having a high  likelihood of qualifying for the subsidy, such as the disabled; individuals  over 79 years of age living in high-poverty areas; and individuals in  Spanish-speaking, Asian-American, and African-American households.   In addition, SSA called over 300,000 Medicare beneficiaries who had not  applied, but had previously qualified for a temporary Medicare drug  discount card, and included information about the subsidy in its 2005   and 2006 annual cost of living adjustment notices to Social Security  beneficiaries and its annual Medicare Savings Program outreach letters.", "SSA\u2019s efforts to solicit applications were hindered by various factors,  including individuals\u2019 confusion over the difference between the  prescription drug program and the subsidy, the reluctance of some  individuals to share personal financial information, and eligibility  requirements, among other factors. According to SSA field office staff   and state Medicaid and advocacy group officials, many individuals were  confused about the difference between the prescription drug program   and the subsidy, and did not understand that they involved separate  application processes, although the subsidy application and the decision  letters explained that Part D enrollment was a separate process.  Consequently, some individuals thought that once they were approved for  the subsidy, they were automatically enrolled in a prescription drug plan  and vice versa to a lesser extent. SSA field office staff and advocacy group  officials also told us some individuals were reluctant to apply because they  did not want to share their personal financial information for fear that an  inadvertent error on the application could subject them to prosecution  under the application\u2019s perjury clause. Though the impact of these factors  has lessened as individuals have become more educated about the  subsidy, concerns remain about eligibility requirements and the overall  complexity of the application. For example, SSA field office staff and  advocacy group officials said that the subsidy\u2019s resource test may render  some low-income individuals ineligible because of retirement savings or  the value of other resources. Legislation has been proposed to increase the  resource limit to allow more beneficiaries to qualify for the subsidy.  Advocacy group officials also said that the application may be too  complex for many elderly and disabled beneficiaries to understand and  complete without the assistance of a third party.

According to SSA officials, those  requiring no decision were the result of duplicate applications,  applications from individuals automatically qualified for the subsidy, or  canceled applications. To identify reasons for subsidy denials, SSA  conducted three separate studies that sampled a total of 1,326 denied  claims. These studies showed that most of applicants were denied due to  resources or income that exceeded allowable limits set by the MMA   (fig. 4). SSA officials stated that they plan to conduct a longitudinal study  to examine the reasons for all cases in which applicants were denied   the subsidy.", "While SSA has captured data on the length of time it takes to make  eligibility determinations since it began accepting applications for the  subsidy in July 2005, it did not develop the capability to report the data,  and did not establish a performance goal for processing times until March  2007. As a result, SSA did not have the management information that it  needed to monitor its performance in this area and identify areas where  improvements were needed.

SSA\u2019s data as of mid-March for calendar  year 2007 showed that of the approximately 213,000 applications received,  SSA had processed about 94 percent in 60 days or less, compared to nearly  91 percent of the approximately 1.3 million applications within the same  time frame for calendar year 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appeals", "paragraphs": ["Individuals may appeal denied subsidy determinations, as well as the level  of the subsidy, by calling SSA\u2019s national toll-free number or calling,  writing, or visiting any Social Security field office.

Individuals have the choice of having their appeal conducted through  a telephone hearing or a case file review. To process appeals, SSA  established six Special Appeals Units. SSA tracks data on the total number  of appeals and the time it takes to process them, the method used to  resolve appeals, the reason for appeals, and the final disposition of  appeals. However, SSA does not currently have a performance goal to  assess the timeliness of its appeals decisions, and lacks the capability to  report this information. In follow-up with SSA officials on their comments  on a draft of this report, they told us that the agency is planning to  establish a goal of processing 75 percent of appeals in 60 days, but will  have to modify its system to report this information. SSA officials told us  that they have managed the appeals process by redirecting resources when  case-processing times for appeals exceed 60 days.", "Regarding data on SSA\u2019s appeals process, an SSA sample, conducted in  July 2006, showed that about 80 percent of individuals chose to have a  case file review. According to SSA data on appeals from August 2005 to  February 2007, it received about 79,000 appeals and completed about  76,000. The number of appeals was consistent with SSA\u2019s initial estimate  that about 3 percent of denied subsidy applications would be appealed,  based on its experience with other programs. On the basis of an SSA  sample of 781 appeals, SSA reversed its decision for 57 percent of the  cases and upheld its decision for the remaining 43 percent.", "SSA data show that the overall volume of appeals received was the highest  from November 2005 and July 2006, declined between August and  November 2006, and rose again between December 2006 and February  2007 (See table 3). During the decline, SSA closed all but one of its Special  Appeals Units by October 2006.", "The time it took SSA to process appeals varied widely, and did not  necessarily decrease when the caseloads grew smaller. For example, SSA  appeals workload data showed that it took SSA an average of 80 days to  resolve approximately 11,600 appeals in April 2006, but took about 90 days  to resolve about 1,800 appeals in July 2006. SSA data from December 2006  through February 2007 also show that the agency\u2019s processing time for  resolving appeals has not shown consistent improvement. For example, it  took SSA an average of 16 days to process 1,254 appeals in December  2006, but 42 days to process 2,463 appeals in February 2007. An SSA July  2006 sample of 781 appeals showed that 63 percent of appeals were filed  based on applicants\u2019 challenges regarding an income issue, 24 percent  were based on applicants\u2019 challenge regarding a resource issue, and   13 percent were based on other issues, such as an applicant\u2019s failure to  respond to SSA requests for additional data in a timely manner.

Future  redeterminations are required to be conducted at intervals determined by  the Commissioner. SSA\u2019s regulations provide that these periodic  redeterminations be conducted based on the likelihood that an individual\u2019s  situation may change in a way that affects subsidy eligibility. Additionally,  SSA\u2019s regulations provide that unscheduled redeterminations may take  place at any time for individuals who report a change in their  circumstances, such as marriage or divorce. However, there is no specific  requirement that recipients report such changes. SSA tracks various  results from the redeterminations process, such as the number of  decisions made, and number and level of continued subsidies, but does not  track the amount of time needed to complete redetermination decisions.", "SSA initiated its first cycle of redeterminations in August 2006, which  included all of the approximately 1.7 million individuals who were  determined to be eligible for the subsidy prior to April 30, 2006. SSA  excluded from the redeterminations process about 562,000 individuals  who were either deceased, automatically deemed eligible for the benefit  by CMS, or whose subsidy benefit had been terminated. As a result, SSA  sent approximately 1.2 million notices to inform individuals that their  continued eligibility status was being reviewed. The notice also provided  individuals with the income and resources data contained in SSA\u2019s files  and asked them to notify SSA if the information had changed. SSA  subsequently sent 242,000 forms to beneficiaries who reported changes to  their income or resources, or whom SSA had identified as having such  changes from other sources, to allow them to indicate changes to the  information or dispute it. SSA data show that as of February 2007, SSA had  completed approximately 237,000 redeterminations. About 69,000  individuals remained at the same subsidy level, another 69,000 had a  change in their subsidy level, and 98,000 individuals had their subsidies  terminated, based on a change in their circumstances.", "SSA does not track processing time for redetermination decisions and has  not established a performance time target for processing such actions.  SSA officials stated that since the redeterminations process is conducted  within a certain period of time, it is unnecessary to track the processing  time for individual redetermination decisions. However, as stated  previously, GAO internal control standards state that agencies should  establish performance measures for all activities and compare actual  performance against expected goals.

SSA hired a total of 2,200 field office staff to assist with subsidy  applications, as well as an additional 500 headquarters staff to support its  MMA activities. SSA officials stated that the agency\u2019s major activities for  implementing low-income subsidy activities for fiscal year 2004 included  preparing public information materials for the subsidy, systems  development, and developing internal training materials for staff. Officials  also stated that major subsidy work activities for fiscal year 2005 included  hiring the approximately 2,200 field office staff, processing subsidy  applications, and establishing Special Appeals Units. For fiscal year 2006,  SSA provided us with data showing that staff spent the equivalent of  approximately 2,190 work years on low-income subsidy activities, with  almost 50 percent of the time used to process subsidy applications. These  activities included processing subsidy applications and resolving appeals,  and developing business process planning and systems development for  the redeterminations process.", "SSA officials stated that the agency\u2019s new responsibilities under the  subsidy program have not adversely affected its other workloads. In fact,  SSA officials pointed out that the processing times for other workloads  improved in fiscal years 2005 and 2006. For example, SSA exceeded its  goal of paying 83 percent of initial claims for retirement and survivor  benefits at the earliest point due, or 14 days after an applicant filed a  claim\u2014the actual performance was approximately 85 and 87 percent,  respectively. Additionally, SSA exceeded its goal of paying 75 percent of  SSI claims for the elderly before their payment was due, or no more than  14 days after an applicant filed a claim\u2014the actual performance was  approximately 85 and 88 percent, respectively.", "Although SSA can track expenditures for implementing its various MMA  responsibilities overall, it cannot track expenditures related specifically to  low-income subsidy activities or other specific sublevel MMA activities.  For example, SSA cannot calculate the total amount of the $500 million  congressional appropriation it received for MMA start-up costs that was  spent on the subsidy program versus its other MMA responsibilities.  Although SSA could not provide documentation of the total amount of its  subsidy-related expenditures, it estimates that its costs related to the  subsidy program are about $175 million annually, based on workload  samples. However, SSA is planning to develop a tracking mechanism to  more accurately capture the data.", "SSA officials attribute the light impact of the subsidy program to various  factors, including the automation of the subsidy application process and  the $500 million congressional appropriation it received for administrative  start-up costs to implement its MMA responsibilities. SSA officials also  told us that they were able to manage the other workloads because the  peak increases in subsidy applications and inquiries were short-lived,  allowing SSA\u2019s operations to return to a more normal operating level after  handling these peak work volumes. SSA officials stated that they expect  small increases in its low-income subsidy workload during future  prescription drug plan open seasons, which typically have been held from  November to December.", "SSA\u2019s spending on its Medicare activities peaked in fiscal year 2005 (see  table 4) as supported by the $500 million congressional appropriation for  MMA start-up activities; more recent increases in such spending could  cause pressure on SSA\u2019s other workloads in the future. The amount of  SSA\u2019s administrative costs covered by the Medicare Trust Funds increased  by about 37 percent between fiscal year 2003 and estimated spending in  fiscal year 2008. The minimal impact of the subsidy workload and other  MMA activities through fiscal year 2006 was due, in part, to the   $500 million separately appropriated by the Congress. Now that the  additional $500 million is exhausted, SSA\u2019s MMA responsibilities must  compete with all other workloads for resources within the overall  administrative appropriation limits. If the cost of SSA\u2019s Medicare workload  increases, as it has done recently, SSA\u2019s other workloads may experience  pressure if the overall administrative appropriation does not increase  proportionately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["SSA has made progress in approving individuals for the low-income  subsidy, but has not established specific performance goals and measures  for its outreach activities. Without such goals and measures, SSA will not  have a means to assess the effectiveness of its efforts, or to identify areas  that require improvement as it moves forward. Having such goals and  measures takes on heightened importance now since SSA is conducting  outreach efforts on a more limited basis. Although no reliable data  currently exist on the population of individuals who might qualify for the  subsidy, SSA does not need such data to establish specific performance  goals and measures to assess its outreach efforts. For example, SSA could  set specific goals and measures to assess the effectiveness if its outreach  efforts for subpopulations where there is an underrepresentation of  subsidy applications. Monitoring the progress of such efforts could help  SSA to identify areas where increased outreach efforts are needed.", "Assessing the performance of outreach efforts can also help SSA to make  more efficient use of staff resources by directing them to areas where  increased outreach efforts are needed to encourage applications among  underrepresented segments of the eligible population. While advocacy  groups have called for a more personalized outreach approach, such as  door-to-door contact, to encourage additional enrollments among  Medicare beneficiaries, it may be difficult for SSA to conduct such efforts,  given its resource limitations. Also, it is unclear how much more outreach  is needed, given the lack of reliable data on the eligible population. The  extent of additional outreach efforts will also depend on SSA\u2019s ability to  more precisely identify remaining individuals eligible for the subsidy.  However, it is not clear to what extent additional taxpayer data from IRS  could help SSA to better target individuals potentially eligible for the  subsidy. Until an effort is undertaken to better determine the size of the  population that is eligible for the subsidy, it will be difficult for SSA and  others to assess its progress in approving individuals for the subsidy.", "Finally, while SSA has considerable data on its subsidy application  processes, it lacks systematic performance indicators to compare results  to expected goals. Without processing time data for redetermination  decisions, and performance measures for all subsidy application  processes, SSA will not have the information that it needs to assess the  quality of the services it provides or to identify areas of improvement.

SSA stated that it monitors the time for completing the overall  redetermination cycle, which provides adequate management controls for  operational data. On the basis of GAO\u2019s internal control standards, we  believe that SSA should measure the time for processing individual  redetermination decisions because it could provide the agency with  information on the efficiency of processing such decisions. While SSA  stated that it had established a performance standard for assessing the  timeliness of appeals, in a follow-up discussion with agency officials after  receiving their comments, they told us that the goal did not currently exist,  but that the agency is planning to establish a goal of processing   75 percents of appeals in 60 days.

SSA stated that it has begun  discussions with IRS to evaluate how such a study might be designed. IRS  also agreed with this recommendation and stated that it is willing to work  with SSA in conducting such a study. IRS emphasized, however, that  current law prohibits the agency from sharing tax information, other than  in statistical form, before an individual applies for the subsidy. IRS also  discussed various limitations that could affect the usefulness of its tax  data.

We also reviewed various  policies and regulations SSA established to carry out its new  responsibilities, as well as guidance provided to field office staff to assist  them in answering questions about the subsidy and taking subsidy  applications. We obtained information on SSA\u2019s implementation activities  from SSA officials in the agency\u2019s headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland,  and in two regional offices, and from management and staff in eight SSA  field office locations in Texas, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. We  selected SSA offices in those states because of the large number of subsidy  applications that had been mailed to individuals who were potentially  eligible for the subsidy. In addition, we selected SSA offices in  Pennsylvania and Texas in particular because they had counties  (Philadelphia County in Pennsylvania and Dallas and Fort Worth Counties  in Texas) that had the most low-income subsidy applicants as of June  2006.

We selected  state Medicaid offices in Colorado, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Utah  because they had established processes to make low-income subsidy  determinations. We also selected the Colorado and Kansas state Medicaid  agencies because we wanted to gain the perspectives of state officials that  had made low-income subsidy determinations. We visited the Texas state  Medicaid agency to gain the perspective of a state that had not yet set up  such a process, but had plans to do so in the future. We also interviewed  state Health Insurance program officials in Pennsylvania and Texas, and  officials from six advocacy groups, including the Access to Benefits  Coalition, the Health Assistance Partnership of Families USA, and the  Henry J.

In particular, we discussed in detail how SSA developed  the approximately 18.6 million population of individuals to whom it  targeted its original mass mailing of subsidy material, as well as how it  more narrowly targeted groups within that population. We reviewed SSA\u2019s  target population by looking at the number of total Medicare recipients  and estimates of the total eligible population developed by the  Congressional Budget Office, CMS, and others. We also met with Internal  Revenue Service (IRS) officials to discuss the data restriction, and  concerns officials would have if the law were changed to grant SSA access  to IRS data for better targeting outreach efforts. To understand SSA\u2019s  efforts to solicit subsidy applications, we discussed with SSA officials the  process used to develop subsidy outreach materials and cognitive tests  that had been conducted to ensure that the materials were written at an  appropriate educational level for the target population.
