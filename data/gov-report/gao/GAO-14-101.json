As required by federal regulations, all 20 selected facilities had OEPs and had designated officials, who are responsible for maintaining OEPs and initiating action according to the OEP in the event of an emergency, including the evacuation of facility occupants. Consistent with federal guidance, officials at 19 of the 20 selected facilities reported that they review and update OEPs at least annually, and officials at 1 facility said they were in the process of updating their OEP. When requested, FPS provides OEP guidance, such as templates to facility officials. Officials at 14 facilities reported using FPS guidance or feedback for their OEPs, officials at 1 facility reported not using FPS guidance, and officials at 5 facilities said they used their own agency's guidance. FPS also checks OEPs during periodic facility security assessments--conducted at least every 3 to 5 years-- to assess overall facility risk. GSA officials said they have a role in coordinating directly with facilities to provide guidance and feedback on OEPs, and to help facility officials plan drills and exercises. To assist agency officials as they develop OEPs that best fit individual facilities and agency needs, the Interagency Security Committee (ISC), a Department of Homeland Security-chaired policy development organization, in April 2010 identified 10 minimum elements, such as exercises or evacuating occupants with special needs, that should be addressed in an OEP. Thirteen of the 20 selected facilities addressed all 10 minimum elements in OEPs or related documents. Seven facilities' OEPs did not address at least 1 of the 10 elements; however, lack of an element does not necessarily indicate potential vulnerabilities for that facility because the intent of the element may be addressed by other procedures or modified based on facility characteristics. For example, evacuation exercises were not included in OEPs for 2 facilities located in leased GSA space; however, officials said they participate in drills conducted by building management. The 20 selected facility OEPs were unique to each facility and how OEPs addressed particular elements.", "Officials at 14 of 20 facilities identified evacuation challenges. The most frequently cited challenges included employee apathy toward participating in drills, accounting for employees, and keeping contact information updated. Officials at all but one facility, which was updating its OEP, reported various ways they addressed evacuation challenges, including using technology such as entry scan systems and radios to track and communicate with employees and making evacuation training more interesting to employees. Other incidents and emerging threats also prompted officials to change OEPs or evacuation training. For example, during the 2011 Washington, D.C., earthquake, officials at selected facilities in the D.C. area said that the lack of employee training on earthquake procedures may have exposed employees to potential hazards when they self-evacuated. Officials reported revising their OEPs to include procedures for earthquakes. Recent shootings also prompted facility officials to revise their OEPs and participate in FPS awareness training on active shooter incidents. Officials at 6 facilities did not report challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Recent natural disasters, such as earthquakes in the nation\u2019s capital, and  fatal attacks, such as the shooting at the Long Beach, California, federal  building in February 2012, have raised concerns about emergency  preparedness in approximately 9,600 facilities owned or leased by the  General Services Administration (GSA) and protected by the Department  of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Protective Service (FPS).

As previously mentioned, ISC listed 10 minimum elements in  its ISC 2010 standard that an OEP should address. In March 2013, ISC  issued Occupant Emergency Programs: An Interagency Security  Committee Guide, to further assist department and agency officials as  they develop and review their occupant emergency programs, including  how to develop OEPs that best fit their individual facility and agency  needs. According to ISC officials, the guidance was disseminated via e- mail to the full ISC membership, which includes 53 federal agencies and  departments. ISC officials said they rely on agencies located in federal  facilities to ensure OEPs are in place and shared several reasons why it  would not be feasible for ISC to comprehensively review OEPs. First,  according to these officials, ISC decided to use broad guidelines that  would allow agencies to develop plans that are suited to the unique  characteristics of their facilities. As a result, the guidance does not  provide specific standards or metrics against which to compare a facility\u2019s  plan. Second, although OEPs are an important part of an overall  occupant emergency program, ISC officials said that OEPs are a  relatively small part of an agency\u2019s overall emergency and security  planning, which may not warrant implementing additional monitoring and  data-gathering efforts. Last, ISC officials cited staffing constraints and  noted that, per Executive Order 12977, they rely on volunteers from  member organizations to carry out the committee\u2019s efforts.", "GSA also plays a role in coordinating directly with facilities to provide  guidance on OEPs and participates in emergency planning efforts.

However, GSA officials said that they will assist agencies  with OEPs as requested. GSA officials also told us that they participate  on facility security committees and in planning drills and exercises, and  can provide GSA and other OEP guidance to their tenants. GSA officials  also said that they work with tenants, as well as building owners at leased  facilities, to ensure that facilities comply with building safety codes, such  as having appropriate exits and fire alarms. Presidential Policy Directive 21 jointly assigns FPS and GSA responsibility for critical infrastructure  protection of the government facilities sector. According to a GSA  Associate Administrator, there is a need for greater visibility of OEPs.  Consequently, GSA and FPS officials told us they have initiated  discussions on future collaboration to ensure OEPs are in place and  updated at GSA facilities.

According to FPS  officials, its OEP template (a Microsoft Word file) can be requested from  the DHS and GSA websites and can also be made available to agency  officials on a DVD. Of the 20 facilities we visited, officials at 14 reported  using FPS guidance or feedback on their OEPs, for example, using the  FPS template as a base for their OEPs and officials at 5 facilities reported  using their own agency guidance for OEP development. FPS officials in  one city we visited reiterated that some agencies have their own  emergency coordinators and choose not to use FPS materials.

For  example, one FPS inspector recommended that 1 facility change its  assembly point because he determined that it was too close to the  evacuated facility. Although officials at this facility expressed some  reluctance in changing the assembly location, the inspector told us that  facilities generally implement FPS suggestions. FPS inspectors also said  that there have been few examples where agencies did not want to  comply. Although agencies do not have to comply with their  recommendations on OEPs, FPS inspectors stated that they do have  enforcement authority related to life safety issues during an actual  emergency event, such as moving occupants to different evacuation  locations.

Officials at 2 facilities mentioned using or planning to  use technology to account for employees in an emergency situation.  One facility is developing an emergency notification system that sends  emergency information to as many as 10 different electronic devices  to contact an individual and determine the individual\u2019s location.  Another facility is planning to use an entry scan system that records  who is in the building and can provide a list to take roll at the  evacuation rally point to account for employees.

Officials at 7 of  the 20 facilities said that it was an ongoing challenge to keep  emergency contacts in the OEP current because of changes in an  employee\u2019s contact information or status such as a transfer or  retirement. To address this challenge, officials at 6 facilities said they  review and update contact information at various points, such as  when staff leave; before drills; or on a daily, weekly, monthly, or  quarterly basis at different facilities. At one facility, officials said that  they rely on tenants to provide notice of personnel changes. At  another, an official said that the facility\u2019s technology department was  able to align its employee finder database with the agency\u2019s  separation database to automatically flag when employees have a  change in location or status. Information was not available for 1 facility  on any efforts to mitigate this challenge.", "Officials at facilities we visited reported experiencing and addressing  other challenges less frequently such as keeping employees trained,  evacuating the public and persons with physical handicaps,  communicating about an evacuation, and coordinating with other building  tenants. Officials who reported encountering these challenges told us that  they had mechanisms in place to mitigate the challenges they  encountered, such as the use of hand-held radios for communications, so  the challenges were not considered an issue that prevented them from  carrying out effective emergency evacuations.", "Other incidents or situations have also prompted facilities to revise their  OEPs or for FPS to evaluate emerging threats and revise its training, as  discussed in the examples below.", "Practice drills.

DHS noted that  GAO recognized the complex roles performed by the ISC, GSA, FPS, and  agency officials to ensure that the approximately 9,600 GSA-owned and  -leased facilities have an OEP. For instance, DHS cited that ISC  establishes standards and guidance for developing OEPs that are  responsive to individual facility needs, whereas FPS is responsible for  coordinating with and assisting department and agency officials in  developing facility OEPs, and providing agencies with evacuation training,  among other things. DHS also stated that it is committed to working  collaboratively with ISC and GSA to identify and mitigate security-related  vulnerabilities at federal facilities.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Department of Homeland  Security, the Administrator of the General Services Administration,  selected congressional committees, and other interested parties.

This included  relevant sections of the Homeland Security Act of 2002; the regulations  regarding federal property facility management and federal agency  requirements for OEPs; Executive Order 12977, establishing the  Interagency Security Committee (ISC); and Executive Order 13286,  amending it. We reviewed OEP guidance issued by ISC, the Federal  Protective Service (FPS), and the General Services Administration  (GSA). We also reviewed our previous work on the roles of FPS, GSA,  and ISC in protecting federal facilities. We interviewed relevant senior  agency officials regarding their agencies\u2019 role in ensuring federal facilities  have OEPs in place, including ISC officials in Washington, D.C.; officials  from FPS and GSA in their headquarters; and FPS and GSA officials in  the three field locations where we conducted site visits to selected federal  facilities, as described below.", "To describe the extent to which the selected facilities\u2019 OEPs reflect  federal guidance, we conducted site visits at 20 of the GSA facilities  protected by FPS.follows:   We selected a nonprobability sample of facilities as", "We selected three geographically diverse areas with a concentration  of GSA facilities from GSA\u2019s top 15 major real estate markets.  Specifically, we selected two areas from the top 5 markets in terms of  GSA assets (Los Angeles, California, and Washington, D.C.), and one  area from a smaller GSA market defined as having fewer than 100  facilities (Kansas City, Missouri).", "To ensure a subset of facilities would be able to discuss evacuation  experiences they have had, we selected 9 facilities total from the  three areas that had reported an evacuation incident to an FPS  MegaCenter during 2011 or 2012. Each of the four FPS MegaCenters  records incidents such as fire alarms, suspicious packages, and  evacuation drills that are reported to that center as part of the center\u2019s  operations log, with an activity code that can be queried for incidents.  Only incidents reported to a MegaCenter are captured, so, for  example, if local police respond to a call at a facility and do not call  FPS, the incident would not be included in the MegaCenter data.  According to discussions with MegaCenter data officials and a review  of the data content, we determined that the incident data were reliable  for our purposes, as our sample was not intended to be representative  of all incidents.", "We used a list provided by GSA from its Real Estate Across the  United States (REXUS) database to select the remaining 11 facilities  to provide a mix of owned and leased properties, and a mix of facility  security levels. We determined that the REXUS database was reliable  for our purposes based on a review of database documents and  discussion with relevant GSA officials. See table 2 for a summary of  characteristics of the 20 facilities we selected.", "For all selected facilities, we reviewed the extent to which the OEPs  included the 10 minimum elements that should be included based on  ISC\u2019s Physical Security Standard (ISC 2010 standard) for federal  facilities. For example, 1 element that an OEP should include is  information on \u201cSpecial Needs Individuals (disabled, deaf, etc.).\u201d For each  facility in our sample, two team members reviewed the OEP and  assessed whether or not each of the elements was addressed. The ISC  2010 standard indicates that the 10 elements should be present;  however, it notes that the scope and complexity of the OEP are  dependent on the facility\u2019s size, population, and mission, and the  standard does not provide a description of, or detail on, what should be  included for each element. Further, not all elements may be applicable for  a facility, for example, if the facility does not have a child care or other  special facility. Because of the general nature of the elements, we  assessed whether a particular element was present in a facility\u2019s OEP,  not its quality or comprehensiveness. We reviewed additional documents  provided by agency officials, such as child care center emergency plans,  emergency cards for quick use, and FPS\u2019s facility security assessment  protocol, used by FPS inspectors when periodically checking OEPs. We  also interviewed GSA property managers and officials from agencies who  occupy each facility about the facility\u2019s plan. Further, those officials were  those identified by GSA and the tenant agency as most knowledgeable  about the OEP, which in some cases was the designated official, and in  other cases, the facility official was, for example, a manager involved with  facility security. While the findings from our 20 case studies are not  generalizable to all GSA-owned and -leased facilities, they provide  specific examples of how selected facilities have addressed emergency  plan requirements and provide insights from a range of federal facilities.", "To describe the challenges and evacuation experiences of the 20  selected facilities, we discussed specific evacuation instances with facility  and GSA officials, the challenges officials face in planning and executing  evacuation plans, and any steps taken to mitigate the challenges. We  asked about evacuation challenges in general, and about specific  challenges that were identified by a review of the literature and from  discussion with FPS. We also asked officials at the facilities we visited  about challenges, and they determined whether they perceived an issue  to be a challenge or not. Where available, we reviewed after-action  reports documenting facility evacuation experiences. We also discussed  evacuation experiences and challenges with ISC, GSA, and FPS officials.  Our findings regarding what issues presented challenges and how such  challenges could be resolved cannot be generalized to all GSA-owned  and -leased facilities; however, they provide specific examples of issues  encountered and how varying facilities addressed them.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2012 to October 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
