GAO identified ten key practices to be included in an SLA, such as identifying the roles and responsibilities of major stakeholders, defining performance objectives, and specifying security metrics. The key practices, if properly implemented, can help agencies ensure services are performed effectively, efficiently, and securely. Under the direction of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), guidance issued to agencies in February 2012 included seven of the ten key practices described in this report that could help agencies ensure the effectiveness of their cloud services contracts.", "GAO determined that the five agencies and the 21 cloud service contracts it reviewed had included a majority of the ten key practices.

For example, the strategy stated that NIST\u2019s role is to lead and  collaborate with federal, state, and local government agency chief  information officers, private sector experts, and international bodies to  identify standards and guidance and prioritize the adoption of cloud  computing services. In addition, the strategy stated that agency cloud  service contracts should include SLAs designed to meet agency  requirements.", "In a December 2011 memo, OMB established the Federal Risk and  Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), a government-wide  program intended to provide a standardized approach to security  assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud  computing products and services. All federal agencies must meet  FedRAMP requirements when using cloud services and the cloud service  providers must implement the FedRAMP security requirements in their  cloud environment. To become authorized, cloud service providers  provide a security assessment package to be reviewed by the FedRAMP  Joint Authorization Board, which may grant a provisional authorization.  Federal agencies can leverage cloud service provider authorization  packages for review when granting an agency authority to operate, where  this reuse is intended to save time and money.", "Further, at the direction of OMB, the Chief Information Officers Council  and the Chief Acquisition Officers Council issued, in February 2012,  guidance to help agencies acquire cloud services.

These measures would include, among other things, the availability of the  cloud service; the number of users that can access the cloud at any given  time; and the response time for processing a customer transaction.  Providing performance parameters provides both the agency and service  provider with a well-defined set of instructions to be followed. (2) Specify  how and when the agency would have access to its data, including how  data and networks will be managed and maintained throughout the life  cycle of the service. Provide any data limitations, such as who may or  may not have access to the data and if there are any geographic  limitations. (3) Specify management requirements, for example, how the  cloud service provider would monitor the performance of the cloud, report  incidents, and how and when they would plan to resolve them. In addition,  identify how and when the agency would conduct an audit to monitor the  performance of the service provider, including access to the provider\u2019s  performance logs and reports. (4) Provide for disaster recovery and  continuity of operations planning and testing. This includes, among other  things, performing a risk management assessment; how the cloud service  would be managed by the provider in the case of a disaster; how data  would be recovered; and what remedies would apply during a service  failure. (5) Describe applicable exception criteria for when the cloud  provider\u2019s service performance measures do not apply, such as during  scheduled cloud maintenance or when updates occur. Without any type  of performance measures in place, agencies would not be able to  determine whether the cloud services under contract are meeting  expectations.", "Security: (1) Specify the security performance requirements that the  service provider is to meet. This would include describing security  performance metrics for protecting data, such as data reliability, data  preservation, and data privacy. Cleary define the access rights of the  cloud service provider and the agency as well as their respective  responsibilities for securing the data, applications, and processes to meet  all federal requirements. (2) Describe what would constitute a breach of  security and how and when the service provider is to notify the agency  when the requirements are not being met.

Nonetheless, while having contractors perform  practices is an acceptable approach, Treasury officials were unable to  provide supporting documentation to show that support contractors  were assisting with the practices in question.", "Officials from VA\u2019s Office of Information and Technology said the  reason the key practice associated with penalties and remedies was  not included in the Terremark SLA was because penalties were  addressed within other parts of the contract; however, officials were  not able to provide documentation identifying such penalties. With  regard to an SLA for eKidney, officials told us they had not addressed  any of the key practices due to the fact that an SLA was not  developed between the agency and cloud service provider.

We then performed a comparative analysis of the practices to identify the  practices that were recommended by at least two sources. Specifically,  we analyzed information from publications and related documentation  issued by the following ten public and private organizations to determine  key SLA practices:", "Federal Chief Information Officer Council", "Chief Acquisitions Officers Council", "National Institute of Standards and Technology", "European Commission Directorate General for Communications  Networks, Content and Technology", "Office of Management and Budget", "Gartner", "MITRE Corporation", "Cloud Standards Customer Council", "International Organization for Standardization  International Electrotechnical Commission  Next, we organized these practices into management areas and validated  our analysis through interviews with experts from these organizations. We  also had officials from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  review and validate that these practices are the ones the office expects  federal agencies to follow. In cases where experts disagreed, we  analyzed their responses, including the reasons they disagreed, and  made changes as appropriate. These actions resulted in our list of key  practices for cloud service SLAs.", "To determine the extent to which federal agencies have incorporated key  practices into their cloud computing contracts, we selected five agencies  to review based, in part, on those with the largest fiscal year 2015 IT  budgets and planned spending on cloud computing services. The  agencies selected were the Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland  Security (DHS), Health and Human Services (HHS), Treasury, and  Veterans Affairs (VA).", "We selected these agencies based on the following two factors. First,  they have the largest planned IT budgets for fiscal year 2015. Their  budgets, which collectively totaled $57 billion, represent about 72 percent  of the total federal IT budget ($78 billion). Second, these agencies plan to  spend relatively large amounts on cloud computing. Specifically, based  on our analysis of OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2015 budget data, each of the five  departments were in the top 10 for the largest amount budgeted for cloud  computing and collectively planned to spend $1.2 billion on cloud  computing, which represents about 57 percent of the total amount that  federal agencies plan to invest in cloud computing ($2.1 billion).", "To select and review the cloud services used by the agencies, we  obtained an inventory of cloud services for each of the five agencies, and  then, for each agency, we listed their cloud services in a random fashion  and selected the first two cloud services in the list for each of the three  major cloud service models (infrastructure, platform, and software). In  certain cases, the agency did not have two cloud services for a service  model, so the number chosen for that service model was less than two.  This resulted in a non-generalizable sample of 23 cloud services.  However, near the end of our engagement, agencies identified 2 of the  services as being in a pilot stage (one from DHS, and one from HHS),  and thus not operational. We excluded these services from our analysis,  as our methodology to only assess operational cloud services. Due to the  stage of the engagement, we were unable to select additional services for  review. Further, because no computer-generated data was used we  determined that there were no data reliability issues.", "For each of the selected services, we compared its cloud service contract  (if one existed) and any associated SLA documentation to our list of key  practices to determine if there were variances and, if so, their cause and  impact. To do so, two team analysts independently reviewed the cloud  service contracts against the key practices using the following criteria:", "Met: all aspects of the key practices were fully addressed.", "Partially met: some key practices were addressed.", "Did not meet: no key practices were addressed.", "In cases where analysts differed on the assessments, we discussed what  the rating should be until we reached a consensus. We also interviewed  agency officials to corroborate our analysis and identify the causes and  impacts of any variances.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 to April 2016 in  accordance to generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Analysis of Agencies\u2019 Cloud Service SLAs against Key Practices", "paragraphs": ["The following tables show each of the five agencies\u2019\u2014DOD, DHS, HHS,  Treasury, and VA\u2014cloud services we assessed and our analysis of each  contract for cloud services against the key practices.
