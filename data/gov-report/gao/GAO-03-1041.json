GAO's review of 1,071 servicemembers' medical records from a universe of 8,742 at selected Army and Air Force installations participating in overseas operations disclosed that 38 to 98 percent of servicemembers were missing one or both of their health assessments and 14 to 46 percent were missing at least one of the required immunizations. DOD also did not maintain a complete, centralized database of servicemembers' medical assessments and immunizations. Health-related documentation missing from the centralized database ranged from 0 to 63 percent for pre-deployment assessments, 11 to 75 percent for post-deployment assessments, and 8 to 93 percent for immunizations. There is no effective quality assurance program at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs or at the Army or Air Force that helps ensure compliance with policies. GAO believes that the lack of such a program was a major cause of the high rate of noncompliance. Continued noncompliance with these policies may result in servicemembers deploying with health problems or delays in obtaining care when they return. Finally, DOD's centralized deployment database is still missing the information needed to track servicemembers' movements in the theater of operations. By July 2003, the department's data center had begun receiving location-specific deployment information from the services and is currently reviewing its accuracy and completeness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, many servicemembers  experienced health problems that they attributed to their military  service in the Persian Gulf. However, subsequent investigations into  the nature and causes of these illnesses were hampered by a lack of  servicemember health and deployment data. Moreover, in May 1997, we  reported on several similar problems associated with the implementation  of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) deployment health surveillance  policies for servicemembers deployed to Bosnia in support of a  peacekeeping operation.", "In response, the Congress enacted legislation in November 1997 requiring  DOD to establish a system for assessing the medical condition of  servicemembers before and after their deployment to locations outside  the United States and requiring the centralized retention of certain  health-related data associated with the servicemember\u2019s deployment. The  system is to include the use of pre-deployment medical examinations and  post-deployment medical examinations, including an assessment of mental  health and the drawing of blood samples. DOD has implemented specific  force health protection and surveillance policies. These policies include  pre- and post-deployment health assessments designed to identify health  issues or concerns that may affect the deployability of servicemembers or  that may require medical attention; pre-deployment immunizations to  address possible health threats in deployment locations; pre-deployment  screening for tuberculosis; and the retention of blood serum samples on  file prior to deployment.", "Given the many deployments of servicemembers to overseas locations  since 1997, you asked us to examine the military services\u2019 implementation  of DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policies and its progress  in correcting the types of problems we found in 1997. More specifically,  we focused our work on Army and Air Force active duty deployments for  Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) in Central Asia and Operation Joint  Guardian (OJG) in Kosovo to address the following two questions:  1.  Are the military services meeting DOD\u2019s force health protection and  surveillance system requirements for servicemembers deploying in  support of OEF and OJG?  2.  Has DOD corrected problems related to the accuracy and  completeness of databases reflecting which servicemembers deployed  to certain locations?", "To accomplish these objectives, we obtained the force health protection  and surveillance policies applicable to the OEF and OJG deployments  from the Army, Air Force, combatant commanders, the office of the  Assistant Secretary of Defense, and the services\u2019 Surgeons General. To test  the implementation of these policies, we reviewed statistical samples  totaling 1,071 active duty servicemembers selected from a universe of  8,742 active duty servicemembers at four military installations. To provide  assurances that our review of the selected medical records was accurate,  we requested the installations\u2019 medical personnel to reexamine those  medical records that were missing required health assessments or  immunizations and adjusted our results where documentation was  subsequently identified. We also requested installation medical personnel  to check all possible sources for missing pre- and post-deployment health  assessments and missing immunizations. We also requested the  U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM) to query its database for  health-related documentation for servicemembers in our sample at one  of the selected installations. We also examined, for Army and Air Force  servicemembers in our samples, the completeness of the centralized  records at the Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA), which is  tasked with centrally collecting deployment health-related records.  Further, we interviewed officials at the office of the Deployment Health  Support Directorate and at the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC)  regarding the accuracy and completeness of DMDC\u2019s personnel  deployment database and planned improvements. For more detailed  information of our scope and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In May 1997, we reported on DOD\u2019s actions to improve deployment  health surveillance before, during, and after deployments, focusing on  Operation Joint Endeavor, which was conducted in the countries of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Hungary. We commented on the  provisions of a joint medical surveillance policy draft that called for a  comprehensive DOD-wide medical surveillance capability to monitor  and assess the effects of deployments on servicemembers\u2019 health. DOD  subsequently finalized its joint medical surveillance policy in August 1997.  Our 1997 review disclosed problems with the Army\u2019s implementation of  the medical surveillance plan for Operation Joint Endeavor in the  following areas:    Medical assessments. Many Army personnel who should have received  post-deployment medical assessments did not receive them and the  assessments that were completed were frequently done late. Of the  618 servicemembers in the 12 Army units whose medical records we  reviewed, 24 percent did not receive in-theater post-deployment medical  assessments, and 21 percent did not receive home station post-deployment  medical assessments. Servicemembers who received home station  post-deployment medical assessments received them, on average, nearly  100 days after they left theater instead of within 30 days as required by the  plan. Further, pre-deployment blood serum samples were not available for  9.3 percent of the 26,621 servicemembers who had deployed to Bosnia as  of March 12, 1996. The most recent blood samples for 6.4 percent of the  pre-deployment blood samples were more than 5 years old.", "Medical record keeping. Many of the servicemembers\u2019 medical records  that we reviewed were incomplete and missing documentation of  in-theater post-deployment medical assessments, medical visits during  deployment, and receipt of an investigational new vaccine. More  specifically, we found that 91 of the 473 servicemembers (19 percent)  with a post-deployment in-theater medical assessment and 9 of the  491 servicemembers (1.8 percent) with a post-deployment home unit  medical assessment did not have the assessments documented in their  medical records. Furthermore, about 29 percent of the 50 battalion aid  station visits we reviewed were not documented in the members\u2019  permanent medical records. Finally, 141 of 588 servicemembers  (24 percent) who received an investigational drug vaccine did not have the  immunization documented in their medical records.", "Centralized database. The centralized database for collecting in-theater  and home unit post-deployment medical assessments was incomplete for  many Army personnel. More specifically, the database omitted 12 percent  of the in-theater medical assessments done and 52 percent of the home  unit medical assessments done for the 618 servicemembers whose records  we reviewed.", "Deployment information. DOD officials considered the database used  for tracking the deployment of Air Force and Navy personnel inaccurate. \u201c(a) SYSTEM REQUIRED\u2014The Secretary of Defense shall establish a system to assess the  medical condition of members of the armed forces (including members of the reserve  components) who are deployed outside the United States or its territories or possessions  as part of a contingency operation (including a humanitarian operation, peacekeeping  operation, or similar operation) or combat operation.  \u201c(b) ELEMENTS OF SYSTEM\u2014The system described in subsection (a) shall include the  use of predeployment medical examinations and postdeployment medical examinations  (including an assessment of mental health and the drawing of blood samples) to accurately  record the medical condition of members before their deployment and any changes in their  medical condition during the course of their deployment. The postdeployment examination  shall be conducted when the member is redeployed or otherwise leaves an area in which  the system is in operation (or as soon as possible thereafter).  \u201c(c) RECORDKEEPING\u2014The results of all medical examinations conducted under the  system, records of all health care services (including immunizations) received by members  described in subsection (a) in anticipation of their deployment or during the course of their  deployment, and records of events occurring in the deployment area that may affect the  health of such members shall be retained and maintained in a centralized location to  improve future access to the records.  \u201c(d) QUALITY ASSURANCE\u2014The Secretary of Defense shall establish a quality assurance  program to evaluate the success of the system in ensuring that members described in  subsection (a) receive predeployment medical examinations and postdeployment medical  examinations and that the recordkeeping requirements with respect to the system  are met.\u201d", "As set forth above, these provisions require the use of pre-deployment and  post-deployment medical examinations to accurately record the medical  condition of servicemembers before deployment and any changes during  their deployment. In a June 30, 2003, correspondence with the General  Accounting Office, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs  stated that \u201cit would be logistically impossible to conduct a complete  physical examination on all personnel immediately prior to deployment  and still deploy them in a timely manner.\u201d Therefore, DOD required both  pre- and post-deployment health assessments for servicemembers who  deploy for 30 or more continuous days to a land-based location outside the  United States without a permanent U.S. military treatment facility. Both  assessments use a questionnaire designed to help military healthcare  providers in identifying health problems and providing needed medical  care. The pre-deployment health assessment is generally administered at  the home station before deployment, and the post-deployment health  assessment is completed either in theater before redeployment to the  servicemember\u2019s home unit or shortly upon redeployment.", "As a component of medical examinations, the statute quoted above also  requires that blood samples be drawn before and after a servicemember\u2019s  deployment. DOD Instruction 6490.3, August 7, 1997, requires that a  pre-deployment blood sample be obtained within 12 months of the  servicemember\u2019s deployment. However, it requires the blood samples be  drawn upon return from deployment only when directed by the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. According to DOD, the  implementation of this requirement was based on its judgment that the  Human Immunodeficiency Virus serum sampling taken independent of  deployment actions is sufficient to meet both pre- and post-deployment  health needs, except that more timely post-deployment sampling may be  directed when based on a recognized health threat or exposure. Prior to  April 2003, DOD did not require a post-deployment blood sample for  servicemembers supporting the OEF and OJG deployments.", "In April 2003, DOD revised its health surveillance policy for blood samples  and post-deployment health assessments. Effective May 22, 2003, the  services are required to draw a blood sample from each redeploying  servicemember no later than 30 days after arrival at a demobilization site  or home station. According to DOD, this requirement for post-deployment  blood samples was established in response to an assessment of health  threats and national interests associated with current deployments. The  department also revised its policy guidance for enhanced post-deployment  health assessments to gather more information from deployed  servicemembers about events that occurred during a deployment.  More specifically, the revised policy requires that a trained health care  provider conduct a face-to-face health assessment with each returning  servicemember to ascertain (1) the individual\u2019s responses to the health  assessment questions on the post-deployment health assessment form;  (2) the presence of any mental health or psychosocial issues commonly  associated with deployments; (3) any special medications taken during the  deployment; and (4) concerns about possible environmental or  occupational exposures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army and Air Force Did Not Comply with Deployment Health Surveillance Policies for Many Servicemembers", "paragraphs": ["The Army and Air Force did not comply with DOD\u2019s force health  protection and surveillance requirements for many of the servicemembers  in our samples at the selected installations we visited.

The results of our statistical samples for  the deployments at the installations visited are depicted in figure 1.", "For those servicemembers in our samples who had completed pre- or  post-deployment health assessments, we found that as many as 45 percent  of the assessments in our samples were not completed on time in  accordance with requirements (see fig. 2). DOD policy requires that  servicemembers complete a pre-deployment health assessment form  within 30 days of their deployment and a post-deployment health  assessment form within 5 days upon redeployment back to their home  station. These time frames were established to allow time to identify  and resolve any health concerns or problems that may affect the ability of  the servicemember to deploy, and to promptly identify and address any  health concerns or problems that may have arisen during the  servicemember\u2019s deployment.", "Not all health assessments were reviewed by a health care provider  as required, as shown in figure 3. DOD policy requires that pre-deployment  and post-deployment health assessments are to be reviewed immediately  by a health care provider to identify any medical care needed by the  servicemember.", "The services did not refer some servicemember health assessments  that indicated a need for further consultation. According to DOD  policy, a medical provider, namely a physician, physician\u2019s assistant,  nurse, or independent duty medical technician is required to further  review a servicemember\u2019s need for specialty care when the member\u2019s  pre-deployment and/or post-deployment health assessment indicates  health concerns such as unresolved medical or dental problems or plans  to seek mental health counseling or care. This follow-up may take the  form of an interview or examination of the servicemember, and forms the  basis of a decision as to whether a referral for further specialty care is  warranted. In our samples, the number of assessments that indicated a  health concern was relatively small, but large percentages of these  assessments were not referred for further specialty care. For example,  our sample at Travis Air Force Base included five pre-deployment health  assessments that indicated a health concern, but four (80 percent) of  the health assessments were not referred for further specialty care.", "Noncompliance with the requirement for pre-deployment health  assessments may result in servicemembers with existing health problems  or concerns being deployed with unaddressed health problems.

Representatives of the two battalion aid  stations said that the missing paper forms documenting the  servicemember visits may have been lost en route to Fort Drum.  Specifically, a physician\u2019s assistant for one of these battalion aid station  said the battalion aid station moved three times in theater and each  time the paper forms used to document in-theater visits were boxed and  moved with the battalion aid station.

The Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness expressed concern about the services\u2019  failure to report complete personnel deployment data to DMDC in  an October 2002 memorandum.", "To address the services\u2019 lack of reporting to DMDC, the Under Secretary  of Defense for Personnel and Readiness established a tri-service  working group that outlined a plan of action in March 2003 to address  the reporting issues. In July 2003, a DMDC official told us that significant  improvements had recently occurred and that all of the services had begun  submitting their classified deployment databases\u2014including deployment  locations\u2014to DMDC. DMDC is currently reviewing the deployment  information submitted by the services to determine its accuracy and  completeness. It plans to complete this review during the summer of 2003.", "With regard to DMDC\u2019s efforts to create a system for tracking the  movements of servicemembers within a given theater of operations,  DMDC officials told us that little progress has been made. They said that  the primary reason for a lack of progress in developing this system is that  the source information has generally not been available from the services  and this may require the development of new tracking systems at the  unit level. In June 2003, a DMDC official told us that it had been recently  determined that the Air Force has implemented a theater tracking  system that may have applicability to the other services. The tracking  system\u2014known as the Deliberate Crisis and Action Planning and  Execution Segment (DCAPES)\u2014enables field teams to enter classified  information about the whereabouts of deployed Air Force personnel at the  longitude/latitude level of detail. DMDC began receiving information from  this system in April 2003. The Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness is reviewing this system to determine whether it could be  used for the same purposes by the other services.", "Also, DOD is developing the Defense Integrated Military Human Resource  System (DIMHRS), which will have the capability to track the movements  of all servicemembers and civilians in the theater of operations. As of  June 2003, DOD plans to implement this system for the Army by about  September 2005 and for the other services by 2007 or early calendar  year 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["While DOD and the military services have established force health  protection and surveillance policies, at the units we visited we found  many instances of noncompliance by the services. Moreover, because  DOD and the services do not have an effective quality assurance program  in place to help ensure compliance, these problems went undetected and  uncorrected. Continued noncompliance with these policies may result  in servicemembers with existing health problems or concerns being  deployed with unaddressed health problems or without the immunization  protection they need to counter theater disease threats. Failure to  complete post-deployment health assessments may risk a delay in  obtaining appropriate medical follow-up attention for a health problem  or concern that may have arisen during or following the deployment.  Similarly, incomplete and inaccurate medical records and deployment  databases would likely hinder DOD\u2019s ability to investigate the causes of  any future health problems that may arise coincident with deployments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve compliance with DOD\u2019s force health protection and  surveillance policies, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs to establish an  effective quality assurance program, as required by section 765 of Public  Law 105-85 (10 U.S.C. 1074f), that will ensure that the military services  comply with the force health protection and surveillance requirements for  all servicemembers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense provided written comments on a draft of  this report, which are found in appendix II. DOD concurred with the  report\u2019s recommendation.", "The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs commented that his  office has already established a quality assurance program for pre- and  post-deployment health assessments. This program monitors pre- and  post-deployment health assessments and blood samples being archived  electronically at the Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA) and  assures that indicated referrals on the post-deployment health  assessments are being conducted by all the services. However, the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs\u2019 comments did not  discuss how his office is using the monitoring activities to assure  the military services\u2019 compliance with force health protection and  surveillance policies.", "According to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the  services have implemented their quality assurance programs. The Army  has developed automated versions of the pre- and post-deployment health  assessment forms, and has established a corporate monitoring system  that is built upon deployment personnel rosters and monitored weekly  by the Army Surgeon General. The Air Force is now receiving monthly  deployment health surveillance compliance reports from its medical  treatment facilities, and has scheduled a special compliance study  through the Air Force Inspection Agency in fiscal year 2004. Navy fleet  commanders have implemented their own quality assurance programs,  with anticipation of standardization through centralized automated  systems. And the Marine Corps has also established unit/command  quality assurance procedures. We view these actions as responsive to our  recommendation and commend the department for taking quick action  to address the compliance issues we found during our audit. However, it  remains to be seen how effective these activities will be in ensuring that  force health protection and surveillance policies are implemented for  all servicemembers.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and the  Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force.

We also  performed additional work at the Deployment Health Support Directorate,  Falls Church, Virginia; the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and  Preventive Medicine, Aberdeen, Maryland; the Armed Forces Medical  Intelligence Center, Fort Dietrick, Maryland; the Army Medical  Surveillance Activity, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington,  D.C.; the Navy Environmental Health Center in Portsmouth, Virginia;  the Defense Manpower Data Center in Monterey, California; and the  U.S. Central Command and the U.S. Special Operations Command at  MacDill Air Force Base, Tampa, Florida.", "To determine whether the military services were meeting DOD\u2019s force  health protection and surveillance requirements for servicemembers  deploying in support of OEF and OJG, we identified DOD and each  service\u2019s overall deployment health surveillance policies. We also obtained  the specific force health protection and surveillance requirements  applicable to all servicemembers deploying to Central Asia in support of  OEF from the U.S. Central Command and these requirements for all  servicemembers deploying to Kosovo in support of OJG from the  U.S. European Command. We tested the implementation of these  requirements at selected Army and Air Force installations. To identify  locations within each service where we would test implementation of the  policies, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs requested  the services to identify, by military installation, the number of active duty  servicemembers who met the following criteria:    For OEF, those servicemembers who deployed to Central Asia for 30 or  more continuous days to areas without permanent U.S. military treatment  facilities following September 11, 2001, and redeployed back to their home  unit by May 31, 2002.", "For OJG, those servicemembers who deployed to Kosovo for 30 or more  continuous days to areas without permanent U.S. military treatment  facilities from January 1, 2001, and redeployed back to their home unit by  May 31, 2002.", "Based on deployment data obtained from the services, we decided to  limit our testing of the force health protection and surveillance policy  implementation to selected Army and Air Force military installations  with the largest numbers of servicemembers meeting our selection  criteria (described above). We limited our review of medical records for  servicemembers deploying in support of OJG to the two Army locations.  We decided not to review Navy installations because there were only  small numbers of servicemembers who met our selection criteria. We  decided not to review Marine Corps installations because officials at  the Marine Corps headquarters had difficulty identifying the number of  servicemembers who went ashore 30 or more continuous days consistent  with our selection criteria.", "The largest deployers for OEF and OJG were selected and are  listed below:    10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum, N.Y.    101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, Ky.     Travis Air Force Base, Calif.    Hurlburt Field, Fla.    10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum, N.Y.    101st Airborne Division, Fort Campbell, Ky.", "For our medical records review, we selected statistical samples of  servicemembers at the selected installations to be representative of those  deploying from those military installations for those specific operations.", "For various reasons, medical records were not always available for review.  We, therefore, sampled without replacement, to choose additional records  when we were unable to meet our sampling threshold of cases for review.  Specifically, there were five reasons identified for not being able to  physically secure the servicemember\u2019s medical record for review:   1.  Charged to patient. When a patient visits a clinic (on-post or  off-post), the medical record is physically given to the patient. The  procedure is that the medical record will be returned by the patient  following their clinic visit.  2.  Expired term of service. Servicemember separates from the military  and their medical record is sent to St. Louis, Missouri, and therefore  not available for review.  3.  Record is not accounted for by the medical records department.  4.  Permanent change of station. Servicemember is still in the military,  but has transferred to another base. Medical record transfers with the  servicemember.  5.  Temporary duty off site. Servicemember has left military  installation, but is expected to return. The temporary duty is long  enough to warrant that the medical record accompany the  servicemember.", "The sample size for deployments was determined to provide 95 percent  confidence with a 5-percent precision. The number of servicemembers in  our samples and the applicable universe of servicemembers for the OEF  and OJG deployments at the installations visited are shown in table 2.", "At Fort Campbell, there were only 333 servicemembers identified as  having met our criteria based on a redeployment date of May 31, 2002;  however, only 8 charts were available for review due to rotation of  soldiers to other military locations or departure from the military. It was,  therefore, necessary to extend our redeployment date to October 31, 2002.", "Doing so provided an additional 2,953 servicemembers who met all criteria  except for a redeployment by May 31, 2002. At Fort Campbell, there were  92 servicemembers who deployed in support of OJG and met our selection  criteria if we extended the redeployment date to October 31, 2002.  Because the number of servicemembers for OJG at Fort Campbell was  small, we reviewed the medical records for all of servicemembers who  were still at Fort Campbell.", "At each sampled location, we examined servicemember medical records  for evidence of the following force health protection and deployment  health-related documentation required by DOD\u2019s force health protection  and deployment health surveillance policies:    Pre- and post-deployment health assessments,    Tuberculosis screening test (within 1 year of deployment for OEF and  2 years for OJG)  influenza (within 1 year of deployment);    measles, mumps, and rubella;    meningococcal (within 5 years of deployment);    polio;   tetanus-diphtheria (within 10 years of deployment);   typhoid (within 5 years of deployment); and     yellow fever (within 10 years of deployment), not required for OJG.", "To provide assurances that our review of the selected medical records was  accurate, we requested the installations\u2019 medical personnel to reexamine  those medical records that were missing required health assessments or  immunizations and adjusted our results where documentation was  subsequently identified. We also requested that installation medical  personnel check all possible sources for missing pre- and post-deployment  health assessments and immunizations. These sources included the Army\u2019s  Soldier Readiness Check folders and automated immunization sources,  including the Army\u2019s Medical Protection System (MEDPROS) and the  Air Force\u2019s Comprehensive Immunization Tracking Application (CITA).  We checked all known possible sources for the existence of deployment  health assessments related to servicemembers in our samples. In  those instances where we did not find a deployment health assessment,  we concluded that the assessments were not completed. Furthermore,  installation officials were unable to logistically access the  servicemembers\u2019 individual records of immunizations, commonly referred  to as yellow-shot records that may have provided documentation for  missing immunizations. Consequently, our analyses of the immunization  records was based on our examination of the servicemember\u2019s  permanent medical record and immunizations that were in the Army\u2019s  MEDPROS and the Air Force\u2019s CITA. In analyzing our review results at  each location, we considered documentation from all identified sources  (e.g., servicemember\u2019s medical record, soldier readiness check folder,  Army Medical Surveillance Activity, and immunization tracking  systems) in presenting data on compliance with deployment health  surveillance policies.", "To identify whether required blood serum specimens were in storage  at the Armed Services Serum Repository, we requested that the Army  Medical Surveillance Activity staff query the Repository to identify  whether the servicemembers in our samples had a blood serum sample  in the repository and the date of the specimen.", "To determine whether the Army and Air Force are documenting in-theater  medical interventions in servicemembers\u2019 medical records, we requested,  at each installation visited for medical records review, the patient sign-in  logs for in-theater medical care providers, namely the Army\u2019s battalion aid  station and the Air Force\u2019s expeditionary medical support, when they were  deployed to central Asia in support of OEF and for the two Army  installations we visited that deployed in support of OJG. Officials were  unable to locate or access the logs at all of our selected installations  except for Fort Drum for the OEF deployment. Consequently, we were  able to perform our planned examination for this objective at only Fort  Drum for the OEF deployment. From these logs, we selected a random  sample of 36 patient visits from one battalion aid station and 18 patient  visits from another battalion aid station. We did not attempt to judge the  importance of the patient visit in making our selections. For the selected  patient visits, we then reviewed the servicemember\u2019s medical record for  any documentation\u2014such as the Army\u2019s Standard Form 600\u2014of the  servicemember\u2019s visit to the battalion aid station.", "To determine whether the Army and Air Force\u2019s deployment health-related  records are retained and maintained in a centralized location, we  requested that officials at the Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA)  query the AMSA database for the servicemembers included in our samples  at the selected Army and Air Force installations. For servicemembers in  our samples, AMSA officials provided us with copies of deployment health  assessments and immunization data found in the AMSA database. We  analyzed the completeness of the AMSA database by comparing the  deployment health assessments and the pre-deployment immunization  data we found during our medical records review with those in the AMSA  database. Since Air Force special operations force units use the Hurlburt  Field, we also requested the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM)  to query their Special Operation Forces Deployment Health Surveillance  System database for servicemembers in our sample at Hurlburt Field for  deployment health assessments and pre-deployment immunization data.  We then compared the data identified from the SOCOM and AMSA queries  with the data we found during our medical records review.", "To determine whether DOD has corrected problems related to the  accuracy and completeness of databases reflecting which servicemembers  deployed to certain locations, we interviewed officials within the  Deployment Health Support Directorate and the Defense Manpower Data  Center and reviewed documentation related to the completeness of  deployment databases and planned improvements in capabilities.", "Our review was performed from June 2002 through July 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Steve Fox, Rebecca Beale,  Lynn Johnson, William Mathers, Terry Richardson, Kristine Braaten,  Grant Mallie, Herbert Dunn, and R.K.
