A key element of such systems modernization programs is the use of an enterprise architecture (EA), which is a blueprint of an agency's current and planned operating and systems environment, as well as an IT investment plan for transitioning between the two. The conference report accompanying FBI's fiscal year 2005 appropriations directed GAO to determine (1) whether the FBI is managing its EA program in accordance with established best practices and (2) what approach the bureau is following to track and oversee its EA contractor, including the use of effective contractual controls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The FBI is managing its EA program in accordance with many best practices, but other such practices have yet to be adopted. These best practices, which are described in GAO's EA management maturity framework, are those necessary for an organization to have an effective architecture program. Examples of practices that the bureau has implemented include establishing a program office that is responsible for developing the architecture, having a written and approved policy governing architecture development, and continuing efforts to develop descriptions of the FBI's \"as is\" and \"to be\" environments and sequencing plan. The establishment of these and other practices represents important progress from the bureau's status 2 years ago, when GAO reported that the FBI lacked both an EA and the means to develop and enforce one. Notwithstanding this progress, much remains to be accomplished before the FBI will have an effective EA program. For example, the EA program office does not yet have adequate resources, and the architecture products needed to adequately describe either the current or the future architectural environments have not been completed. Until the bureau has a complete and enforceable EA, it remains at risk of developing systems that do not effectively and efficiently support mission operations and performance. The FBI is relying heavily on contractor support to develop its EA; however, it has not employed effective contract management controls in doing so. Specifically, the bureau has not used performance-based contracting, an approach that is required by federal acquisition regulations whenever practicable. Further, the bureau is not employing the kind of effective contractor tracking and oversight practices specified in relevant acquisition management guidance. According to FBI officials, the agency's approach to managing its EA contractor is based on its long-standing approach to managing IT contractors: that is, working with the contractor on iterations of each deliverable until the bureau deems it acceptable. This approach, in GAO's view, is not effective and efficient. According to FBI officials, as soon as the bureau completes an ongoing effort to redefine its policies and procedures for managing IT programs (including, for example, the use of performance-based contracting methods and the tracking and oversight of contractor performance), it will adopt these new policies and procedures. Until effective contractor management policies and procedures are defined and implemented on the EA program, the likelihood of the FBI effectively and efficiently producing a complete and enforceable architecture is diminished."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is attempting to replace much of  its 1980\u2019s-based information technology (IT) systems environment to better  support its plans for an integrated bureauwide approach to performing  critical mission operations, including terrorism prevention and federal  crime investigation. Our research and experience in reviewing federal  agency system modernization programs, including the FBI\u2019s, shows that  attempting such programs without a well-defined and enforceable  enterprise architecture (EA) results in nonintegrated, stand-alone systems  that are duplicative and do not effectively and efficiently support mission  performance.", "In September 2003, we reported that the FBI needed an EA to guide its  modernization activities and recommended that the FBI Director designate  the development of a complete architecture as a bureauwide priority and  manage the effort accordingly.

Because of the importance of the EA to the FBI\u2019s  modernization program, the conference report accompanying the fiscal  year 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed us to determine  (1) whether the FBI is managing its EA program in accordance with  established best practices and (2) what approach the bureau is following to  track and oversee its EA contractor, including the use of effective  contractual controls.

Its missions include protecting the nation from  foreign intelligence and terrorist threats, investigating serious federal  crimes, providing leadership and assistance to law enforcement agencies,  and being responsive to the public in the performance of these duties.  Approximately 12,000 special agents and 16,000 mission support personnel  are located in the bureau\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters and in more  than 450 offices in the United States and 45 offices in foreign countries.", "Mission responsibilities at the bureau are divided among the following five  major organizational components:  Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence: identifies, assesses,  investigates, and responds to national security threats.", "Intelligence: collects, analyzes, and disseminates information on  evolving threats to the United States.", "Criminal Investigations: investigates serious federal crimes and  probes federal statutory violations involving exploitation of the Internet  and computer systems.", "Law Enforcement Services: provides law enforcement information and  forensic services to federal, state, local, and international agencies.", "Administration: manages the bureau\u2019s personnel program, budgetary  and financial services, records, information resources, and information  security.", "Each component is headed by an Executive Assistant Director who reports  to the Deputy Director, who, in turn, reports to the Director. The  components are further organized into 19 subcomponents, such as  divisions, offices, and groups. Supporting these subcomponents are various  staff offices, including the Office of the CIO. Figure 1 shows a simplified  organizational chart of the components, subcomponents, Office of the CIO,  and their respective reporting relationships.", "The Office of the CIO\u2019s responsibilities include preparing the bureau\u2019s IT  strategic plan and operating budget; operating and maintaining existing  systems and networks; developing and deploying new systems; defining  and implementing IT management policies, procedures, and processes; and  developing and maintaining the bureau\u2019s EA. To carry out these  responsibilities, the Office of the CIO is organized into four subordinate  offices. Figure 2 shows a simplified organizational chart of the CIO\u2019s office,  subordinate offices, and their reporting relationships; a brief description of  each office\u2019s responsibilities is in table 1. The FBI\u2019s EA program is in the  CIO\u2019s Office of IT Policy and Planning.", "To execute its mission responsibilities, the FBI has historically relied  extensively on IT. For example, it relies on such computerized IT systems  as the Combined DNA Index System to support forensic examinations and  the National Crime Information Center and the Integrated Automated  Fingerprint Identification System to help state and local law enforcement  agencies identify criminals. The FBI reports that it collectively manages  hundreds of systems, networks, databases, applications, and associated IT  tools. As we previously reported, the FBI\u2019s IT environment includes  outdated, nonintegrated systems that do not optimally support mission  operations.", "Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the FBI was forced  to rethink its mission. As we have reported, this resulted in the bureau  shifting its mission focus to detecting and preventing possible future  attacks and ultimately led to the FBI\u2019s commitment to reorganize and  transform itself. According to the bureau, the complexity of this mission  shift, along with the changing law enforcement environment, has strained  its existing patchwork of IT systems, which were developed and deployed  on an ad hoc basis. The bureau reports that these circumstances will  require a major overhaul in its IT systems environment.", "To effect this change, the FBI has undertaken an organizational  transformation and systems modernization effort. Major goals of the  transformation are, among other things, to develop the capability to  become a proactive rather than a reactive organization, embrace  intelligence as a professional and operational competency, and leverage  information across the bureau and with other agencies to \u201cconnect the  dots.\u201dAccording to the FBI, an integral part of the transformation will be  modernizing the IT systems that support the bureau\u2019s processes. The FBI  reports that it will spend approximately $390 million on modernization  projects in fiscal year 2005 out of a total IT budget of $737 million. To guide  and constrain these and future system modernization investments, the FBI  has initiated an effort to align its investments with the new mission being  implemented via its transformation.

The Congress, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), and the federal CIO Council have also recognized the  importance of an architecture-centric approach to modernization. The  Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 mandates that agency CIOs develop, maintain,  and facilitate the implementation of an IT architecture. Further, the  E-Government Act of 2002 requires OMB to oversee EA development  within and across agencies.", "An EA is a systematically derived snapshot\u2014in useful models, diagrams,  and narrative\u2014of a given entity\u2019s operations (business and systems),  including how its operations are performed, what information and  technology are used to perform the operations, where the operations are  performed, who performs them, and when and why they are performed.  The architecture describes the entity in both logical terms (e.g.,  interrelated functions, information needs and flows, work locations,  systems, and applications) and technical terms (e.g., hardware, software,  data, communications, and security). EAs provide these perspectives both  for the entity\u2019s current (or \u201cas is\u201d) environment and for its target (or \u201cto  be\u201d) environment; they also provide a high-level capital investment  roadmap for moving from one environment to the other. In doing so, EAs  link organizations\u2019 strategic plans with program implementations.", "Among others, OMB, the National Institute of Standards and Technology,  and the federal CIO Council have issued frameworks that define the scope  and content of architectures. In addition, OMB has since issued a  collection of five reference models (Business, Performance,  Data/Information, Service, and Technical) that are intended to facilitate  governmentwide improvement through cross-agency analysis and the  identification of duplicative investments, gaps, and opportunities. While  these various frameworks differ in their nomenclatures and modeling  approaches, they consistently provide for defining an architecture\u2019s  operations in both logical and technical terms and providing these  perspectives for both the \u201cas is\u201d and the \u201cto be\u201d environments, as well as  the investment roadmap.", "Managed properly, an EA can clarify and help to optimize the  interdependencies and relationships among an organization\u2019s business  operations and the underlying IT infrastructure and applications that  support these operations. Employed in concert with other important  management controls, such as portfolio-based capital planning and  investment control practices, architectures can greatly increase the  chances that an organization\u2019s operational and IT environments will be  configured to optimize its mission performance.

In April 2003, we published a maturity framework that  arranges key best practices and conditions of the federal CIO Council\u2019s  guide into five hierarchical stages, with Stage 1 representing the least  mature and Stage 5 being the most mature. The framework provides an  explicit benchmark for gauging the effectiveness of EA management and  provides a roadmap for making improvements. Each of the five stages is  described below, and the stages and their core elements are shown in table  2. (See app. II for a more detailed description of our framework and  associated core elements.) 1. Creating EA awareness. The organization does not have plans to  develop and use an architecture, or it has plans that do not demonstrate  an awareness of the value of having and using an architecture. While  Stage 1 agencies may have initiated some architecture activity, these  agencies\u2019 efforts are ad hoc and unstructured, lack institutional  leadership and direction, and do not provide the management  foundation necessary for successful architecture development. 2. Building the EA management foundation. The organization  recognizes that the architecture is a corporate asset by vesting  accountability for it in an executive body that represents the entire  enterprise. At this stage, an organization assigns architecture  management roles and responsibilities and establishes plans for  developing architecture products and for measuring program progress  and product quality; it also commits the resources necessary for  developing an architecture\u2014people, processes, and tools. 3. Developing the EA. The organization focuses on developing  architecture products according to the selected framework,  methodology, tool, and established management plans. Roles and  responsibilities assigned in the previous stage are in place, and  resources are being applied to develop actual architecture products.  The scope of the architecture has been defined to encompass the entire  enterprise, whether organization based or function based. 4. Completing the EA. The organization has completed its architecture  products\u2014meaning that the products have been approved by the  architecture steering committee or an investment review board and by  the CIO. Further, an independent agent has assessed the quality (i.e.,  completeness and accuracy) of the architecture products. Additionally,  evolution of the approved products is governed by a written  architecture maintenance policy approved by the head of the  organization. 5. Leveraging the EA to manage change. The organization has secured  senior leadership approval of the architecture products and has a  written institutional policy stating that IT investments must comply  with the architecture, unless granted an explicit compliance waiver.  Further, decision makers are using the architecture to identify and  address ongoing and proposed IT investments that are conflicting,  overlapping, not strategically linked, or redundant. Also, the  organization tracks and measures architecture benefits or return on  investment, and adjustments are continuously made to both the  architecture management process and the architecture products."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Prior Reviews Have Emphasized the Need for the FBI to Establish Architecture Management Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several years, reviews of the FBI\u2019s efforts to leverage IT to  support its transformation have identified the bureau\u2019s lack of an EA as a  significant management weakness. For example, during 2002, we reported  that the FBI did not have an EA. Because our research and experience at  federal agencies shows that architectures are an essential ingredient to  success for transformations like the FBI\u2019s, we reported that the bureau  should establish the management foundation that is necessary to begin  successfully developing, implementing, and maintaining an EA.", "Between September 2003 and September 2004, we reported on a number  of FBI IT transformation challenges, including effectively developing and  using an architecture. More specifically, we reported in September 2003  that the bureau had not yet acted on our recommendation for an EA, having  only established 1 of the 31 key EA management capabilities described in  our architecture management maturity framework, and that this limited  capability was due in part to the fact that the architecture\u2019s development  was not being treated as an agency priority. Accordingly, we recommended  that the Director make architecture development and use a priority, and we  provided additional recommendations to help the bureau establish the  management capabilities needed to develop, implement, and maintain its  architecture. The FBI agreed with our recommendations.", "Since we reported on the FBI\u2019s lack of an architecture, others have  similarly reported on this gap in the bureau\u2019s ability to effectively  modernize its systems and transform its operations. For example, in March  2004, the Department of Justice Inspector General testified that the lack  of an architecture was a contributing factor to the continuing cost and  schedule shortfalls being experienced by the bureau on its Trilogy  investigative case management system, which was the FBI\u2019s centerpiece  systems modernization project. Moreover, the National Research Council  reported in May 2004 that while the bureau had made significant progress  in its IT systems modernization program, the FBI was not on the path to  success, in part, because it had not yet developed an EA.", "The FBI initiated its current effort to develop an architecture in late 2003.  For example, in March 2004, the bureau awarded a $1.2 million firm, fixed- price contract for assistance in developing, maintaining, and implementing  an EA. It subsequently awarded the same contractor two fixed-price  contracts to provide EA security and integration services. Although these  contracts are supporting the Office of the CIO, responsibility for contract  management resides with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FBI Has Implemented Some Important EA Management Practices, but It Has Yet to Implement Others", "paragraphs": ["As we previously reported, it is critical that the FBI have and use a well- defined EA to guide and constrain its IT investment decisions. We  recommended that in order to effectively develop and implement an  architecture, the bureau employ rigorous and disciplined architecture  management practices. Such practices form the basis of our architecture  management maturity framework. The bureau has thus far implemented  most of our framework\u2019s key practices associated with establishing an  architecture management foundation, but important foundational practices  are still missing. It has also implemented key practices related to  developing the architecture; however, most architecture development  practices are not yet fully implemented, and virtually all practices that are  key to completing and leveraging the architecture for organizational  change remain to be implemented. While the bureau\u2019s EA efforts to date  represent important progress from where it was in 2003, when we last  assessed its efforts, much remains to be accomplished before the FBI will  have an effective EA program. Without such a program, the bureau will be  challenged in its efforts to effectively and efficiently modernize its systems  in a way that minimizes duplication and overlap, maximizes integration,  and effectively supports organizational transformation.", "In March 2005, the FBI completed an EA baseline report on the status of its  \u201cas is\u201d EA activities. The purpose of the report was to, among other  things, provide a \u201chigh-level snapshot\u201d of where it stood in determining and  understanding current bureau business processes and supporting IT  structures and systems and how it was managing its ongoing architecture  development efforts. In May 2005, the bureau issued a similar report on its  \u201cto be\u201d architecture activities. On the basis of these reports, along with  other documentation and officials\u2019 statements, we determined that the  bureau has satisfied 15 of the 31 core elements specified in our architecture  management maturity framework, including 7 Stage 2 elements, all Stage 3  elements, 1 Stage 4 element, and 1 Stage 5 element (see table 3). For the  remaining elements, the bureau has efforts planned and under way that are  intended to satisfy them.", "More specifically, for Stage 2, the bureau has satisfied seven of nine core  elements. For example, in early 2004, the bureau established a program  office\u2014located in the CIO\u2019s office and headed by a senior level executive\u2014 that is responsible for EA development and maintenance, including  drafting and executing a program management plan. This program office  includes a chief architect and five key senior level architect positions for  business, applications, information, technology, and security. The office  also has positions that are to perform support functions such as quality  assurance, risk management, and configuration control.", "The bureau also established an Enterprise Architecture Board that includes  senior representation from across all bureau business areas and has  assigned the board responsibility for directing, overseeing, and approving  the architecture. Minutes of board meetings show that this organization  meets about every 2 weeks to oversee EA program progress, provide  executive direction, and review and approve EA plans and products. These  minutes also show that CIO officials and business area representatives  regularly attend the meetings.", "In addition, the bureau has developed a number of plans, including a  program management plan (dated October 2004). According to these plans,  the architecture is to describe the \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d environments, as well  as a sequencing plan. Moreover, the plans call for describing the enterprise  in terms of business, performance, data, application, and technology. These  plans also include a schedule of tasks to be performed, associated  milestones, and an estimate of resources (e.g., funding, staffing, contractor  assistance) for fiscal years 2004 through 2007. In addition, these plans call  for developing performance metrics to measure EA development and  execution and provide for establishing management controls, such as risk  management, quality assurance, and configuration control, for developing  and maintaining the architecture.", "Other Stage 2 core elements have yet to be fully addressed. For example,  the EA program office does not yet have adequate resources. According to  the framework, an organization should have the resources (e.g., funding,  human capital) to establish and effectively manage its architecture.  According to FBI officials, they have adequate financial resources to fund  the program and sufficient contractor assistance, and they have been able  to use bureau and contractor personnel to staff most of the 13 program  office staff positions. However, core staff positions identified by the bureau  have not yet been filled: four of the five key architect positions mentioned  earlier are vacant. Bureau officials told us that job announcements have  been issued for the four key architect positions, but it has been a challenge  finding the right candidates. According to the FBI, failing to have these key  staff on board hampers the program office\u2019s ability to perform planned  tasks. Having qualified staff serving as the core team is important because  without them, the program office does not have the proper knowledge,  skills, and abilities to properly execute the EA program, including  managing and overseeing its contractors.", "In addition, although the FBI has selected a framework to determine the  type of architecture products to be developed and has acquired an  automated tool to capture the content of its products, the bureau does not  have a defined methodology (i.e., the specific steps and methods)  documenting how it will develop the products\u2019 content. As stated in our  framework, a methodology is important because it defines (and thus  permits stakeholders and others to understand) the steps necessary to  perform the activities associated with capturing EA content in a coherent,  consistent, accountable, and repeatable manner. For this reason, our  architecture maturity framework calls for using a methodology in  conjunction with an EA framework and automated tool. Collectively, these  permit architecture development to occur in an effective and efficient  manner.", "Instead of a defined methodology, the bureau is relying on a combination of  its chief architect\u2019s knowledge and certain documentation, such as an EA  alignment plan that describes, among other things, the products to be  developed, the order in which they are to be developed, the relationships  among products, and analyses that are to be performed to help identify  gaps and redundancies in the contents of these products. However, this  documentation does not include either the specific steps or methods that  explain how the content of products is to be developed and documented. It  is important to have a documented methodology that is available to and  understood by those engaged in providing EA product content, because  without one, there is increased risk that products will be inconsistent,  incomplete, and incorrect, and thus require rework.", "For Stage 3, the bureau has satisfied all six core elements. In particular, the  bureau issued a policy in August 2003 that defines, among other things, the  scope of the architecture and identifies the major stakeholders, including  their roles and responsibilities.", "In addition, the bureau has developed a configuration management plan  that defines management structures and processes for identifying, tracking,  monitoring, reporting, and auditing changes to the architecture products.  The plan establishes a configuration control board and makes the security  architect responsible for initiating board meetings and ensuring that audits  are conducted as intended. To date, this board has identified and begun  tracking such changes. For example, products, including the program  management plan, EA principles, \u201cas is\u201d architecture, and EA software tool,  have been identified and placed under configuration management in  accordance with the plan.", "Further, the program office reports that it is in the process of developing its  \u201cas is\u201d architecture. According to the March 2005 report, the bureau has  issued several iterations of a \u201chigh-level\u201d version of its \u201cas is\u201d architecture  that describes the bureau\u2019s business, data, application, and technology  environments. However, these iterations do not include performance  descriptions. Moreover, the other \u201cas is\u201d descriptions are not complete,  according to the report. For example, as part of the information/data  description, the program office is in the process of completing ongoing  efforts to map FBI data to the business processes that use these data. In  addition, as part of the application description, the program office is  working to develop a system architecture diagram to show how the various  IT applications currently interrelate. Also, while the program office has  developed a business architecture description, it has not performed a  detailed decomposition of the business processes described. The bureau  had planned to complete the remaining work on the \u201cas is\u201d architecture by  mid-summer.", "The office also is in the process of developing the \u201cto be\u201d architecture.  According to the FBI\u2019s May 2005 report, the initial version of the \u201cto be\u201d  architecture includes business, performance, information/data, service,  and technology descriptions. However, the report identifies additional  work needed to complete this version. For example, according to the  report, the service reference models need to be further defined to provide a  detailed framework that supports the transition to the \u201cto be\u201d environment.  In addition, the bureau reports that data exchange models need to be  developed to provide better understanding of data exchange processes and  whether opportunities exist for improvement. Further, the bureau reports  that it needs to develop a framework so that it can better understand the  relationships among EA components, such as between the business  reference model and the service reference model, and between the service  reference model and the technology reference model. The bureau plans to  issue the next version of its \u201cto be\u201d architecture in fiscal year 2006.", "In addition, the bureau reports it has developed a \u201chigh level\u201d description of  a sequencing plan that is not yet complete; the next version of the plan is  scheduled for issuance in September 2005.", "Two additional elements (one Stage 4 and one Stage 5 element) have also  been satisfied. Specifically, while EA products and processes to date have  not been independently verified and validated, the FBI hired a contractor in  April 2005 to begin performing such assessments on both the EA products  and the processes used to develop them. According to the contract  statement of work, the results of these assessments are to be shared with  the program office and reported to the steering committee.", "Also, the bureau has defined a management structure and process to  formally manage EA change. According to its configuration management  plan (dated February 3, 2005), the bureau is using an automated tool to  manage critical EA work products as they are developed and changed.  Further, the bureau established a Change Management Board to resolve  critical issues, including those that require a major commitment of  resources, vary from the EA strategy, or require a policy change.", "Beyond these two elements, 14 core elements in Stages 4 and 5 have yet to  be satisfied. In particular, key architecture products have yet to be  completed. As previously noted, the bureau is still in the process of  developing both its \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d architectures, for example. The  sequencing plan is also a work in process. (A summary of the results of our  assessment on the FBI\u2019s satisfaction of the core elements for each of the  stages are provided in app. III.)", "Discussing the bureau\u2019s EA program, the FBI\u2019s CIO said that significant  progress has been made, which he attributed to top-level organizational  commitment and focus on EA, as well as assignment of bureauwide IT  budget control and authority to the CIO. Despite this progress, much  remains to be accomplished before the FBI will have an effective EA  program. According to our framework, effective architecture management  is generally not achieved until an enterprise has a completed and approved  architecture that is being effectively maintained and is being used to  leverage organizational change and support investment decision making;  having these characteristics is equivalent to having satisfied all of the Stage  2 and 3 core elements and many of the Stage 4 and 5 elements.", "Until the bureau gets to that stage, it will be challenged in its efforts to  implement modernized systems in a way that minimizes overlap and  duplication and maximizes integration and mission support. Our prior  reviews of federal agencies and research of architecture best practices  have shown that attempting to modernize systems without a well-defined  and verifiable architecture and associated management capabilities  increases the risk that large sums of money and much time and effort will  be invested in technology solutions that are duplicative, are not well  integrated, are unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface, and do not  effectively optimize mission performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bureau Is Not Effectively Managing Its EA Contractor", "paragraphs": ["Federal acquisition regulations and relevant IT acquisition management  guidance recognize the importance of effectively managing contractor  activities. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), for example, directs  agencies to use performance-based contracting to the maximum extent  practicable when acquiring most services. Under the FAR, performance- based contracting includes (1) defining the work to be performed in  measurable, results-oriented terms; (2) specifying performance standards  (quality and timeliness) that are tied to contractual requirements;  (3) having a quality assurance plan that describes how the contractor\u2019s  performance in meeting requirements will be measured against standards;  and (4) establishing positive and negative contractor performance  incentives. The FAR and associated regulations also require government  oversight of contracts to ensure that the contractor (the service provider)  performs the requirements of the contract, and the government (the service  receiver or customer) receives the service as intended. However, the  regulations do not prescribe specific methods for this oversight.", "Other acquisition management guidance identifies effective contractor  tracking and oversight as a key activity and describes a number of practices  associated with this activity, including   establishing a written policy for contract tracking and oversight,  designating responsibility for contract tracking and oversight activities,  establishing a group that is responsible for managing contract tracking  and oversight activities, and  using approved contractor planning documents as a basis for tracking  and overseeing the contractor.", "The FBI\u2019s approach to managing its EA contract does not include most of  the performance-based contracting features described in the FAR.  Specifically, although the contract\u2019s statement of work defines when  products are due (i.e., timeliness standards), it does not specify the  products in results-oriented, measurable terms. For example, the statement  of work defines requirements in terms of general product descriptions such  as \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d architectures and a sequencing plan. Further, it does  not specify quality standards for products and does not define incentives  for addressing either timeliness or quality standards.", "The bureau also does not have plans for assuring the quality of the  contractor\u2019s work. Instead, bureau officials told us that they follow the  bureau\u2019s long-standing approach of working with the contractor to  determine whether each deliverable is acceptable. As an example, the  bureau received a draft of its \u201cas is\u201d architecture on August 22, 2004.  According to bureau officials, the draft was of poor quality, and the bureau  did not accept it. The bureau then worked with the contractor to improve  the quality of the product, and after several iterations, the bureau accepted  a draft of the \u201cas is\u201d architecture on September 30, 2004. However, because  the bureau did not have either quality standards or a quality assurance plan,  the basis for acceptance was not available for us to independently assess.", "In tracking and overseeing its contractor, the FBI also has not employed  the kind of effective practices specified in relevant acquisition management  guidance. For example, the bureau does not have a written policy to govern  its tracking and oversight activities, has not designated responsibility or  established a group for performing contract tracking and oversight  activities, and has not developed an approved contractor monitoring plan.  Instead, the bureau holds weekly status meetings with its EA contractor to  discuss progress and plans, and it is receiving incremental drafts of work  products in an effort to increase visibility into contractor activities and  thereby minimize the number of unacceptable deliverables and associated  rework.", "FBI officials from the offices of the Chief Financial Officer and CIO  attributed the current contract management approach to several factors.  First, they said that the FBI has historically been challenged in developing  statements of work that clearly define requirements and establish  performance (quality and timeliness) standards, which are essential to  effective performance-based contracting. Second, these officials stated that  they are still working to define effective contract management controls.  Specifically, as part of the CIO office\u2019s transformation, including  implementing its recently assigned agencywide authority and control over  IT resources, these officials are developing standard policies and  procedures for managing IT. In particular, these policies and procedures  are to include an FBI-wide standard life-cycle management directive that is  to define procedures for the use of performance-based contracting  methods and the establishment of tracking and oversight structures,  policies, and processes. The officials told us they began implementing parts  of the directive in late June 2005, but added that certain key practices, such  as acquisition management, were early drafts and required further  development. However, the officials were unable to provide a date for  when the drafts would be finalized and implementation of the practices  would begin.", "In the absence of performance-based contracting and effective tracking  and oversight, the bureau\u2019s ability to effectively manage its EA contractor is  constrained.

The bureau has taken steps aimed at  developing such an architecture and has made important progress in doing  so; however, much remains to be accomplished before it will have  implemented our prior recommendations and established an effective EA  program. As it moves forward, it is important for the bureau to employ all  the effective architecture management practices that we have previously  recommended, and to do so expeditiously. Moreover, given that the FBI\u2019s  program is heavily relying on contractor support, it is also important for the  bureau to ensure that it employs effective contract management controls  that will enable it to, among other things, define contractor work to be  performed in measurable, results-oriented terms; establish positive and  negative contractor performance incentives; and define and implement  contractor tracking and oversight processes consistent with acquisition  management guidance. Currently, the FBI does not have such controls in  place, and as a result, it is increasing the risk that it will take more time and  money to develop a well-defined EA than is necessary. If the bureau does  not begin employing the kind of effective contract management controls  contained in federal regulations and related guidance, its architecture  efforts will continue to be at risk.

This framework is based on A  Practical Guide to Federal Enterprise Architecture, published by the  federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council. We compared our  framework with the ongoing efforts of the FBI\u2019s EA program. Specifically,  we analyzed the bureau\u2019s EA plans and products, including program  management and other plans, key architecture principles, work breakdown  structures and corresponding milestones, Enterprise Architecture Board  charters and meeting minutes, repository strategy, and EA status reports.

An organization should have the  resources (funding, people, tools, and technology) to establish and  effectively manage its architecture. This includes identifying and  securing adequate funding to support EA activities; hiring and retaining  the right people with the proper knowledge, skills, and abilities to plan  and execute the EA program; and selecting and acquiring the right tools  and technology to support EA activities.", "Establish a committee or group representing the enterprise that is  responsible for directing, overseeing, or approving the EA.
