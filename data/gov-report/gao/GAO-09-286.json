Because schools may spend more time improving students' academic skills to meet NCLBA's requirements, some are concerned that arts education might be cut back. To determine how, if at all, student access to arts education has changed since NCLBA, the Congress asked: (1) has the amount of instruction time for arts education changed and, if so, have certain groups been more affected than others, (2) to what extent have state education agencies' requirements and funding for arts education changed since NCLBA, (3) what are school officials in selected districts doing to provide arts education since NCLBA and what challenges do they face in doing so, and (4) what is known about the effect of arts education in improving student outcomes?

The percentage of teachers that reported that instruction time had stayed the same was similarly high across a range of school characteristics, irrespective of the schools' percentage of low-income or minority students or of students with limited English proficiency, or the schools' improvement under NCLBA. Moreover, about 4 percent of teachers reported an increase. However, about 7 percent reported a decrease, and GAO identified statistically significant differences across school characteristics in the percentage of teachers reporting that the time spent on arts education had decreased. Teachers at schools identified as needing improvement and those with higher percentages of minority students were more likely to report a reduction in time spent on the arts. Because Education's survey did not include questions about why instruction time changed, GAO was not able to determine the reasons for the disparities its analysis identified. A new study of NCLBA implementation that Education plans to undertake may collect information on the uses of instruction time, among other topics. However, Education has not yet determined if it will collect information on the reasons instruction time changed for certain groups. While basic state requirements for arts education in schools have remained unchanged in most states, state funding levels for arts education increased in some states and decreased in others, according to GAO's survey of state arts officials. Arts education officials attributed the funding changes to state budget changes to a greater extent than they did to NCLBA or other factors. School principals have used several strategies to provide arts education; however, some struggled with decreased budgets and competing demands on instruction time, according to those GAO interviewed. Strategies for maintaining arts education include seeking funding and collaborative arrangements in the arts community. Competing demands on instruction time were due to state education agency or school district actions taken to meet NCLBA proficiency standards. Overall, research on the effect of arts education on student outcomes is inconclusive. Some studies that examined the effect of arts education on students' reading and math achievement found a small positive effect, but others found none."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has invested billions of dollars in federal grants to  The federal government has invested billions of dollars in federal grants to  states and school districts to improve educational opportunities for low- states and school districts to improve educational opportunities for low- income students because their academic performance is substantially  income students because their academic performance is substantially  lower than that of other students.

Because this study collected data on changes in instruction time only  from elementary school teachers, the nationally representative findings on  students\u2019 access to arts education apply only to elementary schools. Although  NLS-NCLB data did not allow us to answer the study question for middle and  secondary schools, they were the only existing data on changes in instruction  time available that met GAO\u2019s data quality standards. Our findings also apply  only to the time between school years 2004-2005 and 2006-2007 and not to the  full period of time since NCLBA\u2019s passage. As a further step in identifying  changes in students\u2019 access to arts education by identifying any changes in  state arts education requirements and funding, we surveyed arts officials in 49  states and the District of Columbia. For the survey, an arts official was an  official in a state department of education or other designated state agency  who was knowledgeable about the states\u2019 role in shaping the provision of arts  education in public schools. Forty-five state arts officials completed the  survey. The survey collected data on state arts education requirements and  funding in school years 2001-2002, the year NCLBA was passed, and 2006- 2007, changes made to state arts education requirements and funding  between those school years, and factors contributing to any changes. To  determine what district officials and school principals are doing to provide  arts education since NCLBA and the challenges they face, we visited and  interviewed officials in Illinois, Massachusetts, Florida, and New York. We  selected states with large numbers of schools not meeting AYP and school  districts and schools based on criteria that provide variation in the income  level of the school district, schools\u2019 performance status under NCLBA, and  schools\u2019 urban and rural location. Within each state, we visited 2 school  districts and 4 to 6 schools in each district for a total of 8 school districts and  19 schools. In each state, we also interviewed officials representing at least  one local arts organization that supported arts education in public schools. To  determine what is known about the effect of arts instruction, we reviewed  existing studies that examined the effect of arts instruction on student  outcomes, such as academic achievement and graduation rates. Appendix I  provides a detailed description of our methodology and its limitations, as well  as our scope. We conducted this performance audit from September 2007 to  February 2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Current legislation, NCLBA,  builds upon previous legislation\u2014the IASA\u2014by adding provisions meant  to strengthen accountability requirements for school districts and schools.  For example, both IASA and NCLBA required states to measure the  performance of students in reading and math. NCLBA built upon this  requirement by requiring annual testing in these subjects in each of grades  3 to 8 and added requirements that children\u2019s performance in science also  be assessed.", "Under NCLBA\u2019s accountability provisions, states are required to develop  plans that include academic standards and establish performance goals for  schools\u2019 meeting AYP that would lead to 100 percent of their students  being proficient in reading, mathematics, and science by 2014. To measure  their progress, states were required to establish academic proficiency  goals for making AYP and to administer an annual assessment to students  in most grade levels. In addition, each school\u2019s assessment data must be  disaggregated in order to compare the achievement levels of students  within certain designated groups, including low-income and minority  students, students with disabilities, and those with limited English  proficiency, with the state\u2019s proficiency targets. Each of these groups must  make AYP in order for the school to make AYP. In addition to proficiency  targets on state assessments, states must use another academic indicator  to determine AYP. For high schools, the indicator must be graduation  rates. States may choose what the other academic indicator will be for  elementary and middle schools.", "Title I of the ESEA, as amended and reauthorized by NCLBA, authorizes  federal funds to help elementary and secondary schools establish and  maintain programs that will improve the educational opportunities of  economically disadvantaged children For schools receiving Title I funds  that do not achieve proficiency, a time line is required for implementing  specific interventions based on the number of years the school missed  AYP. If a school fails to meet AYP in reading, mathematics, or science for 2  consecutive years, districts must offer students in these schools the  opportunity to transfer to a higher performing school in the district, and  after the third year they must offer both school choice and supplemental  education services (SES), such as tutoring. Prior legislation\u2014IASA\u2014 required districts to take corrective action as a final intervention for  schools that repeatedly missed AYP. While IASA allowed states to  determine the appropriate corrective action for their districts and schools,  NCLBA is more prescriptive in defining the corrective actions districts and  schools must implement. In addition, a new intervention to change the  governance of schools\u2014school restructuring\u2014was introduced for schools  that miss AYP for 5 or more years. (See table 1.) Districts are responsible  for selecting and implementing the corrective actions and restructuring  options for these schools contained in the law.

One perspective  sees arts education as having intrinsic value because of the insights into  self and others that experiencing the arts can yield. A second perspective  focuses on the association between arts education and development of  cognitive, affective, and creative skills, including improved achievement in  academic subjects such as reading and math.

Through surveys of school principals and teachers that  Education conducted in school years 1993-1994 and 1999-2000, Education  found that visual arts and music were offered by 80 to 90 percent of public  elementary and secondary schools, while theater and dance were offered  by a smaller fraction\u2014fewer than half. Education plans to conduct  another such survey in school year 2009-2010. Education sponsored the  National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) arts assessment of  students in the eighth grade during school year 1996-1997, which reported  the frequency of arts offerings by art form, and how well public school  students could respond to, create, and perform works of visual art, music,  and theatre. Known as the NAEP 1997 Arts Report Card, the study report  was issued in November 1998. The assessment found that a high  percentage of eighth grade students were offered music and visual arts in  the schools they attended, but that instruction in theater and dance was  more limited.

In a few schools, after school classes were the only  arts education opportunity available to students. At one middle school in  Boston that had not met AYP in school year 2006-2007, the principal had  eliminated arts education classes during the school day and purchased an  after-school arts program in drama and music production from an outside  organization.

In contrast, one New  York City middle school, which was not meeting AYP in English and  language arts in school year 2007-2008, changed when other classes were  offered, rather than changing when arts education was offered. This  school extended the school day for students who required additional help  by adding a period to the school schedule four times a week. The principal  told us that this allowed all students to attend art class held during the  regular school day. While many schools experienced changes to their arts  programs, several of the schools we visited reported no changes in their  arts education offerings.

The principal of a large  high school in Chicago, which has not met AYP for 4 years, also said that  the school had not changed its arts education policies.

For example, one elementary school in Boston has  developed partnerships with several companies, including a bank, that  fund the school\u2019s instrumental music program. This elementary school  also has obtained a grant from a television station to pay for instruments  and participates in a city-funded program that sends seven selected  students to the Boston Ballet once a week for lessons. A Chicago high  school received a private grant that supported a student art project to do a  mosaic on the walls outside the music rooms at the school. The principal  of this high school also said that he has informal arrangements with local  artists to bring special projects to the school, such as the group that visited  the school to teach a belly dancing class. A high school in Miami set up  internships for its students at local music stores and solicited a donation  of used equipment from the local news station when it moved to a new  facility. The drama teacher also solicits donations of costumes for school  dramatic productions. In Broward County, Florida, the school district  provides funds each year to pay for the cost of transporting the school  district\u2019s students to performances at the Broward Center for the  Performing Arts (Center). A New York City junior high school receives  support for students to attend plays from a private program and sends the  school\u2019s theater group to perform at Lincoln Center every year. A senior  high school in the city has arranged music programs with Carnegie Hall, a  local orchestra, and the Juilliard School of Music. The Museum of Modern  Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art also cover the students\u2019 cost of  admission for exhibits and performances.", "Arts organization officials in Chicago, Miami, and Broward County,  Florida, described the arts integration model of arts education as a  strategy for maintaining the arts in school curricula and provided  examples of arts integration programs in schools we did not visit. In  Chicago, the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education, a nonprofit arts  education advocacy organization, is participating as a partner in a project  that supports arts integration in the 55 fine and performing arts schools  operated under Chicago Public Schools\u2019 (CPS) magnet school cluster  program. The project, funded by Education\u2019s Model Development and  Dissemination grant program, funds teaching artists who work with art  teachers and regular classroom teachers to incorporate the arts into  teaching academic subjects. In Miami, Arts for Learning, a nonprofit that  promotes arts integration through in-school and after-school programs,  operates \u201cGET smART,\u201d a yearlong professional development program  that provides interdisciplinary training to teachers on how to effectively  create and implement arts integration projects in the core academic  subjects. About 18 Miami-Dade schools participated in this program in  school year 2007-2008. Arts for Learning also offers \u201cEarly GET smART\u201d a  program that works with preschoolers aged 2 to 6 to provide an arts-based  learning approach to literacy and school readiness. The Broward County  Cultural Division, a publicly funded agency established by the Board of  County Commissioners, promotes arts integration in the local schools.  One initiative provides a block grant to the school board to implement  artist-in-residencies and arts integration workshops in individual schools.  Officials representing the division said that schools are increasing use of  the arts to teach lessons in academic subject areas. For example, as his  class learned about a particular country, a social studies teacher would  play music from that country to expose the students to different musical  styles from around the world. The teacher was also working with an artist  to develop a visual presentation that could be incorporated into the lesson.  In addition, the Ft. Lauderdale Children\u2019s Theater goes into schools and  performs dramatic readings of plays with the children acting out the roles  as part of their classroom reading lessons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Report That the Main Challenges to Providing Arts Instruction Have Been Decreased State or Local Funding and Competing Demands on Instruction Time", "paragraphs": ["Officials we met with told us that the main challenges to providing arts  education have been decreased state or local funding and competing  demands on instruction time due to requirements established by the state  education agency or school district to meet NCLBA proficiency standards,  such as doubling the amount of time low-performing students spend on  reading and math.", "District officials and school principals in the Boston, Chicago, Miami- Dade, and New York City school districts all reported that state or local  budget cuts created a challenge for arts education in the schools. The  Boston school district expects an $11 million budget shortfall for the  upcoming school year, a result of a declining population base. School  district officials expect this shortfall to lead to a loss of 10 arts teachers  across the school district. District officials and school principals in  Chicago attributed funding shortages for arts education to the school  district\u2019s arts personnel funding policy. The Chicago school district funds  personnel positions on the basis of student enrollment and supports one  half-time position for an arts teacher in primary schools with fewer than  750 students. To employ a full-time arts teacher on the staff, a school  principal must supplement the arts teacher\u2019s salary from discretionary  funds. Officials in both Florida school districts we visited reported budget  pressures due to a state budget shortfall, but the consequences for arts  education differed. Miami-Dade school district officials reported cuts in  the district\u2019s arts education budget of as much as 70 percent, resulting in  staff cuts. In Broward County, while acknowledging budget pressures,  school district officials reported that the arts have not been cut. They said  that the district had taken steps several years ago to prepare for this  possible economic downturn. However, if cuts in content area programs  are necessary, the district makes an across-the-board percentage cut in the  budget allocated to each school rather than targeting individual subjects  for reduction. New York City school district officials reported that a line  item in the school district budget that provided schools a per capita  allotment solely to support arts education was eliminated in 2007, and  funds were incorporated into the school\u2019s general fund. This change  allowed school principals to allocate the funds to the arts or other  subjects.", "In addition to state and local budget cuts, district officials and school  principals in the Boston, Chicago, Miami-Dade, and New York City school  districts also agreed that competing demands on instruction time were a  major challenge for providing arts education in their schools. These  officials also identified NCLBA\u2019s proficiency standards\u2014as well as  requirements established by the state and school district to meet NCLBA  proficiency standards\u2014as a key source of the time pressure. Boston  school district officials said that it is difficult to convince principals of the  importance of continuing to provide arts education when it is not a tested  subject. They said that the arts curriculum takes a back seat because  school success is based on student performance on their state tests as  required under NCLBA. Although they tried to avoid pulling students out  of arts education classes for remedial work, one elementary and one high  school principal interviewed in Boston, whose schools were not meeting  AYP, agreed that NCLBA\u2019s testing requirements had increased the  demands on instruction time for tested subjects and reduced time  available for the arts, at least for students not meeting proficiency  requirements. A Waltham school district official said that to meet the state  and federal proficiency standards, the district added workshops in math,  reading, and science, which led to cuts in arts staff and even eliminating  arts field trips because they reduce the amount of available class time. She  added that, 2 years ago, the district added a two-block period twice a week  to keep up with state proficiency standards. This resulted in the loss of  one full-time equivalent (FTE) arts teacher. A Chicago school district  official affirmed that the priorities principals set for meeting AYP in  reading and math affect the time available for the arts. In Florida, where  the state requires that students who perform at the lowest two of five  levels on the state NCLBA proficiency tests be placed in intensive classes  for language arts and math, district officials agreed that time for arts  education might be affected. In Broward County, officials said that the  district follows the state policy that requires mandatory pull-out sessions  for students performing at reading levels 1 and 2 on the state performance  assessments. In some cases, the district will require some students to be  pulled out for additional intensive instruction in math. These \u201cpull-out\u201d  students receive double periods of reading or other intensive instruction  that reduces the number of periods they have available to take elective  classes, such as art or music. A New York City school district official  acknowledged that schools not meeting AYP faced challenges in providing  arts education but said that the responsibility for meeting instructional  requirements was the school principal\u2019s. Principals in the elementary and  middle schools we visited in New York, two of which were not meeting  AYP, said they had taken steps to meet the time demands of NCLBA\u2019s  testing requirements. The high school principal said that students not  meeting proficiency requirements could attend their remedial classes and  still meet the arts course requirement for graduation, but that they may not  have an opportunity to take courses above the minimum credit  requirement. This high school was not meeting AYP in school year 2007- 2008."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials Report That When Trade-Offs Involving Funding or Instruction Time for Arts Education Had to Be Made, the School Principal Made the Decision", "paragraphs": ["District officials and school principals told us that when they faced  decreased budgets or increased demands on instruction time, trade-offs  had to be made, and school principals made the decision. Principals\u2019  decisions differed, however. Some principals chose not to spend their  limited discretionary funds on arts education, while other principals, even  when their school had been identified as needing improvement several  times, maintained their arts offerings. For example, one school principal in  a Chicago elementary school chose to spend discretionary budget funds  on special reading and math programs needed to improve students\u2019  performance rather than supplement half the salary of a full-time arts  teacher. On the other hand, one Miami-Dade high school principal had  allocated Title I funds to help retain and rebuild the school\u2019s arts  education program as part of its NCLBA restructuring plan. New York City  officials said that a new accountability system the school district had  developed in part because of NCLBA, but also to evaluate progress toward  meeting city instructional requirements, increased the discretionary  authority vested in school principals. The district also developed an  accountability initiative called ArtsCount. For this initiative, district arts  officials developed measures to be incorporated in the district\u2019s evaluation  of school performance and the quality of arts offerings. This information  will be used to influence the scores that are incorporated into each school  principal\u2019s report card. For middle and high schools, the results are  incorporated into the measure of graduation requirements. Under the  accountability system and this initiative, school principals are given  greater authority to make trade-offs, such as the discretion to allocate  funds formerly restricted to expenditures for the arts to other subjects, but  the school district monitors the results of their decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Overall Research on the Association between Arts Education and Student Outcomes Is Inconclusive", "paragraphs": ["While some studies that have examined the association between arts  education and students\u2019 academic achievement have found a small  positive association with student outcomes, others have found none. One  meta-analysis that combined the results of several studies found small  positive relationships. This study included two separate analyses: one  that looked at the association between music instruction and math scores,  and another that looked at the association between listening to music and  math scores. The first analysis of six studies found that learning to play  music had a small positive relationship with both standardized and  researcher-designed achievement test scores in mathematics, regardless of  whether or not the child learned to read music. Music instruction in these  studies included both instrumental and vocal performance for durations of  at least 4 months and up to 2 years, and included children at the preschool  through elementary level. The second analysis, which included 15  studies, determined that there was a small positive relationship with math  test scores when children listened to certain types of music while  attempting to solve math problems. In contrast, another meta-analysis  found no association with students\u2019 achievement. This analysis, which  looked at 24 studies examining reading outcomes and 15 studies  examining math outcomes, found no association between arts education  and standardized reading or math test scores, regardless of the child\u2019s  background or academic history. The students included in the studies had  a wide range of academic abilities and came from a wide range of  backgrounds. For example, some of the studies included academically at- risk students and students from lower-income families, while some of the  studies included \u201cacademically gifted\u201d students and students from higher- income families. The studies also included children of a variety of ages and  several different types of arts instruction, including music, visual arts,  drama, and dance. Moreover, some research has focused on special  populations, such as students from low-income families; however, most of  these studies did not meet GAO\u2019s criteria for methodological quality, and  their findings are questionable.", "Similarly, studies that examined the association between arts education  and abilities associated with academic performance also were mixed. For  example, two of the three analyses from one meta-analysis looking at the  association between music education and certain spatial abilities found a  positive relationship. One analysis, which was made up of 15 studies, and  another that analyzed 8 studies, found that music education was  associated with student performance on a wide range of spatial tasks.  However, the third analysis, which included 5 studies, found no  association between music education and one measure of spatial  performance. In these studies, enhanced spatial performance referred to  the ability to mentally recognize and manipulate patterns that fall into a  certain logical order and are usually used in subjects such as music,  geometry, and engineering. An example of spatial ability in a music course  would be the ability to produce a piece of music based on memory alone,  anticipating mentally the changes needed to play a certain piece of music.

Among teachers reporting a decrease in instruction time for arts  education, our study identified a more likely reduction in time spent on  arts education at schools identified as needing improvement and those  with higher percentages of minority students. While school officials in our  site visit states told us that requirements established by the state and  school district to meet NCLBA proficiency standards placed competing  demands on instruction time for arts education, the reasons for the  differences in instruction time our statistical analysis identified are  difficult to establish nationally, given current limitations in Education\u2019s  NLS-NCLB longitudinal data.
