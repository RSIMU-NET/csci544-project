Two Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) grant programs provide funding to state and local law enforcement to facilitate their body armor purchases. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership (BVP) program offers 2-year grants on a reimbursable basis. The Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program provides 4-year grant money up front that can be used to fund body armor procurement along with other criminal justice activities. Since the BVP program\u0092s inception in 1999, it has reimbursed grantees about $247 million for their purchases of nearly 1 million vests. The JAG program has provided nearly $4 billion from fiscal years 2006 through 2011, but BJA does not know how much of this amount grantees have spent on body armor because it is not required to track expenditures for specific purposes. BJA reports that from fiscal years 2006 through 2011, 357 grantees intended to use JAG funds for ballistic-resistant vest procurement, but it does not track how many grantees intended to purchase stab-resistant vests. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) sponsors body armor research, establishes body armor performance standards, and oversees body armor testing for compliance.", "DOJ designed several internal controls to manage and coordinate BJA\u0092s and NIJ\u0092s body armor activities, but could take steps to strengthen them, consistent with standards for internal control. For example, the BVP program has not deobligated about $27 million in undisbursed funds from grant awards whose terms have ended. To strengthen fund management, DOJ could deobligate these funds for grants that have closed and, for example, apply the amounts to new awards or reduce requests for future budgets. Also, unlike the BVP program, the JAG program does not require that the body armor purchased be NIJ compliant or that officers be mandated to wear the armor purchased. To promote officer safety and harmonize the BVP and JAG programs, DOJ could establish consistent body armor requirements.", "Factors affecting body armor use and effectiveness include law enforcement agencies\u0092 policies mandating wear; the comfort, fit, and coverage of the vests; degradation caused by wear and tear; and exposure to environmental conditions. Among other efforts to address these factors, DOJ has revised its standards and compliance tests to incorporate the latest technology."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that among other actions, DOJ deobligate undisbursed funds from grants in the BVP program that have closed, establish consistent requirements within its body armor grant programs, and track grantees\u0092 intended stab-resistant vest purchases.

In 2010, the most recent year for  which complete data are available, the FBI reported that 56 law  enforcement officers were killed nationwide in violent encounters and that  all but one of these deaths was caused by a firearm. Preliminary data  collected by the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund show  that in 2011, 68 officers were killed by firearms. Body armor can help  protect officers from firearm assaults. A study conducted by a RAND  Corporation researcher found that officers who do not routinely wear body  armor are 3.4 times more likely to sustain a fatal injury from a torso shot  than officers who do. In addition, data collected in part by the  International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) indicate that body  armor has saved the lives of more than 3,000 law enforcement officers  since 1987. Recognizing body armor as an effective tool in helping to  protect law enforcement officers, the Department of Justice (DOJ)\u2014 through its Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and its National Institute of  Justice (NIJ)\u2014has implemented initiatives to promote and support state  and local law enforcement\u2019s use of body armor.

Of this amount, the program disbursed about $247 million to  grantees through reimbursements. The $93 million difference reflects  funds that BJA has awarded but for which grantees have not sought  reimbursement.

BJA first  awarded this money from fiscal years 2002 through 2009. The grant  terms for each of these grantees have ended and as a result,  grantees are no longer eligible for reimbursement. Thus, BJA could  deobligate funds from these grants that have closed.", "About $52 million in funds from awards whose terms have not yet  ended. BJA awarded the bulk of this money in either fiscal year 2010  or fiscal year 2011 so grantees can still submit payment requests and  the funds remain available for grantee reimbursement.", "In response to our audit work, BVP program officials told us that, as of  February 2012, they and their colleagues in the Office of the Chief  Financial Officer were in the process of examining the $27 million  available for possible deobligation and considering how to use it.  However, DOJ had not yet made a final decision on this matter before we  finalized this report, and officials stated that a decision likely would not be  made until September 2012. Once a grant\u2019s term has ended, a granting  agency typically closes out the grant and deobligates the funds. We have  previously reported that grant closeout is an important final point of  accountability for grantees, ensuring that they have met all program  requirements. Closing out grants also allows agencies to identify and  redirect funds to other projects and priorities or return the funding to the  Treasury. In the case of the BVP program, since Congress appropriates  its funds though no-year appropriations, DOJ does not have to return  deobligated BVP funds to the Treasury. Instead, it could enhance its  management of BVP funding through its grants closeout process by, for  example, redirecting any funds from closed grants to grantees in future  award cycles or reducing the amount it requests in new appropriations.  Given that the BVP program requested $30 million\u2014and received about  $23 million\u2014in fiscal year 2012, deobligating this $27 million could have  significant benefits.", "The BVP program lists its requirements, such as those related to  document retention and the prohibition on combining BVP and JAG  funds, in limited areas, thus increasing the risk that grantees will not be  aware of them. By expanding publicity of the program requirements, BJA  could reduce the risk of noncompliance and increase the efficiency of its  operations. Specifically, the BVP program requires that jurisdictions retain  documentation on all BVP transactions for at least 3 years and prohibits  the use of JAG funding to help pay for the portion of the grantees\u2019 costs  that the BVP program does not cover. Currently, these requirements are  only specifically cited in the \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d section of the  BVP program\u2019s website.

It was not within our scope  to independently verify their compliance or assess the extent to which all  BVP program grantees were aware of the documentation retention and  matching fund requirements. Nevertheless, the fact that all 10 of the  jurisdictions within our sample were unaware of the documentation  retention requirement and 4 jurisdictions were unaware of the prohibition  on combining BVP and JAG funds raises questions about the risks  associated with noncompliance, such as financial mismanagement.  Further, since the Office of the Chief Financial Officer has not yet begun  any on-site financial monitoring of BVP grantees, it will be difficult for BJA  to assess and mitigate these risks until the site visits are under way.

During these desk reviews, BJA officials told us that JAG  grant managers use a checklist to guide their monitoring and  acknowledged that this checklist did not contain specifics for monitoring  instances where BVP and JAG funding were combined. Officials said that  grant managers are trained to check for inappropriate accounting  practices no matter what program they are reviewing, but they did not  provide evidence of this guidance in the training curriculum and  acknowledged that a documented procedure to specifically check for the  combining of BVP and JAG funding was needed. They also  acknowledged that the cost of documenting this monitoring step would  not be prohibitive. Documenting grant managers\u2019 desk review procedures  for monitoring compliance with this requirement would be consistent with  standards for internal control in the federal government. In addition, such  documentation could help ensure consistency in grant managers\u2019  monitoring practices, which in turn could help BJA better ensure grantees\u2019  compliance with JAG program requirements.", "BJA also could strengthen its guidance to JAG grantees on the prohibition  against combining BVP and JAG funds to purchase body armor. BJA  officials acknowledged that, as with the BVP program, the current  \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d section of the JAG program\u2019s website is  the only place that grantees can learn of the program requirement that  JAG funds not be used as matching funds for the BVP program.  Currently, the prohibition is not contained in the JAG program grant  solicitation or within the Grants Management System (GMS). BJA officials  recognized the importance of grantees\u2019 compliance with the prohibition on  combining JAG and BVP funds and explained two additional controls they  are planning to implement to enhance the information they provide to  grantees on this topic, partly in response to our audit work. First, they  have drafted a new section of the \u201cFrequently Asked Questions\u201d  document that they plan to post on their website, pending final review, to  better inform grantees of the prohibition on using JAG funds as matching  funds for the BVP program. Second, they drafted a \u201cspecial condition\u201d  that describes the prohibition on combining BVP and JAG funding that  they plan to include in the JAG grant agreement, once this condition has  been approved. The special condition will require prospective grantees  to certify that they will not use JAG funds to match their BVP funds or  combine JAG and BVP funds to purchase the same vests. The officials  told us they expected to include these documents in the fiscal year 2012  grant cycle, which they thought would be announced in March 2012.  Improved dissemination of this requirement could help ensure conformity  with internal control standards and leading grant management practices.", "BJA has limited visibility over which JAG grantees are using their awards  for body armor purchases. BJA could enhance its tracking to know which  grantees used the JAG funds for this purpose and, as a result, be better  informed and better positioned to target its monitoring for compliance with  existing body armor requirements and any new ones the JAG program  might add, consistent with standards for internal control. Currently, BJA  uses the online Grants Management System (GMS) to track JAG  spending across more than 150 specific categories\u2014each associated  with a \u201cproject identifier.\u201d BJA officials explained that since fiscal year  2011, they have required potential grantees to select up to five identifiers  that reflect the significant ways in which they planned to use their JAG  funds. If the applicants do not select any identifiers, or if JAG grant  managers believe different identifiers are more appropriate, the grant  managers can select as many identifiers as they deem appropriate and  enter them directly into GMS. Although \u201cbulletproof vest\u201d is among the  project identifiers, no project identifier exists that could be used for stab- resistant vests.", "Officials told us that in response to our audit work, they would consider  adding an identifier for \u201cstab-resistant\u201d vests in the future. However, BJA  had not made a decision on this matter before we finalized our report.  Although BJA officials acknowledge that project identifiers have  limitations when used to track spending, they noted that enhancing GMS  with mechanisms more precise than the identifiers would take a  significant financial investment. Thus, they agree that maximizing the  utility of the existing project identifier system\u2014by adding another vest  category\u2014would be a low-cost way of better understanding JAG  spending on body armor in the meantime."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIJ Has Designed Mechanisms to Coordinate and Control Its Body Armor Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NIJ\u2019s Coordination of Body Armor Research and Standards Development", "paragraphs": ["In addition to body armor research that NIJ funds through cooperative  agreements with universities and research institutions, NIJ also has a  collaborative body armor research effort with NIST. Under an interagency  agreement, NIJ and NIST negotiate an annual fiscal year program plan  and statement of work for NIST to provide technical and research  services to support NIJ\u2019s standards and compliance testing programs,  including test laboratory accreditation. We have previously reported that  establishing agency plans, such as the NIST program plan, is a key  collaboration practice that can reinforce agency accountability and ensure  that goals are consistent and mutually reinforcing. For example,  selected fiscal year 2011 NIST projects to support NIJ body armor efforts  included  research of the links between mechanical damage (e.g., stitching,  bending, folding, or stretching) of common body armor materials and  ballistic performance to determine how well the test protocol in the  current ballistic-resistant body armor standard simulates real-life  mechanical wear and proficiency testing to understand how different body armor test  laboratories compare with each other and support enhancements to  the laboratory accreditation program.", "NIJ has also designed mechanisms to leverage and share information on  body armor with DOD and federal, state, and local law enforcement  practitioners. For example, NIJ participates in DOD\u2019s interagency  Combating Terrorism Technical Support Office\u2019s TSWG, which conducts  research and development to identify and address the needs of federal,  state, and local organizations that have responsibilities to prevent and  respond to terrorism. TSWG has a personnel protection subgroup that  focuses on developing techniques that improve the performance of body  armor by reducing weight and optimizing material performance, among  other things. NIJ participates in this subgroup joining NIST, the U.S.  Secret Service, and the Department of Energy, among others. Currently,  TSWG is leveraging resources and expertise from across participating  agencies to conduct research on body armor technology to reduce blunt  trauma and optimize the design of multithreat body armor worn beneath  an officer\u2019s uniform, as well as similarly worn lightweight armor, among  other things.", "In addition, NIJ has established the Law Enforcement and Corrections  Technology Advisory Council and the Body Armor Technology Working  Group, which consist of federal, state, and local law enforcement  practitioners, to identify the body armor needs of and solicit opinions from  the law enforcement community. NIJ and NIST take the practitioners\u2019  input into account when developing the annual body armor research  program plan. For example, the fiscal year 2010 program plan called for  NIST to convene a workshop to evaluate the test methods for hard body  armor in response to concerns raised by the Body Armor Technology  Working Group. Finally, NIJ holds public conferences and workshops  where the results of body armor research conducted by NIJ, DOD, NIST,  and others are presented. These coordination mechanisms help NIJ  leverage resources to identify and address body armor needs, consistent  with key practices to help enhance and sustain collaboration among  federal agencies.", "Another way that NIJ coordinates with stakeholders in the body armor  arena is through its new process to update its standards, which we  described in an earlier section of this report. All six of the body armor  manufacturers and both of the ballistic-resistant and stab-resistant  materials manufacturers we met with expressed concerns that the new  standards revision process would not afford them sufficient opportunities  to provide input. However, according to NIJ officials, any interested party,  including manufacturers, may participate in the process to develop the  standards by providing input at public workshops or providing comments  on the draft document. Given that this new standards revision process  was still under way during the production of our report, it was too soon to  tell how effective the process will be in leveraging stakeholders\u2019  knowledge and meeting globally accepted principles for stakeholder  involvement in standards development, such as openness, due process,  and transparency.", "NIJ requires that body armor models being tested for NIJ compliance be  examined at a laboratory that NIJ has approved. To obtain such approval,  a laboratory must be accredited by NIST\u2019s National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation  Program as meeting general international standards for laboratory  technical competence and quality management, as well as meeting  specific technical requirements to perform the body armor tests  contained in the NIJ standards; be an independent, third-party laboratory and conduct all body armor  compliance testing within the United States; and demonstrate its freedom from potential conflicts of interest and  maintain an independent decisional relationship from its clients,  affiliates, contractors, and other organizations.", "In addition to undergoing laboratory ballistic or stab-resistance testing, the  body armor models must meet workmanship and labeling requirements.", "To ensure the integrity of the compliance testing results, laboratories  send the test results directly to NLECTC, whose staff review the test  results for compliance. NIJ then reviews the compliance test data and  NLECTC\u2019s recommendation and makes the final compliance decision.  Figure 5 illustrates this process.", "To further enhance the compliance testing program and ensure that the  body armor used by law enforcement and corrections officers is safe and  reliable, NIJ has implemented a follow-up inspection and testing  requirement. Under this requirement, each body armor manufacturer with  an NIJ-compliant ballistic-resistant body armor model is subject to six  follow-up inspections and testing over a 60-month period, consisting of  inspections of recently manufactured body armor samples to  determine if the body armor in production continues to be constructed  in the same way as the samples that were submitted for compliance  testing and ballistic testing to ensure that unnoticed or unintentional variations  have not occurred during the manufacturing process that could affect  the performance of the armor.", "Currently, only NIJ-compliant ballistic-resistant body armor is subject to  follow-up inspection and testing, but NIJ plans to implement a follow-up  inspection and testing requirement for NIJ-compliant stab-resistant body  armor following the issuance of the new stab-resistant body armor  standard in December of 2012.", "NIJ is taking steps to increase the uniformity of compliance testing  procedures to address factors that may affect the outcome of ballistic or  stab compliance testing. Officials we met with from all six of the body  armor manufacturers expressed concerns that the results of the  compliance tests may be affected by factors not controlled for in the  standards\u2019 testing protocols. For example, three manufacturers said that  they believe that variations in the clay that body armor is mounted to  during ballistic testing could affect test results. NIJ has provided funding  to NIST to conduct research to develop guidelines to standardize the  process for building the clay-filled backing material fixtures used in  ballistic testing to improve the repeatability of tests. NIJ expects to  incorporate the results of this research in the update of the ballistic- resistant body armor standard. In addition, five of the six manufacturers  raised concerns about the treatment of female body armor, and cited the  lack of a clear definition that describes what constitutes female body  armor and the lack of specific detailed protocols for testing female body  armor. NIJ has recognized this as a challenge for the compliance testing  program and has provided funding to NIST to conduct research to  develop standard definitions of body armor types and standardized test  methods for assessing the performance of contoured body armor  designs. NIJ expects to incorporate the results of this research in the  update of both the stab- and ballistic-resistant body armor standards.  Additionally, NIST officials told us that they were working with NIJ to  develop proficiency testing protocols to compare testing results across  NIJ-approved laboratories as part of NIST\u2019s effort to meet international  standards for this type of compliance testing within the next 3 years."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOJ Has Taken Steps to Address Factors That Affect the Use and Effectiveness of Body Armor", "paragraphs": ["Body armor\u2019s ability to protect an officer during a critical incident depends  upon 1) whether the officer is wearing body armor and 2) the level of  performance and the effectiveness of the armor he or she is wearing.

Comfort, fit, and coverage affect both the  use and effectiveness of body armor. For example, body armor can  create discomfort for an officer through reduced mobility, increased  weight, heat buildup under the armor, and chafing\u2014thereby causing him  or her to discontinue its use. Officials from one law enforcement  association noted that complaints about body armor heat buildup are not  restricted to officers in hot climates, such as Arizona, and that officers in  temperate climates, such as Washington State also report experiencing  discomfort from heat. In addition, if the body armor is poorly fitting, it can  create both discomfort and affect total coverage area. Body armor that  extends too low in the front can cause discomfort by hitting the officer\u2019s  gun belt which can cause the vest to ride up toward the officer\u2019s throat or  pinch the skin of the abdomen between the gun belt and the armor. Body  armor that is not wide enough can leave portions of the officer\u2019s sides  unprotected. One manufacturer explained that if body armor does not fit  properly, it can develop set wrinkles that become weak spots in the armor  and reduce its protection.", "Designing comfortable, well-fitting body armor for female officers is  particularly a challenge, according to the six body armor manufacturers in  our sample. One manufacturer explained that constructing formfitting bust  cups requires additional stitching that can weaken the ballistic materials,  and as a result, more layers of ballistic materials may be needed to  compensate, making the vests thicker and less comfortable. Many  manufacturers, including all six in our sample, will custom fit body armor  to the specific body contours of individual officers.", "DOJ\u2019s activities to address comfort, fit, and coverage include NIJ taking  the following actions:  Issuing guidance that advises agencies to take comfort into account  when selecting body armor and provides information on design  elements that can affect comfort.
