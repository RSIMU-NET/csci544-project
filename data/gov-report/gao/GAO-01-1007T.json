The need is a reflection of the times: Our society has transitioned from the industrial age to the knowledge age, and people are the source of all knowledge. Every organization today depends on its people to contribute knowledge, create knowledge, and put knowledge to practical use. Federal agencies are no different. For these organizations, having sufficient numbers of people on board with the right mix of knowledge and skills will make the difference between success and failure.

First, people are assets whose value can be enhanced through investment. As the value of people increases, so does the performance capacity of the organization and therefore its value to clients and other stakeholders. As with any investment, the goal is to maximize value while managing risk. Second, an organization\u2019s human capital approaches must be aligned to support the mission, vision for the future, core values, goals and objectives, and strategies by which the organization has defined its direction and its expectations for itself and its people.

After a decade of government downsizing and curtailed investments in people, it is becoming increasingly clear that today\u2019s federal human capital strategies are not appropriately constituted to meet the current and emerging needs of the nation\u2019s government and its citizens. The federal government\u2019s approach to people management includes a range of outmoded attitudes, policies, and practices that warrant serious and sustained attention. To view federal employees as costs to be cut rather than as assets to be valued would be to take a narrow and shortsighted view\u2014one that is obsolete and must be changed.", "Ever since we added strategic human capital management to our high-risk list, we have been asked what would need to happen for it to be removed. Clearly, we will need to see measurable and sustainable improvements in the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness with which the government as a whole and the individual agencies manage their workforces to achieve their missions and goals. I believe that congressional hearings such as today\u2019s demonstrate that the momentum for these improvements is building, but the process will undoubtedly take time.", "Clearly, there is very little time to waste. Changes in the demographics of the federal workforce, in the education and skills required of its workers, and in employment structures and arrangements are all continuing to unfold. The federal workforce is aging; the baby boomers, with their valuable skills and experience, are drawing nearer to retirement; new employees joining the federal workforce today have different employment options and different career expectations from the generation that preceded them. In response to an increasingly competitive job market, federal agencies will need the tools and flexibilities to attract, retain, and motivate top-flight talent. More and more, the work that federal agencies do requires a knowledge-based workforce that is sophisticated in new technologies, flexible, and open to continuous learning. This workforce must be adept both at delivering services directly and at effectively managing the cost and quality of services delivered by third parties on the government\u2019s behalf. Agencies\u2019 employment structures and working arrangements will also be changing, and the workplace will need to accommodate a greater mix of full-time, part-time, and temporary workers; more contracting-out; less job security; and the possibilities of additional government downsizing and realignments. elements such as hiring, staffing, compensation, promotions, training and development, and performance management all need to be aligned with organizational missions and goals, and must be approached as interrelated parts of a coherent human capital management strategy. Other elements must also be considered. In the information area in particular, other key elements will include sourcing, contract oversight, knowledge management, and systems development. Overall, and in critical occupational areas, agencies can and must take the initiative to be more competitive in attracting new employees with needed skills; design and implement modern, effective and credible performance evaluation systems; create the kinds of performance incentives and training programs that motivate and empower employees; and build labor-management relationships that are based on common interests and the public trust. To shape human capital strategies that support their specific needs and circumstances, agencies must give strategic human capital management the enhanced and sustained attention it deserves, modernize their existing human capital policies and practices, and identify and make use of the tools and flexibilities available to them under current law.", "To address the federal government\u2019s human capital challenges as a whole, we believe a three-stage approach is appropriate. First, agencies must take all administrative steps available to them under current laws and regulations to manage their people for results. Much of what agencies need to accomplish by way of focusing on human capital management is already available to them. They will, however, need the sustained commitment from top management and the support from both the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to make the most of their existing authorities. Second, the Administration and the Congress should pursue selected legislative opportunities to put new tools and flexibilities in place that will help agencies attract, retain, and motivate employees\u2014both overall and, especially, in connection with critical occupations such as those in IT. Third, all interested parties should work together to determine the nature and extent of more comprehensive human capital (or civil service) reforms that should be enacted over time. These reforms should include greater emphasis on skills, knowledge, and performance in connection with federal employment and compensation decisions, rather than the passage of time and rate of inflation, as is often the case today.", "Mr. Chairman, as is clear from the array of witnesses you have gathered for today\u2019s hearing, addressing the federal government\u2019s human capital challenges is a responsibility shared by many parties. This includes the President, department and agency leaders, OMB, OPM, the Congress, the private sector, foundations and academia, and even the press. (See attachment III). As I have noted elsewhere, strategic human capital management has yet to find the broad conceptual acceptance or political consensus needed for comprehensive legislative reform to occur. In this sense, human capital remains the missing link in the framework of federal management reforms enacted by the Congress over the past decade\u2014 reforms that addressed such essential elements of high performing organizations as financial management, information technology management, and results-oriented goal-setting and performance measurement. However, I believe that the day is approaching when we will see comprehensive federal human capital legislative reform. The essential ingredients for progress in this area are leadership, vision, commitment, persistence, communications, and accountability.", "Notably, OPM and OMB have taken steps in the past year to help raise awareness of the federal government\u2019s human capital challenges and to encourage and enable agencies to make progress in this area. For example, OPM has begun stressing to agencies the importance of integrating strategic human capital management with agency planning and has also been focusing more attention on developing tools to help agencies, such as new Senior Executive Service performance standards and a workforce planning model with associated Web-based research tools. Some of OPM\u2019s efforts have been directed specifically at addressing human capital challenges in the information technology area. For example, in January 2001, OPM created a new special-rate authority to boost the pay of approximately 33,000 current federal information technology workers covered by the General Schedule (GS) at grades GS-5, 7, 9, 11, and 12. Both current and new federal employees are covered by the new pay rates. Further, OPM has issued a new \u201cjob family\u201d classification standard for IT- related positions that revises and updates the previous standard and incorporates many formerly separate IT-related occupations into one. The new special pay rates and classification standard are intended to give agencies more flexibility in their IT-related recruiting and retention efforts. key elements of the President\u2019s Management and Performance Plan, along with budget and performance integration, expand competitive sourcing, improving financial performance, and expanding e-government.", "OMB\u2019s current guidance to agencies on preparing their strategic and annual performance plans states that the plans should set goals in such areas as recruitment, retention, and training, among others. Further, early this year, OMB instructed agencies to submit a workforce analysis by June 29, 2001. Each agency\u2019s analysis was to include summary information on the demographics of the agency\u2019s permanent, seasonal, and temporary workforce; projected attrition and retirements; an evaluation of workforce skills; expected changes in the agency\u2019s work; recruitment, training, and retention strategies being implemented; and barriers to maintaining a high- quality and diverse workforce.

For example, many countries have undertaken knowledge management initiatives, including training of staff and collecting IT-related information in databases.

In particular, agencies are not clearly defining their requirements, fully considering alternative solutions, performing vigorous price analyses, or adequately overseeing contractor performance. Further, it is becoming increasingly evident that agencies are at risk of not having enough of the right people with the right skills to manage service procurements. Consequently, a key question we face in the federal government is whether we have today, or will have tomorrow, the ability to acquire and manage the procurement of increasingly sophisticated services the government needs.", "The amount being spent on services is growing substantially. Last year alone, the federal government acquired more than $87 billion in services\u2014 a 24-percent increase in real terms from fiscal year 1990. In fact, government purchase of services now accounts for 43 percent of all federal contracting expenses\u2014surpassing supplies and equipment as the largest component of federal contract spending. Another dimension to this issue is that federal agencies are increasingly contracting out for information technology services.", "The growth in service contracting has largely been driven by the government\u2019s increased purchases of two types of services: information technology services, which increased from $3.7 billion in fiscal year 1990 to about $13.4 billion in fiscal year 2000, and   professional, administrative, and management support services, which rose from $12.3 billion in fiscal year 1990 to $21.1 billion in fiscal year 2000.", "The increase in the use of service contracts coincided with a 21-percent decrease in the federal workforce, which fell from about 2.25 million employees as of September 1990 to 1.78 million employees as of September 2000.", "As federal spending and employment patterns were changing, changes were also occurring in the way that federal agencies buy services. Specifically, there has been a trend toward agencies purchasing professional services using contracts awarded and managed by other agencies. For example, in 1996, the General Services Administration (GSA) began offering information technology services under its Federal Supply Schedule program, and it now offers services ranging from professional engineering to laboratory testing and analysis to temporary clerical and professional support services. The use of the schedule program to acquire services has increased significantly over the past several years.", "Other governmentwide contracts have also come into use in recent years. The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 authorized federal agencies to enter into multiple-award, task- and delivery-order contracts for goods and services. These contracts provide agencies with a great deal of flexibility in buying goods or services while minimizing the burden on government contracting personnel to negotiate and administer contracts. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 authorized the use of multiagency contracts and what have become known as governmentwide agency contracts to facilitate purchases of information technology-related products and services such as network maintenance and technical support, systems engineering, and integration services.", "While we have seen the environment change considerably, what we have not seen is a significant improvement in federal agencies\u2019 management of service contracts. Simply stated, the poor management of service contracts undermines the government\u2019s ability to obtain good value for the money spent. This contributed to our decision to designate contract management a high-risk area for the Departments of Defense and Energy, the two largest purchasers within the federal government. Improving contract management is also among the management challenges faced by other agencies.", "Compounding these problems are the agencies\u2019 past inattention to strategic human capital management. As I noted earlier, we are concerned that federal agencies\u2019 human capital problems are eroding the ability of many agencies\u2014and threatening the ability of others\u2014to perform their missions economically, efficiently, and effectively. For example, we found that the initial rounds of downsizing were set in motion without considering the longer-term effects on agencies\u2019 performance capacity. Additionally, a number of individual agencies drastically reduced or froze their hiring efforts for extended periods. Consequently, following a decade of downsizing and curtailed investments in human capital, federal agencies currently face skills, knowledge, and experience imbalances that, without corrective action, will worsen, especially in light of the numbers of federal civilian workers becoming eligible to retire in the coming years. not oriented toward shaping the makeup of the force. Rather, DOD relied primarily on voluntary turnover and retirements, freezes on hiring authority, and its authority to offer early retirements and \u201cbuy-outs\u201d to achieve reductions. While DOD had these kinds of tools available to manage its civilian downsizing and to mitigate the adverse effects of force reductions, its approach to civilian force reductions was not really oriented toward shaping the workforce for the future. In contrast, DOD did a much better job managing active-duty military force reductions because it followed a policy of trying to achieve and maintain a degree of balance between its accessions and losses in order to shape its forces with regard to rank, specialties, and years of service. As a result, DOD\u2019s current civilian workforce is not balanced and therefore poses risks to the orderly transfer of institutional knowledge. According to DOD\u2019s Acquisition 2005 Task Force, \u201cAfter 11 consecutive years of downsizing, we  face serious imbalances in the skills and experience of our highly talented and specialized civilian workforce,\u201d putting DOD on the verge of a retirement-driven talent drain.", "DOD\u2019s leadership had anticipated that using streamlined acquisition procedures would improve the efficiency of contracting operations and help offset the effects of workforce downsizing. However, the DOD Inspector General reported that the efficiency gains from using streamlined procedures had not kept pace with acquisition workforce reductions. The Inspector General reported that while the workforce had been reduced by half, DOD\u2019s contracting workload had increased by about 12 percent and that senior personnel at 14 acquisition organizations believed that workforce reductions had led to problems such as less contractor oversight.", "OPM shows that while DOD downsized its workforce to a greater extent than the other agencies during the 1990s, both DOD and the other agencies will have about 27 percent of their current contracting officers eligible to retire through the end of fiscal year 2005. Consequently, without appropriate workforce planning, federal agencies could lose a significant portion of their contracting knowledge base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contact and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For further information regarding this testimony, please contact Victor S.
