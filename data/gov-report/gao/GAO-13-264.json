These improvements focus on establishing Performance Based Navigation (PBN) procedures at key airports, but benefits could be limited in the midterm. PBN uses satellite-based guidance to improve air-traffic control routes (known as \"procedures\"). These procedures can deliver benefits to airlines, such as fuel savings and increased efficiency, particularly in congested airspace. To deliver benefits more quickly, FAA made trade-offs in selecting sites and in the scope of proposed improvements. For example, FAA is not implementing procedures that will trigger lengthy environmental reviews. These trade-offs, with which airlines and other stakeholders generally agree, will likely limit benefits from these PBN initiatives early in the midterm. FAA has also made some progress in other key operational improvement areas, such as upgrading traffic management systems and revising standards to improve aircraft flow in congested airspace. However, FAA has not fully integrated implementation of all of its operational improvement efforts at airports. Because of the interdependency of improvements, their limited integration could also limit benefits in the midterm.", "FAA has efforts under way to help overcome overarching obstacles to NextGen implementation identified by an advisory task force, but challenges remain, and many of these efforts are scheduled to take a number of years. FAA efforts include, for example, a new process for focused and concise environmental reviews for some proposed actions (e.g., new procedures), where a detailed analysis of the environmental impacts is limited to only those categories involving potentially significant impacts, such as increased noise or emissions. Some of these efforts do not, however, fully address previously identified obstacles. FAA has not fully addressed obstacles to selecting new PBN procedures that will best relieve congestion and improve efficiency, for example. FAA continues to rely on requests for new procedures from airlines and other stakeholders. This reliance may or may not result in procedures that maximize benefits to the national airspace system. Not addressing remaining challenges could delay NextGen implementation and limit potential benefits.", "FAA has made progress in developing NextGen performance metrics, but according to key stakeholders, FAA currently provides limited data to demonstrate its progress in implementing midterm improvements and the associated benefits. FAA is in the process of harmonizing performance metrics across all agency programs to ensure that metrics align with agency targets and goals. However, information is incomplete on the midterm improvements and their benefits at selected airports, and airlines and others lack access to needed information to make fully informed investment decisions. FAA has developed a website to report on NextGen implementation, but published information is not fully tied to FAA's implementation goals. FAA's plans also provide limited information about future implementation, such as locations and expected benefits. Better performance and planning information would provide airlines with a stronger basis for making decisions to invest an estimated $6.6 billion on NextGen technology through 2018."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FAA should, among other things, better integrate NextGen efforts; develop processes for selecting new PBN procedures; and ensure that stakeholders have needed information on NextGen progress to facilitate investment decisions.

NextGen is intended  to enhance airspace safety, reduce delays experienced by airlines and  passengers, save fuel, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions and other  adverse environmental impacts. NextGen improvements are projected to  keep airport delays from getting worse than would be expected without  implementation of the improvements. By 2020, the agency estimates that  NextGen improvements, if implemented, could result in a cumulative  reduction in fuel consumption of 1.46-billion gallons and a cumulative  reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 16-million metric tons. FAA  estimates that these benefits, combined with a projected 41 percent  reduction in aircraft delays, will generate $38 billion in savings through  2020 for aircraft operators, the traveling public, and FAA, as compared  with a scenario where no further NextGen improvements were made.  However FAA does not expect that NextGen improvements alone will be  sufficient to meet the capacity needs of certain busy, complex airports in   FAA\u2019s modeling indicates that even  the national airspace system (NAS).if all ongoing and planned NextGen technologies are implemented, some  of the busiest airports may not be able to meet the projected increases in  demand and will need additional capacity, which may require the  construction of new runways or other infrastructure improvements. FAA  believes that ongoing runway development programs are still needed at  airports such as Chicago-O'Hare and Philadelphia International to meet  long-term demand. NextGen improvements will complement these  runway programs. Full implementation of NextGen will necessitate  investment by airlines and others in new technologies. Airlines and other  stakeholders, however, have expressed skepticism about the progress  made to date by FAA, which, in turn, has affected their confidence about  whether benefits will justify these investments.

If OAPM proceeds as planned, FAA expects to  begin to demonstrate benefits at the eight sites that are currently active  by the end of 2015. (See fig. 4.) Projects at five additional sites are  expected to be fully operational before the end of 2017, according to  current FAA plans. With the exception of the Houston project, each  OAPM project has about a 3-year implementation time frame, which  includes 12 to 18 months for the environment assessment process.", "OAPM focuses primarily on implementing PBN procedures\u2014long viewed  as a cornerstone of NextGen\u2014and any necessary airspace redesign for  deployment of the new procedures.foundation for flight paths, airspace design, route separation, and  obstacle clearance.

Potential PBN benefits include shorter, more direct flight paths, reduced  aircraft fuel burned\u2014and resulting reductions in carbon dioxide  emissions\u2014and reduced noise in surrounding communities. The following  are the key types of PBN procedures.", "RNAV procedures, which are enabled by technology available on  nearly all commercial aircraft in the United States, provide aircraft with  routing flexibility and more efficient flight paths than conventional  procedures, and can allow improved access to airports in congested  airspace or in bad weather. In 2011, 96 percent of the domestic commercial fleet was equipped for RNAV. As of January 10, 2013,  there were over 12,500 public RNAV procedures available for all  aircraft capable of flying them.", "RNP procedures (a subset of RNAV) add additional onboard-aircraft  performance monitoring and alerting and require additional equipment  as well as specialized crew training. In some cases, RNP can  increase aircraft access to airports in adverse weather and terrain and  help air traffic controllers keep aircraft operations at one airport from  interfering with aircraft operations at adjacent airports by using curved  flight paths. As mentioned above, in 2012, approximately 50 percent  of the domestic commercial fleet was equipped for RNP. As of  January 10, 2013, 352 public RNP procedures are included on charts  for pilots.", "Optimized Profile Descent (OPD) procedures allow aircraft to descend  from cruise altitude to final approach more efficiently, eliminating or  reducing the level offs or step downs of a traditional descent. Low or  idle engine power settings save fuel and reduce emissions. OPD  procedures also require less dialogue between air traffic controllers  and pilots, which may improve safety by reducing the potential for  miscommunications.", "According to reports by teams planning OAPM implementation, OAPM\u2019s  benefits for airspace users will stem mostly from implementing OPD  procedures enabled through the use of RNAV and the resulting  reductions to fuel use and associated fuel costs. (See fig. 6.) For  example, FAA projected that shorter routes and OPDs at its eight active  sites could save at least 29-million gallons of fuel and reduce carbon  dioxide emissions by 299,000 metric tons annually when fully  implemented. In turn, improved efficiency and predictability at key  metroplexes is expected to improve the efficiency of the NAS. FAA  estimated total annual benefits resulting from new OAPM procedures and  associated airspace changes using aircraft simulators. As previously  mentioned, all eight active sites are predicted to begin demonstrating  benefits in the 2013 through 2015 time frame.", "To achieve the time frames of its OAPM initiative, FAA has made trade- offs, which are summarized below, between procedures that yield some  benefits and can be implemented relatively quickly and those that could  result in greater benefits but would take much longer to implement.", "Excluded new procedures that would require route changes below  3,000 feet AGL or very close in to the airport. Although all new flight  procedures require NEPA review, those deemed to have  extraordinary circumstances such as significant environmental  impacts\u2014including a significant increase in noise or emissions around  an airport\u2014would require a full environmental impact statement,  which can take several years to complete. By excluding changes  closer to the airport, FAA is seeking to avoid the lengthy  environmental reviews that have delayed the implementation of some  other FAA efforts. For example, we previously reported that FAA\u2019s  airspace redesign effort in the New York, New Jersey, and  Philadelphia area has provoked significant community opposition,  including legal challenges to the environmental review process used  by FAA. That effort, which began in 1998, is currently scheduled for  completion in 2016. Representatives from airlines, equipment  manufacturers, and industry associations that we spoke with  acknowledged that there could be additional efficiency benefits from  new PBN procedures closer to the airport. For example, new  procedures that would allow for tight turns for the arrival into the  airport can reduce flight times and associated fuel use and costs and  facilitate the flow of air traffic flying into or out of different airports in a  metroplex, as well as increasing predictability of flight schedules.  Nonetheless, most of these stakeholders did not believe that these  potential additional benefits warranted the longer project timeframes  that would be necessary to complete more detailed environmental  reviews.", "Excluded new procedures that would require new design criteria. FAA  officials explained that having to wait for new design criteria for  procedures could jeopardize the OAPM time frames. Outside of the  OAPM initiative, FAA acknowledged that its staff had at times initiated  work on a requested PBN procedure only to discover that the design  criteria\u2014which ensure the safety of procedures\u2014do not yet exist for  the desired procedure. FAA officials stated that new design criteria  would be needed to more widely deploy PBN procedures, but that  effort is being undertaken independently of the OAPM initiative.", "Excluded sites with ongoing airspace redesign projects. Concerns  about potential implementation delays also factored into FAA\u2019s  decision about which metroplexes to address in the midterm. Some  industry stakeholders have voiced concerns that FAA did not include  in its current OAPM plans the New York/Philadelphia metroplex,  which is the nation\u2019s most congested airspace and contributes to over  half of domestic flight delays. However, FAA decided to exclude that  metroplex in light of the Record of Decision for the existing  environmental reviews for FAA\u2019s ongoing airspace redesign work for  that area, because the agency did not want to initiate a new  environmental review process.", "In addition to the OAPM initiative, FAA has other PBN initiatives that aim  to deliver midterm benefits in less congested areas.

FAA estimates that the new Greener Skies procedures would  reduce annual fuel consumption by 112,420 barrels annually, resulting in  potential annual savings of $13.5 million. To facilitate implementation of  the project, a number of potentially beneficial procedures were scoped  out of the Greener Skies effort based on local concerns. For example,  FAA officials and other Greener Skies participants stated that new  procedures to the east of the airport were not included because of known  community concerns about new aviation noise in those areas and to  avoid any changes that could violate noise commitments made in a  recent Record of Decision. In addition to Greener Skies, FAA also has  non-OAPM PBN efforts in place in Denver and Minneapolis.", "According to analysis done by Alaska Airlines, of the 27 RNP charts that are carried by  the airline\u2019s flight crews, 5 of the routes in Alaska were flown more than 40 percent of the  time, while at least 11 of the routes in the lower 48 states were flown less than 1 percent  of the time. number of times by air traffic controllers. Southwest Airlines has  expressed similar concerns about not being able to obtain projected  benefits of new PBN procedures. For example, in 2011 the airline  reported that its usage of RNP procedures had dropped, in part, because  approval to use existing procedures was often not granted by air traffic  controllers. Some controllers told us that using new PBN procedures  can be difficult for a number of reasons, including a lack of guidance and  tools, which will be further discussed later in this report. Finally, in some  cases, pilots prefer to fly traditional routes\u2014particularly if the PBN route is  longer or less efficient than a shortcut that may be approved by an air  traffic controller on a traditional procedure when conditions allow it.  According to FAA officials, when conditions do not allow for such  shortcuts, pilots can use the PBN procedures.", "FAA does not currently have a system to track the use of PBN  procedures, and is unable to provide information on the extent to which  existing procedures are either unused or are used on a limited basis.  There are currently no automatic data collection systems to track the use  of procedures, either on the aircraft flying the routes or at the air-traffic  control facilities managing those aircraft. FAA officials stated that current  efforts to track the use of procedures through pilot reporting have been  hindered by insufficient and unreliable data. Without a way to  systematically measure the use of particular procedures, the agency may  not recognize routes that need to be revised to ensure that airlines are  able to get expected benefits such as reduced fuel use or improved  access in bad weather.

TMA can enhance the effectiveness of new PBN  procedures, particularly when controllers are mixing traffic using different  types of procedures and aircraft with different levels of equipment (e.g.,  RNP equipped mixed with non-RNP equipped aircraft). For example,  controllers can better merge aircraft on conventional, straight flight paths  with those on PBN curved approaches and obtain a clearer picture of  traffic on the ground and in terminal airspace when TMA is used with  surface management tools (see fig. 7). Currently, TMA is primarily used  for arrival sequencing by certain air-traffic control facilities at times when  the demand for arrivals exceeds the capacity of a specific airspace or  airport.

Likewise, an FAA report  described the existing process as a bundle of interconnected,  overlapping, and sometimes competing processes. It also found  variations and contradictions in existing guidance on procedure  development and implementation, which result in a process that is \u201cfar  from optimal, frequently generates rework, and on occasion results in the  implementation of low- or no-benefit procedures.\u201d To address these  challenges, FAA initiated the Navigation Lean (NAV Lean) initiative to  focus on streamlining the implementation and amendment processes for  all flight procedures, releasing a report with planned improvements in  2010. FAA anticipates that the initiative will cumulatively cut 40 percent  off the time needed to implement new procedures (assuming a full  environmental impact statement is not required), though it acknowledged  that it will be difficult to measure actual time saved. ATO and the Office of  Aviation Safety share responsibility for overseeing the initiative, which  began with the identification of overarching issues that negatively affect  procedure implementation efficiency. The NAV Lean working groups  identified nine issue areas with 21 associated recommendations, which  focus, among other things, on minimizing the workload and delayed  implementation associated with minor amendments of procedures,  amending agency guidance to clarify and promote preparation of focused  environmental assessments, and overcoming challenges to the  development and implementation of criteria for flight procedures.

Lengthy environmental reviews have  been identified as an obstacle to the timely implementation of PBN by  FAA and others. Environmental considerations were frequently not  addressed until late in the procedure development process. The NAV  Lean working group found that previous FAA guidance on the preparation  of environmental assessments did not adequately address circumstances  where the environment analysis could be more narrowly focused on only  certain potential environmental impacts. In those circumstances, FAA  offices should be preparing environmental assessments that consider all  impact categories for applicability and significance, but focus the analysis  only on the impact categories (e.g., noise) where there is potential for  significant impacts caused by the proposed action (i.e., procedures). FAA  anticipates that for small, non-OAPM projects involving one airport,  \u201cfocused\u201d environmental assessments could potentially take from 3 to 6  months, with a cost of $300,000 or less. For more complex OAPM  projects\u2014involving multiple airports and the assessment of numerous  new flight procedures\u2014focused environmental assessments generally will  have 12- to 18-month time frames.

OAPM was  designed, in part, to fill this void, but for airspace or airports that are not  included in the initiative, FAA depends on stakeholders to initiate  requests. Once requests are made, however, they are added to the  procedure-development queue, and are not assessed against other PBN  procedures in the queue to determine their respective potential to benefit  the NAS or to resolve problems at specific airports. Further, requests may  be driven by where a requesting airline flies and not where new  procedures are most needed. In 2012, Airlines for America, an airline  trade organization, led an effort\u2014called 20/20\u2014to identify those 20 new  procedures most wanted by airlines, as well as the 20 procedures they  viewed as most in need of amendment.

According to these officials, although FAA has published many PBN  routes throughout the NAS, from a controllers\u2019 perspective, there were  few rules in place for using those procedures. For example, under the  current handbook there is little guidance on how to safely give less than  the standard separation for merging planes\u2014as is often done for  traditional procedures in clear weather conditions\u2014even if the aircraft are  on precise paths. The separation standards heavily influence the  guidance in the controller handbook, because much of a controllers\u2019  responsibility is to keep safe distances between aircraft.

Airport officials in one OAPM metroplex told us that FAA had not  adequately included them in early planning for new PBN routes.  Consequently, the airport hired environmental consultants to analyze,  among other things, the potential noise impacts of proposed PBN  procedures and submitted concerns to FAA. In addition, although the Port  of Seattle was initially involved in designing procedures for Greener  Skies, airport officials told us that they were concerned that FAA had not  included them during the environmental assessment process or in  conducting local outreach. The project has raised some community  concerns about aircraft noise from new flight paths, and some  neighborhoods have expressed concerns that FAA had not clearly  explained the potential noise impact on their neighborhoods. New  aviation noise is one of the largest obstacles to NextGen implementation,  according to FAA officials and others. It can be difficult to address  community concerns about aviation noise, but FAA may be able to  mitigate such concerns by involving airport officials more closely in  procedure design and community outreach efforts. FAA officials  involved in another OAPM team, for example, noted that local airport  officials, who were not included in initial route planning for the metroplex,  later provided information about potential community impacts that FAA  had not anticipated. Information provided by FAA on establishing OAPM  study teams, however, does not include guidance on the timely  involvement of airport representatives on these teams, if such  involvement is appropriate; rather the information indicates that OAPM  teams should brief airport authorities as the process continues. This is in  contrast to the best practices established by ACRP, which state that  educating\u2014in this case briefing\u2014interested stakeholders after the fact is  not sufficient for effective involvement; rather, proactive involvement is  required.

Leading practices of successful organizations reflect that  programs can be implemented most efficiently when managers are  empowered to make critical decisions and are held accountable for  results. To ensure accountability for NextGen results, several  stakeholders suggested that an office was needed that would report  directly to the FAA Administrator or the Secretary of Transportation. FAA  has made organizational changes in the past in an effort to address these  concerns.", "Beginning in 2011, FAA made additional changes to its NextGen  organizational structure to address NextGen leadership issues.  Specifically, FAA reorganized the structure of the office responsible for  carrying out NextGen implementation, moving the office from within the  ATO to under FAA\u2019s Deputy Administrator. According to FAA, this change  increased NextGen\u2019s visibility within and outside the agency and created  a direct line of authority and responsibility for NextGen. In addition, in  February 2012, the FAA reauthorization act designated that the Director  of JPDO\u2014who is responsible for NextGen planning and coordination\u2014  and created a new leadership  report directly to the FAA Administrator position\u2014the Chief NextGen Officer.", "While these changes indicate a positive step towards addressing  accountability issues, FAA continues to work to fill NextGen leadership  positions.

The Administrator, who was sworn-in to the office in January  2013, has not yet clearly defined the relationship between the JPDO  Director and other NextGen officials.

The NAC recommended in  2011 that FAA adopt performance areas used by ICAO and, as of  February 2013, FAA had adopted 6 of the 11 ICAO performance areas.FAA provided information about 5 of these performance areas\u2014 Environment, Safety, Efficiency, Capacity, and Cost Effectiveness\u2014and  the metrics associated with these areas. Performance metrics for the  sixth performance area\u2014Predictability\u2014are being developed. As we  have reported in the past, having performance measures is important,  because they allow an agency to track its progress in achieving intended  results and develop contingency plans if milestones to complete tasks are  not met, both of which can be particularly important during the  implementation stage of a new program. Performance metrics would  also enable stakeholders, such as airlines, to hold FAA accountable for  results, as well as to make their own business decisions about whether to  invest in equipment needed to enable the use of NextGen technologies  and procedures.", "FAA is currently conducting an agency-wide effort to review and  harmonize its performance metrics to bring order, consistency, and  accuracy to metrics reporting across its lines of business. The agency  began this effort to address several problems, including managing and  monitoring an increasing number of metrics and inconsistent metrics  names and definitions. Once the harmonization is complete, ATO will  create a website to display the harmonized metrics, which, according to  FAA officials, will provide information for many FAA activities, including  the implementation of NextGen. The ongoing modifications to performance metrics must be completed before FAA can establish  baselines from which it can measure progress. Baselines are essential to  compare past performance to current performance. For some established  metrics for which FAA already has extensive data, establishing a baseline  is not expected to be a challenge. By contrast, establishing a baseline for  new metrics for which FAA has not yet collected data may present  challenges and is expected to take time.", "FAA is also developing additional NextGen performance metrics in  response to the FAA reauthorization act, in addition to responding to the  NAC recommendations. FAA was mandated to establish and, beginning  in 2013, to track 12 performance metrics to measure progress for  implementing some NextGen capabilities and improvements. Although  these new reauthorization metrics do not clearly link to the existing  NextGen key performance areas mentioned above, some of the  reauthorization metrics are similar to and reflect the same information that  is already expected to be measured. According to FAA officials, 7 of the  reauthorization performance metrics are already established, however the  agency faces some challenges in developing 5 of the remaining metrics.  For example, FAA is working with the NAC to identify a technically  feasible way to measure and report on the amount of fuel used between  key city-to-city (city-pair) markets\u2014one of the required new metrics. It is  not known at this time if these key city pairs will include some or all  locations where midterm NextGen operational improvements are being  implemented.", "FAA has made minimal progress in developing goals for NextGen, which  we also recommended in our 2010 report. FAA\u2019s Destination 2025 report  establishes cross-cutting agency-wide goals for the midterm, although  these are not all related to the implementation of NextGen. Agency officials emphasized that Destination 2025 goals were intended to be  aspirational and that FAA business plans, which are developed by each  individual business office, would provide NextGen targets and goals.  However, agency officials in the NextGen Office acknowledged that  individual business offices are still developing their respective targets.  When FAA provided information to us in January 2013 about its efforts to  align goals and performance metrics, the goals included in Destination  2025 were used as the source for many of the included metrics. As we  reported in 2010, having goals and performance measures in place will  enable FAA to provide stakeholders, interested parties, Congress, and  the American people with a clear picture of where implementation stands  at any given time, and whether the technologies, capabilities, and  operational improvements that are being implemented are resulting in  positive outcomes and improved performance for operators and  passengers. Thus, we continue to believe that fully addressing our  2010 recommendations has merit.

In March 2012,  FAA made publically available the NextGen Performance Snapshot  website to provide post-implementation performance data. The website  is designed to emphasize the link between NextGen investments and  benefits. To date, information on the website provides performance  progress on the near-term implementation of some, but not all, locations  and initiatives where FAA has implemented NextGen capabilities.January 2013, the website had information on established metrics for  three performance areas\u2014efficiency, environment, and access. Efficiency  is reported at the core 30 airports; environment and access are reported   As of  at the NAS-wide level. For example, the NextGen Performance Snapshot  website reports some efficiency data, such as the average number of  minutes that it takes flights to taxi-in and taxi-out at each of the core 30  airports, and environmental data, such as NAS-wide noise exposure data  for the U.S. population. In the absence of specific NextGen targets, we  looked to track FAA\u2019s progress vis-\u00e0-vis the NextGen-related goals in  Destination 2025 on FAA\u2019s NextGen Performance Snapshot website, but  found it difficult to do so. Information presented was in many cases  neither in the same format nor on the same scale as goals in Destination  2025. For example, one goal in Destination 2025 is to improve throughput  at core airports during adverse weather by 14 percent through 2018, but  the NextGen Performance Snapshot website tracking progress did not  include this information either as an average or for individual core  airports. Likewise, another Destination 2025 goal is to reduce the amount  of fuel burned per miles flown by at least 2 percent annually\u2014which  corresponds to international objectives accepted by ICAO\u2014but  information provided showed changes in the cumulative amount of fuel  burned per kilometers flown. According to agency officials, the NextGen  Performance Snapshot website is currently undergoing improvements  that will include more meaningful measures and additional reporting  levels\u2014such as metroplex and key city-pair views\u2014to more fully  demonstrate progress at core airports, prioritized metroplexes, and  across the NAS. An updated NextGen Performance Snapshot website  has the potential to help stakeholders\u2014such as airports and airlines\u2014and  the public understand the progress and some benefits occurring at  various airports and metroplexes across the nation in a more systematic  way, as well as providing a link between these benefits and the  investments made in NextGen by FAA and others.", "FAA is also developing a PBN assessment tool\u2014the PBN dashboard\u2014to  enable FAA to assess the PBN capabilities at individual airports and  within the NAS. According to FAA officials and the contractors developing  the dashboard, it will be able to measure PBN usage and impacts and  changes to conditions (fleet, equipage, etc.). Representatives from one  airline we spoke with said that they currently do not collect the information  on procedure usage that FAA needs for the dashboard. In response to  industry stakeholders\u2019 aforementioned concerns and perceptions that  some published PBN procedures have provided limited benefits or have  not been sufficiently used, FAA had undertaken some analyses to  determine how often published PBN procedures are being used. This  analysis of flight track data for airspace around some airports showed that  more aircraft were following the airborne routes of published PBN  procedures than was being reported by airlines or air-traffic control  facilities. However, the analysis was unable to determine whether the  aircraft were actually flying the published PBN procedure or merely  following the same track on the conventional procedure. FAA officials  stated that the dashboard could help FAA better assess the extent to  which the fleet is able to use existing procedures. The OAPM study team  for South/Central Florida used the dashboard to determine the  percentage of operations at each airport in the metroplex that would  benefit from proposed new procedures. It is unclear the extent to which  the dashboard will be used to measure the impact of improvements or  assess progress toward overarching NextGen goals. FAA officials do not  plan to use the dashboard to proactively identify additional needed  procedures at individual airports or make the dashboard available to  external stakeholders, such as airlines, that may want to identify  additional needed procedures.", "RTCA, NextGen Equipage: User Business Case Gaps (Sept. 2011). is currently equipped. For example, RTCA noted that FAA\u2019s long-range  implementation plans should provide information on the roll out of RNP  procedures at specific airports\u2014the type of information that would be  useful for airlines that are considering investing in this technology.  However, RTCA found that the plans lacked such information. Nor do  FAA implementation plans identify criteria with which additional sites  would be selected in the case of demonstration projects. Without greater  certainty on when and where NextGen improvements are planned,  airlines and others are unlikely to invest in the equipage (and conduct the  associated staffing and training) that will help achieve the full benefits of  NextGen implementation. FAA has estimated that total industry  equipage could cost $6.6 billion\u2014compared to $11.5 billion in NextGen  implementation costs for FAA\u2014through 2018.

Achieving the benefits of NextGen is a collaborative task that not only  relies on timely and reliable information on progress implementing  NextGen, but also depends heavily on airlines\u2019 and other stakeholders\u2019  continued or increased investments in NextGen technology and training.  The improvements included in NextGen plans are often interrelated, with  benefits in one area dependent on the full implementation of other  operational improvements.", "FAA does not have a system for systematically tracking the use of  existing PBN procedures. As a result, FAA is unable to assure that  investment in these routes is worthwhile or that they justify the cost to  develop and maintain them. In the absence of data on the use of existing  PBN routes, airlines and other stakeholders remain unconvinced that the  investments needed for the full implementation of NextGen will be  justified. Such information could help the agency demonstrate the value  of PBN technologies and any resulting benefits, as well as allow the  agency to identify routes that need to be revised to increase their use.", "Without a process for proactively identifying new PBN procedures based  on NextGen goals and targets, requests for new PBN procedures largely  originate from outside FAA. While the agency has attempted to work with  industry stakeholders, such as airlines in the 20/20 effort, to identify  needed routes, results have been mixed. The use of criteria to proactively  identify needed routes at individual airports, such as criteria used by the  NAC to prioritize metroplexes, could enable FAA to identify routes that  can maximize benefits for the NAS. Furthermore, FAA does not assess  requests received to determine whether the requested route or type of  procedure (e.g., RNAV or RNP) maximizes potential benefits. Since  requestors, such as airlines, may have their own reasons for requesting  routes at certain locations or using specific technologies, their requests  may not correspond with NextGen goals or result in the most efficient use  of resources for PBN implementation or vis-\u00e0-vis the needs of other  users.", "The NAC work group recommended that FAA develop an integrated  approach to increase airspace efficiency in key metroplexes, including  OAPM sites. While FAA has consistently emphasized the importance of  integrating key operational improvements to maximize NextGen benefits,  FAA has primarily focused its midterm efforts on PBN and has not  systematically integrated airborne- and surface traffic management and  revised standards into these efforts. FAA officials explained that non-PBN  improvements were not systematically included in the first round of  OAPM, in part, to achieve OAPM time frames. However, with the  implementation of some first round improvements, as well as progress  made in developing and deploying some non-PBN improvements, FAA is  better positioned to systematically integrate PBN and other improvements  going forward. Insufficient integration of key improvements decreases  midterm NextGen benefits, since these benefits are interdependent.", "Furthermore, by not including the identification of unused flight routes for  decommissioning in OAPM and similar efforts, FAA could be missing an  opportunity to leverage the expertise of participating stakeholders.  Decommissioning unused or little-used conventional, non-PBN  procedures could allow FAA to make better use of its resources by  reducing maintenance costs.", "FAA has made progress in recent years in ensuring the inclusion of  stakeholders in NextGen efforts, especially air traffic controllers. Some  airport officials, however, expressed concern that FAA had not fully  involved them in current efforts or involved them too late in the process,  although a representative with ACI-NA noted that FAA has recently begun  to involve airports more significantly in NextGen design and  implementation efforts. However, FAA has not developed guidelines for  the timely and consistent inclusion of these stakeholders. Some FAA  officials told us that they had not fully appreciated the potential value that  airport officials could provide.

It is  important for FAA to complete this work to measure progress and  demonstrate benefits across the NAS, gain confidence, and engender  needed investments to support the full implementation of NextGen.  Furthermore, RTCA and others have pointed to the importance of having  stable, long-term implementation plans for NextGen capabilities and  determining specific location benefits and implementation dates, but  FAA\u2019s NextGen implementation plans do not detail such deployment  information.
