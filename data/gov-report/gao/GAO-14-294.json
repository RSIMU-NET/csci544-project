The requirements that were fully addressed included an assessment of the modular force capabilities and the status of doctrine for the modular force, among others. Some of the requirements that were partially addressed included information related to risks and mitigation strategies associated with shortfalls; scheduling for repairing, recapitalizing, and replacing equipment; and itemizing information by active-duty and reserve components. The 2013 report provided more thorough information to congressional decision makers on the Army's progress in its modular force transformation than previous reports.", "GAO's body of work since 2005 on the Army's modular restructuring found that the Army faced challenges in creating a results-oriented plan, developing realistic cost estimates, and planning comprehensive assessments.

As the Army plans to restructure its modular force it has made some progress in creating a results-oriented plan, but more work remains in developing realistic cost estimates and planning comprehensive assessments.", "Creating a results-oriented plan. As the Army plans further changes to its modular force design, it has taken initial steps to create a results-oriented plan by developing a timeline with associated tasks and milestones. When the Army began its modular force transformation it did not create a plan with clear milestones to guide its efforts to fully staff and equip the modular force. By incorporating lessons identified in GAO's prior work as it makes further changes, the Army has established a baseline against which to measure performance and may provide decision makers the ability to mitigate any potential problems that may arise.", "Developing realistic cost estimates . From 2005 through 2013, the Army did not create realistic cost estimates or provide a reliable accounting of past spending or future funding needs for implementing its modular force transformation. As the Army plans further changes to its modular force design, it has not developed cost estimates for military construction, personnel relocation, or training for the reorganized units. GAO continues to believe that realistic cost estimates would better position the Army to weigh competing priorities in a fiscally constrained environment and provide Congress with the information needed to evaluate funding requests.", "Planning comprehensive assessments. Since 2004, the Army has made many changes to its modular design based on limited assessments, but it has not completed a comprehensive assessment plan to measure the extent that its modular force transformation is meeting performance goals.

The Army\u2019s primary goals in creating modular (i.e.,  standardized) forces were to expand the number of brigades in order to  meet operational requirements and increase the flexibility of its forces. In  creating its new modular force, Army leaders made a controversial  decision to organize the modular force under a two-battalion brigade  combat team formation, moving away from the traditional three-battalion  brigades. Although generally smaller than the brigades they replaced,  modular brigade combat teams were expected to maintain combat  effectiveness equal to or better than the previous division brigades by  using specialized equipment and specialist personnel called \u201ckey  enablers.\u201d For example, modular brigade combat teams included  embedded combat support functions, such as military intelligence,  reconnaissance, and logistics. Throughout the Army\u2019s transition to the  modular design, we reported and testified on the Army\u2019s management of  its modular transformation and made 20 recommendations intended to  help the Army improve management controls, enhance transparency, and  reduce the risk associated with modularity costs. In 2013, the Army stated  that its transition to a modular force was completed and, due to  decreasing financial resources and increasing ambiguity regarding future  missions, announced plans to modify its modular brigade combat team  designs to include more engineering capabilities and restore a third  maneuver battalion to most brigades.", "The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2007, as amended by the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2011, mandated the Army to report annually on its  progress in fulfilling the requirements for key enablers of modular units  and in repairing, recapitalizing, and replacing items used in support of  overseas contingency operations. The law required the Army\u2019s report to  include, among other things, a comparison of the authorized and on-hand  levels of key enabler equipment, an identification of the risks associated  with shortfalls of equipment and personnel, and mitigation strategies for  addressing those risks. In addition, the law required that the Army\u2019s report  include an assessment of modular force capabilities, the status of the  development of doctrine on the modular force, and comments from both  the National Guard and Army Reserve on all the legislative requirements.  Also, the law mandated us to review the report and to provide information  and any recommendations deemed to be appropriate in light of our  review. In September 2013, the Army issued its fiscal year 2013 report,  which is the last required report on the progress of the modular force. In  our report, we (1) evaluate whether the Army addressed the legislative  requirements in its modular force report and (2) provide an overview of  any challenges that the Army faced in its modular force transformation  and describe how the Army is addressing these challenges as it  implements further changes to its force structure.", "To determine the extent to which the Army addressed the legislative  requirements in its modular force report, three GAO analysts  independently reviewed the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2013 report, comparing it  with each element required by the law and determining whether each  required reporting element was included. In the case of any conflicting  determinations, a fourth GAO analyst adjudicated the difference. To gain  a full understanding of the elements included in the annual report and to  discuss the methodology used for collecting information and reporting on  the Army\u2019s progress toward modular restructuring, we met with Army  officials knowledgeable about compiling information for the report,  including individuals from the Department of the Army, Army Training and  Doctrine Command, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. We also  reviewed related documentation used to compile the report, including a  Director of the Army Staff memorandum to complete the fiscal year 2013  modular report and the list of key enabler personnel and equipment  required to be included in the report. Additionally, we reviewed the Army\u2019s  fiscal year 2012 report on progress in fulfilling modularity requirements to  compare it with the fiscal year 2013 report and to determine the extent of  progress made in fulfilling modularity requirements between fiscal years  2012 and 2013.", "For the overview of the challenges related to the Army\u2019s modular force  transformation and how the Army is addressing these challenges, we  reviewed our prior testimonies and reports on modularity.

The Army\u2019s objective in redesigning its  force structure was to create more units to meet operational needs and  be more flexible in deploying independently while maintaining combat  capabilities of division-based brigades. According to the Army, having  more combat brigades with specialized equipment and specialist  personnel would increase combat capability and add value for combatant  commanders. To increase the flexibility of units, the Army standardized  brigade combat teams in one of three designs\u2014armored brigade, infantry  brigade, or Stryker brigade (see fig. 1). The Army\u2019s new modular units  were designed, equipped, and staffed differently than the units they  replaced, and thus the transformation required many changes, such as  new equipment and facilities, a different mix of skills and occupational  specialties among Army personnel, and significant changes to training  and doctrine. A key change was the reduction in the number of maneuver  battalions within the modular units from three battalions per brigade under  the division-based organization to two battalions for most brigade combat  teams. Critics of the decision to have only two battalions raised concerns  about whether the new structure would maintain as much combat  capability as the division-based battalion. However, the Army expected to  increase the modular brigade combat teams\u2019 capability through  specialized equipment and personnel, called \u201ckey enablers.\u201d", "Since 2004, when the Army introduced its modular restructuring initiative,  the Army has made multiple adjustments to its original plans for  restructuring its operational force. The Army\u2019s initial restructuring plan  called for 77 modular brigade combat teams\u201443 active-duty brigade  combat teams and 34 National Guard brigades. As of fiscal year 2013,  the Army had 71 brigade combat teams, consisting of 43 active-duty  brigade combat teams and 28 National Guard brigades. In 2013, the  Army announced plans for another change in the structure of the modular  force related to the need to reduce the active-duty component from  570,000 to 490,000 soldiers by fiscal year 2015. As figure 2 shows, the  Army plans to reduce the number of active-duty brigade combat teams  from a high of 45 teams to 32 teams by fiscal year 2015. The number of  National Guard brigades would remain at 28, bringing the total of brigade  combat teams to 60. In addition to the reduction in the numbers of  brigade combat teams, the Army plans to refine the designs of the  remaining brigades to add engineering and artillery capabilities, as well as  increase the number of maneuver battalions from two to three for most  brigade combat teams. According to the Army, the modifications to the  modular force would enable it to preserve operational capability and  flexibility, while reducing the number of soldiers in the active-duty  component.", "Our body of work on the Army\u2019s modular force transformation includes  seven reports and three testimonies.

Because of the magnitude of  the Army\u2019s transformation plans and concerns about their affordability, we  initially conducted work under the Comptroller General\u2019s statutory  authority and examined both the force structure and cost implications of  the Army\u2019s transformation into a modular force. Subsequently, Congress  enacted requirements that the Army submit an annual report on its  progress on its modular force transformation and that we review the  Army\u2019s report. According to the Army, the transition to the modular force  structure, which began in 2004, was completed by the end of fiscal year  2013.

For example, the Army\u2019s report discussed  mitigation strategies for personnel shortfalls but not for all equipment  shortfalls. According to Army officials, the Army mitigated risk by  providing equipment to the next deploying units. In other cases, the Army  chose not to mitigate equipment shortfalls due to the costs involved or  because the specific equipment item no longer met the needs of the  modular force. Additionally, the Army did not fully report on a schedule for  the repair of equipment because, according to Army officials, the number  of battle losses and the related amount of wear and tear on equipment  returning from overseas operations was unpredictable. However, the  Army provided some general information about its repair schedule for  fiscal years 2013 and 2014, such as when the Army expects to begin  addressing postcombat equipment repairs. In addition, according to  officials the report did not itemize information by component because the  report included a separate section with comments from the reserve  components. However, the comments by the reserve components did not  include all required information, such as identifying risks and mitigation  strategies associated with equipment shortfalls.

In preparing the fiscal year 2013 report,  the Army implemented our recommendation to provide guidance to Army  officials to ensure the completeness of its report. The Director of the Army  Staff sent a memorandum in March 2013 to Army staff that outlined the  coordination process for preparing the fiscal year 2013 report, identifying  each office responsible for providing information for the report. In addition,  Army officials coordinating the report held meetings with each office early  in the process to ensure they complied with the mandated language.  Additionally, the Army provided the offices with a list of the key enabler  items to report on rather than letting the offices interpret what to report.

In 2005  and 2006, we reported that the Army began its modular transformation  without creating a staffing plan that considered the size and composition  of the modular force. For example, in 2005 we testified that the Army had  begun its modular transformation without deciding on the number of  brigade combat teams or finalizing the design of supporting units.  Without finalized designs or key decisions, the Army did not have a  complete understanding of the personnel needed to achieve its goals. As  a result, the Army could not assure decision makers when modular units  would have the required key enabler staff in place to restore readiness,  and it experienced cost growth and timeline slippage in its efforts to  transform to a modular and more capable force. In 2006, we testified  and reported that the Army did not plan to fill some key intelligence  positions required by its new modular force structure. Without continued  and significant progress in meeting personnel requirements, the Army  had to accept increased risk in its ability to support its combat forces, and  it ultimately sought support for an increase in overall personnel from the  Department of Defense (DOD) and Congress.", "Additionally, in 2005 and 2006 we reported that the Army did not develop  an equipping plan to provide modular units the required quantities of key  enabler equipment considered critical for the transformation. For  example, in 2005 we testified that although the Army had some of its key  enabler equipment on hand at the start of its modular transformation, the  amount of equipment provided to brigade combat teams was well below  the levels tested by the Army Training and Doctrine Command. As a  result, officials from two divisions that we visited expressed concern over  their soldiers\u2019 ability to train and become proficient with some of this high- tech equipment because the equipment was not available in sufficient  numbers. In 2006, we similarly testified that although active modular  combat brigades were receiving considerable quantities of equipment,  they initially lacked required quantities of items such as communications  systems that were key for providing the enhanced intelligence, situational  awareness, and network capabilities needed to help match the combat  power of the Army\u2019s former brigade structure. At that time, the Army\u2019s  modular combat brigade conversion schedule outpaced the planned  acquisition or funding for some equipment requirements, and the Army  had not defined specific equipping plans for brigades. By not completing  development of its equipping strategy, the Secretary of Defense and  Congress were not in a good position to assess the Army\u2019s equipment  requirements and the level of risk associated with the Army\u2019s plans.", "Moreover, in 2008 we reported that although the Army had established  over 80 percent of its modular units, it did not have a results-oriented plan  with clear milestones in place to guide efforts to staff and equip those new  units. The Army extended its estimates of how long it would take to  equip the modular force from 2011 to 2019, but it provided few details  about interim steps. While the Army projected that it would have enough  personnel and equipment in the aggregate, its projections relied on  uncertain assumptions related to meeting recruiting and retention goals  as well as restoring equipment used in current operations. For example,  the Army centered its equipping strategy on the Future Combat System, a  longer-term transformation effort that comprised 14 integrated weapon  systems and an advanced information network. The Army expected  brigade combat teams equipped with the Future Combat System to  provide significant warfighting capabilities to DOD\u2019s overall joint military  operations. However, in 2009, after 6 years and an estimated $18 billion  invested, DOD canceled the Future Combat System acquisition program  and instead identified alternate plans to modernize equipment. The  cancelation of the Future Combat System presented setbacks to the  equipping of the modular force.

The Army based decisions on which units to inactivate on  quantitative and qualitative analyses and developed a timeline for the  changes, with associated tasks and milestones. For example, as we  reported in December 2013, the Army established a planning team for the  brigade combat team reorganization to assess factors such as strategic  considerations, military construction costs, and proximity to embarkation  points, among others, and to develop stationing options for decision  makers. Furthermore, the Army has developed a plan to reduce risk to  the readiness of the force during this reorganization by providing  equipment, personnel, and training resources to units currently deployed  or deploying for operations or contingencies and then to seven brigade  combat teams that will maintain a high level of readiness for 18 to 24  months. According to Army officials, these seven teams will remain at the  highest level of readiness in order to support any planned or unexpected  operations while the remaining brigade combat teams undergo their  reorganizations and accept a risk of low readiness to respond to potential  contingencies.", "Moreover, the Army Structure memorandum for 2015 through 2019  documented interim steps in reorganizing the Army modular force  structure. For example, the Army identified inactivation and  reorganization dates as well as changes to the tables of equipment for the  brigade combat teams. Additionally, once the Army identified which units  would be inactivated or reorganized, officials developed an online tracking  system that provides information such as when the reorganization and  associated training will occur and what tasks each reorganized unit will  have to complete. According to an Army official, senior leaders\u2014including  three-star generals and the Chief of Staff of the Army\u2014reviewed the  online system to track progress in implementing planned changes.  However, the Army has not always been able to implement its plans to  achieve its goals. For example, the Army was not able to fulfill plans for  some key enabler equipment such as through its Future Combat System  program that were deemed critical to achieving the combat effectiveness  of the modular brigade combat teams. The Army could face risks in  implementing current plans without sustaining attention and following  through on its plans for changes to the modular force design. By creating  a results-oriented plan for the inactivations and reorganizations, the Army  has established a baseline against which to measure performance.

We reported that the Army  likely understated its estimates for equipment costs because it did not  entirely reflect the cost of purchasing all the equipment needed to bring  the planned units to the modular design\u2014and therefore to the level of  capability\u2014that the Army validated in testing. In addition, Army officials  were uncertain whether the personnel authorization was enough to  support the modular transformation, putting costs at risk of increasing if  the Army determined that the transformation required additional  personnel. Additionally, the Army was uncertain of the costs of  constructing permanent facilities because it did not incorporate proposals  for base realignment and closure and restationing of personnel from  overseas. As costs grew due to these uncertainties, the Army required  additional funding or needed to accept reduced capabilities among some  or all of its units.

However, the Army did not provide us with any detailed  cost analysis. Further, the Army did not provide cost estimates for military  construction and personnel relocation costs for those reorganizations  occurring across installations or for associated doctrine development or  training for the reorganized units.

Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government state that agencies should provide reasonable assurance to  decision makers that their objectives are being achieved and that decision  makers should have reliable data to determine whether they are meeting  goals and using resources effectively and efficiently. Our  recommendations to the Army included developing a comprehensive plan  for assessing the Army\u2019s progress toward achieving the benefits of the  modular transformation that incorporated quantifiable metrics and  addressed a wide range of both traditional and irregular security  challenges. The Army generally agreed with five of the recommendations  but implemented only one. For example, the Army agreed with but did not  implement our recommendation to develop a comprehensive assessment  plan that includes steps to evaluate modular units in full-spectrum  combat. However, the Army acted upon our recommendation by  assessing aspects of the modular force and refining its modular designs  based on lessons learned in the areas of equipment, doctrine, and  training.

In 2006, we reported that the Army did not have a  comprehensive and transparent approach to measure progress against  stated modularity objectives, assess the need for further changes to  modular designs, and monitor implementation plans. While DOD had  identified the importance of establishing objectives that translate into  measurable metrics that in turn provide accountability for results, the  Army had not established outcome-related metrics linked to most of its  modularity objectives. Further, we reported that although the Army  analyzed lessons learned from Iraq and training events, the Army did not  have a long-term comprehensive plan for further analysis and testing of  its modular combat brigade designs and fielded capabilities. As a result,  decision makers did not have sufficient information to assess the  capabilities, cost, and risks of the Army\u2019s modular force implementation  plans.", "Moreover, in 2007 we reported that the Army was evaluating and applying  lessons learned from its counterinsurgency operations. However, it did  not have a comprehensive assessment plan to determine whether fielded  modular unit designs met the Army\u2019s original goals for modular units  across the full spectrum of low- and high-intensity warfare, and it did not  have outcome-oriented metrics that helped to measure progress in  achieving the goals of the modular force. The Army evaluated the  experiences of modular units deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and had  made some changes in unit designs based on these lessons; however,  the Army did not develop a plan for assessing modular units in high- intensity combat operations. In seeking approval to establish modular  units, the Army identified a number of planned benefits associated with  them, such as providing the same or better combat effectiveness of the  Army\u2019s division-based brigades. However, the Army limited its evaluations  to the performance of modular units during predeployment exercises and  counterinsurgency operations and did not evaluate their performance  across the full spectrum of combat operations that include large-scale,  high-intensity combat operations. As a result, the Army did not have a  clear way to measure the extent to which new modular brigades were as  effective as its division-based brigades for a range of missions. Without a  comprehensive assessment plan that included a wider range of potential  missions, the Army may have missed opportunities to strengthen its  designs.", "Additionally, we reported in our 2008 report on Army modularity that the  Army tested its units with the full complement of required equipment and  personnel, and not at the somewhat lower level of personnel and  equipment the Army actually provided to units. As a result, the Army  assessment of whether the capabilities that it was fielding could perform  mission requirements did not capture realistic missions and outcomes.

The Army Training and Doctrine Command Analysis  Center prepared an analysis in May 2012 to consider whether the Army  should add a third maneuver battalion to the armored and infantry brigade  combat team designs. To begin this analysis, the Army assembled 23  commanders of brigade combat teams to gather insights into the  effectiveness of the both the two- and three-battalion designs across a  wide range of possible future demands, such as major combat  operations, low-threat activities, and enhanced protective posture. In  doing so, the Army considered several factors we reported on in our prior  work, including reviewing the full spectrum of low- and high-intensity  warfare and identifying assessment metrics such as security of vehicles.  However, the analysis was not an assessment of the Army\u2019s prior  performance under a two-battalion construct. Rather, the analysis was a  projection of how to organize the Army for future demands and thus did  not meet the intent of our past recommendations.", "The Army has developed some plans to conduct assessments and  capture lessons learned as it changes its modular force design, but it has  not formalized these plans with a detailed methodology, data-collection  procedures, or outcome-based metrics. According to Army officials, the  Army plans to conduct assessments and capture lessons learned during  the reorganization of the brigade combat teams. The Army issued an  execution order for the Army Training and Doctrine Command to conduct  assessments for this reorganization. According to a senior official from  the Army Training and Doctrine Command, the Army plans to collect  baseline metrics on the brigades both prior to and following their  reorganization. Additionally, the Army has developed new mission- essential task lists for the infantry, Stryker, and armored brigade combat  teams on which to base assessments. When the brigade combat teams  participate in training exercises in their new organizational designs,  assessors will evaluate how well the teams achieve their mission- essential tasks. The assessors can then adjust the training if the brigade  combat teams are having difficulties understanding the new tasks.  However, the Army officials stated that there is no checklist or detailed  plan on how to conduct these assessments or what outputs to measure.  Moreover, according to Army officials, the assessments are dependent  upon receiving sufficient funding and potentially may not occur.
