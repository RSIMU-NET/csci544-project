The act, as amended, includes a provision for GAO to annually study these regulations. This report examines (1) the regulatory analyses federal agencies conducted in Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings and interagency coordination in the rulemaking process; (2) the possible impact of selected Dodd-Frank Act provisions and related rules on community banks and credit unions; and (3) the possible impact of selected Dodd-Frank Act provisions and their implementing rules on financial market stability.", "GAO reviewed Federal Register releases for 26 Dodd-Frank Act rules that became effective July 23, 2014-July 22, 2015 to determine if agencies conducted the required regulatory analyses and coordination. Separately, GAO examined nine Dodd-Frank Act rules that were effective as of October 2015 for their impact on community banks and credit unions. GAO chose these rules because regulators and others expected them to affect these institutions. GAO analyzed data on community banks and credit unions from 2010 to 2015, reviewed studies, and interviewed staff from federal financial agencies and market participants. Additionally, GAO developed indicators on the impact of systemic risk-related provisions and rules and conducted an economic analysis to assess the act's impact on large bank holding companies.", "Regulators provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal financial agencies conducted required regulatory analyses for rules issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and also reported required coordination. These agencies also addressed key elements of Office of Management and Budget guidance for conducting cost-benefit analyses for rules considered major\u2014rules likely to result in an annual impact on the economy of $100 million or more, among other things.", "With regard to select Dodd-Frank Act rules expected to have impacts on community banks and credit unions, community banks, credit unions, and industry associations GAO interviewed cited an increase in compliance burden associated with these rules. This included increases in staff, training, and time allocation for regulatory compliance and updates to compliance systems. Some of these industry officials also reported a decline in specific business activities, such as loans that are not qualified mortgages, due to fear of litigation or not being able to sell those loans to secondary markets. The results of surveys we reviewed suggest that there have been moderate to minimal initial reductions in the availability of credit among those responding to the various surveys and regulatory data to date have not confirmed a negative impact on mortgage lending. However, these results do not necessarily rule out significant effects or the possibility that effects may arise in the future. Federal financial regulators are conducting retrospective analyses of Dodd-Frank Act rules on small entities. GAO developed indicators associated with resources used to comply with regulations and with business lines that may be affected by Dodd-Frank Act regulations to provide baselines against which to monitor future trends. For example, GAO's indicators suggest that residential mortgage loans as a fraction of assets have generally grown for banks of all sizes and for some smaller credit unions but have decreased for larger credit unions. However, changes in GAO's indicators may reflect factors other than the influence of Dodd-Frank Act rules, such as consumer demand for credit.", "The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act remains uncertain because many of its rules have yet to be implemented and insufficient time has passed to evaluate others. Using recently released data, GAO updated indicators from its prior reports that monitor key risk characteristics of large U.S. bank holding companies, and added new indicators that monitor interconnectedness. Although changes in the indicators are not evidence of causal links to the act's provisions, some indicators suggest companies' leverage generally decreased and liquidity generally improved since the act's passage. GAO's updated regression analysis suggests that the act has had little effect on the funding costs of these companies and may be associated with improvements in some measures of their safety and soundness. Indicators associated with the act's swap reforms suggest that holding companies have been requiring their counterparties to post a greater amount of collateral against derivatives contracts. GAO also developed indicators to monitor key risk characteristics of nonbank financial companies designated for supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Because few rules for these companies have been finalized or implemented, these indicators provide a baseline against which to monitor future trends."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in response to the 2007\u20132009  financial crisis that disrupted the U.S. financial system. Under the Dodd- Frank Act, federal agencies are directed or have the authority to issue  hundreds of regulations to implement the act\u2019s provisions. As agencies  continue to develop and implement the regulations, some industry  associations and others have reported on the potential impact,  individually and cumulatively, on financial markets and nonfinancial  institutions. Although the Dodd-Frank Act exempts small institutions, such  as community banks and certain credit unions, from several of its  provisions, and authorizes regulators to provide small institutions with  relief from certain regulations, it also contains provisions that impose  additional restrictions and compliance costs on these institutions.", "Agencies normally must comply with various federal rulemaking  requirements as they draft and implement regulations. For example,  many rulemakings are substantive and are generally subject to the notice  and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),  and many rulemakings must include some form of regulatory analysis,  which provides a formal way of organizing evidence to help in  understanding the potential effects of new regulations. Certain statutes  and executive orders require varying regulatory analyses, and the extent  to which independent regulatory agencies, such as some of the federal  financial regulators (financial regulators), are subject to the requirements  varies. For example, Executive Order (E.O.) 12,866 requires executive  federal agencies to assess costs and benefits of proposed regulatory  action and any alternatives. This order does not apply to independent  regulatory agencies such as banking, securities, or futures regulators, or  the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (commonly known as the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB). However, the CFPB  has a separate requirement under the Act to consider the potential  benefits and costs to consumers and covered persons as part of a  rulemaking under a federal consumer financial law.", "Section 1573(a) of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing  Appropriations Act of 2011 amends the Dodd-Frank Act and includes a  provision for us to annually review financial services regulations, including  those of CFPB. We have previously issued four reports under this  mandate. This report examines the  regulatory analyses conducted by the federal financial regulators and  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) in their Dodd-Frank Act  rulemakings, including their assessments of which rules they  considered to be major rules, and coordination between and among  federal regulators on these rulemakings; possible impact of promulgated Dodd-Frank Act provisions on  community banks and credit unions and their business activities; and possible impact of selected Dodd-Frank Act provisions and their  implementing regulations on financial market stability.", "To examine the regulatory analyses and coordination conducted by the  federal financial regulators and Treasury, we focused our analysis on the  final rules issued pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act that became effective  from July 23, 2014, through July 22, 2015, a total of 26 rules (see app.", "II). We reviewed federal statutes, regulations, and GAO studies on  these rules as well as Federal Register releases that contain information  on the regulatory analyses conducted by agencies and their coordination  efforts. Using GAO\u2019s Federal Rules database, we found that 6 of the 15  rules were classified by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as  major rules under the Congressional Review Act (CRA). We developed a  data collection instrument to compare and assess the regulatory analysis  conducted for the major rules against the principles outlined in OMB  Circular A-4, which provides guidance to federal agencies on the  development of regulatory analysis. We also reviewed the Dodd-Frank  Act and Federal Register releases to identify the interagency coordination  or consultation requirements as required by the act for the 26 rules in our  scope.", "To assess the possible impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on community  banks and credit unions, we used our September 2012 report, which  identified provisions expected to affect some or all community banks and  credit unions, to identify select final rules that became effective by  October 2015. While we started with a larger population of rules, we  specifically reviewed nine final rules which were identified by the  community banks and credit unions we interviewed as potentially having  an impact for the purpose of this report. We reviewed the Federal  Register releases for these final rules and relevant material on the act  and the final rules, as well as five studies by federal and state regulators,  industry associations, and academics on the potential impact of the final  rules on community banks and credit unions. All but one study we  reviewed relied on surveys of banks, usually contacted through banking  association member lists. The final study consisted of a study of all  payment card networks. We conducted semi-structured interviews with  federal regulators, representatives from the Independent Community  Bankers of America (ICBA), the Credit Union National Association  (CUNA), the National Federation of Independent Business, the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, and a non-generalizable, purposive sample of  four state credit union and community bank associations and eight  community banks and credit unions about the impact of the final rules on  community banks and credit unions. Between July and September 2015,  we interviewed representatives from two state community banking and  two state credit union associations from Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, and  Pennsylvania. We also interviewed representatives from four community  banks and four credit unions that fell in each of the four asset categories:  under $250 million, between $250 million and $500 million, between $500  million and $1 billion, and between $1 billion and $10 billion. While the  information we obtained from the interviews provides useful insights, it  cannot be used to make generalizations about the experiences of all  community banks and credit unions since the selection of interviewees  relied on non-probability sampling methods. Nevertheless, we purposely  sought to achieve variety in our sample as a way to gain access to a  range of experiences within the target population.", "We also analyzed bank quarterly Reports of Condition and Income (Call  Reports) data for depository institutions and credit unions obtained from  the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and  National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), respectively, from the first  quarter of 2006 through the second quarter of 2015. We used these data  to construct indicators of the cumulative costs associated with complying  with Dodd-Frank Act regulations, including numbers of employees per $1  million in assets, non-interest expenses as a percentage of assets, and  earnings as a percentage of assets. We used the same data to  construct indicators associated with business lines that may be affected  by Dodd-Frank Act regulations, including residential mortgage lending as  a percentage of assets. We assessed the reliability of the FFIEC and  NCUA data by reviewing relevant documentation and electronically  testing the data for missing values, outliers, and invalid values, and we  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purpose of constructing  indicators associated with compliance costs and business lines for banks  and credit unions. Although we analyzed the impact of a number of  specific Dodd-Frank Act provisions on community banks and credit  unions, assessing the extent to which these provisions or their related  regulations should apply to such institutions was beyond the scope of our  work.", "To analyze the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on financial market stability,  we updated several indicators developed in our prior reports with data  through the second quarter of 2015. We also created new indicators for  banks that are systemically important financial institutions (bank SIFIs)  and nonbank financial institutions designated by the Financial Stability  Oversight Council (FSOC) for supervision by the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve), or designated nonbanks. We  updated indicators monitoring changes in size, complexity, leverage, and  liquidity of bank SIFIs and added new indicators of interconnectedness,  which captures direct or indirect linkages between financial institutions  that may transmit distress from one institution to another. We updated our  econometric analysis estimating changes in measures of the (1) funding  cost for bank SIFIs and (2) safety and soundness of bank SIFIs. Since we  began developing and tracking indicators for bank SIFIs, FSOC has  designated four nonbank institutions for enhanced supervision by the  Federal Reserve. As such, we added new indicators associated with the  size, interconnectedness, leverage, and liquidity of these institutions.  Finally, we updated our indicators monitoring the extent to which certain  swap reforms are consistent with the act\u2019s goals of reducing risk. For  those parts of our methodology that involved the analysis of computer- processed data from Bloomberg, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago,  the Federal Reserve, the National Information Center, and the Bureau of  Economic Analysis, we assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing  relevant documentation; electronically testing the data for missing values,  outliers, and invalid values; and interviewed Federal Reserve staff about  Federal Reserve\u2019s data.

In addition, when an initial regulatory flexibility  analysis is required in connection with a proposed rule, covered  agencies like CFPB must convene a review panel and obtain advice  and recommendations from representatives of small entities on the  effects of the proposed rule on small entities. The initial regulatory  flexibility analyses must describe the number of small entities to which  the proposed rule would apply, projected reporting and recordkeeping  requirements of the proposed rule, any significant alternatives to the  proposed rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable  statutes and which minimize any significant economic impact of the  proposed rule on small entities, and any projected increase in the cost  of credit for small entities.", "Under CRA, before rules can take effect, agencies must submit their  rules to Congress and the Comptroller General, and rules deemed  major by OMB generally may not become effective until 60 days after  the rules are submitted.", "In addition to these requirements, authorizing or other statutes require  certain financial regulators to consider specific benefits, costs, and  impacts of their rulemakings (see table 2).

In September 2012,  we reported that mortgage reform provisions are expected to impose  additional burdens on a large percentage of community banks and credit  unions. In particular, some regulators and industry representatives  expected the reforms to lead smaller institutions to decrease certain  lending activities, or, at the extreme, exit the mortgage business.  However, we also concluded that the full burden on the entities would  depend on the extent to which CFPB (and other agencies) exercised its  authority, where available, to exempt small institutions from any  regulations and how it implemented provisions to provide more limited  relief to small institutions, particularly those in rural or underserved  communities.", "Since our 2012 report, CFPB issued mortgage-related rules pursuant to  Titles X and XIV of the Dodd-Frank Act that became effective by October  2015. Many of these rules amended Regulation X, which implements the  Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) of 1974 and Regulation  Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Representatives  from credit unions, community banks, and industry associations we  interviewed said several of these new rules have increased their overall  compliance burden\u2014training staff, allocating time for regulatory  compliance matters, and updating compliance systems\u2014and in some  cases, have begun to affect mortgage lending. These rules include new  disclosure requirements, minimum standards for mortgage loans, and  new requirements related to escrow accounts and appraisals for higher- priced mortgage loans and mortgage servicing (see table 3).", "CFPB\u2019s integrated mortgage disclosure rule implementing requirements  in the Dodd-Frank Act, known as TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosures  (TRID), combines certain disclosures that consumers receive in  connection with applying for and closing on a mortgage loan. The  purpose of the integrated disclosure is to facilitate compliance with the  disclosure requirements of TILA and RESPA and to help the consumer  understand the transaction by using plain language for the disclosures.", "Representatives from community banks, credit unions, and industry  associations we interviewed and CFPB stated that the compliance costs  incurred by community banks and credit unions to implement the new  disclosures included costs to revise and test software and compliance  systems and costs to train employees. Representatives from two  community banks and four credit unions we interviewed stated that they  had to work with third-party vendors to update their loan origination and  documentation system software. CFPB stated in its analysis of the final  rule that the one-time cost of updating software largely would fall on  software vendors because a majority of creditors rely on these vendors.  The CFPB analysis also stated that many vendor contracts are structured  in a way that vendors would not be able to pass through any cost  increase due to a regulation-related software update such as this one.  However, representatives from one community bank and one credit union  indicated that they had to retain a new vendor to comply with the rules.  Representatives from one community bank and one credit union also  stated that they have to conduct additional due diligence on their vendors  to ensure compliance because they are ultimately held liable if the  vendors\u2019 systems or disclosures are not compliant with the rule. As part of  quality assurance, they have to test the vendors\u2019 new systems prior to  implementation. Representatives from ICBA and CUNA stated that some  entities would not have adequate time to test the software for compliance  before the effective date of the rule due to delays by third-party service  providers. CFPB and the other FFIEC member agencies stated in their  letters to industry associations that during initial examination for  compliance with TRID, the agencies\u2019 examiners will expect the  supervised entities to make good faith efforts to comply with the rule\u2019s  requirements in a timely manner. The agencies stated that during early  examinations, examiners will consider an institution\u2019s implementation  plan, including actions taken to update policies, procedures, and  processes; its training of appropriate staff; and its handling of early  technical problems or other implementation challenges. In October 2015,  FDIC and the Federal Reserve issued a Financial Institution Letter and  guidance, respectively, on their approach to early supervision. CFPB  also issued a press release on the regulators\u2019 approach.", "Representatives from several community banks and credit unions also  said that they had to train their staff on TRID, including familiarizing them  with the new forms. A representative from one community bank  association stated that compared with larger institutions, community bank  staff have to take on more compliance duties and the community banks  may decide to stop offering certain products in order to minimize  compliance risk. A representative from a community bank state  association stated that community banks may exit the market due to the  costs and time allocated to comply. Furthermore, representatives from  one community bank and one credit union state association indicated that  the new TRID requirements could lengthen the closing process and result  in potential closing delays related to meeting these requirements. CFPB  also recognized this potential impact in its final rulemaking analysis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ability to Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from credit unions, community banks, and industry  associations we spoke with said that CFPB\u2019s Ability to Repay and  Qualified Mortgage Standards (ATR/QM) rule could affect mortgage  lending activities of credit unions and community banks, particularly  lending to customers who otherwise might not be served by larger  lenders. However, agency data thus far have not reflected such  changes. The Dodd-Frank Act amended TILA to generally prohibit  lenders from making mortgage loans unless the lender makes a  reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and  documented information that the consumer has a reasonable ability to  repay the loan. In its final rule, CFPB identified eight underwriting factors  a creditor must consider in relation to making the required good faith  determination of a borrowers\u2019 ability to repay, such as current  employment status and monthly debt-to-income ratio. A creditor  presumably satisfies the ability-to-repay requirement by making a  qualified mortgage, which meets certain underwriting requirements and  restrictions on product features and points and fees. CFPB sets out three  main categories of qualified mortgages that are presumed to comply with  the ability-to-repay requirements: general, temporary, and small creditor  (see table 3). Creditors that make qualified mortgages receive some  protection from liability\u2014a safe harbor, or in cases of higher-priced loans,  a rebuttable presumption that ability-to-repay requirements have been  met.", "CFPB included special provisions in the final rule for small creditors,  which during our review were defined as those creditors with less than $2  billion in assets (adjusted annually for inflation) that, together with their  affiliates, originated no more than 500 first-lien mortgage loans in the  preceding year. For loans that are not sold and kept in their portfolios,  such creditors must meet some restrictions on qualified mortgages loans,  such as points and fees, but are not subject to a specific debt-to-income  ratio and are permitted a higher interest rate threshold for a safe harbor.  Certain small creditors operating in rural or underserved areas can also  originate mortgages with balloon payments, a risky loan feature otherwise  not permitted for a qualified mortgage.", "Representatives from some community banks and credit unions as well  as industry associations we interviewed stated that the ATR/QM rule has  negatively affected mortgage lending, particularly for mortgages that do  not meet the criteria for qualified mortgages. For example,  representatives from some community bank and credit union associations  and one credit union said they were unwilling to make loans that are not  qualified mortgages because they may not benefit from the liability  protection afforded qualified mortgages and borrowers may hold lenders  liable for making mortgage loans that they cannot repay. Representatives  from two community banks said that many banks have been unwilling to  originate loans that cannot be sold on the secondary market.  Representatives from one community bank and one credit union we  spoke with said that investors will not purchase loans that are not  qualified mortgages, such as those that do not meet the debt-to-income  requirement. A 2015 survey of community banks conducted by the  Conference of State Bank Supervisors and state regulators found that  about a third of the 974 state-chartered commercial banks that responded  said that they will only make loans that are not qualified mortgages on an  \u201cexception\u201d basis; additionally, about a third of the respondents did not  intend to make any loans that are not qualified mortgages.", "Representatives from several industry associations and community banks  told us that those most likely to be affected by community banks  originating only qualified mortgages are borrowers on the margins of  meeting qualified mortgage standards, or those that would not meet the  underwriting standards at large banking institutions because they were  self-employed, did not have steady income, or were buying in an area  with a lack of comparable sales of similar properties. Representatives  from CUNA and one state community bank association told us that  CFPB\u2019s current rural or underserved area exemption is too narrow and as  a result has limited the ability to lend to those potential borrowers.", "Additionally, while survey results cannot be generalized to all banks, an  ICBA survey found that about two thirds of the 519 responding community  banks in the $500 million to $2 billion asset range made too many loans  to qualify as small creditors under CFPB\u2019s current rural and underserved  area exemption. Moreover, about half of the banks responding to this  survey that serve rural areas did not qualify for the rural exception. In  response to concerns expressed by the industry, CFPB amended the  regulatory criteria for small creditor in September 2015 to raise the limit  for small creditors and their affiliates from 500 first-lien mortgages in the  preceding year to 2,000, excluding loans that are held in portfolio, and  expanded the definitions of rural and underserved areas. The rule will  be effective on January 1, 2016. According to CFPB, the revised small  creditor criteria will effectively expand the overall number of creditors that  are eligible to extend small creditor portfolio-qualified mortgages.  Additionally, CFPB estimated that the number of rural small creditors will  increase from about 2,400 to about 4,100. The final rule retains the asset  limit used to determine small creditor status, but was updated to generally  include the assets of certain affiliates.", "In our June 2015 report on mortgage reforms, we found that studies that  were conducted or posted after the implementation of the ATR/QM rule  anticipated or suggested moderate to minimal initial reductions in the  availability of credit and willingness to originate loans that are not  qualified mortgages. However, we also found that the ATR/QM rule  would have limited initial impacts on mortgage lending activities because  most loans originated in recent years largely conformed with qualified  mortgage criteria and because not all loans that qualify as qualified  mortgages are subject to the same restrictions. According to a  November 2015 Federal Reserve report examining 2014 data collected  under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, there is little indication that the  ATR/QM rules significantly curtailed mortgage credit availability in 2014  relative to 2013. For example, despite the ATR/QM rule that caps  borrowers\u2019 debt-to-income ratio for many loans, the fraction of high debt- to-income loans does not appear to have declined in 2014 from 2013.  However, the report also stated that the results here do not necessarily  rule out the possibility that effects may arise in the future. Additionally,  FDIC stated that FDIC\u2019s data do not appear to confirm a large negative  effect of the rule on small banks. In early 2014, FDIC introduced a new  Community Bank Performance section to the FDIC Quarterly Banking  Profile that is intended to monitor the health of community banks. In the  aggregate, these profiles showed that community banks\u2019 one-to-four  family residential mortgage loan balances have grown in 2014 and  2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rules Related to Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans and Mortgage Servicing", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from some community banks, credit unions, and industry  associations with whom we spoke noted increased compliance costs  associated with CFPB\u2019s new rules related to escrow accounts, appraisals  for higher-priced loans, and mortgage servicing.", "Escrow Requirements. To enhance consumer protection, the Dodd- Frank Act amended TILA to expand escrow requirements for first-lien  higher-priced mortgage loans, including by generally establishing a 5- year minimum for escrow accounts. CFPB\u2019s rule on escrow for  higher-priced mortgage loans increases the time for which mandatory  escrow accounts established for such loans must be maintained from  1 to 5 years, but provides an exemption for certain small creditors  operating in rural or underserved areas and meeting other criteria.  Representatives from ICBA and CUNA said that some of their  community banks and credit union members had to increase  resources to set up and monitor these escrow accounts.  Representatives from both national associations stated that setting up  and monitoring escrow accounts is burdensome and that some  community banks and credit unions do not have adequate technology  or staff to support it. CUNA representatives further stated that some  credit unions had to outsource these functions. ICBA has advocated  for community bank loans held in portfolio to be exempted from the  escrow requirement for higher-priced mortgages because they do not  hold a huge volume of such mortgages. CUNA representatives stated  credit unions that provide low volumes of higher-priced mortgage  loans may cease to provide those loans altogether. While the survey  results cannot be generalized to all banks, in a 2015 survey  conducted by the American Bankers Association, the 182 responding  banks in the survey indicated that cost and, a lack of escrow  capabilities, or, inadequate staff were the primary reasons that they  did not offer escrow services. As discussed earlier, the CFPB  expanded the exemption for small creditors operating in rural or  underserved areas.", "Appraisal Requirements For Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans. CFPB\u2019s  joint rule with other federal financial regulators implementing the  Dodd-Frank Act appraisal requirements for higher-priced mortgages  generally requires lenders to obtain one, or in some limited cases  where timing and pricing requirements are triggered, two written  appraisals. In addition, the requirement to obtain two appraisals does  not apply to a number of transactions, including where the property is  in a rural county. One credit union representative said that having to  deliver appraisals 3 business days prior to consummation delayed an  intended closing (due to its remote location, which makes appraisals  complex and turnaround times longer). Representatives from a state  community bank association and one community bank we interviewed  said the requirement for two appraisals (when timing and pricing  requirements are triggered) is a challenge because they have had  difficulty finding two independent appraisers who understand the  market in their respective areas. ICBA representatives stated that for  higher-priced mortgage loans of smaller amounts, the cost of  appraisal becomes significant in proportion to the loan.  Representatives from CUNA and two state credit union associations  stated the rule had a minimal impact on their members because they  generally did not make higher-priced loans.", "Mortgage Servicing Rules. CFPB issued two mortgage servicing rules  under TILA and RESPA, designed in part to provide, among other  things, better disclosure to consumers about their loan obligations and  loss mitigation options that may be available if they have difficulty with  their loan obligations. CFPB, in its final rule analysis, noted that the  small servicer thresholds were appropriate in part because it  estimated that more than 98 percent of the insured depository  institutions and credit unions, with less than $2 billion in assets fall  beneath the 5,000 loan threshold, qualifying for the small servicer  exemption from many of the rules. Representatives from ICBA and  one state credit union association told us that the exemptions  available to small servicers are too narrow. Although the rules exempt  small servicers from certain provisions, they require all servicers to  respond to written notices of errors received from borrowers, and all  servicers generally must not make the first notice or filing for  foreclosure unless the borrower is more than 120 days delinquent,  among other provisions. Representatives from several industry  associations we interviewed said that community banks and credit  unions had to expand resources to meet these requirements. ICBA  representatives said the small servicer threshold should be increased  from 5,000 to 20,000 loans. However, representatives from four  community banks we interviewed stated the rules had no impact on  their mortgage servicing or that they did not provide mortgage  servicing. A 2013 survey by the Mercatus Center indicated that less  than two-fifths of the approximately 200 small banks participating in  their survey currently offered mortgage servicing and less than a tenth  discontinued or anticipated discontinuing mortgage servicing as a  result of the Dodd-Frank Act. While survey results and interview  responses cannot be generalized to all small banks, they suggest that  the regulatory requirements would have a small overall impact on  mortgage servicing practices at these banks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Industry Officials Also Said Certain Nonmortgage- Related Rules Had Increased Compliance Burden or Changed Business Practices", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from community banks, credit unions, and industry  associations we interviewed also identified the impact of several  nonmortgage-related requirements and implementing rules on  compliance and related business activities.

Representatives from CUNA and two state credit union associations said  that some credit unions have increased fees or left the market. For  example, one credit union representative said that it did not have access  to the information and services required by the rule and had to contract  with a correspondent bank to continue to offer the service.

In addition, CFPB officials stated that, based on  their analysis of NCUA call report data, about 90 percent of the credit  unions do not send over 100 transfers annually and thus are exempt from  the remittance rule.

First, using data  through the second quarter of 2015, we updated the indicators developed  in our December 2012 report to monitor changes in certain characteristics  of SIFIs, which are subject to enhanced prudential standards and  oversight under the act, and also developed new indicators. Second, we  updated our difference-in-difference econometric analysis to infer the  act\u2019s impact on funding costs for bank SIFIs and the safety and  soundness of bank SIFIs. Third, we developed indicators of designated  nonbanks that parallel our bank SIFI indicators. Fourth, using data  through the second quarter of 2014, we updated indicators developed in  our December 2013 report to monitor the extent to which certain of the  act\u2019s swap reforms are consistent with the act\u2019s goals of reducing risk.  All of these analyses have limitations, which we discuss below."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Indicators Suggest Large Bank SIFIs Have Become Larger but Less Vulnerable to Financial Distress Since the Dodd- Frank Act", "paragraphs": ["According to its legislative history, the Dodd-Frank Act contains  provisions intended to reduce the risk of failure of a large, complex  financial institution and the damage that such a failure could do to the  economy. Such provisions include (1) authorizing FSOC to designate a  nonbank financial company for Federal Reserve supervision if FSOC  determines it could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability and (2)  directing the Federal Reserve to impose enhanced prudential standards  and oversight on bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total  consolidated assets (bank SIFIs) and nonbank financial companies  designated by FSOC (designated nonbanks).

We updated the indicators we developed in our December 2012  report and updated in our December 2013 and December 2014 reports to  monitor changes in some of these characteristics of SIFIs. In addition,  we added indicators of interconnectedness. The size,  interconnectedness, and complexity indicators reflect the potential for the  financial distress of a single SIFI to affect the financial system and  economy (spillover effects). The leverage and liquidity indicators reflect a  SIFI\u2019s resilience to shocks or its vulnerability to financial distress.", "It is important to note however, that our analysis has limitations. For  example, the indicators do not identify causal links between changes in  SIFI characteristics and the act. Rather, the indicators track changes in  the size, interconnectedness, complexity, leverage, and liquidity of SIFIs  since the passage of the act to examine if the changes have been  consistent with the goals of the act. However, other factors\u2014including  international banking standards agreed upon by the Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and monetary policy actions\u2014 also affect bank holding companies and, thus, the indicators. These  factors may have a greater effect than the Dodd-Frank Act on SIFIs.  Furthermore, because a number of rules implementing provisions related  to SIFIs have not yet been finalized, our indicators include the effects of  these rules only insofar as SIFIs have changed their behavior in response  to issued rules or in anticipation of expected rules.

These reforms may affect the safety and  soundness of bank SIFIs and the funding costs for bank SIFIs.  Specifically, capital and leverage requirements may help reduce the  probability of bank failures and promote financial stability. However, by  increasing funding costs for banks, the requirements might also cause  banks to raise lending rates and limit their ability to provide credit,  especially during a crisis. Similarly, while stricter liquidity requirements  may help reduce the probability of bank failures and promote financial  stability, banks could respond to these requirements by increasing  lending spreads to offset lower yields on assets or higher costs  associated with liabilities with longer maturities. To the extent that they  increase the cost and reduce the availability of credit, these reforms may  lead to reduced output and economic growth.", "Our analysis shows an association between the Dodd-Frank Act and an  increase in some indicators of SIFI safety and soundness. However, we  find no evidence of an association between the Dodd-Frank Act and  increased funding costs for bank SIFIs. Our econometric analysis  leverages the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that bank holding companies  with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more are subject to  enhanced regulation by the Federal Reserve but other bank holding  companies are not. Specifically, we compare funding costs, capital  adequacy, asset quality, earnings, and liquidity for bank SIFIs and non- SIFI bank holding companies before and after enactment of the Dodd- Frank Act. All else being equal, the difference in the comparative  differences is the inferred effect of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prudential  requirements on bank SIFIs.", "Our approach allows us to partially differentiate changes in funding costs,  capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, and liquidity associated with the  Dodd-Frank Act from changes due to other factors. However, several  factors make isolating and measuring the impact of the act\u2019s new  requirements for SIFIs challenging. For example, the effects of the act  cannot be differentiated from the effects of simultaneous changes in  economic conditions, such as the pace of the recovery from the recent  recession; regulations, such as those stemming from Basel III; or other  changes, such as changes in credit ratings that differentially may affect  bank SIFIs and other bank holding companies. In addition, some of the  new requirements for SIFIs have yet to be fully implemented. For  example, in August 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule that  established risk-based capital surcharges for the largest, most  interconnected SIFIs. Nevertheless, our estimates are suggestive of the  initial effects of the act on bank SIFIs and provide a baseline against  which to compare future trends.", "Our analysis suggests that the Dodd-Frank Act has not been associated  with a significant change in funding costs for bank SIFIs (see table 6). Our  measure of funding cost captures the interest paid on borrowed funds and  deposits. To the extent that the cost of credit provided by bank SIFIs is a  function of their funding costs, the new requirements for SIFIs appear to  have had little effect on the aggregate cost of credit to date via the  funding cost channel.", "Our estimates also suggest that the Dodd-Frank Act is associated with  improvements in some measures of bank SIFIs\u2019 safety and soundness.  Bank SIFIs appear to be holding more tangible common equity as a  percentage of assets than they otherwise would have held since Dodd- Frank Act enactment (see table 6). The quality of assets on the balance  sheets of bank SIFIs seems to have improved since enactment. The act  is also associated with improved liquidity as measured by the extent to  which a bank holding company is using stable sources of funding and  with higher earnings. However, capital adequacy as measured by total  bank holding company equity and liquidity as measured by the capacity of  a bank holding company\u2019s liquid assets to cover its volatile liabilities have  not clearly improved since enactment.

This set of indicators  may shed light on changes in the use of margin collateral associated with  Dodd-Frank Act swap reforms as they are implemented, but has several  key limitations, as described later in this section.", "Our margin indicators measure the fair value of collateral pledged by  counterparties to secure over-the-counter derivatives contracts as a  percentage of net current credit exposure to those counterparties for bank  holding companies. To protect itself from the loss it would incur if a  counterparty defaulted on a derivative contract, a swap entity could  require counterparties to post margin collateral in an amount equal to or  greater than its exposure to the contracts. An increase in collateral as a  percentage of credit exposure suggests that holding companies have  required their counterparties to post a greater amount of collateral against  their credit exposure due to derivatives contracts overall, which would be  consistent with the purposes of the act\u2019s swap reforms.", "Figure 4 shows trends in our margin indicators from the second quarter of  2009 through the second quarter of 2015. The rate of collateralization of  net current credit exposure to all counterparties has increased from about  71 percent in the third quarter of 2010 to about 104 percent in the second  quarter of 2015, suggesting that holding companies generally required  their counterparties to post a greater amount of collateral against their  derivatives contracts.

However, the rate of collateralization consistently  differed by the type of counterparty, with hedge funds consistently posting  more collateral as a percentage of credit exposure than other types of  counterparties. As we reported in December 2013, according to OCC, the  rates differ partly because swap dealers may require certain  counterparties to post both initial and variation margin and other  counterparties to post only variation margin. Depending on how the  margin rules are finalized, the rates of collateralization for some  counterparties may increase.", "Our margin indicators, while suggestive, are subject to important  limitations. First, they do not identify causal links between changes in  collateralization and the Dodd-Frank Act, including its regulations. Rather,  the set of indicators tracks changes in collateralization since the act\u2019s  passage to examine if the changes were consistent with the act\u2019s goals  for increasing collateralization. Second, both net current credit exposure  and the fair value of collateral are as of a point in time because the fair  values of derivatives contracts and collateral can fluctuate over time.  Third, an average collateralization of 100 percent does not ensure that all  current counterparty exposures have been eliminated, because one  counterparty\u2019s credit exposure may be overcollateralized and another\u2019s  undercollateralized. Fourth, our indicators measure the fair value of the  collateral held against net current credit exposures but do not necessarily  measure the risk of uncollateralized losses. The fair value of net current  credit exposure does not fully account for the riskiness of any single swap  contract. If a party has entered into riskier swaps, it is possible for the rate  of collateralization to increase while the risk of uncollateralized losses  also increases. Fifth, our indicators are market aggregates that may not  reflect the collateralization rate for any single company.

We compiled these rules from a website maintained by the Federal  Reserve Bank of St. Louis that tracks Dodd-Frank Act regulations. We  corroborated this information with staff from CFPB, Federal Reserve,  FDIC, OCC, NCUA, SEC, CFTC, and the Treasury. We asked these staff  to identify any other rulemaking that should be included. We reviewed  federal statutes, regulations, and GAO studies on these rules as well as  Federal Register releases that contain information on the regulatory  analyses conducted by agencies and their coordination efforts. Using  these materials, we identified the regulatory analyses, including benefit- cost analysis, required to be conducted by the agencies as part of their  Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings. Of the 26 rules in our scope, 15 were  substantive regulations, meaning that they were generally subject to  public notice and comment under the Administrative Procedure Act  (APA)\u2014and also required the agencies to conduct some form of  regulatory analysis. For each of the 15 rules, we reviewed the Federal  Register release of the final rule document and summarized the analyses  conducted by the regulators and Treasury. Using GAO\u2019s Federal Rules  database, we found that 6 of the 15 rules were classified by the Office of  Management and Budget as major rules under the Congressional Review  Act (CRA). That is, they resulted or are likely to result in an annual impact  on the economy of $100 million or more, a major increase in costs or  prices, or significant adverse effects on competition, employment,  investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of U.S.-based  enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or  export markets. For agencies subject to Executive Order (E.O.) 12,866,  such major rules would be considered significant regulatory actions and  subject to formal cost-benefit analysis.

While we started with a larger population of rules, we  specifically reviewed nine final rules that were identified by the community  banks and credit unions as potentially having an impact for the purpose of  this report. We reviewed the Federal Register releases for these final  rules and relevant material on the act and the final rules, as well as five  studies by federal and state regulators, industry associations, and  academics on the potential impact of the final rules on community banks  and credit unions. All but one study we reviewed relied on surveys of  banks, usually contacted through banking association member lists. The  final study consisted of a study of all payment card networks.

In determining our sample, we relied to the extent possible on  entities interviewed for our September 2012 report for continuity. As two  state bank community banking and credit union associations that we  previously interviewed declined to be re-interviewed, we used a  methodology similar to our September 2012 report to select  replacements. Using SNL Financial data on the number and percentage  of banks and credit unions in each state within different asset classes, we  selected one state banking association and one state credit union  association that (1) represented a higher-than-average percentage of  institutions within specific asset classes and (2) represented a larger  number of institutions within that asset class than other states.", "Additionally, we interviewed three community banks and two credit unions  that we previously interviewed in our September 2012 report and  randomly selected and interviewed one community bank and two credit  unions for the remainder. While the information we obtained from the  interviews provides useful insights, it cannot be used to make  generalizations about the experiences of all community banks and credit  unions since the selection of interviewees relied on non-probability  sampling methods.

A bank holding company\u2019s funding cost is the cost of  deposits or liabilities that it then uses to make loans or otherwise  acquire assets.

Capital absorbs losses, promotes public  confidence, helps restrict excessive asset growth, and provides  protection to creditors.

Asset quality reflects the quantity of existing and  potential credit risk associated with the institution\u2019s loan and  investment portfolios and other assets, as well as off-balance sheet  transactions. Asset quality also reflects the ability of management to  identify and manage credit risk.

Earnings are the initial safeguard against the risks of  engaging in the banking business and represent the first line of  defense against capital depletion that can result from declining asset  values.

Liquidity represents the ability to fund assets and meet  obligations as they become due, and liquidity risk is the risk of not  being able to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable  time period to meet obligations as they become due. We use two  different variables to measure liquidity. The first variable is liquid  assets as a percent of volatile liabilities. This variable is similar in spirit  to the liquidity coverage ratio introduced by the Basel Committee on  Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and measures a bank holding  company\u2019s capacity to meet its liquidity needs under a significantly  severe liquidity stress scenario. We measure liquid assets as the sum  of cash and balances due from depository institutions, securities (less  pledged securities), federal funds sold and reverse repurchases, and  trading assets.

This variable measures the extent to which a bank holding  company relies on stable funding sources to finance its assets and  activities. This variable is related in spirit to the net stable funding ratio  introduced by the Basel Committee, which measures the amount of stable  funding based on the liquidity characteristics of an institution\u2019s assets and  activities over a 1-year horizon. We measure stable funding as total  liabilities minus volatile liabilities as described earlier.", "Finally, we include a limited number of independent variables (Xbq) to  control for factors that may differentially affect SIFIs and non-SIFIs in the  quarters since the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. We include these  variables to reduce the likelihood that our estimates are reflecting  something other than the impact of the new Dodd-Frank Act requirements  for SIFIs.", "Securitization income. Bank holding companies with more income  from securitization are likely to have different business models than  those with more income from traditional banking associated with an  originate-to-hold strategy for loans. Changes in the market for  securitized products since enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act thus may  have had a greater effect on bank holding companies with more  securitization income. If bank SIFIs typically have more securitization  income than other bank holding companies, then changes in the  market for securitized products since enactment may have  differentially affected the two groups. We measure securitization  income as the sum of net servicing fees, net securitization income,  and interest and dividend income on mortgage-backed securities  minus associated interest expense, and express securitization as a  percent of operating revenue. Operating revenue is the sum of  interest income and noninterest income less interest expense and  loan loss provisions.", "Nontraditional income. Nontraditional income generally captures  income from capital market activities. Bank holding companies with  more nontraditional income are likely to have different business  models than those with more income from traditional banking  activities. Changes in capital markets since enactment of the Dodd- Frank Act may have had a greater effect on bank holding companies  with more nontraditional income. If bank SIFIs typically have more  nontraditional income than other bank holding companies, then  changes in capital markets since enactment may have differentially  affected the two groups. We measure nontraditional income as the  sum of trading revenue; investment banking, advisory, brokerage, and  underwriting fees and commissions; venture capital revenue;  insurance commissions and fees; and interest income from trading  assets less associated interest expense, and we express  nontraditional income as a percent of operating revenue.", "Foreign exposure. Changes in other countries, such as the sovereign  debt crisis in Europe, may have a larger effect on bank holding  companies with more foreign exposure. If bank SIFIs typically have  more foreign exposure than other bank holding companies, then  changes in foreign markets may have differentially affected the two  groups.

The quality of assets on  the balance sheets of bank SIFIs seems to have improved since  enactment. The act is also associated with improved liquidity as  measured by the extent to which a bank holding company is using stable  sources of funding and with higher earnings. However, capital adequacy  as measured by total bank holding company equity and liquidity as  measured by the capacity of a bank holding company\u2019s liquid assets to  cover its volatile liabilities have not clearly improved since enactment.  Thus, the Dodd-Frank Act appears to be associated with improvements in  some indicators of safety and soundness for bank SIFIs (relative to non- SIFI bank holding companies) but not others.", "Our approach allows us to partially differentiate changes in funding costs,  capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, and liquidity associated with the  Dodd-Frank Act from changes due to other factors. However, several  factors make isolating and measuring the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act  requirements for SIFIs challenging. The effects of the act cannot be  differentiated from the effects of simultaneous changes in economic  conditions, such as the pace of the recovery from the recent recession, or  regulations, such as those stemming from Basel III, or other changes,  such as in credit ratings that differentially may affect bank SIFIs and other  bank holding companies.
