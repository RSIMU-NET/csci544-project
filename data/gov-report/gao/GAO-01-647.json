The U.S. and EU approaches to nonreciprocal preferential trade have evolved in similar ways since their inception in the early 1970s.

Sensitive products are either excluded completely from coverage or provided access at a higher preferential duty than other covered products. For example, while the U.S. GSP offers duty- free treatment for all eligible products, it excludes completely from coverage sensitive products like textiles and apparel. The EU GSP scheme, on the other hand, offers incremental tariff reductions on the basis of a product\u2019s sensitivity.", "EU and U.S. programs also contain requirements regarding product origin, which all beneficiary countries must meet to receive preferential tariff rates on their products. \u201cRules of origin\u201d ensure that tariff advantages apply only to products actually produced in beneficiary countries. Producers in beneficiary countries may use imported materials to produce goods for export, provided the inputs comply with specific criteria outlined in the rules of origin for the preference program. For example, rules of origin may specify a maximum percentage of imported materials that can be included in a product or may require that specific amounts and types of processing be carried out on imported inputs in order for the final product to qualify for preferential treatment. Both the United States and the European Union allow, to a varying extent, countries to comply with rules of origin by cumulating inputs or sharing production processes with designated beneficiary countries or groups of countries. For example, under the U.S. GSP program, Botswana could use imported inputs from Tanzania in the production of a good for export to the United States because both beneficiaries are eligible for cumulation benefits as members of the Southern African Development Community. In general, allowing broader cumulation provides producers in beneficiary countries with greater flexibility in complying with rules of origin requirements.", "Finally, U.S. and EU trade preference programs contain eligibility requirements in the form of certain country practices.

The same was true for the dutiable exports of Benin and Zaire.", "Figure 1 also illustrates that, compared with the United States, imports from beneficiaries of EU nonreciprocal programs comprised a larger portion of total EU imports in 1999. One reason for this difference is that the European Union extended preferences to 20 countries that were not covered by the U.S. programs. For example, the EU GSP program gave preferences to certain imports from Malaysia and China. Imports from these two countries comprised about 30 percent of EU imports under the GSP program in 1999.

The European Union removed from GSP coverage a significant share of products from large beneficiary countries such as Malaysia and China, which contributed to this decline. However, the yearly imports under the EU GSP were more than double that of imports under all U.S. programs during the same period.

The European Union also intends that the economic partnership agreements will comply with World Trade Organization rules, thereby encouraging domestic and foreign investment in ACP countries and boosting their competitiveness in the world economy. An EU official told us that the ACP countries\u2019 ability to export must be strengthened through export-oriented assistance and by increasing trade among the beneficiary countries.

He believed that the economic partnership agreements held several advantages. While Everything But Arms offered greater access to the EU market, the economic partnership agreements encouraged ACP countries to open their own markets and attract long-term foreign investment. He believed that, rather than relying on trade preferences alone, the Cotonou Agreement used all means to increase trade, including the previously described trade-related financial assistance. The remaining 38 non-LDC ACP countries will be free to decide whether they are ready to negotiate these arrangements. In 2004, the European Union will evaluate the non-LDCs that are not in a position to join an economic partnership agreement and determine how to provide them with benefits tailored to their existing situations.", "While the United States is not phasing out its one-way preferences under its trade preference programs, it is moving toward reciprocity with many developing countries in its own hemisphere. Specifically, the United States is involved in negotiations to establish a Western Hemisphere free trade area known as the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). The FTAA would eliminate tariffs and create common trade and investment rules among the 34 democratic nations of the Western Hemisphere. Many of the 34 FTAA countries are beneficiaries of U.S. trade preference programs, including Brazil under GSP; Bolivia and Colombia under GSP and ATPA; and Costa Rica and El Salvador under GSP, CBERA, and CBTPA. However, one U.S. official commented that the extensive tariff preferences countries enjoy under nonreciprocal trade preference programs could diminish their incentive to negotiate free trade agreements. In fact, the CBTPA specifically states that it is the policy of the United States to offer benefits under the act to Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries willing to prepare for the FTAA or another free trade agreement.

More textile and apparel products were included in the CBERA and ATPA programs and in the GSP program for the LDCs, but many of the most commercially important products of these countries were still excluded. The United States did provide some CBERA beneficiary countries with virtually unlimited access for certain apparel products that met requirements on the use of U.S. textile inputs.

Second, preferences must actually be requested and producers must meet requirements on how and where the products are produced. In particular, experts and officials cited complex and restrictive U.S. and EU rules of origin requirements as a limitation on beneficiary countries\u2019 ability to fully use tariff preferences offered under the programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rules of Origin", "paragraphs": ["U.S. and EU preference programs\u2019 rules of origin are mainly intended to ensure that the tariff preferences are confined to the designated beneficiary countries. To qualify for preferences, producers in beneficiary countries must not only produce goods in accordance with rules of origin, but they must also document that the final product complies with the requirements. Although the U.S. and EU apply rules of origin differently, experts have noted that complexities associated with both rules of origin schemes limit beneficiary countries\u2019 ability to fully use the preferences. Key features and limitations of U.S. and EU preferential rules of origin are shown in figure 8.", "U.S. preferential rules of origin are based on minimum local content percentage criteria that require that the sum of the cost or value of the materials produced in the beneficiary country plus the direct costs of processing equal at least 35 percent of the appraised value at the time the product enters the United States. Imported materials may be used and counted toward the local content percentage requirement provided the materials have been \u201csubstantially transformed\u201d into new and different materials. Additionally, cumulation provisions under U.S. rules of origin consider certain regional groupings as one area for the purpose of complying with the percentage criteria. For example, a manufacturer in Colombia (an ATPA beneficiary country) could use imported materials from Bolivia (another ATPA beneficiary country), and the imported materials would be counted toward the minimum 35-percent local content requirement.", "Experts have cited several ways in which U.S. rules of origin limit beneficiaries\u2019 ability to use nonreciprocal preferences. First, UNCTAD and Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) officials said that the administrative costs and accounting sophistication required to calculate the percentage of local content create problems for producers in beneficiary developing countries. For example, although the 35-percent local content rule is simple in concept from a production standpoint, accounting for and documenting diverse direct costs, such as labor, research and design, fringe benefits, and blueprints, may require producers to account for costs not normally tracked in the course of commercial operations. Additionally, because the local content calculation is based on the appraised value of the product at the time that it enters the United States, exporters may not know the precise value and may miscalculate the local content percentage. Second, experts and our previous work have noted that the lack of a clear definition of what constitutes \u201csubstantial transformation\u201d makes it difficult for beneficiaries to accurately and consistently comply with the requirement.", "Rules of origin under the EU preferential trade programs are described in what is commonly referred to as the \u201cSingle List\u201d and are based on product-specific process criteria. EU rules of origin allow beneficiaries to use imported inputs in the production of goods for export, provided the inputs comply with the process criteria contained in the Single List. The process criteria may require, among other things, that imported inputs (1) undergo a change in tariff heading, (2) undergo specific working and processing, (3) not exceed a specified maximum percentage of the value of the final product, or (4) comply with a combination of the above criteria. Additionally, EU rules of origin under both the GSP and the ACP-EC agreements allow cumulation within specific regions, although the cumulation provisions contained in the ACP-EC are less restrictive.", "Experts have also noted problems with the EU scheme. UNCTAD and OECD officials said that the extent or type of processing required for some products can exceed producers\u2019 capacity or require producers to add an exceptionally high value in order to comply with the rules of origin\u2014 particularly for certain fish, processed food, and textile and apparel products. In addition to process requirements, experts have noted that the complexity and diversity of the rules contained in the Single List complicate documenting compliance with the EU rules of origin."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Program-related Factors", "paragraphs": ["Certain limitations on U.S. and EU GSP program tariff preferences are related to the programs\u2019 temporary nature. These limitations present a trade-off between reserving program preferences for beneficiary countries most in need and providing program stability to attract long-term foreign investment. For both the United States and the European Union, GSP program \u201cgraduation\u201d is meant to remove preferences when a country goes beyond a certain level of development, while GSP products can be removed from coverage if, among other reasons, they become sufficiently competitive in the U.S. market. GSP preferences have also been interrupted during the program authorization process. For example, since its implementation in 1976, the U.S. GSP program has been renewed seven times, with gaps in program coverage of up to 15 months. Regarding GSP country graduation, one U.S. official told us that it was politically difficult to retract GSP preferences because developing countries strongly oppose losing their preferences and are concerned that affected export industries might flee to other countries where preferences are still in place. An EU official believed that it should be easier to graduate more efficient, developed countries from its GSP program to prevent them from dominating program preferences. The EU official noted, however, that products should be harder to remove from GSP coverage. He commented that just as GSP beneficiary countries become competitive in exporting a product, the entire sector might be removed from the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Factors", "paragraphs": ["Experts and officials also identified external factors that may limit the program use. As MFN rates decline in multilateral trade negotiations, the value of preferential rates may be diluted. For example, the World Trade Organization calculated that following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations in 1994, developed countries had committed to reducing their tariffs on industrial goods from an average of 6.3 percent to 3.8 percent\u2014a 40-percent reduction. Tariffs on agricultural products were scheduled to fall by 37 percent. On the other hand, tariff rates on products that developing countries tend to export in greater quantities were to remain higher and be reduced less. For example, the Uruguay Round reduced the average tariffs weighted by developing country exports for textile and apparel products from 14.6 percent to 11.3 percent\u2014about a 23-percent reduction.", "Also, some poorer beneficiary countries may lack the capacity in terms of economic development and expertise to comply with program requirements in the first place. As mentioned in appendix IV, the EU\u2019s Cotonou Agreement provides trade-related assistance to help beneficiary countries improve their infrastructures and develop trade policies to enhance their export markets. Unlike the European Union, the United States has not incorporated financial aid into its trade agreements. However, in a slight departure from previous U.S. nonreciprocal trade programs, AGOA contains provisions for providing technical assistance to help build sub-Saharan countries\u2019 capacity to take advantage of program preferences. In addition, in July of 2000, the United States published a survey of the relevant U.S. government programs and activities that promote trade-related capacity building. The survey concluded that in the period covered (1999-2000), the United States government committed more than $600 million toward strengthening the trade-related capacity of developing countries and transitional economies. Such programs and activities include legal and regulatory reform, customs processes, infrastructure, and foreign investment incentives.", "Although both U.S. and EU program preferences have been shared fairly equally among upper-middle income to low-income countries, a small number of large developing countries (based on overall size of the economy) have tended to account for a greater portion of the trade preferences. For example, in 1999, Angola, Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia, and India accounted for 60 percent of the trade preferences under the U.S. GSP program. Similarly, in the same year, China, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Thailand accounted for 57 percent of the trade preferences under the EU GSP program.", "Finally, program officials and some beneficiary countries contend that preferences offered under new programs can undermine the preferences of existing programs. For example, supporters of Colombia\u2019s efforts to enhance preferences offered by the ATPA program claim that Colombia has lost part of its apparel industry to the beneficiaries of the new CBTPA program."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained oral comments on a draft of this report from officials from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, including the Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Trade and Development.

USTR also highlighted the fact that the U.S. GSP program provides duty-free treatment to eligible products, while the EU GSP program provides graduated duties that are based upon product sensitivity.  USTR disagreed with the characterization of U.S. rules of origin requirements as complex, and maintained that importers can use brokers and U.S. Customs binding rulings to clarify and interpret the rules.

The European Commission raised some general issues and provided several technical comments that we incorporated into the report as appropriate.  Overall, the European Community believed that our analysis implied too much similarity among U.S. and EU programs.  The EU also maintained that the major reasons for its program beneficiaries\u2019 lower use of program preferences compared with U.S. beneficiaries\u2019, was the EU GSP beneficiaries\u2019 ability to choose among multiple programs.  Regarding the similarity between U.S. and EU trade preference programs, this report does not compare every aspect of the U.S. and EU programs, but concludes that the programs have generally evolved in similar ways, and that they offer similar tariff-rate reductions on average.  Regarding the effect of multiple program eligibility on program use, we found that although EU beneficiaries utilize tariff preferences under the EU\u2019s other major program, ACP-EC Convention of Lome , to a greater extent than its GSP program, even the utilization rate of this program is less than 70 percent.

Some tariff rates are given as specific rates of duty (i.e., $5 per bushel) rather than ad valorem (percentage of value) rates.  Ad valorem equivalent (AVE) rates are conversions of specific rates to ad valorem rates in order to allow average tariff rates to be calculated. Although AVE rates are available for the United States, they are not available for the European Union.  Therefore, we did not use them in our analysis, and products subject to specific rates of duty are excluded from the tariff averages.  Also, we did not assess the impact of nontariff trade barriers, such as quotas, on trade flows.", "To assess U.S. trade flows, we analyzed data (imports for consumption) from the official Commerce statistics at customs value. To assess EU trade flows, we analyzed data on EU preferential trade provided by EUROSTAT, the official EU statistical organization. Data were only available on the EU GSP program from 1995 through 1999, and no data were available on the ACP program prior to 1999. EU preferential trade data have some limitations. First, the data are based on declarations by importers requesting preferential status and not on whether actual preference was granted. Countries or products not eligible for preference were screened out, but if the products were rejected trade preference status for another reason, this would not be apparent from the data. Second, the data may not capture all preferential trade since some ports of entry did not provide EUROSTAT with complete information. Total EU import data (normal imports) came from the EU\u2019s official trade statistics, COMEXT. Export data by country for all beneficiaries came from United Nations International Trade Statistics. To calculate utilization rates for each of the preference programs, we looked at the share of eligible trade (actual imports of products included in the programs) that actually received tariff benefits under the programs.  Some countries were able to receive benefits for the same products under multiple programs.  These countries tended to utilize regional programs rather than GSP when given the option. However, even these regional programs were not fully utilized and we chose to use all countries eligible for a program when reporting utilization rates.", "We performed our work from October 2000 through May 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: U.S. and EU Nonreciprocal Trade Preference Programs", "paragraphs": ["This appendix contains tables that describe the U.S. and EU nonreciprocal trade preference programs.
