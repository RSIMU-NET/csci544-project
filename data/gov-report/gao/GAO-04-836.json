Under the Act and its accompanying conference report, the conferees directed GAO to review measures taken by airlines to reduce costs, improve revenues and profits, and strengthen their balance sheets. The Congress also tasked airlines receiving assistance to report their cost-cutting plans to GAO. GAO was also required to report on the financial condition of the U.S. airline industry by Vision 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which became law in January 2004. In consultation with the Congress, GAO agreed to satisfy these directives and report to the Congress on (1) the major challenges to the airline industry since 1998, (2) measures airlines report taking to remain financially viable, (3) the current financial and operating condition of the industry, and (4) how the competitiveness of the domestic airline industry has changed since 1998."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["U.S. airlines, particularly major network or \"legacy\" airlines, have faced an unprecedented set of challenges since 1998 that are reshaping the industry and demand for air travel. The decline in business travel, followed by the September 11, 2001, attacks, caused a significant loss of operating revenue for many airlines. In response to these new challenges, the legacy airlines reported a goal of $19.5 billion in cost-cutting measures to restore their profitability through 2003. As a group, legacy airlines actually reduced their operating costs by $12.7 billion over the last 2 years. For legacy airlines, cost cutting was greatest in labor and commission costs. Meanwhile, low cost airlines, which as a group grew 26.1 percent during the last 2 years, reported little cost cutting. Since 2000, legacy airlines financial performance has deteriorated significantly, while low cost airlines have used their comparative cost advantage to expand their market share. Low cost airlines maintained their unit cost advantage over legacy airlines between 2000 and 2003, despite concerted cost cutting efforts by legacy airlines. For several of the legacy airlines, their weakened financial condition combined with significant future financial obligations makes their recovery uncertain. Competition in the domestic airline industry has increased since 1998, primarily owing to the growth and expansion of low cost airlines. Between 1998 and 2003, low cost airlines expanded their presence from 1,594 to 2,304 of the top 5,000 domestic markets and now have a presence in markets that serve about 85 percent of passengers. Legacy airlines, despite financial problems and reduced capacity, continued to serve nearly all of the markets in 2003 as in 1998, but carried fewer passengers as they lost market share to low cost airlines."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2001, the U.S. airline industry has confronted financial losses of  previously unseen proportions. Over the last 3 years, 2001 through 2003,  the airline industry reported losses of $23 billion, and two of the nation\u2019s  largest airlines went into bankruptcy. Following the tragic terrorist attack  of September 11, 2001, the U.S. government has provided struggling airlines  with $7 billion in direct assistance and many billions of dollars more in  indirect assistance in the form of loan guarantees, a tax holiday, and  pension relief. In April 2003, under the 2003 Emergency Wartime  Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-11) the federal government  provided $2.4 billion of direct financial assistance to the airline industry.", "The Congress, in the conference report accompanying the act, also directed  that we review measures taken by airlines to reduce costs, improve their  revenues and profits, and strengthen their balance sheets. Subsequent to  the Supplemental Appropriations Act, in January 2004, the Congress  required under the Vision 100\u2014Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act  that we report on the financial condition of the U.S. airline industry. In  consultation with the Congress, we agreed to answer the following key  questions to help satisfy these mandates: (1) What have been the major  challenges to the airline industry since 1998? (2) What measures have  airlines reported taking to remain financially viable? (3) What is the current  financial and operating condition of the airline industry? (4) How has the  competitiveness of the domestic airline industry changed since 1998?", "To help answer these questions, the Congress, in the conference report  accompanying the 2003 Emergency Wartime Supplemental Act, directed  the 64 U.S. commercial airlines that received assistance under the act to  provide us with a plan demonstrating how they would reduce their  operating expenses by 10 percent. Working with airlines, we devised a data  collection template for airlines to submit their financial plans (see app. I).    Because of the amount of information and proprietary nature of these  plans, for the purposes of this report, we focused our analysis on the 30  largest domestic airlines and aggregated the financial information  contained in these plans into one of three airline categories\u2014legacy  airlines, low cost airlines, and regional airlines (see app. II for a list of these airlines by category). The body of this report focuses on the cost-cutting  activities and financial condition of the largest seven legacy and largest  seven low cost airlines (in terms of passenger volume).   Although regional  airlines have carried more passengers over the past several years, they  have done so largely under contract with legacy airlines. Hence, we present  their results in appendix III. We also used airline financial and operating  data as reported to the Department of Transportation (DOT) to examine  airline financial condition and changes in competition in the largest 5,000  airline markets in the U.S. To assess the reliability of those data, we  reviewed the quality control procedures that DOT applies and subsequently  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also met with airlines and their trade associations, airline equity and credit  analysts, government experts, and academics to discuss airline cost-cutting  efforts and the current financial condition of airlines. We had sufficient  information to make informed judgments on the matters covered by this  report. We performed our work between December 2003 and August 2004  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1978, under the Airline Deregulation Act, the United States deregulated  its domestic airline industry.  The main purpose of deregulation was to  remove government control and open the air transport industry to market  forces. Prior to the Act, the Civil Aeronautics Board regulated all domestic  air transport, controlling fares and setting routes.  In this regulated market,  airlines competed more through advertising and onboard services than  through fares.  Similar to other highly regulated industries, the airline  industry was heavily unionized with a highly trained and stable workforce.", "In the years since deregulation, many studies, including ours, have found  that fares measured in real terms have fallen since 1978. For example, in  1999, we reported that overall airfares had fallen 21 percent in constant  dollars between 1990 and the second quarter of 1998. However, while  deregulation led to lower fares, it did not bring about the full measure of  competition envisioned by its creators. Legacy airlines created unique hub- and-spoke networks that increased service for consumers but kept local  market fares high at their dominated hubs. Generally, the legacy airlines  earned a premium for operating their hub and acted in a highly competitive  fashion (e.g. substantially increasing scheduled service and aggressive  pricing) against intruders, including low cost new entrant airlines. In many  ways, however, these legacy airlines continue to compete based on service  rather than fares.", "The U.S. commercial airline industry is capital-intensive, labor-intensive,  and has high fixed costs with revenues and profits closely tied to the  nation\u2019s business cycle. Fixed costs, including labor union contracts that  are in effect for several years at a time, comprise a large portion of airline  expenses and airlines must anticipate their capacity needs several years in  advance. As a result, airlines tend to place orders for aircraft during  profitable years, but deliveries tend to occur during down years.   This has  contributed to the cyclic nature of industry profitability. For example, in  the 1990s, the industry recorded historically high profits of $47.4 billion  from 1993 through 1999, during which time several airlines signed new  agreements with their contract work force and ordered new aircraft.  However, the industry has also experienced downturns at the beginning of  each decade since deregulation. The airline industry reported losses of   $2.5 billion from 1980 through 1982, $7.7 billion from 1990 through 1992,  and $23 billion from 2001 through 2003. It is during these lean times that  legacy airlines such as Braniff and Eastern failed, and others\u2014such as US  Airways and United more recently\u2014filed for bankruptcy protection. It is  also during these lean times that new entrant low cost airlines emerged. In  the past, many of those new airlines quickly disappeared. In response to the  latest downturn, the Congress provided several forms of financial relief,  including direct grants and a 4-month security fee holiday, and it set up the  Air Transportation Stabilization Board to provide up to $10 billion in loan  guarantees.", "The U.S. airline industry is principally composed of legacy, low cost, and  regional airlines; and while it is free of economic regulation, it remains  regulated in other respects, most notably safety and operating standards.  Legacy airlines are essentially those airlines that were in operation before  deregulation and whose goal is to provide service from \u201canywhere to  everywhere.\u201d To meet this goal, these airlines support large, complex hub- and-spoke operations with thousands of employees and hundreds of  aircraft (of various types) with service to domestic communities of all sizes  as well as international points at numerous fare levels. To enhance  revenues without expending capital, legacy airlines have entered into  domestic (and international) alliances that give them access to some  portion of each other\u2019s network. Legacy airlines contract with or separately  operate regional airlines to provide service to smaller communities;  regional airlines typically operate turboprop or regional jet aircraft with up  to 100 seats. Low cost airlines entered the marketplace after deregulation  and primarily operate point-to-point service from \u201cfocus cities\u201d using fewer  types of aircraft. These airlines typically offer a simplified fare structure  that was originally aimed at leisure passengers, but is increasingly  attractive to business passengers because they do not have restrictive  ticketing rules that make it significantly more expensive to purchase  tickets within 2 weeks of the flight or make changes to an existing itinerary.  Low cost airlines do not yet offer service outside Canada, Central America,  and the Caribbean. DOT oversees industry competition and safety,  including the air traffic control system. The Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which was  formed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was originally  part of DOT, oversees industry security, including passenger and baggage  screening."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airline Industry Facing Serious Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Although the airline industry was deregulated 26 years ago, during the last  several years, airlines have been presented with a sweeping set of  challenges. These challenges stem from the internal restructuring of the  airline industry and from external factors affecting the demand for air  travel. Internally, the impact of the Internet on how tickets are sold and  how consumers can search for fares, the emergence of low cost airlines as  a powerful market force, and the growth of regional airlines have had a  major impact on the airline industry. Coincidently, a series of largely  unforeseen events\u2014among them the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,  war in Iraq, and associated security concerns; the SARS crisis; economic  downturn; and a steep decline in business travel have seriously disrupted  the demand for air travel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Structural Changes Have Altered Historical Industry Trends", "paragraphs": ["Since 1998, the U.S. airline industry has faced internal changes that have  fundamentally altered the domestic airline industry. Among the most  significant factors affecting this change are the emergence of the Internet  and a new breed of low cost airlines, and the growth of regional airlines  have spurred the industry to reevaluate how it conducts business."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Increased Use of the Internet Has Lowered Airline Distribution Costs but Created Price Transparency and Downward Pressure on Airfares", "paragraphs": ["Since the mid-1990s, partly in response to increasing costs of global  distribution systems, airlines have increasingly sold and processed tickets  through Internet-based applications, such as airline Web sites, Orbitz, and  other internet-based travel agencies. Through various incentives, airlines  have encouraged some passengers to book a growing portion of tickets this  way (see fig. 1). This distribution method is less expensive to airlines than  traditional travel agencies, but it has also increased the ability of  consumers to compare airline ticket pricing and scheduling and often gives  consumers access to special low fares available only on the Internet. This  increased price transparency has been a significant factor in the downward  pressure on airfares, creating a real decline in airline passenger revenues at  the same time that airlines are incurring cost savings.", "Another major factor in the internal restructuring of the U.S. commercial  aviation industry is the growth of low cost airlines. Low cost airlines have  increased their share of available seat miles (ASM)\u2014an industry measure  of supply\u2014from 10.8 percent in 1998 to 17.5 percent in 2003 (see fig. 2).  Low cost airlines typically rely upon fewer types of aircraft and offer  simpler fare structures than legacy airlines. Unlike earlier low cost airlines,  many of which quickly disappeared, these airlines are well-capitalized and  offer a good overall product. As relative newcomers in the industry, these  airlines do not yet suffer from what is commonly know as \u201clegacy costs,\u201d  costs that older airlines incur simply due to their longevity. These include  the labor costs of a more senior workforce as well as retirees, aircraft costs  from maintaining several fleet types as well as older aircraft, and the costs  of maintaining networks.", "During this period of turmoil for the legacy airlines, their regional affiliates  have increased capacity and maintained profitability. Regional airlines,  which operate in affiliation with one or more legacy airlines, may be wholly  or partially owned by the partner airline or completely independent.  Regional airlines primarily serve smaller communities with regional jet or  turboprop aircraft through contractual arrangements with legacy carriers.  Many of these contracts are risk free for the regional airline because the  legacy partner pays a fee for the regional airline\u2019s service. From 1998  through 2003, the 16 largest regional airlines included in our study earned  an operating profit of $3.3 billion. At the same time, regional airlines  increased seat capacity 140.6 percent between 1998 and 2003 (see fig. 3).  This growth and profitability of the regional airlines came about because  legacy airlines transferred routes to them. Recently, two low cost  carriers\u2014AirTran and Frontier\u2014also partnered with regional airlines for  regional jet service. In contrast, JetBlue plans to introduce 100-seat  Embraer 190 regional jets into its own fleet for service in late 2005.  However, changes are looming for regional airlines. Legacy airlines are  seeking less expensive contracts with their regional partners.   In the case  of one of United Airline\u2019s former regional partners, Atlantic Coast Airlines  decided to reinvent itself as a low cost carrier, Independence Air, instead of  operating under a new contract with United or another airline. This may be  the first of several shake-ups in the legacy-regional airline partnerships, as  Delta Air Lines contemplates a bankruptcy filing and US Airways struggles  to avoid a second bankruptcy.

An economic downturn that began in  2000 precipitated a decrease in demand for air travel, while the terrorist  attacks of September 11, the Iraq War, and the outbreak of SARS have  compounded this trend. These events have accelerated the structural  changes in the demand for air travel that is likely to suppress revenue for  the foreseeable future, including the inability of airlines to charge premium  business fares.", "Airlines\u2019 financial problems of the past 4 years began with an economic  downturn in 2000. As illustrated in figure 4 below, industry experts have  long recognized a relationship between the nation\u2019s economic performance  and the demand for air travel. The growth in the nation\u2019s gross domestic  product (GDP) most recently peaked in 1999 before falling to 0.5 percent in  2001, and then rebounding in 2002. This coincided with a drop in demand  for air travel from a high of 691 billion revenue passenger miles (RPM) in  2000 to a low of 641 billion RPMs in 2002. While this time period includes  September 11, quarterly year-over-year data reveals a clear downward  trend in RPM growth prior to September 11; RPM growth reached a peak of  8.9 percent in the second quarter of 2000, with a recession in air travel  beginning in the second quarter of 2001.", "The terrorist events of September 11 compounded the decline in demand  for air travel in the United States.

Figure 5 presents FAA forecasts of RPMS for June  of 2001 through March of 2004, and actual RPMS for 1998 through 2003.", "The effects of the war in Iraq and the outbreak of SARS on demand for air  travel were relatively minimal compared with the effects of September 11.  Actual demand in 2003 was about the same as it was in 2002. FAA\u2019s demand  forecast after the Iraq War began and the SARS outbreak was revised  upward an average of 8 percent for 2004 through 2012. FAA staff we  interviewed thought that the SARS effect, while significant, was limited to  Pacific air travel; year-over-year RPMs dropped 33 percent for the second  quarter of 2003 in the Pacific sector.", "The Iraq War and unrest in the Middle East also contributed to rising fuel  costs for airlines. From the first quarter of 2002 through the first quarter of  2004, the price of oil per barrel increased from $20.98 to $32.97; an increase  of 57 percent. However, oil prices are volatile by nature, and many airlines  hedge some portion of their oil and fuel costs to lock in these costs. Figure  6 presents the cost of oil per barrel from 1998 through the first quarter of  2004.", "The decline in business fares is another factor that has contributed to the  financial problems of the industry. During the late 1990s, legacy airlines\u2019  profitability became increasingly reliant on a very small percentage of last  minute business travelers that paid fares much higher than the average  leisure fare. As the economy soured in 2001, business travelers became less  willing to pay premium fares. According to Air Transport Association (ATA)  data reported by the DOT Inspector General, the number of business  travelers declined 26 percent from December 2001 through December 2002. Moreover, the average one-way business fare also declined nearly 10  percent, from $672 in the first quarter of 2001 to $607, in the first quarter of  2004 (see fig. 7)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "In Response to Challenges, Legacy Airlines Reduced Costs and Cut Capacity, While Low Cost Airlines\u2019 Total Costs Increased Due to Capacity Expansion", "paragraphs": ["To meet the many challenges of the last several years, airlines have sought  to cut costs, enhance revenues, and obtain the assistance of the federal  government.

The only  cost category to increase for legacy airlines was transport-related  expenses, which doubled during the period, an increase of $3.9 billion  annually. Increases in transport-related expenses for legacy airlines are  largely due to fees being paid to regional airline partners for providing  regional air service.

Figure 12 shows legacy and low  cost airlines\u2019 unit cost curves for 2000 and 2003 and suggests that the gap  between legacy and low cost airlines\u2019 unit costs has widened across all  distances.

Some of the legacy airline unit  cost increase is due to the capacity purchased from regional airlines\u2014an  increase in operating expenses (the numerator) but without a  corresponding increase in available seat miles (ASM) (the denominator) in  the unit cost calculation. However, this does not account for all or even  most of the gap between legacy and low cost airlines\u2019 unit costs.", "To account for this unit cost difference between legacy and low cost  airlines, we also examined legacy and low cost airline unit costs over time  and the various cost items that comprise total operating expenses. Overall,  we found that the gap in aggregated (for all stage lengths) unit costs for  legacy and low cost airlines has widened since 2000, from 2.1 cents per  ASM to 3.8 cents at the end of 2003. The size of this gap may be somewhat  overstated because of a change in the financial reporting requirements for  airlines during this time. Beginning in 2003, airlines were required to report  the cost of buying additional capacity from regional airlines under  transport-related expenses. To calculate the legacy airlines\u2019 unit costs  correctly under this new reporting requirement, the ASMs that the legacy  airlines buy from the regional airlines should also be included in calculating  their unit costs. We could not incorporate this into our calculation because  the exact amount of capacity purchased by legacy airlines and the amount  of money spent on capacity purchased from regional airlines are not  reported in sufficient detail to do so. However, to indicate legacy airlines\u2019  minimum unit costs, we calculated legacy airlines unit costs excluding  transport-related expenses (low cost airlines reported very little transport- related expenses). Accordingly, the unit cost difference between legacy and  low cost airlines grew from 1.6 cents per ASM in 2000 to 2.5 cents in 2003.", "Figure 13 shows the gap between legacy and low cost airlines\u2019 unit costs,  including and excluding transport-related expenses.", "The two primary cost components that comprise the unit cost differential  between legacy airlines and low cost airlines are labor costs and asset- related costs. Legacy airlines have high labor costs owing to a highly  tenured, unionized workforce. Low cost airlines are able to suppress unit  costs by achieving higher levels of labor productivity than legacy airlines.  Legacy airlines have higher asset-related costs than low cost airlines  because legacy airlines generally have older fleets and different fleet  structures than low cost airlines. Additionally, because legacy airlines  generally operate hub-and-spoke business models in comparison to the  point-to-point model generally operated by low cost airlines, legacy airlines  are not able to achieve the same level of asset utilization as low cost  airlines. Other costs that currently comprise the remaining unit cost  difference between legacy airlines and low cost airlines include expenses  for items such as fuel, passenger ticketing commissions, and passenger  food.", "Labor costs accounted for over 40 percent of the unit cost difference  between legacy airlines and low cost airlines in 2003. Legacy airlines\u2019 high  labor costs are the result of a highly tenured workforce, higher pension  costs, and work rules that differ from their low cost competitors. Low cost  airlines have been effective at keeping unit labor costs down by achieving  higher labor productivity and paying less. Legacy airlines have made  progress in improving labor productivity since 2001, but they continue to  trail low cost airlines, which have steadily improved labor productivity  since 1998. As Figure 14 illustrates, in 2003 legacy airlines had improved  labor productivity 8.3 percent, compared with 1998, by increasing the  number of ASMs produced per employee. However, in 2003 they still  produced 7 percent fewer ASMs per employee than low cost airlines.", "Legacy airlines encounter higher asset-related unit costs than low cost  airlines because legacy airlines have older fleets and more types of aircraft  in their fleets than low cost airlines, and legacy airlines put their planes in  the air fewer hours per day than low cost airlines. Legacy airlines own  older aircraft than many low cost airlines; and older aircraft can be  expensive to operate because they are less fuel-efficient than newer  aircraft, and they have higher maintenance costs. Additionally, legacy  airlines usually have more types of aircraft in their fleets, adding to  maintenance costs and pilot training costs. Moreover, because legacy  airlines generally operate a hub-and-spoke business model, they are not  able to operate their aircraft for as many block hours per day as low cost airlines. Low cost airlines typically operate a point-to-point business  model that allows them to limit the amount of time a plane must spend on  the ground from the time it lands until it is ready to take off again. Figure 15  demonstrates the asset utilization differential that exists between legacy  airlines and low cost airlines when measured in block hours per day per  aircraft in service. Legacy airlines have improved asset utilization since the  events of September 11; however, despite these improvements, they  continue to trail low cost airlines with respect to asset utilization trends.", "Other operating expenses that explain the unit cost difference between  legacy airlines and low cost airlines include items such as aircraft fuel and  oil, passenger food, and passenger commissions related to ticketing.

However, industry revenues only totaled $77  billion in 2003, which represents just under 80 percent of the 2000 level.  The revenue picture is significantly different when comparing legacy  airlines with low cost airlines. Legacy airline passenger revenues are down  28 percent from 2000 through 2003, while low cost airlines have increased  passenger revenues over 12 percent.

The trends are similar for both the legacy  airlines and low cost airlines; legacy yields dropped about 19 percent, while  low cost airline yields dropped about 17 percent.", "In addition, the gap between the legacy airline yields and the low cost  airline yields has narrowed. Legacy carriers are often able to command a  higher fare\u2014or \u201crevenue premium\u201d\u2014compared with low cost airlines  because passengers will often pay more for the benefits of a network  structure. Accordingly, legacy airline officials have stated that they do not  need to lower their costs to the same levels as low cost airlines because  they can command a revenue premium. This ability to command a revenue  premium, however, appears to be eroding. The revenue premium  commanded by the legacy airlines has fallen from 9.8 percent to 6.4 percent  from 1998 to 2003\u2014a 45 percent decrease. Moreover, this revenue premium  is less than half of the 15 percent to 16 percent revenue premium one  legacy airline stated that they expected to be able to command.", "The primary factor differentiating legacy and low cost airline revenue  performance is the change in demand. Demand (as measured in RPMs) is  down 11 percent for legacy airlines from 2000 through 2003, while demand  for low cost airlines has risen nearly 37 percent (see fig. 18). Low cost  airlines have expanded their operations and market share enough to  increase revenues in a lower yield environment and can do so profitably  because of their lower cost structure. Legacy airlines are simply flying  fewer people at lower fares, which represent decreases in both factors of  the revenue equation. Although nearly as many passengers are flying as  before September 11, they are paying less to do so and choosing to fly on  low cost airlines more often.", "It appears low fares will continue to depress revenues during 2004 since  airlines continue to add capacity. A year-over-year comparison of ASMs for  the first quarter of 2004 indicates capacity is up over 7 percent from 2003.  Airlines generally add capacity to compete for or defend market share.  Legacy airlines are adding capacity because they possess excess capacity  that can be added at relatively low marginal costs. Collectively, however,  this strategy is problematic because the additional capacity depresses fares  further.

Since 2001, legacy airlines have taken on  more debt, relying on creditors for more of their capital needs than in the  past. Higher debt levels leads to greater interest expenses and can make  raising additional capital more difficult. Low cost airlines also increased  their debt levels, but not as much, and their solvency (or long-term  prospects of repaying the debt) has not deteriorated to the same extent as  legacy airlines.

However, low  cost airlines have built proportionally larger cash balances and did it  primarily by generating cash from operations, as well as modest borrowing.  In contrast, legacy airlines built cash balances after September 11,  principally by borrowing. More recently, losses have depleted cash  balances and legacy airlines\u2019 ability to meet current obligations has not  improved. During 2002 and 2003, low cost airlines built cash balances by  generating cash from operations, while legacy airlines continued to lose  cash from operations and compensated for operating losses by taking on  additional debt. In 2003, low cost airlines generated approximately $2.2  million in cash per day while legacy airlines depleted their cash reserves at  a rate of approximately $682,000 per day. Low cost airlines maintain more  favorable liquidity measures than legacy airlines, and the differential  between the two groups of airlines is widening.", "Since legacy airlines have issued debt to cover operating losses, they  continue to be more highly leveraged than low cost airlines, indicating that  low cost airlines are more likely to be able to fulfill their long-term financial  obligations than legacy airlines, and the gap between the airline groups is  growing.

In the process of taking on  additional debt, several legacy airlines have used all or nearly all of their  assets as collateral, limiting their access to capital markets.

Before 2000,  large legacy airlines, all of which predated deregulation, dominated the  domestic airline industry. These airlines competed on the basis of their  networks and onboard amenities as well as fares; profits were earned by  maximizing revenues from high-value business travelers. While low cost  airlines competed in some markets, as a whole, they never accounted for a  significant segment of the industry and rarely took on a legacy airline  directly. In the past, new entrant low cost airlines rarely survived an entire  business cycle. However in recent years this pattern has changed, perhaps  permanently. Significant structural change combined with severe demand  shocks has presented unprecedented challenges to the airline industry,  especially for legacy airlines. Legacy airlines, burdened by significant costs  of labor contracts and pension plans negotiated during profitable years and  an extensive and costly network infrastructure, have found it difficult to  reduce costs quickly enough to restore profitability. The scale of cost- cutting reported to us by legacy airlines was not fully achieved and, most  importantly, legacy airlines were no more cost competitive with low cost  airlines in 2003 than they were in 2000.", "Meanwhile, low cost airlines are using their cost advantage to expand their  market share and challenge legacy airlines like never before. While  industry traffic has recovered to pre-September 11 levels, profitability for  legacy airlines has not, owing to higher costs and weak fare growth. Three  years of losses have left legacy airlines in a weakened financial condition  with large debt and pension obligations looming in the next few years. The  potential for airlines to earn large profits during up-cycles to cover losses  during down-cycles, as they did during the 1990s, appears to have come  undone this decade. Whether legacy airlines can effectively compete with  low cost airlines and regain profitability will depend on their ability to  further reduce their unit costs and gain a revenue premium associated with  network service that connects smaller U.S. communities with international  destinations\u2014a service that low cost airlines do not now offer. The  survivability of legacy carriers may well depend on their ability to do so\u2014 certainly, they cannot continue to sustain losses like those incurred over  the past few years.

To analyze changes in competition based on the size of  the passenger markets, we divided the markets into four groupings based  on 1998 passenger traffic: less than 85,000 passengers; 85,000 to 289,999  passengers; 290,000 to 839,999 passengers; and 840,000 and more  passengers. Each group comprised one-quarter of the total passenger  traffic in 1998. To stratify these markets by the number of carriers  operating, we used the following categories: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more  carriers. To stratify the data by market distance, we obtained the great circle distance for each market using the BACK Aviation Solutions  database and then grouped the markets into five distance categories: up to  250 miles; 251-500 miles; 501-750 miles; 751-1,000 miles; and 1,001 miles and  over. To assess changes in competition in these markets, we analyzed  changes in passenger traffic by market type and airline type, changes in the  number of markets according the various stratifications we developed,  determined the number of dominated markets, and calculated the average  number of effective competitors in each market for each year as well as  the average annual number of effective competitors per market grouping.", "We had access to sufficient information to make informed judgments on  the matters covered by this report.
