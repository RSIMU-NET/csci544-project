It required the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to create a transitional work permit program for foreign workers in the CNMI and to decrease the number of permits issued annually, and presently requires that DHS reduce them to zero by December 31, 2019. To implement this aspect of the law, in 2011, DHS created a CW-1 permit program for foreign workers.", "In addition to the above statutory provisions, GAO was asked to review the implementation of federal immigration laws in the CNMI.

GAO reviewed U.S. laws and regulations; analyzed government data; and conducted fieldwork in Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, CNMI.

By 2015, the number of employed CNMI workers was about 8 percent higher than in 2013, and inflation-adjusted average earnings had risen by 18 percent from 2007 levels. By 2016, about 62 percent of CNMI workers were directly affected by CNMI's minimum wage hike to $6.55 per hour. In 2015, foreign workers, who totaled 12,784, made up more than half of the CNMI workforce and filled 80 percent of all hospitality and construction jobs, according to GAO's analysis of CNMI tax data.", "If all workers with CNMI-Only transitional worker (CW-1) permits, or 45 percent of total workers in 2015, were removed from the CNMI's labor market, GAO projects a 26 to 62 percent reduction in CNMI's 2015 gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014the most recent GDP available. Demand for foreign workers in the CNMI exceeded the available number of CW-1 permits in 2016\u2014many approved for workers from China and workers in construction occupations. The construction of a new casino in Saipan is a key factor in this demand (see photos taken both before and during construction in 2016). Meanwhile, by 2019, plans for additional hotels, casinos, and other projects estimate needing thousands of new employees. When the CW-1 permit program ends in 2019, available data show that the unemployed domestic workforce, estimated at 2,386 in 2016, will be well below the CNMI's demand for labor. To meet this demand, CNMI employers may need to recruit U.S.-eligible workers from the U.S. states, U.S. territories, and the freely associated states (the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau).", "Federal and CNMI efforts to address labor force challenges include (1) job training programs offered by Northern Marianas College, Northern Marianas Trades Institute, and the CNMI's Public School System; (2) employment assistance funded by the U.S. Department of Labor and implemented by the CNMI's Department of Labor; and (3) technical assistance provided by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

In  other simulations, we assumed that domestic and CW-1 workers were  complements, implying that domestic workers would become less  productive as the number of CW-1 workers fell.

Applying this factor to an analysis of the CNMI\u2019s current economic situation  suggests that a reduction in the number of foreign workers with CW-1  permits to zero\u2014which would be equivalent to reducing the number of  total workers by 45 percent, all else unchanged\u2014would lead to a 37  percent contraction in the size of the CNMI economy as measured by  GDP.

The first issue involved immigration and labor matters  affecting the growth potential of the CNMI economy, and the second  issue concerned proposed and ongoing military activities in the CNMI.  In May 2016, President Obama designated the DOI Assistant Secretary  for Insular Areas as the Special Representative for the United States for  902 Consultations. The CNMI Governor was designated the Special  Representative for the CNMI. In December 2016, after 8 months of official  consultations, informal discussions, and site visits to locations in the  CNMI, the Special Representatives transmitted a report to the President  that included six recommendations on immigration and labor matters.  These recommendations included proposals for legislative amendments,  regulatory changes, or DHS actions. On January 17, 2017, the report was  submitted to Congress, marking the first known time a 902 Report has  been submitted to Congress since the U.S.\u2013CNMI Covenant was fully  implemented in 1986, according to DOI. The report\u2019s recommendations  were as follows:  1.  Extending the CW program beyond 2019 and other amendments,  such as raising the CW-1 cap and restoring the executive branch\u2019s  authority to extend the CW program. According to the report, Public  Law 113-235 repealed the U.S. Secretary of Labor\u2019s authority to  extend the transition period beyond 2019. The report states that the  CNMI seeks to extend the transition period by 10 years from  December 31, 2019, to December 31, 2029; to allow the Secretary of  Labor to grant a 5-year extension past this date; and to increase the  numerical limit of CW-1 visas from 12,998 to 18,000 per fiscal year.", "The Special Representatives support an extension of the transition  period, restoring extension authority, and raising the CW-1 cap.  2.  Providing permanent status for long-term guest workers. The Special  Representatives support congressional action to make long-term  guest workers and their families with significant equities in the CNMI  eligible for lawful permanent resident status with a path to citizenship.  According to the report, it is the CNMI\u2019s position that long-term guest  workers, through their continued presence and contributions to the  CNMI, are intertwined with the economic development and growth of  the commonwealth. However, these individuals have no path to lawful  permanent residence, according to the report. The report states that  the CNMI would like to recognize their important contributions to a  place many consider home, in some cases for more than 20 years, by  offering them a path to lawful permanent residence.  3.  Soliciting input on suggested regulatory changes to the CW program.  According to the report, the CNMI\u2019s position is that DHS\u2019s \u201cfirst-come,  first-served\u201d application system for CW-1 permits has resulted in the  displacement of current and long-time CW-1 workers by new workers.  In addition, long-time guest workers who have built families, homes,  and lives in the CNMI are unprotected and are not given priority within  the overall numerical allocation of CW-1 permits. The CNMI\u2019s position  is that its Department of Labor should have a role in determining what  employers should be deemed eligible to sponsor foreign labor workers  under the CW program. For these reasons, the CNMI suggested  several regulatory changes that DHS could implement, such as  prioritizing renewals of CW-1 permits over new CW-1 applications,  establishing a separate numerical allocation for long-term CW-1  workers, and partnering with the CNMI on the distribution and  allocation of available permits. The Special Representatives  recommend that DHS publish a Request for Information to solicit input  from a variety of parties on various regulatory changes, including  those proposed by the CNMI.  4.  Considering immigration policies to address regional labor shortages.", "According to the report, the CNMI believes that many of the newer  CW-1 applications are for Chinese construction workers, and a CW  system with a disproportionate allocation of permits for construction  workers could hamper the development of its service sector. For this  reason, according to the report, the CNMI calls for making Chinese  nationals eligible for H-2B visas for work performed in the CNMI. In  addition, because of the special needs of the region, the CNMI calls  for amending U.S. immigration laws to create additional Guam or  CNMI-Only nonimmigrant visa categories for which current law does  not provide. Finally, because of its geographic distance from Hawaii  and the U.S. continent, and its location in the Asia-Pacific region, the  CNMI calls for new legislation to expand the current Guam and CNMI- Only Visa Waiver Program, which allows eligible visitors from  designated countries to travel to the CNMI for business or pleasure for  up to 45 days without standard federal visa documentation. The  Special Representatives support Congress\u2019s consideration of  extending and expanding existing immigration policies or developing  new policies to address systemic regional workforce challenges  currently being experienced in both Guam and the CNMI.  5.  Extending eligibility to the CNMI for additional federal workforce  development programs. According to the report, unlike the CNMI,  several U.S. states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands are eligible to receive  grants to provide for the employment services authorized under the  Wagner-Peyser Act. Extending this program to the CNMI (and  American Samoa) would ensure that all the territories are treated  equally, according to the CNMI. The Special Representatives  recommend that DOI\u2019s Office of Insular Affairs work cooperatively with  DOL to extend the Wagner-Peyser Act to the CNMI.  6.  Establishing a cooperative working relationship between DHS and the  CNMI. According to the report, in recent years, the CNMI Department  of Labor has filed Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain  information regarding the approved CW-1 permit holders and would  like an easier DHS process for obtaining data from USCIS on the CW  program. According to the CNMI\u2019s Secretary of Labor, the CNMI  Department of Labor has a very good working relationship with DHS  but could benefit from more coordination on data inquiries. The  Special Representatives recommend that DHS and the CNMI work  cooperatively to exchange information and continue existing efforts to  educate employers about applying for alternative nonimmigrant visas  in place of the CW-1 visa when appropriate.", "The U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security has the discretion under current  law to implement the two recommendations directed at DHS, according to  DHS\u2019s Acting Deputy Chief Counsel. However, he noted that  implementing the other recommendations could require enacting new  legislation. DOI\u2019s Office of Insular Affairs will, as appropriate, consult with  DHS and Congress regarding implementation of the 902 Report  recommendations, according to the Acting Assistant Secretary.

The bill would  amend Public Law 94-241 to increase the number of CW-1 permits to  15,000 in 2017 and, among other things, would exclude certain  construction occupations from eligibility for new CW-1 permits and  increase the CW-1 vocational education fee from $150 to $200.

In November and December 2016, we conducted  fieldwork in Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, CNMI, where we interviewed the  CNMI Governor, the Mayors of Tinian and Rota, and the CNMI  Secretaries of Commerce, Finance, and Labor. We also conducted  discussion groups and semistructured interviews with selected  employers, CW-1 workers, U.S. workers currently employed by CNMI  businesses, and students or graduates of the CNMI\u2019s job training  programs. We worked with organizations in the CNMI whose officials we  had interviewed prior to our arrival in order to schedule the discussion  group sessions, recruit session participants, and obtain space for holding  the sessions. For example, we asked the Saipan Chamber of Commerce,  Tinian Chamber of Commerce, and the Rota Department of Commerce to  help us schedule discussion groups with representatives of various local  businesses. Similarly, we asked the Hotel Association of the Northern  Mariana Islands to help us schedule semistructured interviews with  selected hotel executives.", "For background, we described the CNMI\u2019s geography, its history, and its  political relationship with the United States by reviewing U.S. and CNMI  laws, DHS regulations and documents, previous GAO reports, the U.S.  Census Bureau\u2019s decennial census for the CNMI, and estimates of the  CNMI\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) published by DOC\u2019s Bureau of  Economic Analysis. All GDP levels were adjusted for inflation to 2015  dollars. We also analyzed visitor arrival data gathered by the Marianas  Visitor Authority from customs declarations forms for fiscal years 1990  through 2016, which we deemed sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also obtained and analyzed DHS\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) data on airport admissions at the Saipan and Rota airports from  2010 through 2016 to understand the number of travelers granted parole.  Despite delays in CBP\u2019s processing of the CNMI\u2019s airport admissions  data and CBP officers\u2019 gradual adherence to new operational guidance,  we determined that CBP data were reliable for our purposes by  interviewing CBP data analysts and obtaining answers to our data  reliability questions. Finally, we analyzed 2003\u20132015 data provided by the  Hotel Association of the Northern Mariana Islands on hotel occupancy  and room rates and adjusted those rates to 2015 prices based on  inflation.", "To evaluate changes in the CNMI\u2019s labor market since the federally  mandated minimum wage increases began, we (1) analyzed overall  employment data for all domestic and foreign workers in the CNMI,  (2) estimated inflation adjusted average earnings, (3) determined the  industries and occupations with the highest numbers of CNMI workers  affected by the current and scheduled minimum wage increases, and  (4) obtained employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 opinions about the minimum  wage increases.", "To analyze overall employment in the CNMI, we relied on tax data  provided by the CNMI\u2019s Department of Finance for calendar years  2001 to 2015 for citizens and noncitizens. We defined citizens as  domestic workers, or anyone that did not require a visa for  employment in the CNMI, including citizens of the United States, the  CNMI, and the freely associated states (Federated States of  Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Republic of Palau).  All noncitizens or nondomestic workers were classified as foreign  workers. We used the same data source for three prior GAO reviews  of minimum wage changes in the CNMI. We also interviewed CNMI  officials who prepared the tax data to understand how the data were  prepared and any limitations. We reviewed the data to determine  consistency, identified fluctuations, and consulted with CNMI officials  to determine possible explanations for fluctuations. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  Undocumented foreign workers were excluded from the scope of our  review.", "To estimate inflation adjusted average earnings, we also relied on  CNMI tax data from 2003 through 2015, with counts of the number of  individuals in different ranges of earnings. To calculate mean wages  in the CNMI, we divided the total sum of earnings by the number of  workers with non-zero wages per calendar year from 2003 through  2015. All dollar values were adjusted to 2015 prices based on the  CNMI\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI). Because the U.S. Bureau of  Labor Statistics collects CPI data on the 50 U.S. states but not the  CNMI, we relied on other sources of data to compare changes in  earnings or wage rates to changes in prices. We obtained historical  data on the CPI from the CNMI\u2019s Department of Commerce. To  produce an annual CPI series, we analyzed quarterly CPI data from  the first quarter of 2003 to the fourth quarter of 2014 and averaged the  four quarters in each year. To obtain the CPI for 2015, which was not  available from the CNMI\u2019s Department of Commerce, we followed a  methodology used by DOC\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis that  applied Guam\u2019s inflation rate to the CNMI. We also interviewed CNMI  officials responsible for producing the quarterly CPI estimates to  understand how the data were prepared and any limitations to the  data and concluded that the CPI data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our review.", "To determine the industries and occupations with the highest numbers  and percentages of CNMI foreign and domestic workers affected by  the current and scheduled minimum wage increases, we analyzed the  results of the CNMI\u2019s 2014 Prevailing Wage Study; assumed all 2014  workers maintained employment; and projected the numbers and  percentages of workers directly affected by the scheduled 2016, 2017,  and 2018 wage increases. We restricted our analysis to scheduled  minimum wage increases, not those that could happen under possible  future legislation. We then determined the industries and occupations  with the largest numbers of workers directly affected by current and  scheduled wage increases by counting the number of hourly wage  workers in 2014 who earned less than or equal to the level of 2016,  2017, and 2018 minimum wage by industry and occupation. We  determined the data contained in the CNMI\u2019s 2014 Prevailing Wage  Study to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review by  interviewing CNMI officials who gathered and analyzed the original  data and obtaining answers to our data reliability questions.", "To obtain local employers\u2019 opinions about the minimum wage  increase, we reviewed results of a survey conducted in 2016 by the  Saipan Chamber of Commerce, gathered survey results, and  interviewed board members of the Saipan Chamber of Commerce.  We also facilitated four discussion groups and conducted seven  semistructured interviews with representatives of 42 employers  operating on Saipan, Tinian, and Rota in the CNMI. Discussion  groups were held with representatives of selected businesses in  Saipan, Tinian, and Rota, with groups ranging in size from 4 to 16  participants. Semistructured interviews were held with selected larger  employers in Saipan. During discussion groups and semistructured  interviews, we asked the same two questions about (1) the effect of  and business response to the federal minimum wage increase to  $6.55 in October 2016 and (2) the possible future effect of and  business response to the federal minimum wage increase to $7.25  scheduled to occur in October 2018. We selected a nonprobability  sample of employers for participation in our discussion groups and  semistructured interviews. Therefore, views reported by participants in  these groups may not be representative of those of all CNMI  employers and for that reason are not generalizable.", "To evaluate the potential economic impact of reducing the number of  foreign workers in the CNMI to zero and replacing them with domestic  workers, we (1) developed an economic model that simulates how the  CNMI\u2019s GDP would change if the number of CNMI-Only transitional  worker (CW-1) permits were reduced to zero, (2) evaluated the local  supply and demand for labor, and (3) obtained local employers\u2019 and  employees\u2019 opinions about the past and scheduled reduction in foreign  workers.", "To develop an economic model that simulates how the CNMI\u2019s GDP  would change if the number of CW-1 permits were reduced to zero,  we adapted an economic model that we used in a prior GAO report.  The model relied on assumptions regarding the substitutability  similarity of the domestic and foreign workforces. In this report, we  also relied on reports produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis  on GDP in the CNMI from 2011 to 2015. We presented the change in  GDP based from its 2015 value. We examined the possible range of  effects from a reduction in foreign workers by calculating the effect on  GDP under a range of assumptions. Specifically, we simulated the  effect on GDP varying the assumptions regarding the ability of CNMI  domestic workers to substitute for foreign workers and the effect of a  reduction in labor (see app VI).To check this analysis, we developed  a separate analysis that examined the relationship between GDP and  the number of workers in the CNMI from 2002 to 2015. We found that  the two factors were indeed related but that relationships differed by  industry (see app V).", "To evaluate the local supply and demand for labor in the CNMI, we  compared the annual number of CW-1 permits approved by DHS\u2019s  U.S. Citizens and Immigration Services (USCIS) to the annual  numerical limit (or cap) of CW-1 permits set by USCIS from 2011 to  2016. Numbers of approved CW-1 permits are the number of  beneficiaries approved for each fiscal year cap, provided by DHS\u2019s  Office of Performance and Quality, Performance Analysis and  External Reporting Branch, based on Form I-129CW petitions for  CNMI-Only nonimmigrant transitional workers, as of November 18,  2016. We analyzed the number of approved CW-1 permits by fiscal  year (2012 through 2016), month, country of birth, occupation, and tax  identification. We determined DHS/USCIS data to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. We also analyzed the gap between the local  supply and demand for labor in the CNMI by comparing the number of  approved CW-1 workers to the potential number people seeking  employment in 2016, based on a CNMI Behavioral Health Survey and  the number of high school and college graduates in 2016, as provided  by the CNMI\u2019s Public School System.

In the four discussion groups and seven  semistructured interviews with employers, we asked the same two  questions regarding reductions in foreign workers:  1.  How did reaching the numerical cap of CW-1 permits in May for  fiscal year 2016 and October for 2017 affect your business and  how did you respond?  2.  How do you think your business will be affected and will respond  by the end of the CW permit program, scheduled for December  31, 2019?", "As indicated above, the discussion groups with selected employers  ranged in size from 4 to 16 participants. We also conducted eight  discussion groups with selected workers in Saipan. We conducted  separate discussions with four groups of 41 workers who held CW-1 visas  and four groups of 29 workers who were citizens or permanent residents  of the United States or the freely associated states. Discussion groups  with workers who held CW-1 visas ranged in size from 8 to 16  participants, while discussion groups with workers who were citizens or  permanent residents of the U.S. mainland or territories ranged in size  from 5 to 10 participants. In all discussion groups with workers, we asked  the same two questions regarding reductions in CW-1 workers:  1.  How did reaching the numerical cap of CW-1 permits in May for  fiscal year 2016 and October for 2017 affect your job?  2.  How do you think the end of the CW permit program, scheduled  for December 31, 2019, will affect your job in the future?", "Participants in all employer and employee discussion groups were  selected using a nonprobability sampling approach.

The parameters that control  both the substitutability and the factor shares of resident and foreign labor  are  and & In addition, the elasticity of output with respect to \u201ctotal  workforce\u201d is given by (1-).", "We chose this function because it allowed us to vary assumptions about  the degree to which both foreign and domestic labor act as substitutes for  each other. In this model, the less often the foreign workers are close  substitutes for domestic workers, the greater the effect of any restriction  on foreign workers\u2014because domestic workers are less able to step into  the roles occupied by foreign workers. Allowing the substitutability to be  less than perfect is consistent with a recent paper suggesting that even  when the education level and experience level of immigrant and  nonimmigrant workers are identical, they may not be perfect substitutes.", "According to information from the CNMI\u2019s Department of Commerce,  foreign and domestic workers have similar levels of education. For  example, about 20 percent of each group had a college education or  greater in 2014. However, there are stark differences between the two  groups in pay. The average wage for a CNMI-Only transitional worker  (CW-1) visa holder in 2014 was $7.54, about 69 percent of the average  wage of domestic workers, at $10.94.", "We chose parameters for the model by examining research in this area  and available data. For example, we simulated the effect of greater or  less \u201csubstitutability.\u201d However, because of the extent of uncertainty, we  purposely allowed the parameters to have large ranges. We assumed  that capital and technology remained constant. See table 13 for the  parameters and inputs used in our analysis.", "Determining the number of CW-1 workers required that we combine  different data sets, which introduced a potential source of error. As a  check on our results, we also ran simulations with different estimates of  the CW-1 workers. We found that making different assumptions about the  number of CW-1 workers affected our estimates but did not affect the  overall message.", "We ran a simulation in which the number of CW-1 workers was  assumed to be 9,715, based on the number of CW-1 permits  approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in fiscal  year 2015. We found that making this change caused the range of  gross domestic product (GDP) reduction to change, from 26 to 62  percent under the assumption of 11,370 CW-1 workers to 22 to 45  percent under the assumption of 9,715 CW-1 workers.", "We addressed the possibility that the percentage of visa holders with  CW-1 permits, which we based on the CNMI prevailing wage study,  might be too low. Specifically, we ran a simulation in which we  assumed that the 641 workers from the freely associated states  (Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands,  and Republic of Palau) in the prevailing wage study were incorrectly  coded as non-CW-1 visa holders, instead of not requiring a visa at all.  This possibility was noted in the methodology section of the prevailing  wage study. Making this change increased the number of CW-1  workers to 11,816.

We relied on data from two sources.  For the number of workers, we used data from the CNMI tax system. For  information on the size of the economy (GDP), we used the most recent  data available from the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of  Economic Analysis (BEA). BEA has reported data on GDP in CNMI from  2002 to 2015.", "From 2002 to 2015, the CNMI\u2019s inflation adjusted GDP fell from $1.47  billion to $814 million, according to BEA, a decline of 45 percent. The  decline in GDP reflects the departure of the garment industry. Over this  same period, CNMI tax data show that the number of total workers fell  from 50,436 to 25,307\u2014a decline of about 50 percent\u2014accounted for  almost entirely by the reduction of foreign workers.", "Because of the lack of other relevant data, our analysis has important  limitations. First, it attributes all of the change in GDP to changes in labor  and assumes that nothing else in the CNMI changed over this period. It is  possible, however, that capital in the island also diminished as labor left,  since machinery may have been removed from the island and vacant  factories may have been depreciated. Second, the change in GDP also  could be attributed to the changes in the global economy, as well as other  factors, which are not accounted for in the statistical model.", "Given these limitations, we employed a simple linear regression model,  where the dependent variables were the natural log of GDP (presented in  fig. 14) against the natural log of the number of workers (presented in  table 12) and a constant. We used the natural log because that allowed  us to interpret the coefficients as an elasticity. We estimated a coefficient  of 0.83 that implies that for every 10 percent decrease in the number of  workers, there is a decline in GDP of about 8 percent, on average, with  the elasticity interpretation. We also ran a version of this regression with a  linear time trend. Including a linear time trend yielded a similar estimated  relationship between GDP and the number of workers. Figure 14 shows  the relationship between these two variables as a scatter plot.", "In a separate analysis, however, we found that the relationship between  GDP and the number of workers differed by industry, which further  indicates the degree of uncertainty, and shows that the experience of the  garment industry may not be generalizable. We determined this  relationship was inconsistent across different industries using data on  GDP from BEA by comparing GDP with the number of workers in each  industry. However, because of a data limitation, we measured the number  of workers not by the number of unique Social Security numbers but by  the number of W-2 wage and tax statement forms filed by CNMI  employers. A single person can have W-2 forms at multiple employers if  he or she holds multiple positions. In addition, GDP by industry is  available through 2014 rather than 2015.
