As troop levels decrease in Iraq and increase in Afghanistan, larger numbers of forces will be training for Afghanistan. To meet future requirements, the services plan to adjust training to train forces on a fuller range of missions. The House report to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 directed GAO to report on any challenges the Department of Defense faces as it adjusts training capacities. GAO assessed the extent to which the Army and Marine Corps have (1) made adjustments at their major training facilities to support larger deployments to Afghanistan; and (2) developed plans to adjust training capacity to meet future requirements. GAO analyzed service training guidance, future training requirements, and related plans, and interviewed headquarters officials and personnel from the services' major training facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Due to similarities in training requirements, the Army and Marine Corps did not need to make significant adjustments at their major training facilities to support the shift in operational priority from Iraq to Afghanistan. While the Army had to adapt training scenarios to more closely resemble the operating environment in Afghanistan, it did not have to adjust trainers, training ranges, and mock towns and villages as these are the same regardless of whether forces are preparing for missions in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Since the summer of 2009, the Marine Corps had withdrawn most of its forces from Iraq and shifted the focus of training at its combat training center to exclusively train forces for missions in Afghanistan. Like the Army, the Marine Corps noted that, because of similarities in training requirements, it had to make few adjustments beyond changing some cultural role players and signs in mock towns and villages to support its shift in focus from Iraq to Afghanistan. The Army and Marine Corps face several challenges as they plan to broaden the scope and size of training rotations to meet future training requirements. The Army projects capacity shortfalls at its combat training centers as it seeks to train brigade combat teams to meet future requirements for both ongoing operations and full-spectrum operations--offensive, defensive, and stability operations. The Army has identified the need to conduct 36 to 37 annual training rotations for its brigade combat teams by fiscal year 2011; the centers can currently conduct 28 rotations a year. The Army is developing an exportable capability, expected to increase its capacity by 6 rotations each year when it reaches full operational capability in 2013. However, this will not be sufficient to meet the total projected requirements. To address the gap, the Army plans to give priority to deploying units. The Army has not completed an assessment to determine its full range of options for meeting future brigade combat team training requirements, or the risks associated with not conducting the desired number of training rotations. The Army's force generation model calls for smaller reserve-component units to train for both ongoing and full-spectrum operations, but the Army has not finalized its training strategy for these reserve-component forces. The Army has identified training requirements and locations where deploying forces will train for ongoing operations, but it has not determined where or when it will train its reserve-component contingency forces for full spectrum operations. The Army has the capacity to train 86,000 reserve-component personnel at its seven mobilization training centers each year. It is also conducting enhanced training at other locations, which could expand capacity. Until the Army finalizes its reserve-component training strategy it will not be able to determine whether it can leverage existing resources to meet future training requirements, or whether any excess reserve-component training capacity exists. In the future, the Marine Corps plans to expand training to allow larger numbers of forces to train together, but it lacks sufficient space at its combat training center. It is considering alternatives for acquiring land, ranging in size from approximately 131,000 to 200,000 acres, and expects to reach a decision by fiscal year 2012."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends the Army develop a risk-assessment and mitigation plan to address gaps in training capacity, and assess how it can maximize existing resources to conduct reserve-component training called for under its force generation model.

For the Army we focused on active  and National Guard brigade combat teams, which prepare and train for  deployment at the Army\u2019s maneuver CTCs. In addition, we focused on the  Army\u2019s mobilization training centers, where National Guard brigade  combat teams that will be split into smaller units in theater conduct  training. Because smaller-sized reserve-component units also conduct  predeployment training at the Army\u2019s mobilization training centers for the  Reserve and National Guard, we included these units in the scope of this  review. We did not include active component units that do not train at  maneuver CTCs since these units generally train at different locations\u2014 their home stations where they have training facilities and support.

Specifically, we held discussions with officials from all  four of the Army\u2019s CTCs; the Marine Corps\u2019 only CTC, the Air Ground  Combat Center, located at Twentynine Palms, California; and officials  from the Army\u2019s seven mobilization training centers for the Reserve and  National Guard where the Army currently conducts training and plans to  conduct training in the future. To determine the extent to which the Army  and the Marine Corps have developed plans to adjust training capacity, we  reviewed training guidance and strategies that provided information about  future training requirements for the services, including the Army\u2019s force  generation annex to its campaign plan and the Marine Corps\u2019  expeditionary brigade training requirements. We interviewed Army and  Marine Corps officials to discuss the future training requirements and the  available capacity at their major training facilities.

If they are not  deployed, units will return to the Reset phase after 12 months. There are  no prescribed time lengths for one complete ARFORGEN cycle because  the length of the cycle is driven by the length of active-component  deployments, and reserve-component mobilizations. While current  deployments are typically 12 months long, the Army has also used  deployments of varying lengths, including 6 and 15 months, to support its  ongoing operations.

For  example, the types of Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles that  troops train on may vary due to the differing terrain between the two  operations. In Afghanistan units use a lighter-weight all-terrain-capable  version of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles better suited for  the uneven terrain and subpar road conditions, whereas in Iraq units use a  heavier version of the vehicles. According to Army officials, the maneuver  CTCs currently do not have the number of all-terrain-capable Mine  Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles that they prefer for enhancing  collective training; the majority of these vehicles currently are being  deployed to Afghanistan. Therefore, the available vehicles are primarily  being used at the maneuver CTCs to support individual training tasks  required prior to deploying for operations in Afghanistan.

However, due to personnel constraints, the Army was  only able to develop the Exportable Training Capabilities at the Joint  Multinational Readiness Center and the National Training Center. The  Army designated the Joint Multinational Readiness Center as a dual- mission Exportable Training Capability because it already had employed  its mobile capability to a limited extent into Eastern Europe to conduct  training with multinational partners and had the necessary capabilities to  perform as a mobile capability. In March of 2009 the Joint Multinational  Readiness Center\u2013Exportable Training Capability deployed to Fort Bragg,  North Carolina, and conducted a \u201cproof of principle\u201d for this concept by  conducting a training rotation for a brigade combat team from the 82nd  Airborne Division. With this deployment, the Joint Multinational Readiness  Center\u2013Exportable Training Capability demonstrated that it has increased  flexibility, which could be used to help the Army conduct 28 U.S. Army  brigade combat team rotations by conducting its normal 4 rotations at  Hohenfels, Germany, for the brigade combat teams in Europe and by  deploying to the United States to conduct four additional rotations for  Army brigade combat teams.", "The Exportable Training Capability at the National Training Center would  increase the Army\u2019s training rotation capacity for brigade combat teams  and is expected to conduct exportable training at one of the designated  training areas at the same time that training is being conducted at the  National Training Center at Fort Irwin. At full capability, this training  capability is expected to be able to conduct 6 rotations annually, which  would increase the annual maneuver CTC training capacity from 28 to 34  rotations. The National Training Center\u2019s Exportable Training Capability  was initially scheduled to reach its full operational capability in 2010, but,  as we reported in 2007, the Army was unable to meet its timelines due to  personnel shortfalls caused by the Army\u2019s current commitments to  ongoing operations.

The remaining 17  positions are for mid-level officers, who are in short supply throughout the  entire Army and in the Army\u2019s maneuver CTCs\u2019 existing operations groups.  According to Army officials, if all 30 of the critical personnel positions are  not filled by September 2010, the Army will potentially miss its operational  timeline for conducting its initial training rotation, which has already  slipped once. Officials at the maneuver CTCs noted that they expect to see  an improvement in the filling of these positions with a recent transfer of  responsibility for the operations groups from the U.S. Army Training and  Doctrine Command to U.S. Army Forces Command but still expressed  concerns about whether they would meet the September 2010 deadline for  filling the 30 critical personnel positions. These officials said they  eventually expect to see improvements in the filling of these positions with  the continued drawdown in Iraq and the increased time at home of  servicemembers.", "To meet its goal of conducting 6 training rotations, the Exportable  Training Capability at the National Training Center will also have to  overcome a number of support challenges. For example, the exportable  capability will have to rely on the designated training areas for support.  Specifically, the training areas will have to fund the initial start-up costs  for facilities or support infrastructure required by the Exportable Training  Capability. Further, the designated training areas will have to provide  administrative support, and the unit conducting training may have to  provide trainers for the exportable capability.", "Even if the Army is able to use the Exportable Training Capabilities as  projected and conduct 34 training rotations of various levels each year  beginning in fiscal year 2013, the Army projects that it will fall short of the  36 to 37 rotations it expects to need to train brigade combat teams. To  help address its training capacity shortfalls, the Army has developed a list  that prioritizes the scheduling of units training at its maneuver CTCs. The  list assigns first priority to deploying units, followed by the global  response force / CBRNE (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and  high-yield explosives) consequence-management reaction force. Lower  priority is assigned to units conducting full-spectrum operations mission- essential tasks and security forces.", "However, the Army has not assessed the risks associated with its inability  to conduct the desired number of brigade combat team training rotations  and has not developed a mitigation plan that identifies a full range of  available options for addressing the risks of not conducting the desired  numbers of rotations, within its current resource levels. Without such a  plan, the Army\u2019s brigade combat teams face uncertainties concerning their  ability to conduct CTC rotations or receive support from the Exportable  Training Capability and will need to conduct some type of alternative  training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Continues to Develop Its Training Needs for the Reserve Component to Support ARFORGEN", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, the Army has relied heavily on its reserve-component  forces to meet operational demands in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Furthermore, in the Army Training Strategy, the  Army indicated that the service should, to the extent possible, leverage  existing training resources and use innovative training methods to reduce  overhead.  It will also enable the reserve component to establish a  training strategy that increases premobilization readiness, and provide for  seamless transition from premobilization to postmobilization and the  flexibility to provide training to contingency forces within the ARFORGEN  cycle.", "In preparation for their deployments, the Army currently trains its smaller  reserve-component units at its mobilization training centers. As the Army  plans to meet its future requirements, its plans call for continuing to train  its smaller reserve-component forces at its seven mobilization training  centers.

Although the Army\u2019s ARFORGEN requirements call for these units to be  trained to operate across the full-spectrum of operations, the Army has not  decided where these smaller units will conduct their collective training  exercises in support of ARFORGEN. However, the Army has existing  training locations that could be utilized to provide this training. For  example, a recent First Army preliminary review indicates that it can train  and support approximately 86,000 reserve-component servicemembers  annually at the seven mobilization training centers. In addition to the  Army\u2019s mobilization training centers, the Army could also utilize the  training capacity at the Army National Guard\u2019s Home Station Culminating  Training Event or the Army Reserve\u2019s Combat Support Training Center.  These training venues provide units with external equipment, resources,  and trainers at a level above what normally could be provided at the units\u2019  home stations.

In its  comments, DOD recognized its shortfall in maneuver Combat Training  Center (CTC) capacity to execute its brigade combat team training  strategy and meet global force requirements. DOD stated that in January  2010, the Army initiated a Collective Training Comprehensive Review to  identify and evaluate brigade combat team training options with a specific  focus on the roles and requirements between home stations and CTCs in  the training strategy.  DOD noted that it will discuss the review's findings  and recommendations during an upcoming Army Training and Leader  Development Conference, and develop consensus on future adjustments  to the training strategy or CTC Program based on acceptable levels of risk.   DOD further noted that the Army agrees a risk and mitigation plan is  required to address CTC capacity shortfalls.  However, it believed that  including table 1 in the report, which describes the current and potential  Army maneuver CTC training rotation requirements under various  deployment scenarios, was inappropriate.  Specifically, DOD believed  including the table suggests that the Army should mitigate CTC capacity  shortfalls with longer deployments.  While it noted that longer  deployments would mitigate shortfalls, the Army must consider other  factors, including stress on the force.  We agree that the Army must  consider a number of factors, including deployment length and  deployment to time-at-home ratios, to identify the training capacity  required at its CTCs.  By including the table we are not suggesting that the  Army increase deployment lengths.  Rather, as noted in the report, the  table is presented to illustrate the effect of various deployment lengths,  which the Army has used in the past, on the number of required training  rotations.
