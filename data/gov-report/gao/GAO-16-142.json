State also funds innovations to support economic growth and clean  energy for underserved populations in India through the U.S.-India  Science and Technology Endowment Fund and the PACESetter fund,  respectively.", "While these programs have similar objectives and beneficiaries, they also  have some differences in the way they are implemented. For example,  the Millennium Alliance and the U.S.-India Science and Technology  Endowment Fund are managed in cooperation with the Indian  government, while DIV is funded and managed solely by USAID. In  addition, the USAID India Partnerships Program requires partners to  share the costs and contribute at least $500,000 in cash and in-kind  resources for a one-to-one match totaling at least $1 million, while DIV  has no requirements for cost-sharing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DIV and Other USAID and State Innovation Programs Fund Some Similar Projects in India", "paragraphs": ["Our review of project data for innovation programs in India identified  examples in which these programs have funded innovations similar to  those funded by DIV, as shown in figure 8.

DIV  and two other programs supported projects to provide inexpensive eye  care and eyewear for poor and underserved populations. DIV and two  other programs funded projects to support the development, testing, or  implementation of micro grids for people living in rural areas who are  unconnected to the power grid.", "USAID and State officials we interviewed in India stated that they  generally supported the implementation of similar innovation programs in  India by different organizations if the programs resulted in additional  resources being made available to poor and underserved populations.  According to these officials, there is a vast need for innovations, such as  clean energy and off-grid electricity, which improve the lives of the poor in  that country. In addition, State officials commented that in a country of  1.25 billion people, with significant diversity in cultural, linguistic, and  religious norms, as well as considerable geographic diversity, different  solutions to the same problem may produce varying levels of success in  different contexts. These officials said that, as a result, it may be in some  cases necessary to fund several similar or competing solutions in an  effort to identify the few that demonstrate widespread impact and cost- effectiveness. USAID India officials added that because of the variety of  difficult and intractable problems in India, the mission does not see it as  problematic that there would be more than one activity aimed at  addressing the same problem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaboration among U.S.- Funded Innovation Programs in India Has Been Limited and Opportunities Have Been Missed to Share Information and Leverage Resources", "paragraphs": ["We have previously found that several key practices that enhance  collaboration, including articulating a joint strategy and common  outcomes, agreeing on roles and responsibilities, and identifying and  addressing needs by leveraging resources, can help manage programs  with similar objectives and beneficiaries. Collaboration among U.S.- funded innovation programs in India has not routinely or systematically  included these practices and, with some exceptions, has been limited to  USAID India\u2019s providing initial input to DIV regarding grant award  decisions.", "During USAID India\u2019s technical reviews of DIV applications, DIV routinely  communicated with USAID India officials, requesting that the mission  review applications for projects that DIV subsequently funded in India.  USAID India officials rated the proposals, provided narrative information  on the strengths and weaknesses of the projects, and in some cases  raised concerns.", "However, according to DIV officials and a wide range of USAID India and  State officials we spoke with in India, collaboration among programs  beyond these examples has been limited and has not routinely included  the key practices we identified. For example, these officials indicated that  after award decisions were made, DIV and the other programs did not  systematically share information about project results, or reach  agreements on their respective roles and responsibilities, such as roles in  coordinating planning for the use of grant funds or in monitoring the  implementation of grants. State officials we interviewed in India who  manage other innovation programs\u2014such as the U.S.-India Science and  Technology Endowment Fund and the PACESetter fund\u2014stated that,  while they were aware of some of the activities that DIV has supported in  India, DIV had not communicated with these other agency programs to  collaborate on ongoing or upcoming efforts.", "USAID India and State officials we interviewed in India who manage  innovation programs under the India Partnerships program and the  PACESetter Fund, among others, told us that limited collaboration among  these programs and DIV had resulted in missed opportunities to share  information and leverage USAID India resources by providing outreach  and monitoring of project implementation and marketing DIV innovations.  We have previously found that, without engaging in collaboration  practices such as agreeing on roles and responsibilities or identifying  common outcomes, overlap can have a negative effect in that limited  resources may not be used in the most efficient and effective manner and  opportunities may be missed to leverage resources. The following  provide some examples of missed opportunities to share information and  leverage the mission\u2019s resources.", "Missed opportunities to provide outreach to DIV grantees and  monitor project implementation. USAID India officials stated that in  many cases, they did not know DIV grants had been awarded and  thus missed opportunities to provide outreach and establish  productive working relationships with DIV grantees in India because  roles and responsibilities were not clarified. For example, USAID India  officials from the India Partnerships program, and the health sector,  cited examples in which DIV grantees had contacted USAID India  seeking assistance but found that the mission was unaware that DIV  had awarded grants to these organizations, limiting the effectiveness  of USAID India\u2019s outreach to them. In addition, USAID India officials  stated that the mission\u2019s and DIV\u2019s respective roles and  responsibilities were not always clear to USAID India officials or to  DIV grantees, which negatively affected some grantees\u2019 perceptions  of USAID. USAID India officials also discussed missed opportunities  to conduct project monitoring on DIV\u2019s behalf, and DIV officials stated  that they had not sought assistance from USAID India in monitoring  DIV projects.", "Missed opportunities to market DIV innovations. USAID India and  State officials responsible for promoting U.S.-funded clean energy  projects in India, including those of the PACEsetter Fund, indicated  that they had missed opportunities to share those results with the  government of India or other stakeholders with the means to scale  them up, if appropriate. For example, during a recent high-level U.S.  government delegation\u2019s visit to India, USAID India officials stated that  they had missed an opportunity to highlight promising DIV projects  focused on clean energy activities, because they were unaware of the  projects\u2019 results.", "Although collaboration among innovation programs in India has been  limited, DIV officials provided some additional examples of  communication and consultation with USAID India beyond the initial  consultation on DIV applications. For example, USAID India and DIV  jointly funded a project to rigorously test an innovation to increase full  immunization rates in rural areas. This project is testing the viability of  implementing the innovation in cooperation with the government system  in the Indian state of Haryana.

The plan also discusses time frames for  collaboration activities, including identifying opportunities for joint  management and co-investment with missions on DIV projects. During  our visit to India, a DIV official briefed staff at the mission about the DIV  program and about its broader plans to increase outreach to USAID  missions. DIV officials also provided us with additional examples of  briefings and outreach that it conducted with other bureaus and missions.  In addition, in 2015, DIV collaborated with the USAID mission in Jordan to  hold a regional competition for innovators to pitch their ideas for  development solutions to be considered for grants in the Middle East and  North Africa region, where DIV has made the fewest awards thus far.", "We previously found that developing a joint approach among related  programs, including reaching agreement on a joint strategy, common  outcomes, roles and responsibilities, and leveraging resources, can  improve collaboration and generate greater results than the programs  could achieve independently. However, DIV\u2019s action plan, while a  promising step toward improving collaboration, does not yet represent a  joint approach among the overlapping innovation programs that we  identified in India. Thus, DIV cannot ensure that the benefits of its initial  outreach efforts will be realized. DIV has not extended its action plan to  include the similar innovation programs we identified outside USAID  India, for example. Also, DIV has not harmonized its award selection  processes with those of the other innovation programs to help ensure that  funding similar projects is appropriate and not unnecessarily duplicative.  Furthermore, DIV has not reached agreement with the other U.S.-funded  innovation programs on a common approach to monitoring and evaluation  of the projects they select to fund to help ensure that results from similar  projects are being assessed consistently.

After 5 years of experience in implementing projects  and testing its model in real-world situations, DIV has an opportunity to  assess what results have been achieved and what lessons have been  learned from these initial experiences.

Although USAID\u2019s mission in India prioritized  innovation and modeled one of its programs after DIV, DIV and the  mission collaborated to a limited extent during the implementation of  DIV\u2019s projects. As a result, DIV and the USAID mission in India have  missed opportunities to share information and leverage resources. While  DIV has begun implementing an action plan to improve collaboration with  other USAID missions and bureaus, the action plan does not establish a  joint approach, including reaching agreement on a joint strategy, common  outcomes, or roles and responsibilities among all relevant programs and  agencies.

We  focused our analysis on projects implemented in India, including  multicountry projects where India was one of the countries where the  project was being implemented, for a total of 33 projects. For the  applications analysis, we reviewed USAID applications for funding  through the DIV program, for multiple rounds, and developed a data  collection instrument based on criteria in the application. We  independently reviewed the applications and rated the extent to which the  applicant responded to the question, supplying data and citations when  necessary. We then reconciled any instances where the ratings of the  initial and secondary reviewer did not concur. We aggregated and  reported the outcomes of several questions we developed in the data  collection instrument. For the final reports and evaluations, we reviewed  the award letters for all 18 projects in India that had completed the grant  agreement and submitted a final report or final evaluation. The award  letters contain the terms and conditions of the grant agreement, including  required tasks to be completed with the supporting documentation, to be  submitted periodically to DIV by the grant recipient.
