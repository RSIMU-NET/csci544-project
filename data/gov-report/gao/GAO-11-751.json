The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defined requirements for such personal identity verification (PIV) credentials based on \"smart cards\"--plastic cards with integrated circuit chips to store and process data. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed federal agencies to issue and use PIV credentials to control access to federal facilities and systems.

OMB, the federal Chief Information Officers Council, and NIST have all taken steps to promote full implementation of HSPD-12. For example, in February 2011, OMB issued guidance emphasizing the importance of agencies using the electronic capabilities of PIV cards they issue to their employees, contractor personnel, and others who require access to federal facilities and information systems. The agencies in GAO's review--the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, the Interior, and Labor; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission--have made mixed progress in implementing HSPD-12 requirements. Specifically, they have made substantial progress in conducting background investigations on employees and others and in issuing PIV cards, fair progress in using the electronic capabilities of the cards for access to federal facilities, and limited progress in using the electronic capabilities of the cards for access to federal information systems. In addition, agencies have made minimal progress in accepting and electronically authenticating cards from other agencies. The mixed progress can be attributed to a number of obstacles agencies have faced in fully implementing HSPD-12 requirements. Specifically, several agencies reported logistical problems in issuing credentials to employees in remote locations, which can require costly and time-consuming travel. In addition, agencies have not always established effective mechanisms for tracking the issuance of credentials to federal contractor personnel--or for revoking those credentials and the access they provide when a contract ends. The mixed progress in using the electronic capabilities of PIV credentials for physical access to major facilities is a result, in part, of agencies not making it a priority to implement PIV-enabled physical access control systems at all of their major facilities. Similarly, a lack of prioritization has kept agencies from being able to require the use of PIV credentials to obtain access to federal computer systems (known as logical access), as has the lack of procedures for accommodating personnel who lack PIV credentials. According to agency officials, a lack of funding has also slowed the use of PIV credentials for both physical and logical access. Finally, the minimal progress in achieving interoperability among agencies is due in part to insufficient assurance that agencies can trust the credentials issued by other agencies. Without greater agency management commitment to achieving the objectives of HSPD-12, agencies are likely to continue to make mixed progress in using the full capabilities of the credentials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to nine agencies, including OMB, to achieve greater implementation of PIV card capabilities.

Physical access control focuses on restricting the entry and exit  of users into or out of a physical area, such as a building or a room in a  building. Physical access control techniques include devices such as  locks that require a key to open doors or ID cards that establish an  individual\u2019s authorization to enter a building.

Generally, techniques that provide higher  levels of assurance are more expensive, more difficult to implement, and  may cause greater inconvenience to users than techniques that provide  lower levels of assurance.

Smart cards are plastic devices that are  about the size of a credit card and contain an embedded integrated circuit  chip capable of storing and processing data. The unique advantage that  smart cards have over traditional cards with simpler technologies, such as  magnetic strips or bar codes, is that they can exchange data with other  systems and process information, rather than simply serving as static  data repositories. By securely exchanging information, a smart card can  help authenticate the identity of the individual possessing the card in a far  more rigorous way than is possible with traditional ID cards. A smart  card\u2019s processing power also allows it to exchange and update many  other kinds of information with a variety of external systems, which can  facilitate applications such as financial transactions or other services that  involve electronic record-keeping.", "In addition to providing ways to enhance security for federal facilities,  smart cards also can be used to significantly enhance the security of an  agency\u2019s computer systems by tightening controls over user access.  Users wishing to log on to a computer system or network with controlled  access must \u201cprove\u201d their identity to the system\u2014a process called  authentication. Many systems authenticate users by requiring them to  enter secret passwords. This requirement provides only modest security  because passwords can be easily compromised. Substantially better user  authentication can be achieved by supplementing passwords with smart  cards. To gain access under this scenario, a user is prompted to insert a  smart card into a reader attached to the computer, as well as type in a  password. This authentication process is significantly harder to  circumvent because an intruder not only would need to guess a user\u2019s  password but would also need to possess a smart card programmed with  the user\u2019s information.", "Even stronger authentication can be achieved by using smart cards in  conjunction with biometrics. Smart cards can be configured to store  biometric information (such as fingerprints or iris scans) in an electronic  record that can be retrieved and compared with an individual\u2019s live  biometric scan as a means of verifying that person\u2019s identity in a way that  is difficult to circumvent. An information system requiring users to present  a smart card, enter a password, and verify a biometric scan uses what is  known as \u201cthree-factor authentication,\u201d which requires users to  authenticate themselves by means of \u201csomething they possess\u201d (the  smart card), \u201csomething they know\u201d (the password), and \u201csomething they  are\u201d (the biometric). Systems employing three-factor authentication  provide a relatively high level of security.

The public key is used to encrypt information, making it unintelligible to  any unauthorized recipients. It is called \u201cpublic\u201d because it is made freely  available to any users or systems that wish to be able to authenticate the  user. To decrypt the information requires the private key, which is kept  confidential on the user\u2019s smart card. If a user\u2019s card is able to  successfully decrypt a message that was encrypted using the user\u2019s  public key, then the authenticity of the user\u2019s smart card is proven.

DHS officials stated that they still had not yet  determined what physical access systems were in place throughout their  agencies and what investment would be needed to upgrade or replace  the systems to achieve a departmentwide HSPD-12-compliant system.  According to a 2010 report by the DHS Office of Inspector General, the  department had not made the implementation of an effective HSPD-12  program a priority and did not have a plan for enhancing the department\u2019s  physical access controls. DHS officials stated that they had recently  formed a working group dedicated to physical access. The group had  begun determining what systems were in place throughout the  department and planned to report quarterly on its progress to OMB.  Although Interior issued an official policy in 2009 requiring use of PIV  credentials for physical access, the department does not have a plan in  place to implement the policy. Interior officials stated that they plan to  convene a working group of representatives from each departmental  bureau to develop plans for modernizing their physical access control  infrastructure.", "The other three agencies\u2014HUD, Labor, and USDA\u2014had developed  plans for PIV-enabled physical access but had not obtained funds to pay  for implementation or had delayed implementation to reduce investment  costs. Officials from HUD, for example, had planned to not implement  PIV-enabled access at field locations until each location was scheduled  for renovations, to reduce costs. The agency planned to re-examine that  strategy based on OMB\u2019s February 2011 guidance. Labor officials stated  that they previously had been planning to enable PIV-based access at  their field locations in fiscal year 2012 but were planning to develop  revised milestones for those implementations due to budget constraints.  Officials at USDA stated that they were in the process of purchasing  equipment for PIV-enabled physical access.", "Use of PIV credentials for physical access is unlikely to progress at these  six agencies until greater priority is placed on implementation of PIV- based physical access control systems. Until Commerce, DHS, and  Interior develop specific implementation plans for their major facilities,  including identifying necessary infrastructure upgrades and time frames  for deployment, they are unlikely to reach HSPD-12\u2019s objective of using of  the PIV credential to enhance control over access to federal facilities.  HUD, Labor, and USDA are also unlikely to reach that objective until they  place greater priority on funding PIV-enabled physical access at their  major facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Not Established a Full Suite of Procedures for Using PIV Cards as the Primary Means for Access to Their Networks and Information Systems", "paragraphs": ["HSPD-12 requires agencies to use PIV credentials for access to federal  information systems to the maximum extent practicable.

Additionally, OMB\u2019s February 2011 guidance required agencies  to step up their efforts to use the electronic capabilities of PIV credentials  as the common means of authentication for access to agency information  systems.", "Officials from four agencies (HUD, NRC, NASA, and USDA) reported that  various technical issues hindered using PIV cards as the primary means  of access to agency networks and systems. One technical issue that  agencies reported was not having backup procedures to authenticate  employees who did not possess a PIV card. Officials from HUD, NASA,  and USDA stated that, although they had deployed software and  hardware to enable PIV-based access to systems and networks, they  were not using the cards as the primary means of authentication to  agency systems because they had not established backup procedures to  authenticate employees who did not possess a PIV card. According to  these officials, the issue of how to accommodate personnel without PIV  cards was a major obstacle to requiring the use of PIV cards for access to  networks and systems.", "There are several reasons why staff might not have a PIV card when  trying to access agency systems. Individuals could have left the card at  another location or lost the card. The card may have been damaged and  made inoperable. Also, some staff may not have any cards issued to  them. Short-term employees (less than 6 months on the job), guest  researchers, volunteers, and intermittent or temporary employees, for  example, may not be required to have PIV cards but may still need  access to agency networks and systems.", "Agency officials reported that they were working on solutions to this  problem. Officials at HUD and USDA, for example, stated that they were  working on developing standard procedures to address these  circumstances. NASA officials stated they were participating in a  governmentwide team tasked with drafting guidance for issuing smart  cards to people who do not qualify for PIV cards but need access to  agency facilities and systems. Until HUD, NASA, and USDA develop and  implement procedures for providing temporary logical access to their  systems as a backup mechanism, they are unlikely to reach HSPD-12\u2019s  objective of using of the PIV credential to enhance control over access to  federal systems.", "Other technical issues reported by agency officials included adapting to  the requirement that workstations be locked when PIV cards are removed  and using hardware that was not compatible with PIV cards. Specifically,  NRC and USDA officials stated that governmentwide security policies  requiring workstations to be locked when removing the PIV card makes  using the PIV card for logical access in a laboratory setting difficult  because employees routinely need access to multiple computers at the  same time. If they were required to use the PIV card for logical access,  they would be unable to remain logged in to multiple computers.  Additionally, NASA officials stated that many of its employees utilize  Apple Mac workstations or mobile devices to carry out their work  responsibilities. The same officials noted that the PIV card is incompatible  with these devices; therefore, employees must continue to use their  username and password for access to the NASA network when using  these devices.", "Officials from the other four agencies (Commerce, DHS, and Interior, and  Labor) indicated that implementing PIV-enabled logical access had not  been a priority at their agencies and that resources had not been  committed to fully implementing the electronic capabilities of the PIV-card  for access to their networks and systems. Commerce, DHS, Interior, and  Labor officials, for example, stated that their agencies had not yet  determined what logical access systems were currently in place  throughout their agencies and what investment would be needed to  upgrade or replace them to achieve a departmentwide HSPD-12- compliant system. They also stated that funding constraints had hindered  implementing PIV-based logical access in a timelier manner.

As we have previously reported,  prior to HSPD-12, there were wide variations in the quality and security of  ID cards used to gain access to federal facilities. To overcome this  limitation, HSPD-12 directed ID cards to have standard features and  means for authentication. Further, guidance from OMB required agencies  to have access control processes that accept and electronically verify PIV  credentials issued by other federal agencies.", "Nevertheless, agencies have made minimal progress in implementing  access control systems that can accept and validate PIV cards issued by  other agencies. Several of the agencies we reviewed, including  Commerce, HUD, and Labor, had not devoted resources or management  attention to achieving cross-agency interoperability, according to agency  officials. This limited progress reflects, in part, the low priority OMB  initially put on achieving cross-agency interoperability. OMB guidance  initially focused on card issuance and set performance measures keyed  exclusively to progress in that area. According to an OMB official, specific  interoperability requirements were not established until November 2009,  when the office directed agencies to develop detailed policies for aligning  their identity, credential, and access management activities with the  Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management Roadmap and  Implementation Guidance. As part of their policies, agencies were  required to enable relevant applications to accept PIV cards from other  executive branch agencies for authentication.", "In addition to a lack of systems and processes in place at agencies to  electronically validate PIV cards issued by other agencies, there are also  no processes in place to ensure that credentials issued by agencies are  trustworthy and should be accepted by other agencies as a basis for  granting access to their facilities and systems. Processes have not been  developed to establish trustworthiness by validating the certification  processes at agencies. HSPD-12 guidance allows agencies to  independently develop FIPS 201-compliant credentialing systems, and  NIST issued guidance in 2005 for certifying and accrediting organizations  that issue PIV credentials. However, according to GSA officials, the  approach envisioned in the NIST guidance, which relies on self- certification, has not been adequate to establish trust. The primary reason  self-certification has not worked is that it does not include a provision for  independent validation, such as through the use of third-party audits.  OMB officials agreed that a third-party validation process would be useful  in establishing trust. Until such a process is in place, agencies may be  reluctant to authorize access to their facilities and systems based on PIV  credentials issued by other agencies.", "Until agencies develop implementation plans for accepting and  electronically verifying external agency credentials and a process is  established to provide assurance that external PIV credentials are  trustworthy, progress in achieving HSPD-12\u2019s goal of governmentwide  interoperability for PIV credentials will likely remain limited."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Agencies have made substantial progress in issuing PIV cards to  employees and contractor personnel and have begun using the electronic  capabilities of the cards for physical and logical access but have made  less progress in using the credentials for access to federal facilities and  information systems. They face a variety of obstacles in fully issuing the  credentials and making better use of their electronic capabilities. For  example, several have experienced difficulties in issuing credentials to  remote and \u201cother\u201d staff and in ensuring that expired credentials are  promptly revoked. Six agencies were not using the electronic capabilities  of the credentials for access to all of their major facilities because doing  so was not a priority in terms of management commitment and resources.  None of the eight agencies had fully implemented logical access to  networks and systems using PIV credentials, half because of technical  challenges and half because it was not a priority to do so. Delaying  implementation of HSPD-12 means that the benefits of enhanced security  that HSPD-12 is designed to provide are also being delayed. Without  taking steps to resolve technical problems and setting a higher priority on  implementation, agencies are not likely to make substantially better  progress in addressing these obstacles.", "Establishing interoperability among agencies has also been a challenge.  Agencies have established policies and procedures for accepting  credentials from other agencies only in limited circumstances, in part  because OMB only began requiring that agency systems accept  credentials from other agencies in 2009. Interoperability among agencies  has also been hindered by the lack of third-party audit mechanisms to  establish the trustworthiness of agency implementations of HSPD-12.

In order to assess the  reliability of the data collected from the eight agencies\u2019 quarterly status  reports specific to background investigations and PIV card issuance, we  submitted questions to the agencies and reviewed agency  documentation. In some cases, as we noted where applicable, the data  included in the reports were based on the agencies\u2019 best estimates. We  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for determining overall  agency progress in the areas of background investigations and PIV card  issuance.
