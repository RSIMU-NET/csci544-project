This report examines initiatives foreign posts have implemented to improve mail delivery and retail networks and related results, and modernization strategies used by foreign posts that can inform consideration of proposals to improve USPS's financial condition and customer service. GAO selected foreign posts in Australia, Canada, Finland, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland as case studies based on characteristics, such as delivery and retail changes and country size and location. GAO reviewed foreign posts' documents, including annual reports and strategic plans related to delivery and retail network changes and innovations. GAO met with foreign post officials, toured their retail facilities, received briefings on their delivery and retail networks and other areas, and met with regulators, labor unions, and mailers to obtain their views on the effects of their posts' modernization efforts. USPS generally agreed with GAO's findings and mentioned both its own modernization efforts and the barriers it faces."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The foreign posts GAO reviewed have developed alternative delivery choices for customers that, according to the posts, have reduced costs and improved customer satisfaction and service. All of these posts now offer digital (purely electronic) or hybrid mail (a blend of physical and digital) options. Some posts offer parcel pick up at retail facilities like grocery stores, which are open longer than post offices, and are often owned and operated by businesses that partner with the posts, thus reducing costs. One post allows customers to pick up parcels from a publicly-located machine, or parcel locker, that is available 24 hours a day. The selected foreign posts have modernized their legacy brick and mortar retail networks in response to customers' changing use of the mail. For example, they have expanded retail access through alternatives such as Internet sales and partnerships with retail businesses such as grocery stores or pharmacies, while reducing the number of post-owned and -operated facilities. According to all of the posts, retail modernization has either (1) improved customer service, in some cases because the partner stays open longer, or (2) reduced operating and labor costs, by closing post-owned and -operated facilities, or both. The foreign posts faced resistance to change and challenges similar to those USPS faces, and they have used strategies that could be helpful to USPS as it moves forward with plans to modernize its own delivery and retail networks. In particular, they relied on outreach and communication strategies to inform public officials and customers of increased access to products and services and help gain acceptance for retail network changes. A few posts also developed labor transition plans or strategies under which they provided training, relocation and job search services, and financial incentives to support employees who were negatively affected by the modernizations. While USPS has taken steps in the past year to generate ideas for modernizing its retail and delivery networks, the experiences of foreign posts suggest that it will be critically important for USPS to fully develop and implement similar outreach, communication, and labor transition strategies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Foreign postal operators (foreign posts) in industrialized countries have  seen mail volumes decline and electronic communication and payment  alternatives (referred to as electronic substitution of mail) take the place  of traditional mail. In addition, their legacy infrastructure remained larger  than necessary to handle declining mail volumes. Over the past 10\u201320  years, foreign posts have engaged in strategic efforts to modernize their  delivery and retail networks to address these challenges. For example,  they are taking advantage of technological innovations and partnerships to  facilitate new delivery services, such as offering hybrid mail, an electronic  service combining physical and digital mail delivery options. Additionally,  many foreign posts are planning to make or have already made changes to  modernize their delivery and retail networks. For example, some foreign  posts have installed parcel pick-up lockers in public locations as an  alternative to home parcel delivery, or have transitioned from traditional  post offices to partner-owned and -operated facilities. These retail and  delivery modernization efforts encompass aspects of \u201cuniversal service,\u201d  such as requirements related to delivery of the mail and other access to  postal retail services and facilities, among other areas.

Mail volume fell from 213 billion pieces in fiscal  year 2006 to 171 billion pieces in fiscal year 2010\u2014or about 20 percent.  This decline resulted from the recession as well as electronic substitution.  However, USPS has not been able to cut costs fast enough or generate  sufficient net revenue to offset the lower mail volume and revenue that  have occurred as customers have moved to electronic substitution of the  mail. USPS has introduced a number of initiatives and efforts to reduce its  costs and to try to mitigate expected future losses, but its financial  condition and future viability will continue to be a concern as electronic  substitution increases and mail volumes continue to drop.", "Congress seeks to learn how USPS can effectively address its challenges  and return to financial viability. The Postal Accountability and  Enhancement Act of 2006 mandated that we report in 2011 to the  President and Congress on options and strategies for long-term structural  and operational reforms of USPS, including the experiences of other  countries. Because of concerns about USPS\u2019s deteriorating financial  condition and future viability, we completed this work early and reported  to Congress in April 2010 with options and strategies for financial  viability. In that report, we discussed the challenges to USPS\u2019s business  model and options to address these challenges, including improvements to  its retail, delivery, and mail processing operations. Further, we noted that  we planned to address the experiences of foreign posts in a separate  review. The subcommittee requested that we review foreign posts in order  to learn lessons for USPS related to technological innovations, as well as  cost savings and efficiencies achieved through changes in delivery and  retail networks. In accordance with this request, we addressed the  following objectives:  1.  What major initiatives have foreign posts implemented to improve or  enhance mail delivery, and what have been the results?  2.  What major initiatives have foreign posts implemented to improve or  enhance their retail networks and what have been the results?  3.  What modernization strategies have foreign posts used that could  help inform USPS and Congress as they consider proposals to  improve USPS\u2019s financial condition and customer service?", "To address our three objectives, we employed a case study approach and  selected from among industrialized countries six countries based on  changes in delivery and retail networks, innovations and technology (from  a literature review), rank of broadband usage per 100 inhabitants, nature  of business or diversification, convenience and cost of travel, country  population, location and size of the country, number of delivery points in  2008 (last year data were available), and 2008 mail volume (last year data  were available).

We  also received briefings on their retail and delivery networks, strategic  planning, and other matters. We observed a number of demonstrations of  the foreign posts\u2019 innovations.  In addition, we met with regulators, labor  unions, and private sector mailers to gain their perspectives on the effects  of the modernization efforts. Following the in-country interviews, we  requested additional data and information on each foreign post\u2019s  strategies, goals, and results related to its modernization efforts. We also  met with USPS officials to discuss innovations and strategies related to  USPS\u2019s retail and delivery network but we did not compare these  innovations to those of foreign posts. We also did not assess whether the  foreign posts\u2019 operational changes were profitable since that information  is either proprietary or not consistently reported. In 2009, we reported on  USPS\u2019s efforts to reduce costs and improve delivery efficiency.

Additionally, foreign posts told us  they, like USPS, faced high infrastructure and workforce costs. Some  foreign posts began to modernize their delivery or retail networks, or both,  as early as the 1990s. One of the factors precipitating these changes  occurred when the European Union began to establish a timetable for the  gradual ending of monopolies of letter markets, in its 1997 Council  Directive. In 2008, the European Union directed its members to fully  \u201copen\u201d their domestic letter markets to competition by 2010 (i.e., remove  their monopoly on delivering letter mail). In doing so, the European Union  stated that it wanted to \u201callow sufficient time to put in place  the\u2026modernization and restructuring measures required to ensure long- term viability under the new market conditions\u201d of the posts.

In addition, USPS has twice as many delivery points as any foreign post we  studied\u2014USPS delivers to 151 million homes, businesses, and post office  boxes. Another challenge that USPS experienced was a record loss of $8.5  billion in fiscal year 2010.

According to foreign post officials we spoke with, customers have  been increasingly changing the way they use and receive their mail. With  increasing Internet and broadband access and related changing use of the  mail, use of traditional mail has been declining as customers find more  convenient and faster ways to communicate. Several of the posts we met  with said that customers were using various electronic means to conduct  their daily business, such as paying bills online, sending postcards and  greeting cards electronically, or receiving news and other periodicals via  the Internet instead of hard copy (all referred to as e-substitution).  This  changing use of the mail was a primary factor driving changes in the way  the posts do business. In addition, foreign post officials told us they have a  significant amount of costs associated with delivering traditional letter  mail and packages. Some posts have been experiencing increases in the  number of delivery points every year, at the same time that mail volumes  overall have been declining. Australia Post and Canada Post officials told  us the number of addresses has generally grown each year by about  200,000 addresses.

Over the years, Canada Post has  been engaged in a number of efforts to reinvent, update, and enhance  customer use of the mail through digital alternatives. Canada Post officials  observed that some initiatives were successful, while others failed because  they may have been ahead of their time. For example, according to a  Canada Post official, epost 2.0 will be an improvement on a former digital  offering and will be introduced within the next 2 years. Some postal  officials see digital and hybrid mail as the \u201cnew last mile\u201d and are gearing  toward incorporating more digital mail delivery options for their  customers.", "Foreign postal officials told us that their digital and hybrid mail options  offered three benefits. First, some of the officials said these digital and  hybrid mail services offer enhanced security and trust. They told us that  they use their customers\u2019 trust and loyalty in the \u201cbrand\u201d of the postal  operator to illustrate that digital and hybrid mail communications through  the postal operator are secure. According to an Itella official, the biggest  advantage of NetPosti was mail security. The official said that a NetPosti  account was not as easily accessible as an e-mail account and its contents.  The primary concern for Itella was ensuring security of the mail. Swiss  Post created its Suisse ID to incorporate security encryption on the actual  identification card or Universal Serial Bus (USB) used by customers to  sign into their accounts. This encryption provided customers with a secure  encryption whenever they logged in. Customers must have their  identification verified in person at a post office before receiving the  SuisseID.", "Second, officials at three of the six posts we spoke with offered their  customers who use digital or hybrid mail solutions the opportunity to  archive not only their digitally transmitted mail, but other documents as  well. NetPosti offered archiving of all data and documents for 7 years free  of charge. Customers could also bring into their NetPosti accounts  personal files, such as scanned receipts, for a fee. Swiss Post offered  customers the option to archive their documents.", "Third, three of the six foreign posts offered hybrid mail options combined  with a \u201cplatform of services.\u201d This platform offered integration between  the sending and receipt of mail (letters, bills, cards, etc.) in a mixture of  electronic and physical forms, along with other electronic capabilities  such as archiving data for the customer (including the mail itself, as  mentioned above), and financial services, such as bill presentment or bill  pay and bill consolidation. For example, Swiss Post offered its Suisse ID  customers a number of options, including bill pay and receipt, marketing  services, and electronic archiving.", "Posts reported that these digital and hybrid mail initiatives have resulted  in increased convenience and customer satisfaction, primarily because  they make mail more accessible. A number of the foreign posts mentioned  wanting to be where their customers shop or work, a goal that affected  posts\u2019 decisions about where to locate services. Officials with Swiss Post  stated that their products are not only about making money but also about  decreasing the cost of delivering the mail, which for Swiss Post they  estimated was more than 50 percent of its operating costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pick Up at Retail Store Counter", "paragraphs": ["Several of the posts we spoke with have partnered with major retailers as  well as individual stores and shops, such as grocery and drug stores, to  provide a number of postal products and services to their customers,  including parcel pick up. These stores offer more convenient locations and  longer hours than traditional post offices. This partnering was part of a  major transformation in the foreign posts\u2019 retail networks, and part of an  approach to provide multiple alternatives and choices for customers. In  Sweden, Posten AB customers receive a notice, sent as a text message or a  hard copy by the letter carrier, that they have a package available for pick  up at a retail store counter convenient to them. They then take the paper  notice to show the text to a postal retail partner outlet, such as a grocery  store, and pick up the package.

Some community  boxes have parcel boxes built in. Carriers leave a note along with a key in  the private box of a customer with a parcel delivery, and leave the parcel  itself in the parcel section of the community box.

Customers can sign up for delivery (free of charge to both the  sender and the receiver) and have their identity verified in person by the  Post. When customers want to receive parcels at a Packstation, they can  give the Packstation as the delivery address (instead of their home  address). The parcel is then delivered to the Packstation and the  customers are notified via text message or e-mail that they have a package.  Delivery to a Packstation eliminates the need for home parcel delivery for  the postal operator and allows customers to pick up their parcels more  conveniently, according to DP DHL. Packstations can also be used to  dispatch small packets and parcels 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As of  the end of January 2011, DP DHL had more than 1 million registered users  who could collect or send parcels.

Itella officials noted that sales of other nonpostal products,  such as jewelry and candy, have not been as successful. They said selling  luxury items such as jewelry required focused work by the salespeople to  make the sale. In addition, they said the market for luxury items was  limited. Officials reported that although candy was inexpensive, sales have  not been successful because candy was available for purchase in so many  other places.

Strategic outreach and coordination with governments can  address political resistance.  Foreign posts have developed public  relations campaigns to inform both national and local government  officials as well as the public about the need for modernization and the  benefits of improved access to services. They have also coordinated  with local governments to resolve concerns raised by communities  affected by facility closures.", "For example, Sweden\u2019s Posten AB developed a comprehensive public  campaign and communication effort to inform its stakeholders of what  is perhaps one of the most expansive and earliest examples of retail  network transformations of any of the posts we met with. (Video of  Sweden\u2019s national campaign effort, courtesy of Posten AB.) Part of this  communication effort was intended to help change the perception of  \u201cthe post as a place\u201d to \u201cthe post as a service.\u201d  Despite this extensive  and planned effort, Posten AB officials said the Post\u2019s brand and  customer satisfaction ratings suffered, taking 10 years to recover.  2.  Strategic communication and outreach with mailers, small  businesses, and retail customers. Foreign posts communicated with  and reached out to customers to increase acceptance of changes and to  better meet customers\u2019 needs, including providing alternatives before   implementing major retail network changes. In some cases, they have  established ongoing outreach with their customers to determine how  they can best serve them. In addition, when adjustments to the posts\u2019  retail networks meant that alternative facilities would be further away  for some customers than their traditional post offices, the posts  emphasized that the new locations would have extended operating  hours.", "Posten AB and DP DHL officials, in Sweden and Germany respectively,  told us they made efforts to show customers and other stakeholders  that although post-owned and -operated retail facilities were closing,  the new retail partnerships offered more access points and made  postal products and services more convenient to obtain.", "If Swiss Post planned to close, replace, or relocate a post office, the  Post was required by law to attempt to reach an agreement with the  affected community, according to officials. Typically, Swiss Post  approached the area officials first and offered a variety of solutions,  such as creating an alternative retail access point if a partner could be  found. The Post negotiated with the local community on the best way  to address closures or moves. Although Swiss Post owned 88 percent  of retail facilities at the end of 2009, it reported that it was considering  increasing the number of nonpost-owned facilities. In some cases, such  as in Australia, when closures or relocation were planned, the affected  community first had an opportunity to propose an alternative.   3.  A labor relations strategy can ease transition. Foreign posts also  anticipated employee resistance and developed strategies to address  how changes could affect employees and to assist employees in  making the necessary transition to changes in operations. For  example, for retail network changes\u2014such as closures\u2014strategies  were developed to assist employees in making the necessary transition  to any downsizing. Foreign postal officials told us that although they  viewed the modernization efforts as necessary, some of the labor  changes were unpopular; however, they also said that support for  affected employees helped alleviate some of the resistance the posts  faced. In most cases, either the foreign posts negotiated changes with  the labor unions or created industrial relations (labor relations)  strategies to help transition the workforce, or both. For example:    Australia Post created a labor relations policy that was central to  how it managed structural change, which involved reducing excess  staff. This policy was known as the RRR Agreement:    Redeployment to other areas of the business. Australia Post  sometimes needed to retain and attract more employees in  certain areas. To do this, Australia Post could redeploy an  employee from one area to another job or facility.", "Retraining to provide skills required in new positions. In  some cases, if employees were not redeployed, Australia Post  could retrain the employees.", "Redundancy. When Australia Post needed to reduce the number  of positions, it tried to obtain them through voluntary means,  using incentives to encourage employees to retire.", "Itella reported a number of ways in which it supported its  employees through changes in Finland:    Career consultants worked with employees to find new  placements within Itella when they would lose their jobs.", "Job-seeking training was provided in collaboration with the  Finnish government\u2019s employment office, which helped  employees fill out job applications and search for jobs.", "Outplacement services within Itella helped employees find new  jobs in other companies or helped employees set up their own  business.", "Monetary support measures helped to alleviate the effects on the  individual in case of redundancy, relocation, or a change from  full-time to a part-time employment.", "Posten AB officials noted that labor was not as resistant to changes  in Sweden as in some other countries, in part, because labor was  represented on Posten AB\u2019s governing board, which ultimately  helped the relationship between management and labor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategies Used by Foreign Posts Could Help USPS Gain Critically Needed Support as It Plans and Implements Network Modernization Efforts", "paragraphs": ["USPS has taken steps to modernize its retail and delivery networks, but, as  we have previously reported, it faces ongoing challenges related to  legislative restrictions and stakeholder resistance to changes. Some  stakeholders have been concerned about how USPS\u2019s network changes  might affect jobs, services, employees, and communities, particularly in  small towns or rural areas. According to some members of Congress, and  others, post offices are an important aspect of small towns, providing  them with an economic and social anchor. Another concern is that  inadequate USPS financial resources could impede efforts to optimize  postal mail processing, retail, and delivery networks by limiting available  funding for transition costs. In addition, concerns have been raised about  whether USPS should be allowed to introduce new products and services  that are not directly related to postal activities. Some of the steps USPS  has taken to modernize include the following:  1.  Issued an action plan that outlined a general modernization  strategy. USPS issued a plan on March 2, 2010, that identified  modernization strategies for addressing financial challenges associated  with declining letter mail volumes. Among other changes, USPS  requested flexibility to    Change delivery frequency. Adjust delivery days to better reflect  current mail volumes and customer usage.", "Expand access. Modernize customer access by providing services  \u201cwhere the customers are.\u201d Increase and enhance customer access  through partnerships, kiosks, and improved online offerings, while  reducing costs.", "Expand products and services. Permit USPS to evaluate and  introduce more new products consistent with its mission, and  allowing it to better respond to changing customer needs.  2.  Identified the need for legislative clarification and changes.", "After issuing its action plan, USPS developed legislative proposals for  changes needed to implement its action plan. In September 2010,  Senator Carper introduced a bill that included some of USPS\u2019s  legislative proposals related to these areas. Senator Collins  introduced another bill that included a provision to encourage USPS to  enhance its retail presence and consider the impact of any changes to  retail facilities on small communities and rural areas.  3.  Conducted initial outreach to stakeholders and is developing a  more detailed long-term strategy for modernizing its retail  network and services. Senior USPS officials we met with stated that  they are continuing to work on developing strategies for modernizing  their retail and delivery networks. USPS plans to make these details  public in early 2011. USPS has held a number of meetings to involve  stakeholders in this ongoing discussion, such as a 2010 innovation  symposium whose goal was to discuss potential initiatives to help  address its financial sustainability. Similarly, USPS has begun a  dialogue with its customers, including major mailers, through its  previously mentioned innovation efforts.", "As USPS moves forward with its modernization efforts, the experiences of  foreign posts suggest that outreach and communication strategies will be  critically important to help it address concerns raised by the public,  Congress, postal unions, and the Postal Regulatory Commission. In recent  testimony we discussed some of the public policy questions related to  legislative proposals that require congressional decisions to determine  how USPS should modernize to achieve sustainable financial viability.  For example:    Should USPS have greater flexibility to rightsize its retail network and  workforce, which may involve closing post offices and moving retail  services to alternative commercial locations that are often open more days  and longer hours?", "Should it retain retail facilities and provide new nonpostal products and  services to help it cover costs and generate net revenues?", "Foreign posts did not plan and implement changes to their networks, nor  realize results, overnight. In many cases they planned for the  modernization 10\u201320 years in advance, and were met with a great deal of  stakeholder resistance. Thus, Congress and USPS urgently need to make  critical decisions about actions USPS will take to restore its financial  viability. In doing so, they can potentially learn from a number of  strategies that foreign posts have used to modernize their networks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to USPS for review and comment.

USPS  suggested that we use the word \u201cimprove,\u201d rather than \u201cmodernize\u201d, when  discussing its retail and delivery networks. USPS believes some  stakeholders interpret modernize to mean automate.  Further, USPS stated  that many of its modernization and optimization efforts in the areas of  delivery, networks, access, and products and services have been underway  for some time and that political barriers have slowed these efforts.  We  recognize that USPS has made changes to its retail networks by  transitioning to alternative retail locations, and we are evaluating these  efforts in an ongoing review.
