To help ensure proper implementation, the act requires that agencies report annually to the Attorney General on their processing of FOIA requests. For fiscal year 2006, agencies were also to report on their progress in implementing plans to improve FOIA operations, as directed by a December 2005 Executive Order. A major goal of the order was reducing backlogs of overdue FOIA requests (the statute requires an agency to respond to requests within 20 or, in some cases, 30 working days with a determination on whether it will provide records). For this study, GAO was asked, among other things, to determine trends in FOIA processing and agencies' progress in addressing backlogs of overdue FOIA requests since implementing their improvement plans. To do so, GAO analyzed 21 agencies' annual reports and additional statistics."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on data reported by major agencies in annual FOIA reports from fiscal years 2002 to 2006, the numbers of FOIA requests received and processed continue to rise, but the rate of increase has flattened in recent years. The number of pending requests carried over from year to year has also increased, although the rate of increase has declined. The increase in pending requests is primarily due to increases in requests directed to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In particular, increases have occurred at DHS's Citizenship and Immigration Services, which accounted for about 89 percent of DHS's total pending requests. However, the rate of increase is slightly less than it was in fiscal year 2005. Following the emphasis on backlog reduction in Executive Order 13392 and agency improvement plans, many agencies have shown progress in decreasing their backlogs of overdue requests as of September 2007. In response to GAO's request, 16 agencies provided information on their recent progress in addressing backlogs; results showed that 9 achieved decreases, 5 experienced increases, and 2 had no material change. Notably, according to this information, DHS was able to decrease its backlog of overdue requests by 29,972, or about 29 percent. However, the statistics provided by the 16 agencies varied widely, representing both overdue cases and all pending cases, as well as varying time frames. Further, 3 of 21 agencies reviewed were unable to provide statistics supporting their backlog reduction efforts, and 1 provided statistics by component, which could not be aggregated to provide an agencywide result. (The remaining agency reported no backlog before or after implementing its plan.) Tracking and reporting numbers of overdue cases is not a requirement of the annual FOIA reports or of the Executive Order. Although both the Executive Order and Justice's implementing guidance put a major emphasis on backlog reduction, agencies were given flexibility in developing goals and metrics that they considered most appropriate in light of their current FOIA operations and individual circumstances. As a result, agencies' goals and metrics vary widely, and progress could not be assessed against a common metric. The progress that many agencies made in reducing backlog suggests that the development and implementation of the FOIA improvement plans have had a positive effect. However, in the absence of consistent statistics on overdue cases, it is not possible to make a full assessment of governmentwide progress in this area. Justice's most recent guidance directs agencies to set goals for reducing backlogs of overdue requests in future fiscal years, which could lead to the development of a consistent metric; however, it does not direct agencies to monitor and report overdue requests or to develop plans for meeting the new goals. Without such planning and tracking, agencies may be challenged to achieve the reductions envisioned."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) establishes that federal agencies  must generally provide the public with access to government information,  thus enabling them to learn about government operations and decisions.

Agencies receive requests, usually in writing (although  they may accept requests by telephone or electronically), which can come  from any organization or member of the public. Once received, the request  goes through several phases, which include initial processing, searching  for and retrieving responsive records, preparing responsive records for  release, approving the release of the records, and releasing the records to  the requester. Figure 1 is an overview of the process, from the receipt of a  request to the release of records.", "During the initial processing phase, a request is logged into the agency\u2019s  FOIA system, and a case file is started. The request is then reviewed to  determine its scope, estimate fees, and provide an initial response to the  requester (in general, this simply acknowledges receipt of the request).  After this point, the FOIA staff begins its search to retrieve responsive  records. This step may include searching for records from multiple  locations and program offices. After potentially responsive records are  located, the documents are reviewed to ensure that they are within the  scope of the request.", "During the next two phases, the agency ensures that appropriate  information is to be released under the provisions of the act. First, the  agency reviews the responsive records to make any redactions based on  the statutory exemptions. Once the exemption review is complete, the  final set of responsive records is turned over to the FOIA office, which  calculates appropriate fees, if applicable. Before release, the redacted  responsive records are given a final review, possibly by the agency\u2019s  general counsel, and then a response letter is generated, summarizing the  agency\u2019s actions regarding the request. Finally, the responsive records are  released to the requester.", "Some requests are relatively simple to process, such as requests for  specific pieces of information that the requester sends directly to the  appropriate office. Other requests may require more extensive processing,  depending on their complexity, the volume of information involved, the  requirement for the agency FOIA office to work with offices that have  relevant subject-matter expertise to find and obtain information, the  requirement for a FOIA officer to review and redact information in the  responsive material, the requirement to communicate with the requester  about the scope of the request, and the requirement to communicate with  the requester about the fees that will be charged for fulfilling the request  (or whether fees will be waived).", "Specific details of agency processes for handling requests vary, depending  on the agency\u2019s organizational structure and the complexity of the  requests received. While some agencies centralize processing in one main  office, other agencies have separate FOIA offices for each agency  component and field office. Agencies also vary in how they allow requests  to be made. Depending on the agency, requesters can submit requests by  telephone, fax, letter, or e-mail or through the Internet. In addition,  agencies may process requests in two ways, known as \u201cmultitrack\u201d and  \u201csingle track.\u201d", "Multitrack processing involves dividing requests into two groups:  (1) simple requests requiring relatively minimal review, which are placed  in one processing track, and (2) more voluminous and complex requests,  which are placed in another track.", "In contrast, single-track processing does not distinguish between simple  and complex requests.

Note that this  backlog of overdue requests is distinct from the pending cases reported in  the annual reports (those FOIA cases open at the end of the reporting  period). For the annual reports, agencies are required by the statute to  provide a count of FOIA requests that are still pending (that is, not yet  closed) at the end of the reporting period. In response to this annual  report requirement, agency tracking systems and processes have been  geared to providing statistics on pending requests. Pending cases totals  would generally be larger than backlog, as the term is used in the  Executive Order, since they would include any requests received within  the last 20 to 30 working days of the reporting period, which would not be  overdue.", "The order also instructed the Attorney General to issue guidance on  implementation of the order\u2019s requirements for agencies to conduct  reviews and develop plans.

With respect to backlog reduction,  the guidance stated that agencies were not limited to time horizons in  fiscal years 2006 and 2007 only. According to the guidance, if an agency  believed that reform could enable it to process requests in a more efficient  manner, thereby reducing its backlog, the agency should consider  implementing these measures even though they might result in a short- term increase in backlog, as long as it was confident of a long-term benefit.

The other three agencies did not  provide evidence of internal controls that would provide reasonable  assurance that FOIA data were recorded completely and correctly, or they  acknowledged material limitations of the data.", "The accuracy of annual report data is important so that government FOIA  operations can be monitored and understood by the Congress and the  public. To provide reasonable assurance of accuracy, agencies rely on  internal controls to minimize the risk that data are incomplete or  incorrect. Specific examples of such controls include supervisory or  other reviews of the quality of data entry, spot checks of selected records,  software edit checks of data entered (such as prevention of duplicate  entries), and other manual or automatic processes to detect data entry  errors.", "We determined that GSA did not have adequate internal controls to  provide reasonable assurance that the data in its fiscal year 2006 annual  report were accurate and complete. Although about one-third of GSA  FOIA requests were handled by FOIA staff at GSA headquarters,  mechanisms had not been established to verify that data were entered  correctly into the system that tracked FOIA requests. One staff person was  responsible for entering data, but the data were not checked periodically  to ensure that they were correct. Agency officials told us that errors could  be caught if, for example, the GSA program office responding to a request  observed a discrepancy when the request letter was transmitted to the  program office. However, they acknowledged that for the fiscal year 2006  annual report, the FOIA office did not perform regular reviews or spot  checks of the data to check for errors. Since the 2006 annual report was  prepared, GSA has increased the staff at the headquarters FOIA office, and  it has changed its approach to FOIA tracking by implementing a  centralized tracking system for requests handled both by headquarters and  by the GSA regional offices. According to officials, the centralized tracking  system provides the agency with additional controls, but GSA had not  established procedures for checks to ensure that information on requests  was entered correctly at all stages. Until the agency establishes checks of  data entered or other internal controls, such as periodic reviews, it will  have reduced assurance that data are captured completely and accurately.", "Data from HUD are omitted because HUD officials told us that the fiscal  year 2006 annual FOIA report statistics were not accurate. As part of its  improvement plan implementation, HUD performed an organizational  realignment in which FOIA processing functions were transferred to the  Office of the Executive Secretariat. According to the Executive Secretary,  after the realignment, the office found that many requests in the  department\u2019s FOIA tracking system were incorrectly recorded as open,  although they had in fact been closed. According to this official, the  department\u2019s regional and field offices had not been consistently closing  requests in the system, resulting in inaccuracies. In addition, not all field  offices were using the tracking system, but were using spreadsheets and  other means of tracking. According to HUD officials, they were taking  actions to remedy these problems by working with the field offices to  make sure that data were entered correctly and cases closed out properly.  Also, in the department\u2019s progress report on its improvement plan, HUD  reported that it had selected and was acquiring a new automated FOIA  tracking system. According to the department, in December 2007, it began  implementing this system and training staff in its use, and all offices  (including headquarters) would be required to use it. However, the  implementation was not yet complete departmentwide. Further, although  the department planned to develop policies and procedures to govern the  use of the system, it had not yet done so; if well designed, these policies  and procedures could help ensure that all FOIA offices, including regional  and field offices, are using the tracking system consistently and that  information is entered accurately and promptly. Until the department  develops and establishes such policies and procedures, it will be unable to  provide annual report data that are accurate and complete.", "We are also omitting data from the Department of Agriculture. In our  March 2007 report on the FOIA annual reports for fiscal year 2005, we  omitted data from the department\u2019s annual FOIA report because a major  component acknowledged material limitations in its data. Although most  Agriculture components expressed confidence in their data, one  component did not: the Farm Service Agency, which reportedly processed  over 80 percent of the department\u2019s total FOIA requests. According to this  agency\u2019s FOIA Officer, portions of the agency\u2019s data in annual reports  were not accurate or complete. We recommended that the department  revise its FOIA improvement plan to include activities, goals, and  milestones to improve data reliability for the Farm Service Agency and to  monitor results. Since then, Agriculture has taken actions to improve the  reliability of its data, such as issuing guidance and conducting training.  The department is also developing an electronic tracking software system  that it expects to improve the timeliness, accuracy, depth, and breadth of  the department\u2019s FOIA reporting. However, our reliability assessment was  performed toward the end of fiscal year 2006, and our recommendation  was made in March 2007, which was after the data for the annual report  were assembled. Thus the department\u2019s actions were not undertaken in  time to affect the statistics for fiscal year 2006.

In  2005, SSA attributed the jump to an improvement in its method of counting  requests and stated that, in previous years, these requests were  undercounted.

Most of this rise occurred from fiscal years 2002 to 2003: about 18 percent,  both for requests received and for requests processed. In contrast, in the  last two fiscal years, the rise was much less: for requests received, the rise  was roughly 3 percent from fiscal year 2004 to 2005 and another 1 percent  to 2006; for requests processed, the rise was about 2 percent from fiscal  year 2004 to 2005 and another 2 percent from fiscal year 2005 to 2006.", "Specifically with regard to SSA, in fiscal year 2006, as in the previous year,  the vast majority of requests reported fall into a category SSA calls \u201csimple  requests handled by non-FOIA staff;\u201d according to SSA, these are typically  requests by individuals for access to their own records, as well as requests  in which individuals consent for SSA to supply information about  themselves to third parties (such as insurance and mortgage companies)  so that they can receive housing assistance, mortgages, and disability  insurance, among other things. SSA stated that these requests are  handled by personnel in about 1,500 locations in SSA, including field and  district offices and teleservice centers. Such requests are almost always  granted, according to SSA, and most receive immediate responses.  According to SSA officials, they report these requests because, as  discussed earlier, Justice guidance instructs agencies to treat Privacy Act  requests (requests for records concerning oneself) as FOIA requests and  report them in the annual reports.", "SSA attributed the jump that occurred in fiscal year 2005 to an  improvement in its method of counting these simple requests, which can  be straightforwardly captured by its automated systems.

In fiscal year 2006, all but about  34,000 of SSA\u2019s over 18 million requests fell into this category. From fiscal  years 2002 to 2005, SSA\u2019s FOIA reports attributed the increases in this  category largely to better reporting, as well as actual increases in requests.", "Besides SSA, agencies reporting large numbers of requests received were  the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland  Security, Justice, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, as shown in table 4.

However, if SSA\u2019s numbers  are included, the proportion of grants dominates the other categories\u2014 raising this number from 87 percent of the total to 98 percent.

In many cases, the variance can be  accounted for by the types of requests that different agencies process. For  example, as discussed earlier, SSA grants a very high proportion of  requests because most of its requests are for personal records that are  routinely made available to the individuals concerned (or to others with  their consent). Similarly, VA routinely makes medical records available to  individual veterans, and HHS also handles large numbers of Privacy Act  requests. Such requests are generally granted in full. Other agencies, on  the other hand, receive numerous requests whose responses must  routinely be redacted to prevent disclosure of personal or other exempt  information. For example, NSF reported in its fiscal year 2005 annual  report that most of its requests (an estimated 90 percent) are for copies of  funded grant proposals. The responsive documents are routinely redacted  to remove personal information on individual principal investigators (such  as salaries, home addresses, and so on), which results in high numbers of  \u201cpartial grants\u201d compared to \u201cfull grants.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Processing Times Vary, but Broad Generalizations Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["For 2006, the reported time required to process requests (by track) varied  considerably among agencies.

With only medians, it is not statistically possible to  combine results from different agencies to develop broader  generalizations, such as a governmentwide statistic based on all agency  reports, statistics from sets of comparable agencies, or an agencywide  statistic based on separate reports from all components of the agency.  This was the basis for the suggestion in our previous report that the  Congress consider amending the act to require agencies to report average  times and ranges; this requirement is a provision of the OPEN Government  Act, enacted December 31, 2007, as Public Law 110-175."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase in Pending Cases for 21 Agencies Is Mostly Associated with DHS", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the increase in numbers of requests processed at the 21  agencies, the number of pending cases\u2014requests carried over from one  year to the next\u2014has increased.

One issue in relation to these files is that about 55  million hard-copy A-files are shared with Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), which can lead to delays in locating, referring, and  processing documents. According to the department, CIS and ICE have  convened a working group to establish a streamlined approach to  processing documents in the A-files, and they are also assessing  digitization of the files, which would allow both components to  electronically access any file.", "Table 7 shows the percentage of the total pending requests that each  agency accounted for in fiscal year 2006; to provide an idea of the scale of  these requests in comparison to the agency\u2019s annual workload, the last  column provides the number received.

For requests  that involve large volumes of responsive records, it may take significant  time to assemble, review and redact, and duplicate records. In addition,  processing of such requests may be delayed while requests received earlier  are processed. In addressing such requests, agencies report that they  contact requesters to determine whether a more limited or targeted  selection of records will meet their needs, and that this can lead requesters  to narrow their requests. In addition, agencies may use multitrack  processing, putting voluminous or complex requests in a separate queue  (which allows relatively simple requests to be processed more quickly).", "The selection of agencies\u2019 oldest case files that we reviewed included  several examples of voluminous requests. For example, at Defense, 5 of  the 10 oldest cases remained open, in part because the responsive records  were voluminous. For one request for records on the 1972 Strategic Arms  Limitation Talks (SALT), Defense\u2019s case file indicated that the request  involved the review and coordination of 936 pages of top secret  documents. A request for 1970 SALT records involved 613 pages of top  secret documents.", "At HHS, 4 of the 10 oldest case files included references to voluminous  records. For example, for a media request for background information on  a report by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on an incident  involving an error at a hospital, the centers indicated that the responsive  documents were bulky, consisting of about 500 to 600 pages of records.", "At VA, all 10 oldest pending requests, dating from 2003 to 2005, were in the  VA Office of the Inspector General. For one of these cases, the responsive  records were described as voluminous (about 700 pages) and in need of  review by legal staff; the requester was informed that because of this, they  would be placed in a queue with other voluminous requests requiring legal  review. The request reached the head of the queue about 2 years later  (May 2007), and three incremental releases were made from May to June  2007.

VA  officials also described a more recent voluminous request involving a  database containing more than 72,000 active files, with 431 data elements  and over 4 million PDF files, each of which had to be reviewed for  personal data.", "At Justice, two of the six oldest case files included letters explaining that  because of the high volume of responsive records associated with each,  the requests had been placed in the pending queue for processing. In one  case, a letter indicated that the request had moved from number 91 in the  pending queue in October 1990 to number 54 in November 1993; according  to the letter, the processing delay was caused by large numbers of requests  received, as well as the need to devote part of the office\u2019s resources solely  to processing documents in response to legislative requirements (the  President John Fitzgerald Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act  of 1992).", "Requests may require extensive review and consultations. Review of  requests may require coordination with many organizational components,  or they may require the agency to consult with other agencies. If  responsive records are classified, they must be reviewed and redacted by  personnel with appropriate clearances. Classified or intelligence issues  may involve both internal reviews and external consultation when other  agencies must review and approve the release of information gathered  before a case can be closed. Agency officials stated that this coordination  can be time-consuming, especially when it is not clear which agencies  have ownership of the information. In other cases, proper review and  redaction may require the involvement of subject-matter experts or others  with specialized knowledge.", "Defense\u2019s oldest case files, as described above, included several involving  top secret documents, which required extensive reviews by multiple  components before release.

Before releasing information under FOIA, federal agencies are  generally required to provide predisclosure notifications to submitters of  confidential commercial information. Officials stated that when agencies  receive requests for proprietary, acquisition, or procurement records, the  submitter notification process can delay closure of these cases. For  example, NSF officials stated that most of their requests are for copies of  funded grant proposals, which require FOIA staff to contact grantees for  approval of the release. According to NSF, many of these grantees are  academics who are not familiar with FOIA processes (including the  submitter review process); NSF officials state that locating the submitters  and explaining the process can be time-consuming.", "Requests may be delayed until ongoing investigations are completed.  According to our analysis of the 10 oldest case files from selected  agencies, several old requests remained open because they sought  documents regarding investigations that were still ongoing. At DHS and  VA, most of the oldest FOIA requests remain open because the responsive  records are relative to ongoing investigations. Some examples of these  requests follow:    At DHS, 8 of the 10 oldest pending requests (dating from 2000 to 2001)  were requests directed to the Coast Guard for documents on vessel  incidents (such as collisions between vessels). In these cases, the Coast  Guard responded to requesters that, as the incident was still under  investigation, material might be protected from release as part of an  ongoing law enforcement proceeding; the exemptions cited included 7(A),  which exempts records or information compiled for law enforcement  purposes to the extent that the production of such records could be  expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The requesters were  offered the choice of receiving any material available at the time or  authorizing an extension until the investigation was complete; in these  cases, requesters asked that requests remain open, pending completion of  the investigation.", "At VA, 7 of the 10 oldest pending requests (dating from 2003 to 2005) were  for documents concerning investigations or reviews by the VA Office of  the Inspector General. For example, one request was for records of an  investigation of medical research activities at a VA medical center that was  opened after employees reported that established research procedures  were not being properly followed. Another was for records regarding  complaints filed against a health care provider. In these and other cases,  requesters were informed that the records were not yet releasable and  cited exemptions, including 7(A). For these 7 requests, VA informed  requesters that it would keep the requests open until the investigations  were complete.", "The Director of Justice\u2019s Office of Information and Privacy stated that the  agencies could have simply closed the requests as denials under  exemption 7(A) and any other applicable exemption (see app. II); she also  noted that these requests remained open in accordance with the  requesters\u2019 wishes.", "Requests more than 6 years old may receive low priority. At one agency  component, a set of old cases remained open because the agency believed  they were no longer subject to litigation. In accordance with the general  federal statute of limitations, lawsuits against the United States generally  are barred after 6 years after the right of action first accrues. At Justice\u2019s  Criminal Division, requests over 6 years old were given lower priority than  requests for which litigation was deemed likely, and, in some instances,  the original request processing files were lost. That is, the Criminal  Division was unable to locate the original processing files for 4 requests  that it had identified as among its 10 oldest pending requests, dating from  around the early 1990s. (Justice officials later informed us that one of  these cases was in fact closed and had been incorrectly identified.) In  August 2007, the Chief of the division\u2019s FOIA/Privacy Act Unit (now  retired) told us that he could not account for the loss, but that the unit had  recently undergone a move and personnel changes, which might have been  contributing factors. According to this official, the unit was creating  replacement files from a tracking database and would then take action to  close the requests.", "According to its former chief, the FOIA/Privacy Act Unit gave priority to  avoiding litigation, since lawsuits can generate a significantly increased  workload and slow down other FOIA processing. For example, according  to this official, the Criminal Division was then processing over 30,000  documents as a result of a lawsuit. Criminal Division officials stated that  because of the magnitude of this task, which was subject to supervision by  the court and potential sanctions if not timely, it was not practical to divert  resources to process older cases.", "Although the goal of avoiding litigation is reasonable, the lack of priority  given to the division\u2019s oldest case files is inconsistent with the  department\u2019s expressed emphasis on what it termed \u201can emerging area of  concern\u201d\u2014the longest-pending FOIA requests that agencies have on  hand. According to Justice, its Office of Information and Privacy (which  has lead responsibility for providing guidance and support to federal  agencies on FOIA issues) established as a backlog-related goal the regular  closure of the 10 oldest FOIA requests pending at eight senior leadership  offices in the department, for which the office performs FOIA processing.  According to the department, this served as an example for other agencies,  some of which followed suit. (Also, in October 2007, Justice issued new  requirements for all agencies to report on their 10 oldest pending requests  and 10 oldest pending consultations received from other agencies.)", "Further, although the statute of limitations may prevent requesters from  filing suit after 6 years, following a practice that avoids applying resources  to cases older than this has the potential effect of increasing the number of  very old open requests having little prospect of being closed.", "In response to this issue, the Criminal Division\u2019s FOIA/Privacy Act Unit  began taking action to close the requests that had missing case files,  according to its former chief. Also, in December 2007, the current deputy  chief of the Criminal Division told us that an attorney had been detailed to  work full time on the oldest cases (those dating from 2000 and before);  according to this official, the Criminal Division had decreased its pending  list by over 100 cases between September 14 and November 29, 2007.  However, the division\u2019s improvement plan did not address closing its  oldest cases, and the division had not established time frames for doing so.  Although the actions described by the deputy chief, if implemented  appropriately, should help to address this issue, establishing goals and  time frames would provide further assurance that attention to this issue is  sustained appropriately. Without such goals and time frames, the Criminal  Division risks perpetuating the tendency for the oldest requests to remain  open indefinitely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Since Implementing Improvement Plans, Several Agencies Reduced Backlogs of Overdue or Pending Requests, but the Governmentwide Picture Is Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Following the emphasis on backlog reduction in Executive Order 13392  and agency improvement plans, many agencies have shown progress in  decreasing their backlogs of overdue requests as of September 2007.

Tracking and  reporting statistics on overdue cases is not a requirement of the annual  FOIA reports or of the Executive Order. Although both the Executive  Order and Justice\u2019s implementing guidance put a major emphasis on  backlog reduction, agencies were given flexibility in developing goals and  metrics that they considered most appropriate in light of their current  FOIA operations and individual circumstances. As a result, agencies\u2019 goals  and metrics vary widely, and progress could not be assessed against a  common metric. Justice\u2019s most recent guidance directs agencies to set  goals for reducing backlogs of overdue requests in future fiscal years,  which could lead to the development of a consistent metric; however, it  does not direct agencies to monitor and report overdue requests or to  develop plans for meeting the new goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Certain Agencies Made Progress in Backlog Reduction, While Others Faced Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Table 8 shows statistics provided by 16 agencies in response to our request  for numbers of overdue requests before and after the implementation of  the improvement plans. \u201cAfter\u201d statistics were as of September 14, 2007  (except as noted in the table). \u201cBefore\u201d (baseline) statistics were generally  as of about June 2006. As the table shows, a few agencies provided  statistics on pending requests rather than overdue requests.", "As shown in table 8, since implementing their FOIA improvement plans,  eight agencies showed significant decreases in their backlogs of overdue  cases (AID, DHS, EPA, Interior, Labor, the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, the Treasury, and VA), and one (Energy) showed decreases  in pending requests (Energy does not distinguish overdue requests from  pending requests in its reduction efforts).", "Because of the large numbers of pending and overdue requests that it  accounts for governmentwide, DHS\u2019s reduction is particularly notable.  According to its statistics, DHS succeeded in reducing backlog by 29  percent since June 2006, reducing its overdue requests by almost 30,000.  DHS officials, including the Deputy Chief FOIA Officer, attributed the  department\u2019s success to activities performed as part of its improvement  plan for both 2006 and 2007. For 2006, DHS\u2019s improvement plan goals  related to backlog reduction included hiring additional personnel,  implementing operational improvements at CIS, meeting with an  important requester group (the American Immigration Lawyers  Association) to discuss file processing and customer service  enhancements, and establishing a monitoring program under which all  DHS components submitted weekly and monthly data to DHS\u2019s Chief FOIA  Officer. Officials also cited improvements to the department\u2019s Web site to  assist requesters in properly drafting and directing their requests;  increased outreach and assistance by the central FOIA office to  components; formalized employee training programs; and the launch of an  Internet-based FOIA correspondence tracking and case management  system for FOIA offices at DHS headquarters, which is to streamline the  tracking of requests. In addition, DHS\u2019s Deputy Chief FOIA Officer told us  that she attributes the department\u2019s progress to an increased focus on  customer service and communication with requesters, as well as efforts to  streamline FOIA processing using available technologies.", "Also notable is VA\u2019s performance: it reported achieving a backlog  reduction of over 80 percent from August 2006 to September 2007\u2014a  reduction of 9,550 requests. This is also significant to the overall backlog  picture, as VA accounts for significant portions of governmentwide  requests received and pending (table 7 provides numbers for fiscal year  2006). VA attributed its backlog reduction to the improvements resulting  from meeting the milestones that it had set in its improvement plan and  the increased management emphasis on backlog reduction. VA\u2019s 2006  improvement goals were to implement quarterly backlog snapshot  reporting for all components; analyze these snapshots to identify offices  with significant backlogs; identify the department\u2019s 10 oldest FOIA  requests and estimated completion dates; and conduct FOIA site visits. In  its annual report, VA reported meeting these goals, as well as a number of  goals for 2007, including analysis of backlog and solutions.", "Other agencies did not reduce their backlog of overdue or pending cases:  two agencies with minor backlog saw no material change, but five  agencies saw significant increases:    Commerce saw a minor increase in its backlog of 7 overdue requests, for a  total of 188 (Commerce generally receives about 2,000 FOIA requests a  year). According to Commerce\u2019s Departmental FOIA Officer, the  department received a large number of voluminous requests in the period  before September 14, which she said was because of the election year, and  many of these requests were requests for congressional correspondence  and correspondence logs. According to this official, because such logs and  correspondence involve other agencies, such requests require external  consultation, which can be time-consuming. She also stated that the  department\u2019s backlog of overdue requests varies from day to day, and that  by September 30, 2007, it had fallen to 159. For agencies such as  Commerce, whose processing rates have fluctuated closely around 100  percent (see fig. 7), such variations are not surprising.", "NSF\u2019s pending requests rose from 5 to 7 from its fiscal year 2006 report to  September 14, 2007; NSF processes around 250 to 350 requests per year.  As these numbers show, NSF does not face major backlog issues. Further,  when dealing with small numbers that can vary daily, a difference of 2  between snapshot dates does not provide a meaningful indication of a  trend.", "SSA, State, and Defense saw rises in overdue requests, and NASA and  Education saw rises in pending requests:    Although SSA stated in its fiscal year 2006 annual report that it had  reduced its backlog by 5 percent, it experienced a rise in its backlog of  overdue requests by September 2007. SSA officials, including the Principal  Public FOIA Liaison, attribute this rise to difficulties in migration to a new  electronic FOIA tracking system, recent loss of experienced staff, and an  increase in complex requests in 2007. According to these officials, this  increase in requests occurred because of events that led to heightened  public interest, such as SSA field office closures. Although SSA is  expecting to lose more senior staff in 2007, officials hope to reduce  backlog by streamlining operations and careful management. For example,  according to agency FOIA officials, SSA is tasking junior-level personnel,  including administrative and office automation staff, with the  responsibility of responding to requests from frequent requesters seeking  routine statistical data, thus allowing senior analysts to work on more  complex requests.", "According to FOIA officials at State\u2019s Office of Information Programs and  Services, the department\u2019s backlog of overdue requests increased because  of conflicting demands on the staff that coordinate and process FOIA  requests. For example, staff resources were redirected in response to a  department priority placed on passport processing. State also reported  that it experienced an increase in the number of congressional requests for  documents, the expedited processing of which often competes for the  same staff. According to the department, it plans to address its backlog  challenges by efforts to better track and control the FOIA workload.", "Defense attributes most of the rise in its backlog of overdue requests to an  unforeseen influx of requests received by the Defense Security Service  (DSS). According to the chief of Defense\u2019s Freedom of Information Policy  Office, DSS accounts for over 10,000 of Defense\u2019s 23,255 backlogged  requests. This official told us that these requests are primarily Privacy Act  requests for background investigation files from individuals who were  investigated by DSS for security clearances over the past 15 years.  According to this official, the DSS backlog increased because, among  other things, personnel security investigation resources were transferred  from DSS to OPM when OPM assumed the personnel security investigation  mission in 2005; the increased security awareness within the country since  the events of September 11, 2001, caused more employers of former  Defense personnel to ask for security clearance information; and the war  in Iraq caused a significant increase in the use of cleared contractors for  critical positions. The chief of Defense\u2019s Freedom of Information Policy  Office stated that the department plans to modify its FOIA improvement  plan to address this new backlog.", "NASA saw an increase of more than 100 percent in pending requests from  February 2006 to September 14, 2007. According to NASA\u2019s Chief FOIA  Public Liaison Officer, during this past fiscal year, it experienced an  unexpectedly large increase in FOIA workload because of high-visibility  incidents that led the public and media to increase their FOIA requests,  such as an incident involving an astronaut accused of attempted murder,  foam-related issues with the shuttle tanks, and contracts with NASA\u2019s new  exploration vehicle. Most of these requests involve information that is  being considered under civil and criminal proceedings, operational safety  reviews, and internal controls; as a result, according to this official, they  required extensive legal reviews concerning the initial release  determinations.", "Education experienced a 44 percent increase in pending requests from  June 2006 to September 14, 2007.

In its  annual report, the department stated that it exceeded its 10 percent goal,  but that it did not close its 10 oldest requests because resources had been  reallocated to address other unplanned FOIA priorities and workload. In  addition, the Director of Regulatory Information Management Services in  the department\u2019s Office of Management told us that the department has  experienced an increase in pending/backlog FOIA requests because of the  growing number of FOIA requests seeking responsive documents of a  cross-cutting nature, which require substantial time and attention from  senior personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variations in Statistics Tracked and Backlog Reduction Goals Prevent a Clear Assessment of Governmentwide Progress", "paragraphs": ["Although the statistics provided by the 16 agencies indicate that many  agencies have made reductions, the governmentwide picture is not clear  because the types of statistics varied widely, representing both overdue  and pending cases and varying time frames.

For agencies that provided the number of their overdue cases,  the dates generally depended on when the agencies first began to collect  such statistics. Some agencies had collected preimplementation backlog  numbers as a baseline for their improvement plans, and others planned to  determine backlog of overdue cases as part of the implementation of their  plans. For agencies that provided pending statistics, the dates generally  depended on the systems and processes used to develop the statistics.", "Some agencies provided statistics on backlog of overdue requests, some  provided numbers of pending requests, and some provided a combination.  For the four agencies providing only pending statistics, the actual backlogs  of overdue requests would probably be lower, since overdue cases are a  subset of pending cases. Those providing pending statistics did so either  because their systems were not set up to track overdue requests, because  they chose not to distinguish them, or both. For example, according to  NASA, its current in-house FOIA database is designed to report statistics  only on open requests and does not distinguish those that are over the  statutory limit (20 or, in some cases, 30 days). Therefore, NASA provided  us numbers pertaining to all open requests. On the other hand, Education  and Energy chose not to distinguish between pending cases and those over  the statutory limit. Energy explained this decision on the grounds that it  ensured that all cases were given the same priority and that new cases  would receive just as efficient a response as old ones.", "Two agencies (Justice and Defense) provided a mix of pending and  overdue statistics:    Justice reported by components, which provided a mix of pending and  overdue statistics, as well as baselines associated with dates ranging from  September 2005 to October 2006. Because of this mix, the statistics could  not be aggregated and directly compared to give a meaningful  departmentwide result. However, of 28 components, 13 reported  decreases in overdue or pending cases, 6 reported increases, 7 reported no  overdue requests, 1 was a new component that had no preimplementation  history, and 1 component did not provide statistics for the time frames  requested.", "According to Defense, it had not previously tracked backlog in the sense  of the Executive Order (that is, overdue requests), and it planned to use  the September 2007 statistics collected for us as a baseline for future  tracking.", "Similarly, the Department of the Interior could not provide us with a  preimplementation baseline because it did not track its backlog of overdue  requests at that time. Interior told us that it has now modified its tracking  system to allow it to monitor overdue cases in real time.", "Table 10 shows the four agencies for which information was not provided  or was not sufficient for a clear conclusion. (The remaining agency, SBA,  did not report a backlog for either June 2006 or September 2007.)", "Three agencies did not provide any statistics. Transportation and HHS,  both of which have decentralized FOIA programs, told us that collecting  and providing such statistics was not feasible. Transportation stated that it  would have been extremely burdensome to do so because its operating  administrations are set up to capture open requests and not overdue  requests. Similarly, HHS officials told us that the decentralized nature of  the department\u2019s FOIA operations and the manual processes that are used  to compile statistics made it impractical to compile the requested data.", "One agency, OPM, did not provide a baseline statistic. It reported 152  overdue requests as of September 2007, but without a baseline, no  conclusion on its progress is possible. According to OPM, because it did  not establish a numerical goal for backlog reduction (its goal was to  eliminate its backlog of overdue requests), it did not record the number of  overdue requests as a baseline before implementing its improvement plan.", "A major reason for this variation in statistics is that agencies did not  necessarily have systems or processes to record backlog in the sense of  the Executive Order (requests for records that have not been responded to  within the statutory time limit); instead, their systems or processes were  based on recording statistics required for the annual reports, which  include a count of open requests pending at the end of the reporting period  but do not include backlog of overdue requests. This challenge is  compounded for agencies with highly decentralized programs or manual  processes, for which assembling the statistics, even if they were available,  is a significant task.", "In addition, the goals that agencies set regarding backlog reduction varied  widely. In our March 2007 report, we noted that almost all plans contained  measurable goals and timetables for avoiding or reducing backlog.  However, the goals concentrated on a wide variety of targets and metrics.  For example, some goals and milestones were focused on activities that  could be expected to reduce backlog by contributing to efficiency, such as  conducting reviews, setting up monitoring mechanisms, hiring staff,  conducting training, and making other process improvements. Others  were numerical goals aimed at particular metrics, such as reducing  processing time; completing a certain percentage of requests within 20  days; reducing the number of some subset of requests (such as the 10  oldest cases, those over a year old, cases opened before a particular date,  or cases at particular components); or reducing the number of pending or  overdue requests by a certain percentage, to a certain number, or to a  certain proportion of requests received per year. The goals also covered a  variety of time frames, so that not all agencies set numerical goals for the  first reporting period (which ended about 7 months after they began  implementing their improvement plans), but instead set only process  goals.", "The reason for this variety of goals and milestones is that Justice\u2019s  guidance on implementing the Executive Order gave agencies broad  flexibility in designing their plans. This guidance emphasized that  identifying ways to eliminate or reduce backlog should be a major  underpinning of the implementation plans of all agencies that had  backlogs. However, the guidance allowed agencies to develop goals that  they considered most appropriate in light of their current FOIA operations;  it did not prescribe any particular metric for all agencies to use. According  to the Director of Justice\u2019s Office of Information and Privacy, the guidance  was intended to provide flexibility to agencies in developing appropriate  measurements that best fit their individual circumstances. As a result, the  goals and milestones set by agencies included a wide variety of different  aims and measures.", "In recent guidance issued to implement the Attorney General\u2019s  recommendations for improving FOIA implementation, Justice directed  agencies to develop backlog reduction goals for fiscal years 2008 to 2010.  The guidance directs agencies to estimate the number of requests they  expect to receive during each fiscal year and to set goals both for the  number of requests they intend to process and for the number of requests  pending beyond the statutory limit (backlog) at the end of each fiscal  year. According to the Director of Justice\u2019s Office of Information and  Privacy, this guidance was aimed at ensuring the continuation of the  improvement process begun by the Executive Order. This guidance  continues the flexible approach set in earlier guidance, in that it gives  agencies freedom to set goals that they consider appropriate and realistic  to their own circumstances.", "The Director of the Office of Information and Privacy also stated that by  directing agencies to establish these goals, the office intended to establish  a core definition for what is being tracked and to encourage agencies to  begin focusing on this metric. However, the guidance does not direct  agencies to modify their existing improvement plans or to otherwise  develop strategies, plans, or milestones to achieve these new goals, which  are in addition to the specific goals set in their improvement plans. The  guidance also does not direct agencies to track and report the actual  number of requests pending beyond the statutory limit. Without such  planning and tracking, agencies may face challenges in achieving the  reductions envisioned. Neither the public nor the agencies could  effectively monitor progress unless agencies put in place processes and  systems that allow them to track and report their backlogs of overdue  requests."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The annual FOIA reports continue to provide valuable information about  the public\u2019s use of this important tool to obtain information about the  operations and decisions of the federal government.

It is important for agencies to ensure that they have appropriate  procedures and internal controls, so that agencies and the public have  reasonable assurance that FOIA data are reliable.", "Some of the challenges that agencies face in processing FOIA requests  include the need to review and redact sometimes large volumes of  responsive records, to consult with other agencies or confer with multiple  organizations, and to provide predisclosure notifications to information  submitters. These practical challenges provide some insight into the  reasons why backlogs can develop and grow, as well as an appreciation of  the need for sustained attention to ensure that backlogs do not become  unmanageable. For example, in one agency component, the pressure to  avoid litigation, while ensuring that some newer requests were responded  to promptly, led to a situation in which very old cases may remain open  indefinitely. Establishing goals and time frames to close such cases could  help avoid this result. The challenge to agency management is to  determine how to apply finite resources to respond to the multiple and  sometimes competing demands placed on their FOIA programs.", "The progress that many agencies have made in reducing backlog suggests  that the development and implementation of the FOIA improvement plans  have had a positive effect. However, in the absence of consistent statistics  on overdue cases, it is not possible to make a full assessment of  governmentwide progress in this area. Justice\u2019s latest guidance on setting  backlog reduction goals is a step toward developing such statistics,  although it does not explicitly ask agencies to track and report them.  However, on the principle that \u201cwhat gets measured gets managed,\u201d the  chances of agency success in achieving reductions could be increased if  they monitor and report statistics on their backlog of overdue requests, as  well as develop plans for achieving their goals.
