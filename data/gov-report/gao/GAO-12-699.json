Several factors contribute to the higher rate of poverty among elderly women including their tendency to have lower lifetime earnings, take time out of the workforce to care for family members, and outlive their spouses. Other factors could affect older women\u0092s financial insecurity. These include the economic downturn and changing trends in pension plan offerings. In light of these circumstances, GAO was asked to examine (1) how women\u0092s access to and participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans compare to men\u0092s and how they have changed over time, (2) how women\u0092s retirement income compares to men\u0092s and how the composition of their income\u0097the proportion of income coming from different sources\u0097changed with economic conditions and trends in pension design, (3) how later-in-life events affect women\u0092s retirement income security, and (4) what policy options are available to help increase women\u0092s retirement income security. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed data from two nationally representative surveys, conducted a broad literature review, and interviewed a range of experts in the area of retirement security.", "GAO is making no recommendations.

Indeed, from 1998 to 2009, women surpassed men in their likelihood of working for an employer that offered a pension plan, largely because the proportion of men covered by a plan declined. Furthermore, as employers have continued to terminate their defined benefit (DB) plans and have switched to defined contribution (DC) plans, the proportion of women who worked for employers that offered a DC plan increased. Correspondingly, women\u0092s participation rates in DC plans increased slightly over this same period while men\u0092s participation fell, thereby narrowing the participation difference between men and women to 1 percentage point. At the same time, however, women contributed to their DC plans at lower levels than men.", "Although the composition of income for women age 65 and over did not vary greatly over the period\u0097despite changes in the economy and pension system\u0097 women continued to have less retirement income on average and live in higher rates of poverty than men in that age group. The composition of women\u0092s income varied only slightly, in part, because their main income sources\u0097Social Security and DB benefits\u0097were shielded from fluctuations in the market. Women, especially widows and those age 80 and over, depended on Social Security benefits for a larger percentage of their income than men. For example, in 2010, 16 percent of women age 65 and over depended solely on Social Security for income compared to 12 percent of men. At the same time, the share of household income women received from earnings increased over the period, but was consistently lower than for men. Moreover, women\u0092s median income was approximately 25 percent lower than men\u0092s over the last decade, and the poverty rate for women in this age group was nearly two times higher than men\u0092s in 2010.", "For women approaching or in retirement, becoming divorced, widowed or unemployed had detrimental effects on their income security. Moreover, divorce and widowhood had more pronounced effects for women than for men. For example, women\u0092s household income, on average, fell by 41 percent with divorce, almost twice the size of the decline that men experienced. For widowhood, women\u0092s household income fell by 37 percent\u0097while men\u0092s declined by only 22 percent. Unemployment also had a detrimental effect on income security, though the effects were similar for women and men; household assets and income fell by 7 to 9 percent.", "A range of existing policy options could address some of the income security challenges women face in retirement. For example, some would expand existing tax incentives to save for retirement while others would improve access to annuities. All of these options have advantages and disadvantages that would need to be evaluated prior to implementation. For example, increasing Social Security benefits for widows could provide additional income for women who have few options to increase their retirement savings. However, increasing benefits would also increase costs to the Social Security program and have implications for its long-term solvency."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Historically, elderly women have been at greater risk of living in poverty  than elderly men.

Second, women are more  likely to take time out of the workforce to care for children and elderly  relatives. These employment patterns result in lower retirement savings,  reduced Social Security benefits, and smaller pension benefits for  women in comparison to men. Third, women tend to live longer than men,  increasing the risk of exhausting their retirement savings before death.

Social Security  provides retirement benefits to eligible workers, based on their work and  earnings history. Social Security also provides benefits to eligible workers  who become disabled before reaching retirement age, as well as  spouses, widow(er)s, and children of eligible workers. Although all Social  Security benefits are based upon a common formula, they are calculated  in different ways for each beneficiary type. The level of the monthly  benefit is adjusted for inflation and varies depending on the age at which  the beneficiary chooses to begin receiving benefits. Generally,  beneficiaries may begin receiving retirement benefits at age 62; however,  the payments will be higher if they wait to receive benefits at their full  retirement age, which varies from 65 to 67, depending on the  beneficiary\u2019s birth year. The monthly retirement benefit continues to rise  for workers who delay benefits beyond their full retirement age, up to age  70. Employees and employers pay payroll taxes that finance Social  Security benefits. However, Social Security faces a long-term financing  shortfall resulting largely from lower birth rates and longer life spans.  According to the Social Security Trustees, the Social Security Trust  Funds could be exhausted by 2033 and unable to pay full benefits.", "Pension income from employer-provided retirement plans falls into two  broad categories: DB and DC pension plans. DB plans typically provide  retirement benefits to each retiree in the form of an annuity that provides a  monthly payment for life, the value of which is typically determined by a  formula based on particular factors specified by the plan, such as salary or  years of service. Under DC plans, workers and employers may make  contributions into individual accounts. Workers can also save for  retirement through an individual retirement account (IRA). IRAs allow  workers to receive favorable tax treatment for making contributions to an  individual account.", "At retirement, participants\u2019 distribution options vary depending on the type  of pension plan. Private sector DB plans must offer participants a benefit in  the form of a lifetime annuity (either immediately or deferred). An annuity  can help to protect a retiree against risks, including the risk of outliving  one\u2019s assets (longevity risk) and, when an inflation-adjusted annuity is  provided, the risk of inflation diminishing one\u2019s purchasing power. Some DB  plans also give participants a choice to take a lump sum cash settlement  (distribution) or roll over funds to an IRA, instead of taking a lifetime  annuity. In contrast, DC plan sponsors are not required to offer a lifetime annuity and more often provide participants with a lump sum distribution as  the only option. Other options for DC participants may include leaving  money in the plan, taking a partial distribution, rolling their plan savings into  an IRA, or purchasing an annuity, which are typically only available outside  of the plan.", "In addition, whether a pension plan is a DB or DC has implications for  whether a spouse is entitled to the pension\u2019s benefits. The Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) requires that DB plans  include a survivor\u2019s benefit, called a qualified joint and survivor annuity.   Thus, after a worker with a DB plan dies, the surviving spouse continues  to receive an annuity, but typically at a reduced level. A qualified joint and survivor annuity may only be waived through a written spousal  consent. Under most DC plans, the plan is written so that the employee  may, during his or her lifetime, make withdrawals from the account or roll  over the balance into an IRA without spousal consent, provided that the  employee\u2019s vested account balance is payable in full on death to the  surviving spouse.", "Over the past quarter-century, the percentage of private sector workers  participating in employer-sponsored pension plans has held steady at  about 50 percent. Although some workers choose not to participate in an  employer-sponsored pension plan, the large majority of nonparticipating  workers do not have access to one. In addition, over the last 3 decades,  the U.S. retirement system has undergone a major transition from one  based primarily on DB plans to one based on DC plans, increasing  workers\u2019 exposure to economic volatility and usually shifting the burden of  saving to the individual worker, which makes them more reliant on their  own decision making. As we have previously reported, from 1990 to  2008, the number of active participants in private sector DB plans fell by  28 percent, from about 26 million to about 19 million. Over the same  period, the number of active participants in DC plans increased by 90  percent, from about 35 million to about 67 million. DC plans generally do  not offer annuities, so retirees are left with increasingly important  decisions about managing their retirement savings to ensure they have  income throughout retirement. These decisions may be more difficult to  make in times of economic volatility. For example, two recent  recessions\u2014one beginning in March 2001 and ending in November 2001  and the other beginning in December 2007 and ending in June 2009\u2014 resulted in major stock indices falling dramatically. The long-term effects  of financial market fluctuations on retirement income security are  uncertain, but the effects may vary based on factors such as age, type of  pension plan, and employment status. Employment status, in particular,  can pose serious challenges for retirement security. As we recently  reported, long-term unemployment can reduce an older worker\u2019s future  monthly retirement income in numerous ways such as by reducing the  number of years the worker can accumulate DB plan retirement benefits  or DC plan savings, by motivating workers to claim Social Security at an  earlier age, and by leading workers to draw down retirement savings to  pay for expenses during unemployment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Working Women\u2019s Access to and Participation in Employer-Sponsored Pension Plans Have Improved Relative to Men", "paragraphs": ["From 1998 to 2009, working women surpassed men in their likelihood of  having an employer that offered a pension plan, but were slightly less  likely to be eligible for and to participate in those plans.

These options could enhance the retirement security of workers who  experience a period of unemployment or who take time out of the  workforce to care for family members. For example, counting  unemployment insurance payments as creditable earnings under Social  Security may be particularly helpful for women who become unemployed  later in life and experience a notable decrease in their assets and income.  However, because they would extend eligibility or increase benefits, these  options would increase costs for Social Security and decrease solvency.", "Other policy options could either expand access to retirement savings in  DC plans and IRAs or strengthen spousal protections for retirement  savings (see table 5). These options could address a variety of  challenges women face, including their lower levels of income in  retirement. In addition, they could preserve retirement income after a  divorce or after becoming widowed. For example, requiring that a wife  provides consent whenever a husband takes a distribution from his DC  savings would protect the wife\u2019s access to household income in  retirement. However, these options could increase costs for plan  sponsors. For example, requiring notarized spousal consent whenever a  husband takes a distribution could increase the administrative costs that  must be paid by plan sponsors.", "Experts identified three policy options that could motivate women nearing  retirement to remain in the workforce and delay claiming Social Security  benefits, thereby giving them more time to save for retirement and  increasing their Social Security benefits (see table 6). Because women  tend to have less income in retirement than men, and because elderly  women face higher poverty rates than elderly men, these options for  boosting retirement savings and benefits may improve women\u2019s overall  retirement income security. For example, the full retirement age for Social  Security could be increased, thus providing workers who are able to work  with an incentive to keep doing so\u2014potentially saving more for retirement  in the process. However, each of these options has disadvantages. In the  case of increasing the full retirement age, this option may not prove to be  effective because women may not be able to work longer or may choose  to exit the workforce before the full retirement age. They would, in turn,  suffer reductions in Social Security income.", "Experts also identified several policies that would ensure lifetime  retirement income for women (see table 7). Women may especially  benefit from these options, given that they (1) have lower levels of  retirement income than men, (2) are more likely to live longer, and (3) are  also more likely to become widowed. For example, Treasury recently  proposed modifying the required minimum distribution rules so that  individuals could use part of their retirement savings to purchase a  longevity annuity. This option would provide older women with  guaranteed additional income, which may be helpful if they live long lives  or outlive a spouse. These options, however, often have cost implications  for either federal tax revenue or plan sponsors. For example, if individuals  purchased longevity annuities using tax-qualified retirement savings, the  tax revenue generated from withdrawing these savings would be deferred  until the annuity started paying out.", "There are also a number of policy options that could enhance Social  Security benefits for vulnerable groups at risk of not having sufficient  income or assets in retirement, including widows, divorced women, low- income women and women age 85 and over (see table 8).increasing the Social Security Survivor\u2019s benefit to 75 percent of the  deceased worker\u2019s benefit would provide widows with more monthly  income, helping to keep some women out of poverty. However, all of  these options would increase existing costs or introduce new costs and,  in turn, would decrease the solvency of the system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["To retirement security experts, our findings paint a familiar if disconcerting  picture. Although increases in women\u2019s labor force and retirement plan  participation have led to a marginal improvement in women\u2019s prospects  for achieving a more secure retirement, our report also highlights the  substantial risks women continue to face in accumulating adequate  retirement income. Yet, despite the differential risks women face,  retirement security in America continues to be a national dilemma that  transcends gender differences. It is important to note that much of the  relative improvement in women\u2019s retirement security has been a  consequence of deterioration in men\u2019s retirement security. Recent  economic volatility, coupled with the continued shift toward defined  contribution plans, exposes all workers to more financial risk than  previous generations. Further, older workers\u2019 financial security is  increasingly dependent on individual choices regarding how much to  save, how to invest those savings, at what age to retire, and how to make  those savings last throughout retirement. Much of the total workforce  continues to approach retirement age with no traditional pension.  Unchecked, this problem will only grow in severity.", "Nevertheless, women face a unique set of circumstances, which warrant  special attention. In particular, our findings show that the disruptions that  occur as a result of later-in-life events, such as divorce and widowhood,  can be financially devastating for women. In addition, women\u2019s greater  likelihood of being single, higher life expectancy, and lower average  earnings continue to make saving for retirement and avoiding late-life  poverty a challenge.", "The challenges facing women\u2019s retirement income security do not lack for  potential resolutions. In fact, our discussions with experts identified a  number of policy options that would improve retirement income security  for women. These options range from changes to Social Security to  altering the private pension system. While these options involve tradeoffs  and difficult choices, they have the potential to improve the retirement  income security of men as well. Ultimately, such efforts provide  opportunities to improve the retirement security of many Americans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor, the  Department of the Treasury, and the Social Security Administration for  review and comment.

The survey is conducted in a  series of national panels, with sample sizes ranging from approximately  14,000 to 36,700 interviewed households. The duration of each panel  ranges from 2 \u00bd years to 4 years. Within each panel, the data are  collected in a series of \u201cwaves\u201d which take place in 4-month cycles.  Within each wave, Census administers a core survey consisting of  questions that are asked at every interview, and several modules relating  to a particular topic.

For all  but the 2008 panel, the topical module on retirement and pension  coverage was administered in Wave 7. For objective 1, we matched core  data from Wave 3 of the 2008 panel with the topical module data, which  was also administered in Wave 3. This ensured that the demographic  data used in the analysis for that objective would match the time frame of  the topical module data. However, to obtain the most up to date income  data for objective 2, we used core data from Wave 7, which was the most  recently available data as of October 2011.

First, the SIPP collects separate information on  defined benefit (DB) and defined contribution (DC) plans. Other surveys,  such as the Current Population Survey, do not distinguish between  income from and participation in DB and DC plans.

For example, if we know that  women are disproportionately more likely to work part-time and that part- time status is an important factor associated with plan participation, we  can infer that women\u2019s higher rates of part-time status might contribute to  their lower rates of plan participation.

In  fact, the positive gender effect for women is eliminated when we control  for occupational characteristics using a statistical model (results not  shown below).

In these models, we attempted to control for a set of demographic and other  variables, such as education and age that could be correlated with life events, household  assets, and household income. A challenge to this approach is that many factors that  affect assets and income are unobserved, and lead to mistaken conclusions. For example,  if an individual earns a low wage, that may be connected with poor health and the  accumulation of assets. So, while the researcher is attempting to estimate the effect of  health on income, what is actually measured is the effect of income on health. In general,  in our cross-section models, we found that effects were larger in magnitude than in the  fixed-effects models, but these models were not as good a fit to the data as the fixed- effects models.", "Specifically, we estimated variations of the following equation, separately  by gender:  (1) Log (Household Assets or Income) = \u03b1 + \u03b1 + \u03b2*(poor health) + \u03c7  *(marital status) + \u03b4*(other control variables)", "Where, \u03b1 and \u03b1 indicate fixed effects for the individual and wave. \u03b2 is the  effect of poor health and \u03b4 \uf020and \u03c7 are the effect of other control variables  and marital status.By including a dummy variable for each wave, we  attempted to control for all national-level changes that could have affected  assets and income, and also have been associated with the life events.  Therefore, \u03b2 \uf020can be interpreted as the effect of poor health, measured as  the percent difference in average assets between periods where an  individual reports poor versus not-poor health. Due to the additional  controls, this average percent difference is measured relative to the  changes over time, and also relative to the other time-variant measures  captured, such as changes in marital status.", "However, while some of the life-events are likely associated with the  passage of time, the regression does not assume that relationship. For  example, if an individual switches from poor health to good health, the  fixed-effects regression will also use those transitions to estimate the size  of the effect. Similarly, the fixed-effects regression will also use transitions  from married to widowed, as well as widowed to married, to estimate the  effect of widowhood.", "Other control variables that we included were age (measured as date of wave minus  birth year), race and education (categorical), cohort of HRS survey, Census region, region  of birth (12 categories, including non-U.S.). In general, in the cross-section models, we  found that education was positively related to assets and income, while minority status  was negatively related. With some slight variation, we based our choice of control  variables on Coile and Milligan. (See Courtney Coile and Kevin Milligan, \u201cHow Household  Portfolios Evolve After Retirement: The Effect of Aging and Health Shocks,\u201d The Review  of Income and Wealth, vol. 55 no. 2 (Malden, MA: June 2009)).  In order to estimate effects in terms of percents, we estimated the effects on the log of  assets or income. In addition, we transformed the coefficients to more closely approximate  percent changes by taking the exponent of the estimated coefficient and subtracting 1.  Regression variables were weighted by household weights. the possibility of endogenous relationships. For example, if an individual\u2019s  health declined because income fell, and not the other way around, that  bias could affect our findings.", "Some of the life events we examined were likely correlated with changes  in household structure, such as changes in marital status. However, if the  income of a household falls when an individual leaves, the remaining  individuals may not be worse off when it comes to resources because the  household now requires fewer resources to meet its needs. To address  this, we adjusted the estimated effects by household size; the  household\u2019s income and assets were scaled by the square root of the  individuals in the household. The rationale for using the square root is  because the effect of reducing members is diminishing (changing from 1  to 2 has a larger effect than going from 9 to 10).  In addition, this analysis  estimated the effect of an individual\u2019s life event on household assets or  income.  We did not attempt to determine to what extent a spouse\u2019s life  event (for married individuals) may have affected household assets or  income)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Divorce", "paragraphs": ["Table 19 contains the effects of the first event we analyzed: divorce.
