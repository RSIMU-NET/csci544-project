Semiconductors, commonly known as integrated circuits or  computer \u201cchips,\u201d are often used in weapons systems as well as consumer  electronics such as computers, cell phones, and televisions. The  manufacture of semiconductors takes about 2 months, requires a complex  process involving more than 250 steps, and uses hundreds of millions of  dollars in sophisticated equipment and materials.

This industry in turn  produces the computer chips needed by many other industries, including a  $1.6 trillion electronics industry. Semiconductors are devices that enable  computers and other products such as cell phones to process and store  information. Producing semiconductors is a multistep sequence of  photographic and chemical processes during which electronic circuits are  gradually created on a wafer made of pure semiconducting material, most  commonly silicon. For example, the equipment used to manufacture  semiconductors performs tasks such as depositing a thin chemical film on  wafers, and selectively removing the film by etching it away, creating  microscopic transistors.", "The technological complexity of semiconductors is indicated by the feature  size (the density of the etched lines) on the wafer. Smaller feature sizes  measured in nanometers allow for more components to be integrated on a  single semiconductor, thus creating more powerful semiconductors. Each  reduction in feature size\u2014for example, from 90 nanometers to 65  nanometers\u2014is considered a move to a greater level of technological  sophistication, or a move to the next \u201cgeneration\u201d of manufacturing  technology.", "Consistent with multilateral export controls, the U.S. government classifies  semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials as dual-use items  because they have both commercial and military uses. Under the authority  granted in the Export Administration Act of 1979, Commerce\u2019s Bureau of  Industry and Security (BIS) administers export controls for dual-use items  through the requirements contained in the Export Administration  Regulations (EAR). Under these regulations, exporters are to either  obtain prior government authorization from BIS in the form of a license,  general authorization, or license exception, or determine that a license is  not needed before exporting dual-use items. The EAR establishes a  framework for regulating the export of dual-use items by identifying the  characteristics and capabilities of items that may require export licenses.  These characteristics and capabilities are contained in the Commerce  Control List, which provides detailed specifications for about 2,400 dual- use items, divided into 10 categories (see app. II for a list of the 10  categories). Each category is subdivided into five groups designated by  letters A through E (see app. II for a list of the five groups). For example,  semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment and  materials fall under Category 3 (electronics), with manufacturing  equipment placed in Category 3B (test, inspections, and production  equipment) and materials placed in Category 3C (materials).", "Exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and materials to  China are primarily controlled for national security and antiterrorism  reasons.

In  turn, this would enable Commerce to dedicate more resources to  transactions and end-users that are less well known, and thus enhance  security. However, according to the Director of Commerce\u2019s Office of  Technology Evaluation, the department has a finite amount of resources  and an increasing number of export licenses to process from year to year.  Thus, he noted that it is unclear whether a potential reduction in licensing  volume resulting from increased shipments under the VEU program would  allow Commerce to increase scrutiny over lesser-known end-users or  merely enable Commerce to maintain current levels of oversight. In  addition, although Commerce anticipated that one of the program\u2019s  benefits would be to increase scrutiny over lesser known end-users,  according to the Chairperson of the ERC, it was unclear whether increased  shipments under the VEU program would coincide with additional PSV  checks for end-users that receive items under individual export licenses  due to the multiple considerations involved in scheduling and carrying out  PSV checks.", "The advantages of the VEU program anticipated by Commerce have not yet  been realized because few U.S. exporters have shipped items to China  under the authorization. Commerce\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated  benefits of the VEU program hinges on whether or not exporters choose to  use the VEU authorization rather than an individual license. Recognizing  the high volume and dollar value of U.S. exports to certain companies in  China, Commerce designed the VEU program with the goal of reducing the  number of licenses to these types of companies. For instance, according to  Commerce, the first five companies designated as validated end-users  accounted for 18 percent of the value of licensed trade with China in 2006.  Commerce anticipates that approval of a second set of five companies  could increase that number to 40 percent. However, as of June 2008, only  one of the three validated end-users authorized to receive semiconductor  equipment and materials had received any items under the program.   Furthermore, according to Commerce, since the first validated end-users  were authorized in October 2007, approximately 6 percent of the total  exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China have taken  place under the VEU program, whereas 94 percent were conducted under  an export license. In addition, according to the Chairperson of the ERC,  since the VEU program was authorized, three licenses were issued for  items that could have been shipped under the VEU program.", "Company officials that received validated end-user status offered several  reasons for not yet fully using the authorization. One company official  stated that they were upgrading their administrative systems and planned  to switch from their Special Comprehensive License to the VEU program in  the fall of 2008. Another validated end-user cited a global economic  slowdown in their industry as a reason for not taking advantage of the VEU  program. Finally, another company official with validated end-user status  noted that some of its suppliers have elected to use existing individual or  special comprehensive licenses to avoid the administrative burden and  time requirements associated with obtaining an additional End-User  Statement from the Chinese government, as recently requested by  Commerce. The EAR does not require that validated end-users obtain End- User Statements for shipments received under the authorization.  However, in April 2008, Commerce requested that the first five validated  end-users seek End-User Statements from the Chinese government to  facilitate on-site reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges with VEU Implementation May Limit Commerce\u2019s Ability to Conduct On-site Reviews", "paragraphs": ["Commerce may not be able to ensure that semiconductor equipment and  materials exported to China are used as intended because it has not  negotiated a VEU-specific agreement with the Chinese government for  conducting on-site reviews under the VEU program and lacks specific  procedures for carrying out these reviews. On-site reviews are not a  mandatory program requirement; rather, they are discretionary based on  an assessment of each validated end-user by the ERC. Commerce has  stated though that on-site reviews are a key mechanism for ensuring that  validated end-users comply with the terms of the authorization and that the  ability to conduct meaningful on-site reviews will be a critical factor in  Commerce\u2019s long-term support of the program.", "However, Commerce may be limited in its ability to conduct on-site reviews  of validated end-users because it has not negotiated a VEU-specific  agreement with the Chinese government for conducting these reviews. In  October 2007, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced that Chinese  entities were prohibited from hosting foreign governments, including the  U.S. government, for interviews or investigations related to export controls  without its permission. The Chinese government has also asked that  Commerce refrain from approving any new, additional validated end-users  until the two sides can agree on terms for conducting on-site reviews of  validated end-users. A senior official from the Chinese Ministry of  Commerce stated to us during a March 2008 meeting that the Ministry  wants on-site reviews to be conducted either according to the terms of the  2004 EUVU, or under a newly negotiated U.S.-China agreement specific to  the VEU program. In the absence of a new agreement specific to the VEU  program, Commerce has requested to conduct one on-site review pursuant  to the terms of the 2004 EUVU as a stopgap measure. However, to conduct  on-site reviews under the 2004 agreement, Commerce relies on the  voluntary compliance of validated end-users to obtain End-User  Statements from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, as this requirement  was not included in the regulations establishing the VEU program.  According to Commerce, Chinese officials were receptive to its request for  an on-site review, but MOFCOM and Commerce have agreed to postpone  the check under the existing EUVU mechanism, as negotiations on the  VEU-specific protocol are still in progress.", "Commerce\u2019s ability to ensure that items shipped under the VEU program  are being used as intended is further limited by a lack of procedures for  selecting and conducting the on-site reviews. Commerce officials stated  that criteria that could be considered for on-site review selection include  the volume of items shipped, the geographic location of the validated end- user, the civil or military utility of the authorized items, foreign or U.S.  company ownership, the facility\u2019s licensing history, and intelligence  reporting. In April 2008, 10 months after Commerce approved the VEU  program, draft procedures for selecting end-users for on-site reviews were  disseminated to ERC members. However, as of September 2008,  interagency agreement on these procedures had not been reached.  Moreover, Commerce has not developed procedures for conducting on-site  reviews. During our field work in March 2008 in China, Commerce\u2019s export  control officer in Beijing noted that it was unclear how on-site reviews  would be conducted because she was unaware of procedures governing  them. Thus, even if the Chinese Ministry of Commerce grants permission to  conduct an on-site review, it is unclear how the review would be conducted  in the absence of any final procedures.

Commerce also noted that there is substantial public  information on foreign availability of semiconductor manufacturing  equipment and materials in China. In response to our prior  recommendation, Commerce noted that, while the EAR allows the U.S.  government to initiate a foreign availability assessment, this provision is  intended primarily to be used by industry to challenge overly restrictive or  ineffective export controls.", "In recent years, semiconductor equipment manufacturers have not  requested Commerce to conduct a foreign availability assessment because  the assessments require a significant amount of effort, and previous efforts  have not resulted in the decontrol of any equipment. For instance, SEMI  indicated that it submitted, for the United States to discuss at Wassenaar, a  number of proposals to decontrol items, which were unsuccessful.  Furthermore, SEMI indicated that the scope of the issue regarding controls  over semiconductor manufacturing equipment is too large for them to  undertake without a serious commitment from the U.S. government.", "Commerce has taken steps to address our 2002 recommendation, however,  by evaluating foreign availability when assessing export controls and  making licensing decisions related to semiconductor manufacturing  equipment and materials. Information provided by a number of sources\u2014 including technical advisory groups, the public, and reviews of license  applications\u2014informs both export controls and licensing decisions. For  example, Commerce receives information about foreign availability from  its technical advisory committee and uses this information to develop  proposals during multilateral discussions and for Commerce Control List  reviews. The proposals could result in the addition or elimination of a  control. For example, according to Commerce, a number of adjustments or  liberalizations to controls for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and  materials have occurred as a result of this input.", "Commerce also seeks information regarding foreign availability from the  public. For example, during the development of the China military end-use  rule, Commerce originally planned to control 47 items. Commerce  published a notice in the Federal Register seeking information, including  whether or not the items they were seeking to control were available in  foreign markets. In response to the feedback it received and analysis it  conducted, Commerce reduced the list of items controlled from 47 to 31.  Included among the items were several types of lower-level semiconductor  manufacturing equipment that Commerce determined were available from  sources outside Wassenaar.", "Commerce also noted that, as China has emerged as a significant  semiconductor manufacturer over the past decade, U.S. export control  officials have become knowledgeable about different \u201cplayers\u201d in China as  well as the various sources of supply for controlled semiconductor  manufacturing equipment. According to Commerce, officials incorporate  this information into the licensing review process.

In its Fiscal Year 2006 Annual Report, Commerce announced  that it planned to conduct two studies related to the semiconductor and  semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries. First, Commerce  stated that it planned to conduct an industrial base assessment on U.S.  integrated circuit design and manufacturing capability. According to the  Director of OTE, Commerce has initiated this study, and it is nearing  completion. Second, Commerce announced plans to conduct an evaluation  of the health and competitiveness of U.S. industry engaged in developing  critical semiconductor manufacturing equipment technology.

Integrated circuits, for example, are not only inputs to consumer products  but are often used in weapons systems.

This statement is not required under the VEU  program and thus imposes an additional burden on validated end-users,  running counter to the trade-facilitating objectives of the program.

Commerce has consistently  stated that on-site reviews for validated end-users and end-use checks for  individual licenses are distinct activities serving different purposes.  End- use checks focus on ensuring that an item is being used for the purposes  stated in the license, whereas on-site reviews are more comprehensive.

We have modified our draft report to indicate that Commerce intends to  use the 2004 End Use Visit Understanding (EUVU) as a stopgap  measure to conduct on-site reviews under the VEU program. However,  as we note in the following comment, this stopgap measure imposes an  additional burden on VEU-authorized companies. Moreover, the  Chinese government has not always agreed with this approach. In 2007,  China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce issued a decree prohibiting Chinese  entities from accepting on-site reviews conducted by foreign  government personnel without its permission.  The Chinese  government also requested that the United States refrain from  approving any new validated end-users until the two countries agreed  on the terms for conducting these reviews.   2. We understand that the intent of the VEU program is to enhance and  facilitate trade between the United States and China.  Our report notes  that the VEU program would foster trade by reducing the  administrative burden associated with seeking an export license for  U.S. exporters and enabling VEU-authorized entities to obtain items  more easily than their domestic competitors.  Commerce asserted that  it can use the EUVU procedures for inspecting shipments made under  the VEU program, but it can only do so by requesting validated end- users to voluntarily obtain End-User Statements from the Chinese  government.  Such statements are required for all exports of controlled  items to China under individual export licenses that exceed $50,000.   However, these statements were not required under the VEU program  and impose an additional burden on VEU-authorized companies.  Commerce notes that the procedures for obtaining these statements  are cumbersome and conflict with the trade facilitating objective of the  VEU program. Until VEU negotiations with the Chinese government are  completed, the trade-enhancing benefits of the program may not be  realized.  3. We disagree with Commerce\u2019s assertion that general procedures for  selecting and conducting on-site reviews do exist. First, as noted in this  report, the procedures for selecting which validated end-users will  receive on-site reviews are still in draft form as of September 2008 and  have not been cleared by the interagency process. Commerce would  not provide us with a copy of these draft procedures.  Second,  Commerce\u2019s general procedures for conducting end-use checks are not  specific to the VEU program. Instead, they were designed for pre- license and postshipment verification checks of items shipped under  individual export licenses. End-use checks focus on ensuring that an  item is being used for the purposes stated in the license, whereas on- site reviews are more comprehensive.  In the course of our work,  Commerce repeatedly asserted that end-use checks for individual  licenses and on-site reviews under the VEU program are distinct  activities that serve different purposes. Finally, we agree that  Commerce needs additional case-by-case guidance for on-site reviews  to ensure that the review is tailored to a particular validated end-user.  However, the department also needs general procedures to ensure that  on-site reviews are conducted in a consistent manner.  4. Commerce\u2019s comment is perplexing since the department appears to be  contending that semiconductors do not provide the United States with  a strategic military advantage. As evidence, Commerce notes that  semiconductors are included on the Wassenaar Arrangement Basic List,  rather than its Sensitive or Very Sensitive List. However, Commerce  understates the military significance of items on Wassenaar\u2019s Basic List.  According to Wassenaar\u2019s Basic List criteria, items to be controlled are  those which are \u201cmajor or key elements for the indigenous production,  use, or enhancement of military capabilities.\u201d Furthermore,  semiconductor manufacturing equipment is not only controlled on the  Basic List. One of the first validated end-users was authorized to  receive metal organic chemical vapor deposition reactors (MOCVD), an  item included on Wassenaar\u2019s Sensitive List, under the VEU program in  China.  This equipment may be used to produce radiation-hardened  electronics, for use in commercial and military applications.      5. Commerce noted that we needed to make clear that the report  describes the capabilities of companies in China rather than those of  the government.  We agree and have made changes to the report to  reflect this distinction. 6. We have revised the report to clarify that, before the introduction of the  VEU program in 2007, export licenses provided the only mechanism by  which U.S. companies could ship most advanced semiconductor  manufacturing equipment and materials to China.  We also note that  since the introduction of the VEU program, the majority of  semiconductor manufacturing equipment exported to China continues  to be made under individual export licenses. We added export data to  the report showing that, according to Commerce, during the first 9  months of the VEU program, 94 percent of the total exports of  semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China were approved  under individual or special comprehensive licenses while 6 percent  were authorized under the VEU program. 7. We used the term \u201ctrusted\u201d entities because Commerce officials used  the same language in discussions with us to describe companies that  would be approved as validated end-users. Moreover, Commerce has  used the \u2018trusted\u201d term in public statements describing the program,  including as recently as April, 2008, in testimony before Congress.   8. We have revised our reference to Chinese companies and now refer to  these companies as companies or entities in China."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Anthony Moran, Assistant  Director; Nabajyoti Barkakati; Lynn Cothern; Julie Hirshen; Drew Lindsey;  Grace Lui; and Mark Speight made key contributions to this report.
