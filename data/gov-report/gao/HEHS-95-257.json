Consequently, the Congress has been considering approaches to broaden the protections available to allow people to change health plans without facing lapses in health care coverage. In particular, S. 1028 includes provisions to increase the portability of health care coverage when individuals change health plans. Allowing individuals to receive credit for their previous health care coverage in many cases would exempt them from having to wait before being fully eligible under their new health plan.", "You asked us to provide information on (1) the protections offered by current state and federal health insurance portability reforms, (2) the number of people who could be affected by broader national portability standards, and (3) other issues related to the design of national portability standards.

If a new employer does not offer health insurance, an individual must either depend on another source of health care coverage (such as a spouse\u2019s plan or purchasing individual coverage) or become uninsured. Even if a new employer offers coverage, the new plan\u2019s benefits may be more limited or more expensive than the previous plan\u2019s.", "Most private health plans have waiting periods for new enrollees and limit coverage for preexisting conditions. These limitations allow insurers to ensure that new enrollees have not purchased insurance just because they have become sick. However, the risk of losing health care coverage discourages workers from changing jobs, leading to a phenomenon known as \u201cjob lock.\u201d", "Employer benefits surveys have found that waiting periods and preexisting condition clauses are common, even among larger employers. KPMG Peat Marwick in 1994 reported that, among employers with at least 200 employees, 62 percent of health plans have time periods during which an employee must wait before getting coverage, typically lasting less than 3 months. The Peat Marwick survey also found that 59 percent of indemnity plans, 70 percent of preferred provider organization (PPO) plans, and 56 percent of point-of-service (POS) plans have preexisting condition exclusions. In contrast with the other plan types, health maintenance organizations (HMO) do not typically have preexisting condition clauses.

The COBRA requirements generally allow individuals who leave a job to continue their health plan for up to 18 months by paying no more than 102 percent of the premium previously paid by the employer and employee, even if the employee starts a new job that offers health care coverage. A recent study found that 22 percent of eligible individuals continued health care coverage through the COBRA requirements. Another study estimated that the COBRA requirements increased mobility by 10 percent among those with health insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Recently, we reported that most states enacted small group health insurance reforms between 1990 and 1994. We found that 40 states have included portability provisions in their small employer health insurance legislation. These provisions require insurance carriers to waive preexisting condition limits or waiting periods if an individual has been continuously enrolled in a health plan. The states vary in the size of groups for which these provisions apply, the length of time allowed between health plans for coverage to be considered continuous, and how coverage between current and prior policies is linked for determining the effect of preexisting conditions.", "We also reported that most state reforms have included, in addition to portability provisions, guaranteed issue, guaranteed renewal, and limits on preexisting condition exclusions. For guaranteed issue, states vary in whether insurers are required to actively offer a single plan to all small employers, offer two or more plans, or offer all of their plans with a guarantee that a plan would be issued. Every state we examined except Georgia requires insurers to guarantee renewal of a health policy regardless of health status or claims experience, with limited exceptions. We found that 41 states limit the use of preexisting conditions to deny coverage for specific illness, with about half limiting the term of preexisting conditions to no more than 1 year and ten states shortening the waiting period to 6 months or less. Finally, we found that, to varying degrees, most states impose rating restrictions on health insurers. For example, some states have limited the factors that insurers can use to estimate premiums, narrowed the range in rate differences among different groups, or adopted adjusted community rating.", "State insurance reforms, however, cannot address the portability issue for every employee. Under ERISA, health plans that are self-funded by employers are not affected by state insurance regulation, including portability requirements. We estimate that about 44 million Americans are in self-funded health plans that states cannot regulate, even indirectly.States have also generally limited their reforms to insurance policies sold to small firms.

In effect, these bills would limit the length of time that preexisting condition clauses can restrict health care coverage by providing credit for individuals who have been continuously enrolled by another group health plan. Thus, individuals with medical conditions who change health plans when they change jobs would not have to wait before receiving full coverage. In addition, S. 1028 would allow individuals who have exhausted their 18 to 36 months of COBRA continuation coverage, or who were ineligible for COBRA continuation because their prior firm employed fewer than 20 employees, to convert to individual coverage without having to meet eligibility requirements such as waiting periods or preexisting condition exclusions.

Table 1 shows each of these affected groups and our estimates of the number of individuals that the proposed legislation could affect.", "Insurance regulation that ensures portability could benefit people in a variety of ways. Without portability standards, people with preexisting medical conditions who change health plans could be denied coverage for their conditions and may have to pay out of pocket for necessary medical services. Others may have to pay for COBRA continuation coverage in addition to paying for their new private health plan to ensure that their medical conditions are covered. Some people will remain in a job or turn down job offers because of health insurance concerns. A few people who exhaust their COBRA continuation coverage, or are ineligible for COBRA coverage after leaving a job, will be unable to purchase individual coverage at any price if they have a severe medical condition, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome, severe diabetes, or heart disease.Finally, individuals who change employers may find that, even if the employer offers a choice of health plans, their choice is limited to health plans without preexisting condition exclusions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Portability Standards Would Reduce Discontinuity in Health Care Coverage for People Changing Jobs", "paragraphs": ["The largest group of people affected by the proposed legislation is those who change jobs. On the basis of our analysis of the CPS, over 20 million Americans changed jobs in 1993. Nearly 12 million of these people also maintained employer-based health care coverage. Additionally, nearly 7 million nonworking dependents received employer-based coverage through these job changers. Without portability standards, many of these individuals faced preexisting condition exclusions or waiting periods with their new health care coverage. Furthermore, individuals with preexisting conditions could face a period in which their new plan does not cover their condition. As an alternative, some could purchase COBRA continuation coverage if they want to be insured for a preexisting condition, though such coverage would be duplicative.", "The proposed legislation would benefit such individuals to the extent that their coverage would not lapse while they are between health plans. Because about three-quarters of job changes are voluntary and therefore unlikely to mean a significant gap in employment, we estimate that S. 1028 would allow about 9 million individuals (with 5 million dependents) to change jobs without having any preexisting condition clause exclusions.Also under S. 1028, the remaining 3 million job changers (with 2 million dependents) would likely have reduced waiting periods, if any at all, before receiving full eligibility for coverage.", "The proposed legislation would also allow individuals to purchase individual-based health care coverage without preexisting condition limits if they had maintained group health care coverage for at least 18 months and are no longer eligible for COBRA continuation coverage. In addition, individuals employed by firms with fewer than 20 employees who lose their employer-based coverage are not eligible for COBRA continuation coverage, but they could immediately qualify for individual coverage through the proposed portability standards. On the basis of COBRA continuation coverage election rates and turnover rates in small firms, we estimate that about 2 million individuals would be able to convert from employer-based coverage to individual coverage (although at a higher premium) without having to meet preexisting condition exclusions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Portability Provisions Would Also Lessen Fear of Losing Coverage From Changing Jobs", "paragraphs": ["The proposed legislation, however, would affect more individuals than those who change health plans because the standards would allow those workers who stay in their jobs out of concern over losing health care coverage to change jobs. Although studies of the extent of job lock have varying conclusions, we estimate that over time between 1 million and 4 million additional workers would change jobs if national portability standards were in effect.", "Surveys have found that between 11 and 30 percent of individuals report that they or a family member have remained in a job at some time because they did not want to lose health care coverage. Extrapolating from a 1993 survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, we estimate that the proposed portability standards would relieve as many as 3 million or 4 million Americans of job lock. Twenty percent of individuals who reported job lock in their households cited preexisting conditions as the main reason for not changing jobs, according to this survey.", "Other estimates of the extent of job lock among those with health insurance have varied. Although one study found little evidence of job lock, other studies we reviewed found that job mobility was reduced by at least 20 percent for individuals with health insurance and more for those who could have high medical expenses. For example, one study estimated that job mobility for workers with health care coverage was reduced by nearly one-third for married men, over one-third for workers with large families (a proxy for high medical expenses), and two-thirds for workers with a pregnant wife. Another study reported that employer-based health care coverage reduced job mobility by 23 percent for men and over 30 percent for women.

While the standards would guarantee that individuals could change health plans without having to meet preexisting condition exclusions, the standards\u2019 effects on price and affordability of coverage are less clear, particularly for people with medical conditions.", "Since the cost of health insurance coverage is often cited as the most critical determinant of whether firms or individuals purchase coverage, the expected effects on premiums are crucial in determining the net impact of state and federal insurance reforms on the level of coverage. High expected costs for an individual can mean a high premium, particularly for individual and small group policies. If government restrictions constrain premiums for individuals or a group, then insurers may be forced to raise premiums for all other workers.", "Although empirical evidence is sparse, the possible price effects relate more directly to other health insurance reforms, such as guaranteed issue, than to portability. In fact, for the entire market, portability should little affect prices because the cost of these individuals would merely be shifted among health plans. Raised premiums could occur when a potentially high-cost individual transfers into a very small firm or the individual health insurance market. With no restrictions on ratings, the small firm\u2019s or the individual\u2019s premium could be significantly raised, which could lead to a decision to forego coverage.", "For this reason, some insurers have opposed provisions in state and federal legislation to extend portability standards to individual-based health plans. They believe that high-cost individuals are the ones most likely to convert from a group health plan to an individual health plan, leading to increased premiums. Insurers disagree, however, about the extent to which national portability standards would cause higher premiums. Premium increases, if any, would depend upon the size of the covered group, rating restrictions imposed by state laws, and the extent to which the insurer uses medical underwriting to set premiums.", "Federal and state legislators have tried to respond to these concerns to some extent. Several states, for example, explicitly recognize the greater uncertainties in the individual market by applying some reforms only to employers with at least two or three workers or only to self-employed individuals. In response to these concerns, S. 1028 as approved by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources includes a provision that requires anyone converting to an individual health plan to have had continuous group health care coverage for the preceding 18 months for the portability standards to be effective.
