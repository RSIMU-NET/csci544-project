Because of the MDBs\u2019 favorable credit ratings, those MDBs that borrow funds from world capital markets are able to obtain more favorable loan terms than their borrowers could otherwise negotiate. Thus, MDBs enable developing countries to access foreign currency resources on more advantageous terms than would be available to them solely on the basis of their own international credit standing.

Most loans are issued with market-based interest rates; however, some MDBs offer loans at concessional (less than current market) rates to the poorest of the developing countries. MDB loans are available in various currencies to their member countries or, in some cases, to private enterprises, for development projects in a borrowing member country.
