This report assesses the extent to which (1) ODNI has implemented an executive branch-wide program and developed plans to monitor and measure its performance; (2) DOD and other agencies have designed, piloted, and evaluated continuous evaluation and (3) agencies completed timely periodic reinvestigations from fiscal years 2012-2016, and the potential effects of continuous evaluation on reinvestigations. GAO reviewed documentation, analyzed timeliness data, and interviewed officials from ODNI and other agencies. This is a public version of a sensitive report that is being issued concurrently.

For the first phase, agencies are to conduct certain continuous evaluation record checks against a portion of their national security population by the end of fiscal year 2017. However, ODNI has not formalized its policy on what continuous evaluation encompasses, determined what the future phases will entail or when they will occur, or developed an implementation plan. According to all seven agencies GAO interviewed, this uncertainty has affected their ability to plan for the program and estimate its costs. Without a continuous evaluation policy and a fully developed plan, full implementation\u2014which has been delayed since 2010\u2014may be further delayed. Moreover, ODNI lacks a plan to monitor and measure program performance, including for the first phase, which is underway. Without developing such a plan, ODNI cannot ensure that the program is being implemented consistently across the executive branch or that it is effectively identifying risks to national security.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of State (State) have designed, piloted, and evaluated continuous evaluation. Their approaches have varied in scope, size, and duration, as they pre-date ODNI's efforts to implement continuous evaluation executive branch-wide. DOD's pilot involves the most record checks and the largest population. DOD had 500,000 employees enrolled in December 2016, and it plans to enroll 1 million by the end of calendar year 2017 and all clearance holders by the end of fiscal year 2021.", "Executive branch agencies meeting established timeliness goals for completing periodic reinvestigations decreased from fiscal years 2012 through 2016, and the potential effects of continuous evaluation, including on reinvestigations and resources, are unknown. While 84 percent of the executive branch agencies reviewed by GAO reported meeting the executive branch's 195-day timeliness goal for at least three of four quarters in fiscal year 2012, only 22 percent did so in fiscal year 2016. Also, a 2008 report outlined a plan to replace reinvestigations with continuous evaluation, but ODNI documentation indicates that this is no longer the intent. While agencies expressed varying views about changes to reinvestigations\u2014such as modifying their scope\u2014officials from five agencies stated that the continuous evaluation program will increase their workloads and costs if no other changes are made to the requirements. DOD officials said they cannot afford to conduct both continuous evaluation and reinvestigations, as DOD estimates that more frequent reinvestigations for certain clearance holders will cost $1.8 billion for fiscal years 2018 through 2022. Although agencies have identified increased resources as a risk of the program, ODNI has not assessed the program's potential effects on agency resources. Without assessing the potential effects once ODNI has further defined the program, implementing continuous evaluation could lead to further delays and backlogs in reinvestigations, and could increase agency costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that ODNI formalize its policy on continuous evaluation, develop an implementation plan as well as a plan to monitor and measure program performance, and assess the potential effects of continuous evaluation on agency resources.

Implementing a continuous evaluation program has  been a long-standing goal of security clearance reform efforts, with  implementation milestones set by the government-wide reform effort  dating back to the 4th quarter of fiscal year 2010 and Department of  Defense (DOD) pilot studies dating back to the early 2000\u2019s. Specifically,  since 2001, DOD\u2019s Defense Personnel and Security Research Center  (PERSEREC) has conducted a number of studies related to continuous  evaluation, such as the usefulness of various data sources, the technical  capability to conduct automated record checks, and the value and utility  of such checks.", "Following the September 2013 shooting at the Washington Navy Yard,  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) conducted a 120-day  review of the government\u2019s security clearance procedures.

The report also included a milestone for the Office of the Director  of National Intelligence (ODNI) to develop an initial continuous evaluation  capability for certain clearance holders by September 2014. However, in  April 2015, we found, among other things, that the milestone for  implementing continuous evaluation had been adjusted to December  2016, and that executive branch agencies faced challenges in  establishing a continuous evaluation policy and implementing the  process.", "You asked us to review executive branch efforts to implement a  continuous evaluation program for personnel security clearances. Our  objectives were to assess the extent to which: (1) ODNI has implemented  an executive branch-wide continuous evaluation program and developed  plans for monitoring and measuring the performance of the program; (2)  DOD and other executive branch agencies, if any, have designed, piloted,  and evaluated continuous evaluation; and (3) executive branch agencies  completed periodic reinvestigations in accordance with established  timeliness goals from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, and the  potential effects of continuous evaluation on periodic reinvestigations.  This report is a public version of a sensitive report that we issued in  November 2017. ODNI and State deemed some of the information in our  November report to be sensitive, which must be protected from public  disclosure. Therefore, this report omits sensitive information about  ODNI\u2019s continuous evaluation program and State\u2019s pilot.

We compared the status of the  continuous evaluation program against recommendations resulting from  the February 2014 120-day review. We also conducted interviews with  officials from DOD, the Department of State (State), the Department of  Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Department  of Justice, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine the  extent to which those agencies have developed plans to implement  continuous evaluation and determined potential costs. We selected these  seven agencies based on their management of the data sources to be  checked as part of continuous evaluation and because they are among  those subject to ODNI\u2019s continuous evaluation requirements. We  compared ODNI program documentation against relevant program  management criteria for developing project management plans, key  attributes of successful performance measures identified in our prior  work, and Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  related to communication with external partners and monitoring activities.", "For our second objective, we reviewed pilots underway at DOD and  State\u2014the two agencies that have piloted continuous evaluation in  advance of its implementation across the executive branch. Specifically,  we analyzed DOD documentation related to its continuous evaluation  process and reviewed PERSEREC reports on DOD\u2019s continuous  evaluation pilots, including lessons learned. We also interviewed officials  who developed those reports and analyzed available metrics to determine  how DOD has evaluated and tracked the results of its pilots. In addition,  we conducted interviews with DOD officials from the Defense Security  Service, the Defense Manpower and Data Center, the Consolidated  Adjudications Facility, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Intelligence, which all have roles in the department\u2019s continuous  evaluation program. We also reviewed metrics and lessons learned from  State\u2019s pilot and conducted interviews with officials conducting the pilots  at State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Finally, we observed a  demonstration of the information technology (IT) system that DOD is  developing for use in conducting continuous evaluation.", "For our third objective, we obtained data from ODNI on the timeliness of  periodic reinvestigations at specific executive branch agencies from fiscal  year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, by quarter. The number of agencies  included in our review was omitted because the information was  sensitive. We excluded the data reported by State to ODNI from our  analysis due to a July 2017 report by the State Office of Inspector  General, which identified a number of errors in the department\u2019s security  clearance timeliness data. As such, we report on the timeliness of the  remaining executive branch agencies for which ODNI provided data. To  assess the reliability of the data for the remaining executive branch  agencies, we reviewed relevant documentation and interviewed officials  about data quality control procedures. Based on these steps, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. For that reason, we did not independently test the accuracy of the  agencies\u2019 databases. We selected the fiscal year 2012 to 2016 timeframe  for our analysis because the executive branch has not publicly reported  on the timeliness of individual executive branch agencies since fiscal year  2011.

The investigative  service provider then conducts a background investigation and submits  an investigative report to the requesting agency. Adjudicators from the  requesting agency use the information from the investigative report to  determine whether to grant or deny the employee eligibility for a security  clearance by considering guidelines in 13 specific areas that address (1)  conduct that could raise security concerns and (2) factors that could allay  those security concerns and permit granting a clearance. Individuals  granted security clearances are investigated periodically\u2014for as long as  they remain in a position requiring access to classified information\u2014to  ensure their continued eligibility.

For example, while the Federal Investigative Standards have  allowed for periodic reinvestigations to be conducted at any time following  the completion of the previous investigation or reinvestigation, agencies  have not been required to conduct them more frequently than every 5  years, at most, depending on the clearance level and investigative  standards in effect.

Further, ODNI officials highlighted the complexities associated with  developing a whole-of-government continuous evaluation program and  noted that a number of challenges have come to light as they have been  developing the program, which have contributed to missed milestones.  However, ODNI has not prioritized the setting of internal milestones for  the future phases of implementation that it considers to be reasonable.

While some agencies, such as DOD and State\u2014 both of which have established continuous evaluation programs in  advance of implementation across the executive branch\u2014have  developed concepts of operations or standard operating procedures for  continuous evaluation, all seven agencies we spoke with stated that they  are waiting for additional information from ODNI before completing their  implementation plans. Department of Homeland Security officials stated  that they are waiting for ODNI to define and schedule the future phases of  implementation and to finish developing its continuous evaluation IT  system, because there could be unknown policy implications that would  affect the Department\u2019s planning efforts. In August 2017, ODNI officials  described plans to distribute information to executive branch agencies  regarding continuous evaluation requirements for fiscal year 2018.  Specific details of these plans were omitted from this report because the  information is sensitive.", "Second, six of the seven agencies we spoke with noted challenges  associated with estimating the costs of implementation. For example,  while the Federal Bureau of Investigation has developed some cost  estimates for implementing continuous evaluation, officials noted that it is  challenging to estimate the full costs of the program until they receive  additional information from ODNI, such as the requirements for future  phases of implementation, as well as information about record check,  technology, and personnel requirements. DOD officials stated that the  number of individuals enrolled in continuous evaluation directly relates to  the amount of agency resources required, for example, to validate,  respond to, and adjudicate alerts. Two agencies we spoke with stated  that they had not yet taken any steps to estimate costs because they are  waiting for additional information from ODNI. In August 2017, ODNI  officials stated that they plan to leverage an upcoming OMB budget data  request, administered through the PAC, to obtain agency funding  estimates for expenses related to conducting continuous evaluation from  fiscal years 2017 through 2019.", "We have previously identified weaknesses associated with estimating the  costs of personnel security clearance reform. Specifically, in April 2015  we found, among other things, that long-term costs of implementing the  2012 Federal Investigative Standards\u2014including the implementation of  continuous evaluation\u2014were not addressed in personnel security  clearance background investigation reform planning documentation.  Further, we found that OMB did not have current and detailed cost- estimate information from executive-branch agencies, because it did not  begin to solicit the information from the agencies until almost 2 years after  the updated standards were approved. As such, we recommended in  April 2015, among other things, that the Deputy Director for Management  of OMB, in the capacity as Chair of the PAC, develop long-term funding  estimates for changes to the federal government\u2019s investigation practices  resulting from the implementation of the standards, including but not  limited to costs related to: (1) information technology adjustments to  enable government-wide data sharing; (2) implementation of continuous  evaluation of clearance holders; and (3) additional personnel resources  for twice-as-frequent reinvestigations. OMB concurred with the  recommendation. However, as of October 2017, this recommendation  remained open. We continue to believe that this recommendation is  valid and should be implemented.", "In addition, the seven executive branch agencies we spoke with identified  other areas related to agency expectations for which they need  information from ODNI. For example, officials from the Department of  Justice; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; and  the Federal Bureau of Investigation stated that while they would like to  use ODNI\u2019s IT system to conduct all or at least some of the record checks  that will be required, they will need to develop an interface with ODNI\u2019s  system to do so. However, these officials stated that they were unaware  of ODNI\u2019s technical requirements for that interface. These officials further  stated that without information related to the technical requirements, they  are unable to sufficiently plan or budget for continuous evaluation. ODNI  officials stated that although ODNI\u2019s IT system remains under  development, information on technical interface requirements is available  to all stakeholders and that they meet with agencies to discuss agency- specific IT requirements. According to ODNI, several executive branch  agencies have expressed an interest in using ODNI\u2019s IT system to  conduct at least some, if not all, of the checks that will be required once  continuous evaluation is fully implemented. ODNI officials acknowledged  that agencies will need to develop an interface to use the system, and  that agencies will be responsible for the associated costs.", "The Project Management Institute\u2019s Guide to the Project Management  Body of Knowledge (PMBOK\u00ae Guide) provides guidelines for managing  individual projects, including developing a project management plan\u2014in  advance of executing the project\u2014that describes how the project will be  executed, monitored, and controlled. The plan should include, among  other things, project schedules and stakeholder roles and responsibilities.  The guide notes that updates may be made to the project management  plan as changes may occur as the project progresses.", "ODNI officials managing the continuous evaluation program stated that  they have not developed a project management plan for the  implementation of continuous evaluation, to include an implementation  schedule, because they are still in the planning stage. However, ODNI  has already started to implement the program. Without a plan that, among  other things, identifies reasonable milestones for the future phases of  implementation, ODNI does not have a schedule against which it can  track its progress or to which it is accountable. Further, without a plan for  implementing continuous evaluation executive branch-wide that includes  a schedule and agency requirements for future implementation phases,  full implementation\u2014which has been delayed for almost 7 years\u2014may be  further delayed.", "While a phased approach to implementation provides agencies time to  adapt their personnel security clearance programs to changing  requirements, without an implementation plan outlining ODNI\u2019s  expectations of agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities, agencies are unable  to sufficiently plan for the implementation of continuous evaluation,  including identifying required resources and estimating potential costs.  Further, without clearly defining expectations for agencies\u2014including  information such as the planned requirements for future phases of  implementation\u2014continuous evaluation may not be fully implemented  across the executive branch. Incomplete implementation could potentially  prevent the federal government from identifying security-relevant  information in a timely manner, thereby exposing it to further national  security risks, such as unauthorized disclosures of classified information.

ODNI  officials stated that, ideally, agencies will report that they have met the  fiscal year 2017 requirements for the first phase of implementation, and  that ODNI will follow up with agencies that do not report. The officials  added that, in the long term, ODNI would like to incorporate continuous  evaluation into its Security Executive Agent National Assessment  Program, through which it conducts oversight of the security clearance  process at executive branch agencies, but that continuous evaluation is  not currently included in the oversight program.

Further, ODNI cannot ensure that continuous evaluation is effectively  meeting its critical purpose of filling the information gap between  investigative cycles to identify risks to national security.", "Additionally, we reported in 2012 that federal agencies engaging in large  projects can use performance measures to determine how well they are  achieving their goals and to identify any areas for improvement.  Reporting on these measures can help key decision makers within  agencies, as well as stakeholders, to obtain feedback for improving both  policy and operational effectiveness. Moreover, performance measures  need to provide managers and other stakeholders with timely, action- oriented information in a format that helps them make decisions that  improve program performance. Throughout our body of work on leading  performance management practices we have identified several attributes  of successful performance measures, which include, among other things,  measures that are clear, quantifiable, and objective, and that are linked to  measurable goals.", "However, ODNI has not developed and distributed to executive branch  agencies performance measures to assess the effectiveness of  continuous evaluation once it is implemented executive branch-wide.

In addition, DOD officials stated that they believe  continuous evaluation will not only result in the more timely identification  of security-relevant information, but will also help to change individuals\u2019  behaviors\u2014for example, that individuals will be more likely to self-report  such information once they are enrolled in the program. DOD officials  also noted that if changes are not made to the periodic reinvestigation  process, the investigation backlog will persist, because continuous  evaluation alerts will continue to add to the investigative workload.", "In addition, in September 2016, PERSEREC issued a report on a study it  conducted on the effectiveness, timeliness, and cost of various  automated record checks-based investigative strategies as compared  with traditional periodic reinvestigations. The analysis found that some of  the automated record checks strategies were effective, improved the  timeliness of issue detection, and lowered costs. However, DOD officials  noted that because ODNI is the Security Executive Agent, it must  approve the change to the investigative process.

Similarly, officials from the  Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security stated  that they do not intend to replace periodic reinvestigations, and that  continuous evaluation is to be a supplement to the personnel security  clearance process. However, officials from all three of these agencies  stated that it may be possible to change the frequency or scope of  periodic reinvestigations at some point in the future. ODNI officials stated  that, at this time, they have no intention of replacing periodic  reinvestigations with continuous evaluation, and that the Security  Executive Agent Directive for continuous evaluation, once issued, will  clarify that continuous evaluation is intended to supplement and not  replace periodic reinvestigations.", "In May 2017, ODNI officials stated that ODNI is not opposed to further  improving the security clearance process, and that once continuous  evaluation is operational, it plans to determine the efficiencies and  mitigation of risks associated with the approach.

Specifically, all five agencies stated that continuous evaluation will  increase their workloads\u2014and therefore costs\u2014if no other changes are  made to the personnel security process. For example, DOD officials  noted that adjudicator workloads will increase as new investigative  leads\u2014identified through continuous evaluation\u2014require adjudication.  Senior DOD officials stated that DOD cannot afford to conduct both  continuous evaluation and periodic reinvestigations. Specifically, DOD  estimates that implementing the 2012 Federal Investigative Standards  requirement to conduct more frequent periodic reinvestigations for certain  clearance holders will cost approximately $1.8 billion for fiscal years 2018  through 2022. In addition, State officials stated that they anticipate that  continuous evaluation will increase their personnel security workload  because alerts will have to be validated, and potentially investigated, and  then adjudicated.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to  achieving defined objectives. Risk assessment is the identification and  analysis of risks related to achieving defined objectives to form a basis for  designing risk responses. In addition, the PMBOK\u00ae Guide states that  entities should perform a quantitative risk analysis to numerically analyze  the effect of identified risks on overall project objectives. The key benefit  of this process is that it produces quantitative risk information to support  decision-making in order to reduce project uncertainty.", "Although executive branch agencies have identified increased resources  as a risk associated with implementing continuous evaluation, and ODNI  has acknowledged that risk, ODNI, in coordination with the PAC, has not  assessed the potential effects of continuous evaluation on an agency\u2019s  resources. Further, ODNI has not developed a plan, in consultation with  implementing agencies, to address such effects, to include modifying the  scope or frequency of periodic reinvestigations or replacing periodic  reinvestigations for certain clearance holders. While ODNI is  implementing continuous evaluation in a phased approach, having a plan  in place to address the increased workload once continuous evaluation is  fully implemented is critical to ensuring the sustainability and  effectiveness of executive branch agencies\u2019 personnel security programs.  Further, without assessing the potential impacts on agency resources and  developing a plan to address them\u2014once ODNI has further defined the  program\u2014implementing continuous evaluation could further increase the  periodic reinvestigation backlog and agency costs.

However, ODNI has not demonstrated the leadership necessary to make  continuous evaluation a priority. Accordingly, the program\u2019s  implementation has been delayed for almost 7 years. Although ODNI has  taken an initial step to implement it in a phased approach, it has not yet  formalized the program in policy or provided an expanded definition of  continuous evaluation to implementing agencies. In addition, ODNI has  not yet determined key aspects of the program, including future phases of  implementation and agency requirements. Key executive branch  agencies have deemed information about the future phases necessary to  plan for the implementation of continuous evaluation and to estimate  potential costs. The absence of this information has limited their ability to  prepare for the next phases of implementation. This could further delay  the full implementation of continuous evaluation executive branch-wide  and result in inconsistencies among agencies\u2019 approaches. Specifically,  in the absence of ODNI policy and comprehensive guidance, DOD and  State continue to develop their current continuous evaluation programs.  The ultimate effects of such inconsistencies could negatively affect  reciprocity\u2014another key government-wide security clearance reform  effort.", "Although ODNI is to have oversight of continuous evaluation, it has not  incorporated it into its oversight program or developed a plan to ensure  that agencies implement it.

Further,  ODNI does not know whether it is meeting the critical purpose of filling the  information gap between investigative cycles to identify risks to national  security.", "Executive branch timeliness in completing periodic reinvestigations has  declined over the past five years. Further, the executive branch does not  know whether the timeliness goals\u2014set nearly a decade ago\u2014are still  relevant and appropriate, given changes to the personnel security  clearance process. Without conducting an evidence-based review to  ensure that goals for the timely completion of periodic reinvestigations are  appropriate, executive branch agencies may not be planning sufficient  time and resources to complete periodic reinvestigations and therefore  may be challenged to ensure the continued eligibility of the entire national  security workforce. Finally, executive branch agencies have identified  increased resources, such as workload and costs, as a challenge to  implementing continuous evaluation. However, the executive branch has  not determined the potential expected effects of continuous evaluation on  periodic reinvestigations, and agencies have varying views about what, if  any, additional changes should be made to the personnel security  clearance process. Without an assessment of the potential effects of  continuous evaluation and a plan to address those effects\u2014once ODNI  has further defined the program\u2014agencies may not be able to effectively  integrate continuous evaluation into their personnel security clearance  programs, which in turn could lead to further delays in the clearance  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following six recommendations to ODNI:", "The Director of National Intelligence should issue a Security Executive  Agent Directive for continuous evaluation to formalize the program,  which includes, among other things, an expanded definition of  continuous evaluation in advance of the next phase of  implementation. (Recommendation 1)", "The Director of National Intelligence should, in coordination with the  Continuous Evaluation Working Group, develop an implementation  plan for continuous evaluation across the executive branch that  includes a schedule with timeframes and expectations for agencies,  such as the requirements (e.g., the size of the enrolled population in  continuous evaluation) for future phases of implementation.  (Recommendation 2)", "The Director of National Intelligence should develop a plan for  monitoring continuous evaluation performance, to include assessing  continuous evaluation at various phases of implementation.  (Recommendation 3)", "The Director of National Intelligence should develop performance  measures for continuous evaluation that agencies must track and  determine a process and schedule for agencies to regularly report  those measures to ODNI. At minimum, these performance measures  should be clear, quantifiable, objective, and linked to measurable  goals. (Recommendation 4)", "The Director of National Intelligence should, in coordination with the  Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and  Budget in the capacity as Chair of the Security, Suitability, and  Credentialing Performance Accountability Council, conduct an  evidence-based review of the timeliness goal of 195 days for  completing the fastest 90 percent of periodic reinvestigations and the  associated goals for the different phases of periodic reinvestigations,  and adjust the goal if appropriate, taking into consideration available  resources, the additional workload of continuous evaluation, and the  risks associated with individuals retaining access to classified  information without determining their continued eligibility.  (Recommendation 5)", "The Director of National Intelligence should, once ODNI has further  defined the continuous evaluation program, to include issuing a  Security Executive Agent Directive and developing an implementation  plan, in coordination with the Deputy Director for Management of the  Office of Management and Budget in the capacity as Chair of the  Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability  Council, assess the potential effects of continuous evaluation on  agency resources and develop a plan, in consultation with  implementing agencies, to address those effects, such as modifying  the scope of periodic reinvestigations, changing the frequency of  periodic reinvestigations, or replacing periodic reinvestigations for  certain clearance holders.

Written comments from ODNI are reprinted in their  entirety in appendix I. DOD, OMB, NBIB, and the Department of  Homeland Security did not provide comments. ODNI, State, and the  Department of Justice provided technical comments, which we  incorporated in the report as appropriate.", "In its written comments, ODNI stated that it generally concurred, with  comments, with our six recommendations. However, ODNI stated that it  did not concur with aspects of our overall conclusions and provided  observations in four specific areas. We continue to believe that our  conclusions are valid, as discussed below.", "First, ODNI disagreed with our conclusion that it has not demonstrated  the leadership necessary to make continuous evaluation a priority. ODNI  noted that it has taken recent actions to better prioritize the  implementation of continuous evaluation. While these recent steps are  positive and may help position ODNI for success, historically ODNI has  not demonstrated the leadership necessary to make the implementation  of a continuous evaluation program a priority. Specifically, while ODNI  refers to continuous evaluation as a new initiative, the original milestone  for implementing the program was the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010,  which was not attained. Since then, as discussed in the report, a number  of revised milestones for implementing the program have been missed.  For example, the PAC, of which ODNI is a principal member,  subsequently set a milestone for developing an initial continuous  evaluation capability for other clearance holders by September 2014\u2014 which was extended to December 2014\u2014and a milestone for  implementing the capability for other clearance holders by December  2016. These milestones were also missed. As of August 2017,  continuous evaluation has not yet been fully implemented, and ODNI has  not set a milestone for when full implementation would occur. As such, we  recommended specific actions that are needed to better position ODNI for  success, including issuing a Security Executive Agent Directive for  continuous evaluation, developing plans for implementing the program  and monitoring its performance, and developing performance measures.", "Second, ODNI disagreed with our conclusion that it has not yet  determined key aspects of the continuous evaluation program, including  future phases of implementation and agency requirements. ODNI stated  that the Security Executive Agent Directive for continuous evaluation is  undergoing interagency coordination and that it has provided executive  branch agencies with interim guidance until that process is completed,  which we acknowledge in the report. While ODNI has provided interim  guidance for continuous evaluation, it only details the requirements for  fiscal year 2017 and not for the future phases of implementation. In  August 2017, after receiving a draft of our report, ODNI officials stated  that they planned to provide additional guidance to agencies clarifying  that the requirements for fiscal year 2018 will be the same as those for  fiscal year 2017. While this correspondence, once issued, will help  agencies with their immediate program planning, ODNI officials stated  that they have not yet determined the requirements for fiscal year 2019 or  beyond, which limits agencies\u2019 abilities to plan beyond the next fiscal year  for the future phases of implementation.", "Additionally, ODNI stated that the technical development milestones of  the Continuous Evaluation System it is developing are well-established,  tracked, and shared with stakeholders. As discussed in the report,  according to ODNI officials, they have established technical milestones  for the development of ODNI\u2019s Continuous Evaluation System. While this  is an important step in implementing the program, ODNI has not  developed similar programmatic milestones for the overall implementation  of the program, such as when future phases of implementation will occur,  to include full implementation. As discussed in the report, this has limited  the ability of executive branch agencies to plan for implementation in  accordance with ODNI\u2019s phased approach. As a result, full  implementation\u2014which has been delayed for almost 7 years\u2014may be  further delayed.", "Third, ODNI did not agree with our conclusion that although it is to have  oversight of continuous evaluation, it has not incorporated it into its  oversight program or developed a plan to ensure agencies implement it.  In its response, ODNI identified its intention to take certain actions and  future mechanisms that could position it to monitor continuous evaluation.  Specifically, ODNI stated that continuous evaluation metrics will be  collected and analyzed when the initial phase of continuous evaluation  implementation ends on September 30, 2017. Additionally, ODNI stated  that it will leverage a pending OMB budget data request and that its  Security Executive Agent National Assessments Program will be  responsible for analysis and oversight of agency implementation and  operation of continuous evaluation.", "However, as we note in the report, ODNI has not developed and  distributed plans to monitor or assess the performance of continuous  evaluation across the executive branch, including for the first phase of  implementation. As we note in our report, ODNI officials stated that ODNI  did not oversee the pilots that were conducted by DOD and State, as they  were performed at the discretion of those agencies. State officials noted  that while they have shared lessons learned on their continuous  evaluation pilot, they were not tasked to do so. While ODNI stated in its  written comments that it has specific expertise in researching, measuring,  analyzing, and monitoring personnel security performance across the  executive branch, it has not yet demonstrated these actions with regard to  continuous evaluation. For example, DOD\u2014the executive branch agency  with the majority of security clearance holders\u2014has conducted research  on continuous evaluation since 2001, piloted its program since October  2014, and plans to increase the number of personnel enrolled in the  program to 1 million by the end of calendar year 2017. However, ODNI, in  the capacity as the Security Executive Agent, has not overseen DOD\u2019s  pilot.", "Moreover, as discussed in the report, as of August 2017\u201410 months into  fiscal year 2017\u2014ODNI has not yet developed and distributed to  executive branch agencies continuous evaluation performance measures.  At the end of our review, in August 2017, ODNI officials stated that they  have developed a draft list of metrics for continuous evaluation for fiscal  year 2017 and that once the metrics are finalized, they will issue guidance  to executive branch agencies requesting them to report these metrics to  ODNI. While metrics can help to establish a baseline and inform aspects  of a program\u2019s status\u2014and ODNI\u2019s development of draft metrics is a  positive step\u2014performance measures are linked to a goal and inform how  well an agency is doing against that goal. As ODNI has not developed  and distributed performance measures that are clear, quantifiable, and  objective, and that are linked to measurable goals prior to initiating, or  earlier in the first phase of implementation, executive branch agencies  may not be positioned to collect and report these metrics at the end of the  fiscal year. Additionally, as discussed in the report, according to ODNI  officials, while they would like to incorporate continuous evaluation into  their Security Executive Agent National Assessments Program, it is not  currently part of the program. While ODNI has identified steps that could  position it to monitor continuous evaluation in the future, it has not yet  implemented mechanisms to monitor and measure program performance.", "Fourth, ODNI did not agree with our conclusions that it is not well- positioned to ensure the success and effectiveness of the continuous  evaluation initiative, and that it does not know if it is meeting the critical  purpose of filling the information gap between investigative cycles to  identify risks to national security. However, in its written comments, ODNI  stated that successful implementation of continuous evaluation across the  executive branch requires formal Security Executive Agent policy  guidance, implementation and technical guidance and milestones,  performance measures, and a monitoring program, which we  recommended in the report. ODNI states that it is well-postured to  achieve these goals, and refers to its intention to apply Security Executive  Agent National Assessments Program best practices as a mechanism to  use to monitor and ensure compliance. Although this action could be a  step in better positioning ODNI as continuous evaluation implementation  further proceeds, as noted above and in our report, ODNI has not yet  finalized, distributed, and implemented these and other actions to ensure  that it is currently positioned to ensure success, even while it has initiated  the first phase of continuous evaluation implementation.", "As noted in our report, although ODNI has taken steps to implement  continuous evaluation in a phased approach, executive branch efforts to  implement continuous evaluation have been a long-standing component  of overall security clearance reform. The actions ODNI intends to take as  it further implements continuous evaluation, as well as the mechanisms it  identified, may better position it and the implementing agencies for  success. However, given the challenges that the executive branch has  faced in implementing continuous evaluation thus far and the continued  delays it has faced, without a fully defined program in place, we believe  that our conclusions remain valid.", "Finally, in its written comments, ODNI suggested a revision to our sixth  recommendation. Specifically, ODNI suggested adding an explicit  timeframe for completing the action. We believe that ODNI is best  positioned to set an appropriate timeframe for completion based on its  familiarity with the progress of the program and, as such, did not  incorporate this change in our report. We agree with ODNI that  establishing such a timeframe is a positive step.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of  Defense, the Director of OMB, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of  Homeland Security, the Director of OPM, the Director of NBIB, the  Attorney General, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Intelligence, and  the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.
