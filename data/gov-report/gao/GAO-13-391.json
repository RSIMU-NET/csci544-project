Specifically, anticipating exhaustion of funds, CCIIO stopped ERRP enrollment in May 2011. According to CCIIO officials, CCIIO suspended making reimbursements to plan sponsors in September 2012, as reimbursements had reached the $4.7 billion cap established for paying claims under the original appropriation, and the remainder was reserved for administrative expenses. When the cap was reached, significant demand for the program remained with 5,699 ERRP reimbursement requests left outstanding that accounted for about $2.5 billion in unpaid claims. CCIIO officials told GAO that they planned to pay some of the outstanding reimbursement requests by redistributing any overpayments recovered from plan sponsors--when, for example a plan receives a rebate that lowers the total cost of a prior claim--as well as money recovered from program audits. As of January 2013, officials told GAO that CCIIO had recovered a total of $54 million and redistributed $20.7 million of this amount.", "Enrollment and spending for the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) program have grown substantially. Cumulative PCIP enrollment had reached 103,160 by the end of December 2012, more than doubling from a year earlier. By the end of January 2013, total PCIP spending reached about $2.6 billion, representing over half of the $5 billion PCIP appropriation compared to a year earlier when only about 16 percent of the total appropriation had been spent. PCIP spending has varied on a monthly basis, but overall, monthly spending also has increased over the life of the program. Most recently, monthly spending reached its highest point since the program's inception, increasing about 35 percent from December 2012 to January 2013.", "According to CMS, PCIP spending is likely to approach the $5 billion appropriation by the end of 2013, and CCIIO is taking steps intended to ensure it does not exceed this amount. In June 2012, Office of the Actuary (OACT) within the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released a projection that the entire $5 billion in PCIP funding would be used \"through 2013.\" Similarly, CCIIO officials told GAO they anticipate total PCIP spending to closely approach $5 billion, and that they are taking program management steps--many of which are not yet reflected in spending data--to ensure appropriated funding lasts through 2013. For example, in the second half of 2012, CCIIO was able to obtain lower provider reimbursement rates for the PCIP program. Also, in January 2013, CCIIO instituted benefit changes that shifted more costs onto PCIP enrollees, including by increasing enrollee coinsurance from 20 percent to 30 percent in many states. Due to growing concerns about the rate of PCIP spending, in February 2013, CCIIO suspended PCIP enrollment to ensure the appropriated funding would be sufficient to cover claims for current enrollees through the end of the program. Officials told GAO that if spending trends begin to indicate that funding will not be used as quickly as they are projecting, they could reinstate PCIP enrollment to use remaining funds."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)  appropriated $5 billion each to establish and carry out two temporary  programs, the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program (ERRP) and the   Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) program.

Eligibility for  participation is determined by a plan sponsor meeting a number of  requirements, including being able to document claims, implement  programs and procedures that have the potential to generate cost savings  for plan participants with chronic and high-cost conditions, and having  policies and procedures in place to detect and reduce fraud, waste, and  abuse. When requesting reimbursement, sponsors must provide  documentation of the cost of medical claims, which can include costs  paid by early retirees in the form of deductibles, copayments, or  coinsurance. For eligible claims paid by a plan on behalf of each early  retiree, CCIIO will reimburse 80 percent of the amount that exceeded  $15,000 (the cost threshold) but was not greater than $90,000 (the cost  limit) in a given year. ERRP reimbursement requests are paid in the  order in which they are received, and CCIIO may stop taking ERRP  applications or, if an application is approved, deny all or part of a  reimbursement request, based on the availability of funding.", "Plan sponsors are not required to use ERRP reimbursements by the end  of the plan year in which they are provided, but are expected to use  reimbursements as soon as possible and no later than December 31,  2014.  Under PPACA, plan sponsors can use the reimbursements to  reduce their own premium contributions or other health benefit costs;  reduce plan participants\u2019 premium contributions, copayments,  deductibles, coinsurance, or other out-of-pocket costs; or reduce any  combination of these costs. However, sponsors are not permitted to use  the funds received as general revenue, and thus must maintain the same  level of contribution toward the plan as they did prior to applying to enroll  in ERRP. CCIIO may conduct audits of plan sponsors to verify their  compliance with this and other program requirements.", "To be eligible for PCIP, individuals must have a preexisting condition and  have been without creditable coverage for at least 6 months prior to  application. This requirement effectively prevents enrollment by those  who were already insured, thus limiting the program to individuals who  likely have been unable to access insurance because of their preexisting  condition. PCIP programs must not impose waiting periods for coverage  based on the enrollee\u2019s preexisting condition, and plan benefits must  cover at least 65 percent of the total cost of coverage until enrollees hit a  statutory out-of-pocket spending limit, at which point PCIP covers   100 percent of the cost. PPACA requires that HHS develop procedures to  transition PCIP enrollees from the program to the Exchanges when they  begin in 2014 and that such procedures ensure these enrollees do not  experience a lapse in coverage. At the same time, if HHS estimates  that, for any fiscal year, PCIP funding will be insufficient to cover the  payment of claims, PPACA authorizes it to make such adjustments as are  necessary to eliminate this deficit and to stop PCIP enrollment.", "The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program is a joint state and federal program for  uninsured children in families whose incomes are too high for Medicaid, but too low to  afford private coverage.", "Initial PCIP allocations ranged from $8 million for North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming to  $761 million for California.

Twenty-seven states elected to operate  a PCIP for their residents, while 23 states and the District of Columbia  opted to allow HHS to operate their PCIPs. For the 27 states that chose  to operate their own PCIPs, HHS directly contracted with states or their  designated nonprofit entities. The contracts established that HHS would  reimburse states or their designated entities for claims and administrative  costs incurred in excess of the premiums they collected. To implement  the federally run PCIP for the 24 states that opted not to operate their  own PCIP, HHS coordinated with other federal agencies and selected the  Government Employees Health Association, Inc. (GEHA) to help operate  the program. GEHA was awarded a cost-plus-award fee contract, which  established that HHS would reimburse GEHA for claims and  administrative costs in addition to granting fixed and performance-based  award fees.

In anticipation of exceeding the cap, CCIIO had issued  guidance on December 13, 2011, stating that it would not accept  reimbursement requests for ERRP claims incurred after December 31,  2011. However, the program continued to accept requests for claims  incurred on or before this date and officials explained that a number of  factors led to it taking until September 2012 for all $4.7 billion to be spent,  including that reimbursements must go through a clearance process to  make sure funds are paid appropriately.

Overpayments are  identified through the claims adjudication process and can happen when,  for example, a plan receives a rebate from a provider that lowers the total  cost of a claim after the claim was initially submitted to ERRP. In addition,  because early reimbursement requests were based on summary claims  data, CCIIO required plan sponsors to submit a more detailed accounting  of the actual costs of these requests by April 27, 2012. Officials told us  that if an overpayment was identified for a reimbursement request, or if  sponsors failed to meet the April deadline, costs associated with that  request were to be recovered by CCIIO. As of January 2013, CCIIO had  identified $60.2 million in overpayments and recovered $54 million of this  amount. CCIIO was pursuing collection of the remaining $6.2 million and  estimated that as much as an additional $15 million in overpayments may  be identified and collected in fiscal year 2013.", "In addition to recovering overpayments, officials told us that any money  recovered from program audits would also be used to pay outstanding  reimbursement requests. CCIIO hired a contractor with a goal of  conducting audits of 30 ERRP plan sponsors that officials said account  for 30 percent of program reimbursements.

For example, on behalf of the federally run PCIP, GEHA contracted  in August 2012 with United Healthcare to access lower provider  reimbursement rates than those the federally run program had previously.  While the extent of this rate reduction varies by state, officials said that  there has been about a 20 percent reduction on average. To further  reduce rates, GEHA also worked with United Healthcare to approach  approximately the top 100 hospitals in terms of PCIP utilization to attempt  to renegotiate federally run PCIP hospital facility fees to the same rate as  Medicare. According to officials, about one quarter of the hospitals  approached agreed to the renegotiation. Officials told us that some states  have similarly approached hospitals to lower reimbursement rates,  negotiated other discounts with providers, or implemented other cost  control strategies, such as disease management programs.", "More recently, CCIIO instituted benefit changes for the federally run PCIP  that shifted more costs onto enrollees starting in January 2013. For  example, it increased enrollees\u2019 out of pocket maximum for in-network  services from $4,000 to $6,250 and for out-of-network services from  $7,000 to $10,000. It also increased enrollee coinsurance from   20 percent to 30 percent.

Finally, due to growing  concerns about the rate of PCIP spending, in February 2013, CCIIO  suspended PCIP enrollment to ensure the appropriated funding would be  sufficient to cover claims for current enrollees through the end of the  program. In addition, CCIIO requested that state-run PCIPs institute the  same benefit changes that were instituted in the federally run program in  January 2013 by April 1, 2013, or the earliest possible date thereafter for  all of their enrollees.
