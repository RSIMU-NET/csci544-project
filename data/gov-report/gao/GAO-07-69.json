Commerce's and State's export control requirements and processes provide physical checkpoints on the means and methods companies use to export controlled goods to help the agencies ensure such exports are made under their license terms, but the agencies cannot easily apply these same requirements and processes to exports of controlled information. For example, companies are generally required to report their shipments of export controlled goods overseas with Customs and Border Protection for exports made under a license, but such reporting is not applicable to the export of controlled information. Commerce and State expect individual companies to be responsible for implementing practices to protect export-controlled information. One third of the companies GAO interviewed did not have internal control plans to protect export-controlled information, which set requirements for access to such material by foreign employees and visitors. Commerce and State have not fully assessed the risks of companies using a variety of means to protect export-controlled information. The agencies have not used existing resources, such as license data, to help identify the minimal protections for such exports. As companies use a variety of measures for protecting export-controlled information, increased knowledge of the risks associated with protecting such information could improve agency outreach and training efforts, which now offer limited assistance to companies to mitigate those risks. GAO's internal control standards highlight the identification and management of risk as a key element of an organization's management control program. GAO also found that Commerce's and State's communications with companies do not focus on export-controlled information.

Commerce\u2019s Export Administration Regulations (EAR) establish the  Commerce Control List, which generally contains detailed controls for  dual-use items. BIS has two branches: Export Administration and Export  Enforcement. Export Administration is responsible for processing export  license applications, outreach, and counseling efforts to help ensure  exporters\u2019 compliance with the EAR as well as monitoring certain license  conditions to determine exporters\u2019 compliance with their conditions.

Both agencies\u2019 programs require companies to  apply for export licenses under their respective regulations and to keep  records on such exports for possible agency monitoring and inspection.  However, certain export documentation, agency reporting requirements,  and agency monitoring processes for exports of controlled goods are not  easy or practical to apply to the oversight of exports of information, which  limits the agencies\u2019 ability to monitor exports of licensed controlled  information.", "Means of Transportation or Transfer Reported on Export  Documentation: When shipping a controlled good overseas, a company  is generally required to file a Census Bureau Shippers\u2019 Export  Declaration (SED) form with CBP, within the Department of Homeland  Security.Companies generally are required to file the SED form for  every export made under a specific license, which requires companies  to specify the method of transportation for the exported goods, such as  vessel or air. However, exports of controlled information transmitted  electronically or in an otherwise intangible form are specifically  exempted from SED filing. Commerce and State export license  applications require exporting companies to report the name of the  freight forwarder or other agents to be used for the shipment of goods,  which provides the agencies with some oversight on how companies  intend to conduct such exports. However, agency export license  applications do not require companies to report information on the  means of transmission they intend to use to transfer export-controlled  information. In the absence of information on the means of  transmission used to export-controlled information, Commerce and  State lack information that could help provide some level of oversight  as they do for physical shipment of goods.", "Agency Reporting Requirements: Certain agency reporting  requirements for goods do not apply to export-controlled information.  Companies are generally required to present the SED form before any  export. As previously described, the SED Form is not required for  electronically transmitted export-controlled information. Further,  companies are not otherwise required to notify Commerce when  exports of licensed controlled information take place. While in certain  circumstances State requires companies to notify it when they transmit  licensed export-controlled information, this requirement only applies to  the first instance of transfer. Beyond these notifications, Commerce  and State cannot be sure that all exports of controlled information  under the license are made to the designated end-user and are within  the terms of the license approval.", "Agency Monitoring: Commerce and State monitor exports to help  ensure company compliance with license requirements and to assess  industry areas where export licenses may be required. However, the  two agencies\u2019 efforts focus on export-controlled goods, and not  information, due in part to the nature of transfers of export-controlled  information, which makes elements of agency monitoring processes  inapplicable. For goods, the SED can be used to aid the government in  tracking exported goods and determining whether or not they reach the  specified end-user. The SED also provides a feedback mechanism,  which the lead export-control agencies may use to measure the  effectiveness of their activities and processes. A similar feedback  mechanism does not exist for export-controlled information  transmitted electronically and by other intangible methods. Since the  agencies cannot completely monitor these exports, their reliance on  companies to implement control mechanisms becomes increasingly  important for protecting export-controlled information.", "For example, Commerce and State do not systematically monitor  whether companies abide by the conditions of their \u201cdeemed\u201d export  licenses, which permit the transfer of export-controlled information to  specific foreign nationals. Consequently, agencies have no way of  knowing if all licensed export-controlled information was exported  according to the terms of the license\u2014for example, if it was sent within  the permitted time period, if the information exported was appropriate,  and if the export reached its intended end-user. In 2002, we  recommended that Commerce\u2014in consultation with the Secretaries of  Defense, State, and Energy\u2014establish a risk-based program to monitor  compliance with deemed export license conditions. Commerce  officials told us they recently completed a limited pilot program to  monitor company compliance with deemed exports and did not find  any compliance issues in the sample of deemed export licenses they  reviewed. However, Commerce officials told us that this pilot did not  address the issue of export-controlled information transferred by  electronic means, such as e-mail, and that they have not decided  whether they will perform similar monitoring efforts on an annual  basis.", "Table 1 provides an overview of the key agency checkpoints generally  related to export-controlled goods and information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Use a Variety of Practices to Protect Export-Controlled Information", "paragraphs": ["Under the U.S. export control system, companies are responsible for  implementing procedures to protect export-controlled information  regardless of how it is exported. We found a range of company practices  for protecting export-controlled information from our discussions with  officials from 46 companies, including the use of internal control plans,  limiting employee access, and computer security technologies. Almost two  thirds of the company officials we interviewed told us their companies use  internal control plans, which establish procedures to protect proprietary  and export-controlled information and also set requirements for access to  such material by foreign employees and visitors. However, other  companies we interviewed exported controlled information or employed  foreign nationals, but had not yet developed internal control plans for such  transactions. While Commerce and State generally do not require  companies that export controlled information to use such plans, an  industry report on export control best practices includes internal control  plans as a best practice to safeguard export-controlled products and  technologies against improper access by foreign nationals\u2014employees,  customers, and visitors. For example, companies can use such internal  control plans to provide specific procedures and processes addressing  physical and computer access to export-controlled information; such as  employee badging, record-keeping procedures for all relevant export- related documents; the use of internal audits on export transactions; and  the use of electronic surveillance, such as hidden cameras, where  appropriate, for physical security. Almost half of the company officials we  interviewed told us they encounter uncertainties when determining what  measures should be included within their internal control plans to help  ensure the proper protection of export-controlled information. Officials  from larger companies who expressed such concerns added that these  uncertainties may be magnified in smaller companies due to their  inexperience with export regulations, a point confirmed by officials from  five small companies we interviewed.", "In addition to the companies\u2019 stated use of internal control plans, we  found companies also had practices related to employee access and  foreign national access to export-controlled information. Examples  include the following:    Two thirds of the companies indicated that all employees\u2014including  foreign nationals\u2014wear identification badges that contain information  such as a picture, a color-code indicating the employee\u2019s security  clearance, and encoded data that allows access to only those areas  authorized for the employee.", "About three fifths of the companies we interviewed indicated that they  protect export-controlled information by storing it within restricted  components of the company\u2019s computer server, and requiring  employees to gain permission through a network administrator before  obtaining access to such information.", "Some companies also use information security protections for their  electronic transfers of export-controlled information. More than two fifths  of the companies we interviewed use encryption; an information  technology process used to obscure data files, making them inaccessible  without the appropriate code to decipher the meaning. Neither  Commerce\u2019s nor State\u2019s regulations require companies to use encryption  when transferring export-controlled information. According to the  International Standards Organization, a nongovernmental organization  that provides technical standards to the public and private sectors,  organizations should consider using some form of encryption when  transferring sensitive information. Commerce and State export control  officials told us they do not specifically recommend that companies use  encryption for various reasons, such as agencies\u2019 inability to keep current  on rapid developments in this field and possible liability issues  surrounding their recommendation of a particular encryption product for  e-mail security.", "Our review of selected companies\u2019 export control internal control  practices highlights how uneven company practices can contribute to  vulnerabilities associated with the protection of export-controlled  information. For example, officials from three of the companies we  interviewed told us that they exported controlled information\u2014through  electronic transmissions or interpersonal interactions with foreign  nationals\u2014but that they did not have technology control plans that  provided company-wide policies and procedures to limit their foreign  national employees\u2019 access to export-controlled information. However, in  situations when companies manufacture or research sensitive  technologies that are export-controlled, they are required to register with  the government, even if they are not planning to export. In situations  including these, the extent of company internal control practices could  affect its vulnerability. For example, a nanotechnology company official  intending to export technology in the immediate future told us a former  Chinese foreign national employee had full electronic access to the same  sensitive company information as its U.S. employees. The official also told  us this foreign employee was not physically segregated from any portions  of the company facilities or lab where more sensitive technology functions  were performed. Under these circumstances, we believe that the company  official could not have determined whether the employee improperly  accessed company information that potentially could be export-controlled."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Government Lacks Sufficient Knowledge of the Risks Associated with the Protection of Export- Controlled Information to Identify the Minimal Safeguards", "paragraphs": ["The lead government agencies have not fully assessed the risks of  protecting export-controlled information to help identify the minimal level  of protection for such exports.

However, neither Commerce nor State has implemented systematic risk- assessment practices for its oversight of export-controlled information.  Applying systematic risk-based strategies to export-controlled information  could enable Commerce and State officials to focus their resources on  information exports that may pose a higher risk to national security. As  shown in figure 2, risk management aims to integrate systematic concern  for risk into the usual cycle of agency decision-making and  implementation.", "Threat, vulnerability, and criticality are frequently used aspects of risk  assessment. Our internal control standards state that once risks have  been identified, they should be analyzed for their possible effects. Our  standards also state that because economic and industry conditions  continually change, entities should provide mechanisms to identify and  deal with any special risks prompted by such changes. Risk analysis  generally includes estimating the risk\u2019s significance, assessing the  likelihood of its occurrence, and deciding how to manage the risk and  what actions should be taken. The threats to the protection and transfer of  export-controlled information include the inadvertent exposure of such  information to unauthorized foreign parties as well as foreign economic  espionage. For example, several of the larger defense and commercial  companies we interviewed told us their computer networks are routinely  subject to hacking attempts by individuals attempting to steal or corrupt  information, which officials said can number in the hundreds daily.  Currently, Commerce and State rely on companies to identify and protect  export-controlled information whether it is transferred orally,  electronically, or visually\u2014or through traditional physical shipment  methods used for goods, such as a courier transporting a compact disk  containing export-controlled information to a customer. The vulnerability  of export-controlled information may be increased by companies not using  computer or physical security mechanisms that help protect against  physical and electronic diversions during its transmission. The  consequences of such risks to export-controlled information may include  the loss of sensitive information to foreign entities with interests contrary  to our own as well as significant and costly civil and criminal penalties for  violations of the export control regulations.", "At present, both agencies\u2019 approaches to conducting company compliance  visits generally target specific industries and industry practices, but are  not based on thorough knowledge of possible weaknesses and  vulnerabilities in company protection of export-controlled information.  Commerce officials told us the agency primarily conducts company visits  based on company size and technology produced. Commerce officials also  told us they also target companies and industry associations based on a  variety of other factors, including their analysis of license data and  publicized company export control developments, such as announcements  in local business newsletters reviewed by Commerce export officials.  Through its company visit plan, State performs its company compliance  visits based on general knowledge of topic areas its staff believe may be  vulnerable to compliance problems and discrete compliance issues, such  as companies that employ foreign nationals. However, Commerce and  State do not use available licensing data to strategically target both  established and emerging business sectors to aid in their monitoring and  oversight of exports of controlled information. For example, agency  license databases and company records provide a pool of information,  which Commerce and State could analyze to help them discern trends in  export-controlled information, such as identifying which companies are  involved in cutting-edge commercial and military technology  developments. Increased agency knowledge in these technology fields that  transmit export-controlled information and are known to be subject to  foreign espionage would help increase agency oversight and may reduce  such vulnerabilities.", "State and Commerce told us they perform company outreach and training  visits as part of their oversight of company export control activities, but  neither agency considers export-controlled information in determining  which companies they should visit. For example, State officials told us  they conduct these visits when requested by companies. Consequently,  companies without knowledge of the export regulations would not know  to request this additional assistance. Commerce officials told us the  agency conducts over 100 company training seminars nationwide annually  on topics ranging from an exporting primer, product classifications, and  deemed exports for both novice and experienced exporters. These  seminars are held in conjunction with local business cosponsors, and  Commerce develops specific training topics to reflect the interests of local  industry. Commerce officials told us they conduct a limited number of  visits to specific companies as part of their company outreach, which are  usually prompted by information and intelligence obtained through their  compliance efforts. Such training and outreach is particularly important  because we found during our company interviews that newly-formed  smaller businesses working in advanced technology areas were not as  aware of the extent of their responsibilities to protect export-controlled  information, and their company officials suggested that their protection  measures did not follow best practices to safeguard such information as  used by experienced exporters.

However, these Web sites do not  communicate information such as industry best practices or identify  specific protection measures for companies to use to securely transfer  export-controlled information electronically. For example, we found  while Commerce\u2019s Web site provides information to businesses on the  Export Administration Regulations, such as frequently asked questions  and guidance for deemed exports, it does not provide information on  measures companies could use to protect the transmission of export- controlled information, such as encrypting e-mails used to transmit  export-controlled information to a company\u2019s foreign subsidiary.

State\u2019s Web site does not provide users with  answers to frequently asked questions, such as common questions  companies have on the export process. The State Web site also does  not link to the Commerce Web site or provide information on best  practices companies use to comply with the regulations. By providing  this type of information on its Web site, State could help enhance its  communication to companies and alleviate company confusion  surrounding the protection of export-controlled information.", "Advisory Opinions: As part of their export control activities,  Commerce and State provide nonbinding advice to companies, called  advisory opinions, on specific questions they submit to the agencies  regarding the export regulations. Officials from about two fifths of the  companies we interviewed told us they submitted questions to the  agencies regarding export-controlled information. However, under the  Commerce and State advisory opinion programs, the agencies do not  publicly share all agency responses to these requests for guidance and  information due to concerns about inadvertently releasing a company\u2019s  proprietary information to the public as well as agency officials\u2019  judgment that such opinions do not have broad utility to the export  community. From our review of Commerce\u2019s and State\u2019s export control  activities, we found while Commerce provides a few public examples  of advisory opinions on its Web site that address deemed exports and  the employment of foreign nationals, none specifically address the  electronic transfer of export-controlled information. State officials told  us State does not provide any advisory opinions to the public. By  publicizing their advisory opinions, Commerce and State could possibly  leverage their limited outreach resources and help a greater number of  companies attain clarifying information on agency policies on export- controlled information.", "Other federal agencies, such as the Department of Labor (DOL), share  advisory opinions with the public on their Web sites but redact  company proprietary information to protect identifying information.  This allows other companies with similar questions to benefit from the  additional agency guidance. One company export control official we  interviewed suggested companies could submit two letters  simultaneously to either Commerce or State to request advisory  opinions on export control issues. In the first letter the company would  include all necessary information to distinguish the export, so the  agency could make an appropriate decision on the specific export  control matter. In the second letter the company would redact all  proprietary and company identifying information, which the agency  would be allowed to publicize to other companies. DOL uses this  approach to alleviate itself of the burden from identifying and redacting  proprietary information from advisory opinions it shares publicly.", "Agency Training on Export-Controlled Information: While Commerce  and State provide export-control training to companies, we found the  agencies do not strategically target companies and industry sectors  where the greatest risk of violations of the export regulations on  export-controlled information may exist. While Commerce and State  have significantly different approaches towards company training,  neither offers specific training opportunities focusing exclusively on  export-controlled information. Furthermore, officials from  approximately 20 percent of the companies we interviewed told us  agency training on export controls does not provide specific guidance  to companies on the adequate protection of export-controlled  information. For example, these officials said agency training does not  provide information protection options to companies, such as using  dedicated communication lines for e-mail transmissions or limiting  employee access to servers that contain export-controlled information.  Company officials told us government-sponsored training does not  target smaller companies new to the exporting process, which may not  be familiar with necessary measures to securely transfer export- controlled information. Furthermore, we found agency training, in  particular State\u2019s training, is limited to specific geographic regions of  the U.S., which company officials stated hinders smaller companies  with limited budgets from attending. Although State and Commerce  have separate export control jurisdictions, the 2004 Interagency Offices  of Inspector General report stated that Commerce and State could  improve their outreach by providing joint training that explains the  differences between the two agencies\u2019 licensing requirements and  procedures\u2014a recommendation that, according to the report, was  shared by company officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The globalization of the U.S. economy and economic interdependence  with the rest of the world has many dimensions. While the export of  controlled information from U.S. companies to foreign business partners is  a key component to maintaining a strong and developing economy, the  improper export of such technology can be detrimental to U.S. security  and economic interests. Developing effective oversight to help ensure the  protection of export-controlled information poses a challenge to the  federal agencies responsible for export control. These risks may increase  as electronic communications and information-transfer capabilities used  by companies that export-controlled information continue to grow.  Moreover, the lack of coordination between Commerce and State on  outreach, analysis, and oversight could hamper their ability to determine  whether export-controlled information may be at risk when foreign  nationals are in U.S. company settings. Without leveraging and properly  utilizing available export license data, these agencies will not be able to  fully understand and assess potential risks associated with the export of  controlled information and develop the proper protections and outreach to  help mitigate the risks associated with such information. Further, in the  absence of guidance from the government, some U.S. companies may not  fully understand these associated risks and the need for applying  corresponding measures of protection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve the Department of Commerce\u2019s oversight of export-controlled  information at companies, we recommend that the Secretary of Commerce  direct the Administrator of the Bureau of Industry and Security to take the  following actions:    Strategically assess potential vulnerabilities in the protection of export- controlled information using available resources, such as licensing  data, and evaluate company practices for protecting such information.", "Based on such a strategic assessment, improve its interagency  coordination with the Department of State in the following areas (1)  provide specific guidance, outreach, and training on how to protect  export-controlled information and (2) better target compliance  activities on company protection of export-controlled information.", "To improve the Department of State\u2019s oversight of export-controlled  information at companies, we recommend that the Secretary of State  direct the Director of the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls to take  the following actions:    Strategically assess potential vulnerabilities in the protection of export- controlled information using available resources, such as licensing  data, and evaluate company practices for protecting such information.", "Based on such a strategic assessment, improve its interagency  coordination with the Department of Commerce in the following areas  (1) provide specific guidance, outreach, and training on how to protect  export-controlled information and (2) better target compliance  activities on company protection of export-controlled information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the departments of Commerce,  Defense, and State for their review and comment. Commerce and State  provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendixes II and III,  respectively. Defense did not have any comments on our draft report.", "Commerce generally agreed with our recommendations to assess potential  vulnerabilities related to export-controlled information and to conduct  more targeted outreach and compliance activities. Commerce, in its  response, described planned and recent activities related to its oversight  and outreach efforts on deemed exports, such as the Deemed Export  Advisory Committee and increased export outreach and compliance  activities. While these activities address some unique cases where  companies are required to have a Technology Control Plan (TCP) in place  when employing foreign nationals, they do not fully address how to  protect export-controlled information when transferred electronically and  by other intangible means. As noted in our report, almost half of the  company officials we interviewed told us they have difficulty determining  the proper measures to protect export-controlled information. Commerce  also cited a September 2006 American Society for Industrial Security trade  association meeting where it addressed the protection of export- controlled information. Actions such as this, if conducted on a regular  basis, could improve companies\u2019 understanding of how to protect export- controlled information in today\u2019s commonplace business transactions,  such as e-mail, e-commerce exchanges, and intracompany transfers.", "State agreed with our recommendation to improve guidance for exports of  controlled information and disagreed with our report\u2019s finding that it does  not assess the potential vulnerabilities associated with export-controlled  information. State responded that it recently tasked its Defense Trade  Advisory Group to develop a best practice guide for industry on how to  comply with the regulations. Such guidance, particularly if it addresses  export-controlled information and is shared on State\u2019s Web site, can help  to improve companies\u2019 understanding of accepted practices for protecting  such information. Regarding its assessment of potential vulnerabilities  associated with export-controlled information, State responded that its  individual licensing and compliance activities strategically target its  concerns related to exports of controlled technical data. State added that  its assessments of the vulnerabilities and risks associated with export- controlled information form the basis for topics addressed at training  events and industry conferences, as well as many regulatory changes.  While State\u2019s activities may help inform its individual licensing decisions  and identification of specific companies for possible compliance visits, we  found that State is not proactively using available information to  strategically assess the vulnerabilities associated with the transfer of  export-controlled information. For example, we found State does not use  available data from its licensing activities to strategically target  established and emerging business sectors to aid in its monitoring and  oversight of exports of controlled information. These license data and  company records provide a pool of information, which State could analyze  to help discern trends in export-controlled information. Furthermore,  State told us its outreach visits do not consider export-controlled  information in determining companies to visit and we found that State\u2019s  training does not provide specific guidance on export-controlled  information. Broader assessments of the risks and vulnerabilities  associated with export-controlled information will help the department  identify ways to improve its oversight of these exports and its guidance to  companies.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees and to the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Defense,  the Secretary of State.

We also reviewed export- control policies and practices within the Department of Defense, including  proposed changes to the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement (DFARS) to identify requirements related to export controls  and foreign national access to sensitive information. We interviewed  officials from DTSA to gain more information regarding the agency\u2019s  activities as they relate to the export control practices and policies of  Commerce and State. We interviewed agency officials from the Commerce  Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) who perform export  control related functions, such as enforcement and administration. Within  the State Department\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (DDTC), we  interviewed officials from the areas of licensing, compliance, and policy to  obtain information on agency efforts to protect export-controlled  information.
