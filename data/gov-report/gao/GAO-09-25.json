Private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans--one type of MA plan--give beneficiaries an option that is more like Medicare FFS than other MA plans, with a wider choice of providers and less plan management of services and providers. PFFS enrollment increased from about 35,000 beneficiaries in June 2004 to about 2.3 million in June 2008. This report compares PFFS plans to other MA plans and Medicare FFS in three areas: (1) characteristics of beneficiaries, (2) financial risks for beneficiaries who do not contact their plans before receiving services, and (3) disenrollment rates. To do this work, GAO reviewed materials from a selected sample of nine PFFS plan sponsors, analyzed Medicare data, and interviewed officials from CMS, which administers the Medicare program, and other organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In April 2007, beneficiaries in PFFS plans tended to be healthier and generally younger than beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS. Specifically, projected health care expenditures for PFFS beneficiaries were 7 percent less than the projected average for beneficiaries in other MA plans and 10 percent less than the projected average for beneficiaries in Medicare FFS. Beneficiaries in PFFS plans also generally were more likely than beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS to reside in rural areas where fewer other MA plans were available. In addition, about 81 percent of beneficiaries who were new enrollees in PFFS plans were in Medicare FFS before enrolling in their plan, compared to 65 percent in other MA plans. PFFS beneficiaries may have faced certain financial risks if they did not contact their plan before receiving services. These risks were generally not assumed by beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS. Specifically, if beneficiaries or their providers did not contact their PFFS plans before obtaining a service to make sure it would be covered, beneficiaries unexpectedly may have had to pay for the entire cost of the service if coverage was later denied by their plan. CMS officials told GAO they did not have data on the extent to which PFFS beneficiaries were faced with such costs. Furthermore, some beneficiaries likely experienced higher out-of-pocket costs for covered services if they did not contact their plan before obtaining the services. For example, one sponsor of PFFS plans increased the share of the cost for which beneficiaries were responsible from 30 percent to 70 percent if the beneficiaries did not contact the plan before obtaining certain durable equipment. GAO found that some PFFS plans were inappropriately using the term prior authorization, which can involve denying service coverage if prior plan approval is not obtained, in their informational materials. CMS officials stated that PFFS plans should not have used this term because these plans were not permitted to deny service coverage due to lack of prior plan approval. However, CMS guidance on this issue has been inconsistent and sometimes incorrect. From January through April 2007, beneficiaries in PFFS plans disenrolled at an average rate of 21 percent compared to 9 percent for other MA plans, and GAO concludes that CMS has not complied with statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to Medicare beneficiaries. Disenrollment rates can reflect factors such as beneficiary satisfaction and CMS is required by law to mail this information to Medicare beneficiaries to help them compare available MA plans in their area. Although CMS has not mailed disenrollment rates to beneficiaries since 2000, the agency did provide disenrollment rates through Medicare's Web site. However, this information was based on disenrollment in 2004 and 2005 and, given the enrollment growth since then, may not accurately reflect plans available to beneficiaries in 2008."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are an alternative to original Medicare  fee-for-service (FFS) in which private plans provide Medicare benefits to  enrolled beneficiaries. Enrollment in MA plans has grown substantially in  recent years from about 4.7 million beneficiaries in June 2004 to   9.6 million\u2014about 1 out of every 5 Medicare beneficiaries\u2014as of June  2008. This increase in enrollment followed the enactment of the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, which  among other things, resulted in increased payments to MA plans. MA plans  are able to use the increased payments to offer more benefits and reduce  beneficiary cost sharing relative to Medicare FFS. In addition, the  increased payments allowed MA plans to expand into geographic areas  where previously plan options had been very limited, resulting in more  plan choices for beneficiaries.", "Nearly half of the recent growth in MA enrollment, about 45 percent,  occurred in one type of plan\u2014private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans.  Enrollment in these plans increased from about 35,000 beneficiaries in  June 2004 to about 2.3 million beneficiaries in June 2008. About one- quarter of beneficiaries enrolled in MA plans in June 2008 were enrolled in  a PFFS plan, and 99 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in 2008 had access  to a PFFS plan\u2014up from 41 percent in 2005. The Congressional Budget  Office (CBO) projects continued growth in PFFS and other MA plans  through 2013, though at a slower pace.", "The growth in enrollment and availability of MA plans has financial  implications for the Medicare program because the program pays more for  beneficiaries in these plans than it would if they were in Medicare FFS.  The federal government is projected to spend about $91 billion on the MA  program in 2008. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission (MedPAC), in 2008, Medicare is projected to pay about   13 percent more for beneficiaries in MA plans overall and 17 percent more  for beneficiaries in PFFS plans than what the program would have paid for  these beneficiaries under Medicare FFS.", "PFFS plans are designed to offer beneficiaries an MA option that is more  like Medicare FFS. Compared to other MA plans, PFFS plans generally  offer a wider choice of providers and impose less plan management of  health care services and providers. Unlike other types of MA plans, such as  Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) and Preferred Provider  Organizations (PPO), PFFS plans are not required to have networks of  contracted providers if they pay providers Medicare FFS rates or higher.", "Further, providers can agree to accept a PFFS beneficiary on a service-by- service basis. Almost all PFFS plans operate without networks. Paying  providers at Medicare FFS rates or higher suggests that beneficiaries in  PFFS plans will have access to those providers who accept beneficiaries  from Medicare\u2019s FFS program. However, there have been reports that, in  some areas, it may be more difficult for beneficiaries to obtain care while  in PFFS plans than it would be if they were in Medicare FFS.", "Under federal law, PFFS plans may not place providers at financial risk or  restrict beneficiary access to providers. The Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers the Medicare  program, prohibits PFFS plans\u2014but not other types of MA plans\u2014from  requiring that providers or beneficiaries obtain plan approval before a  service is furnished as a condition of coverage, a process known as prior  authorization. However, sponsors of PFFS plans, like sponsors of other  MA plans, must provide an advance coverage determination, should  beneficiaries or their providers request one. An advance coverage  determination informs beneficiaries before they receive services whether  the services will be covered and the amount that the beneficiary must pay  with respect to such services. In finalizing regulations in 1998 for the MA  program (then called the Medicare+Choice program), CMS considered  requiring PFFS plan sponsors to mandate that providers who serve PFFS  plan beneficiaries assume the responsibility for acquiring advance  coverage determinations or risk being unable to charge beneficiaries if the  plan later denied payments for the services. CMS, however, determined  that this beneficiary protection would be inconsistent with federal  statutory provisions that prohibit PFFS plans from placing their providers  at financial risk.", "The rapid growth in PFFS plan enrollment highlights the need for more  information about who is enrolling in, and disenrolling from, these plans.  Specifically, if healthier beneficiaries are enrolling and staying in PFFS  plans, this could leave other MA plans or the Medicare FFS program with  sicker and potentially more costly beneficiaries. Also, if PFFS plans have  high disenrollment rates compared to other MA plans, this could be an  indicator of beneficiary dissatisfaction with access or quality of care or  could indicate that other plans with more attractive benefit packages are  available. In order to help Medicare beneficiaries compare and select MA  plans, CMS is required by law to mail certain information to beneficiaries  annually, including MA plan disenrollment rates for the previous 2 years to  the extent that these disenrollment rates are available.", "Certain features of PFFS plans will change as a result of the Medicare  Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA). Beginning  in 2011, PFFS plans will be required to form contracted networks of  providers in areas that have at least two available network-based plans  (such as HMOs or PPOs). In areas with fewer than two network-based  plans, most PFFS plans will continue to have the option of operating  without networks if they pay providers at Medicare FFS rates or higher.  In addition, beginning in 2010, PFFS plan sponsors will be required to have  quality improvement programs for each plan and report related quality  information to CMS.", "Given the uniqueness of PFFS plans and their rapid enrollment growth,  you asked us to examine the characteristics of beneficiaries in these plans,  PFFS plan features, and beneficiary disenrollment patterns. Our report  addresses the following objectives: (1) compare the characteristics of  beneficiaries in PFFS plans to the characteristics of beneficiaries in other  MA plans and Medicare FFS; (2) describe the financial risks that  beneficiaries in PFFS plans face, compared to beneficiaries in other MA  plans and Medicare FFS, if they do not contact their plan prior to receiving  services; and (3) compare the rates at which beneficiaries in PFFS plans  disenroll to the rates for other MA plans and evaluate whether CMS met  statutory requirements to mail disenrollment rates to beneficiaries.", "To compare the characteristics of beneficiaries in PFFS plans, specifically  age, gender, and residential location, to the characteristics of beneficiaries  in other MA plans and Medicare FFS, we analyzed Medicare enrollment  data for April 2007.

After  excluding plans that restrict enrollment and certain beneficiaries from our  analysis, we analyzed data as of April 2007 for about 5.8 million  beneficiaries in 1,998 MA plans and about 31.7 million beneficiaries in  Medicare FFS. To compare the health status of PFFS and other Medicare  beneficiaries, we obtained plan-level risk scores from CMS, which are  based on projected health care expenditures of plan beneficiaries and  provide an indicator of the health status of the plans\u2019 beneficiaries. We  also examined the type of Medicare coverage that MA beneficiaries held  previously. For this analysis, we identified beneficiaries who were new to  an MA plan type in April 2007 and examined their Medicare coverage in  December 2006.

We reviewed 2008 plan benefit information  provided to beneficiaries as well as provider terms and conditions of  payment for 30 PFFS plans, accounting for more than half of each  sponsor\u2019s total enrollment in PFFS plans. We reviewed 2008 plan benefit  information provided to beneficiaries for 33 HMO or PPO plans operated  by the same nine plan sponsors, accounting for more than half of each  sponsor\u2019s total enrollment in other MA plans. We also interviewed officials  from CMS and the plan sponsors.

We calculated disenrollment rates for each  MA contract, which covered one or more MA plans of the same plan type.  To compare the health status of disenrollees to beneficiaries overall in  PFFS and other MA plans, we used risk scores for 2006 as a proxy for  health status. To evaluate whether CMS met statutory requirements to  mail disenrollment rates to beneficiaries, we interviewed CMS officials,  analyzed relevant federal laws and regulations, and reviewed  disenrollment information CMS provided to Medicare beneficiaries  through, for example, Medicare Options Compare (MOC) on Medicare\u2019s  Web site. MOC is a source of information through which beneficiaries  can compare the quality, benefits, and premiums of MA plans.", "We conducted interviews with CMS officials on the reliability of the CMS  data used in our analysis.

CMS officials stated that information on  beneficiaries\u2019 reasons for disenrollment is necessary to understand the  underlying differences in disenrollment rates across plans. Nonetheless,  CMS officials said that the disenrollment reasons survey was discontinued  after 2005 due to budget constraints. A CMS official also noted that  providing disenrollment rates without reasons for disenrollment would be  misleading because one would not know the extent to which beneficiaries  left a plan, for example, because another plan was less expensive or due to  poor quality care. We disagree with CMS\u2019s position. Although it would be  useful to know the reasons behind beneficiaries\u2019 disenrollment decisions,  disenrollment rates alone can provide useful relative information about  MA plans and prompt beneficiaries to investigate plans further."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The substantial enrollment growth in PFFS plans shows that these plans  are an attractive option for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet, beneficiaries in  these plans may have faced unexpected out-of-pocket costs if plans denied  coverage for services for which beneficiaries or their providers had not  obtained an advance coverage determination. While officials from CMS did  not believe that PFFS plans often denied services unexpectedly for not  being medically necessary, it is important to determine the extent to which  such denials occur. Having this knowledge would inform CMS and policy  makers about whether additional protective measures or beneficiary  educational efforts are warranted. It is also important that beneficiaries  have accurate and current information about MA plans\u2019 policies and  procedures. As such, ensuring that prior authorization guidance is  accurate will help beneficiaries and providers better understand the  obligations and financial risks associated with PFFS plans. Similarly,  providing beneficiaries with current information about MA plan  disenrollment rates would help them make more informed choices when  considering enrolling in an MA plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Acting Administrator of CMS take the following  three actions:  investigate the extent to which beneficiaries in PFFS plans are faced with  unexpected out-of-pocket costs due to the denial of coverage when they  did not obtain an advance coverage determination from their plan;    ensure that CMS guidance on prior authorization accurately reflects CMS  policy and that PFFS plan materials conform to CMS requirements; and   mail to Medicare beneficiaries MA plan disenrollment rates for the  previous 2 years for MA plans that are or will be available in their areas, as  required by statute, and update disenrollment rates provided to Medicare  beneficiaries through MOC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Other External Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CMS and AHIP for comment.

As a consequence, CMS stated that it is important for  beneficiaries in non-network plans (such as virtually all PFFS plans) to  understand their rights and obligations.  CMS advised that beneficiaries in  non-network plans may want to consider obtaining advance  determinations from their plans in appropriate circumstances. CMS said  that it would continue to work closely with Congress, GAO, beneficiary  advocacy groups, and other interested parties to ensure that beneficiaries  receive appropriate health care and do not incur unexpected financial  risks.", "CMS outlined the steps that it was taking, or planned to take, in response  to each of our three recommendations. In response to our  recommendation that CMS investigate the extent to which beneficiaries in  PFFS plans are faced with out-of-pocket costs due to the denial of  coverage when they did not obtain an advance coverage determination  from their plan, CMS is examining coverage denials and complaints, and  will be collecting new information from plans and refining its complaint  tracking module to support this effort. In response to our recommendation  that CMS ensure prior authorization guidance accurately reflects CMS  policy, the agency described several steps it has already taken and planned  to take to address the inaccuracies, including providing new guidance,  modifying the PBP, and providing model terms and conditions that PFFS  plans will be required to use in 2009. In response to our recommendation  that CMS mail disenrollment rates to Medicare beneficiaries and update  disenrollment rates through MOC, the agency commented that it had  recently awarded a contract to obtain disenrollment rates and other  performance metrics by late 2009.

They also stated that our discussion of MIPPA should have  occurred earlier in the report given the potential impact of this legislation  on PFFS plans, and suggested that our finding that all nine PFFS  organizations in our study provided either case management or disease  management services should have been given greater prominence in the  report. We believe our methodology and findings regarding prenotification  are clearly presented in the report and do not agree that clarifications are  warranted. We also believe the placement and emphasis on MIPPA and  case and disease management are appropriate given the focus and timing  of our work.", "AHIP representatives made several other observations they thought might  help clarify aspects of the report. They explained that prenotification was  originally intended to protect beneficiaries by providing them with an  incentive to contact their plan to determine whether a service was covered  before the service was rendered. AHIP representatives informed us that  CMS had posted standard terms and conditions on its Web site that would  help to address use of incorrect terms by the industry. They also stated  that one explanation for our finding that beneficiaries in PFFS plans were  younger on average could be that younger beneficiaries were more likely  to try new types of plans.

We focused our analysis on beneficiaries  enrolled in five types of MA plans as of April 2007 that accounted for more  than 99 percent of the approximately 7.8 million beneficiaries in MA plans  at that time\u2014PFFS plans and four other types of MA plans\u2014Health  Maintenance Organizations (HMO), Local Preferred Provider  Organizations (PPO), regional PPOs, and Provider-Sponsored  Organizations (PSO). Among beneficiaries in the five MA plan types in our  analysis, we excluded those (1) who were in plans that have enrollment  restrictions (i.e., employer plans, Special Needs Plans (SNP), and plans  that only cover Medicare Part B services) and (2) who live outside the 50  states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. After implementing these  exclusions, we analyzed data as of April 2007 for 1,304,288 beneficiaries in  431 PFFS plans, 4,535,881 beneficiaries in 1,567 other MA plans, and  31,680,824 beneficiaries in Medicare FFS. We used the Health Resources  and Services Administration\u2019s Area Resource File for 2006 to obtain data  on counties\u2019 level of urbanization. We defined new enrollees in PFFS and  other MA plans as beneficiaries who were in a given MA plan type in April  2007, based on data from the MIIR database, but who were not in that  same plan type in December 2006. To compare the health status of  beneficiaries in PFFS plans, other MA plans, and Medicare FFS, we used  plan-level risk scores from CMS as a proxy for health status. After  excluding beneficiaries in employer plans, SNPs, and plans that only cover  certain Medicare FFS services as described above, we analyzed risk scores  for 430 PFFS plans in which 1,371,169 beneficiaries were enrolled and  1,576 other MA plans in which 4,610,368 beneficiaries were enrolled as of  July 2007.", "To describe the financial risks that beneficiaries in PFFS plans face,  compared to beneficiaries in other MA plans and Medicare FFS, if they do  not contact their plan prior to receiving services, we reviewed relevant  laws, regulations, documentation from CMS, and materials from nine PFFS  plan sponsors interviewed that accounted for about 81 percent of PFFS  enrollment in July 2007. We reviewed plan benefit information for 2008  provided to beneficiaries as well as provider terms and conditions of  payment for 30 PFFS plans, accounting for more than half of each  sponsor\u2019s total PFFS plan enrollment. We reviewed plan benefit  information for 2008 provided to beneficiaries for 33 HMO or PPO plans  operated by the same nine plan sponsors, accounting for more than half of  each sponsor\u2019s total enrollment in other MA plans. If the plan\u2019s benefit  information provided to beneficiaries explicitly stated that beneficiaries  would face higher cost sharing for certain services if they or their provider  did not notify the plan before receiving such services, we considered that  plan to have a prenotification requirement. We also interviewed officials  from CMS and the plan sponsors. Information gathered from our review of  the benefit information provided to beneficiaries for PFFS and other MA  plans may not be representative of, or generalizeable to, other types of  plans offered by these plan sponsors or to other PFFS and other MA plans  that were not in our sample.", "To compare the rates at which beneficiaries in PFFS plans disenroll to the  rates for other MA plans, we used Medicare enrollment data from the MIIR  database for 6,913,780 beneficiaries in MA plans in December 2006.  Because MA plan selections for 2007 generally take effect from January  through April 2007, we identified disenrollees as beneficiaries who were  covered under a given MA contract in December 2006 but were no longer  covered under that contract in April 2007 based on Medicare enrollment  data. Because we calculated disenrollment at the MA contract level, we  did not address the extent to which beneficiaries transferred from one  plan to another within an MA contract. We chose to calculate  disenrollment rates at the MA contract level, rather than at the MA plan  level, for two reasons: (1) transferring from one plan to another within a  contract can occur for administrative reasons and therefore may not  reflect beneficiary decisions, and (2) a beneficiary\u2019s decision to transfer,  for example, from a zero premium plan to a plan within the same MA  contract that charges a premium and has a richer benefit package does not  suggest dissatisfaction with the type of MA plan or the sponsor that  administers it. We calculated disenrollment rates for each MA contract as  the total number of beneficiaries who disenrolled from their MA contract  divided by total enrollment in that contract. The disenrollment rate for an  MA contract applies to all plans under that contract.", "We did not include beneficiaries in disenrollment rate calculations if they  disenrolled involuntarily due to factors such as death, loss of Medicare  eligibility, moving out of their MA contract\u2019s service area, or to  administrative factors such as a change in their MA contract\u2019s service area  or a termination of their MA contract or plan. After excluding  beneficiaries (1) in certain plans and locations as described above and   (2) in contracts or plans that were terminated in 2006 or 2007, we analyzed  data for 158 PFFS plans accounting for 805,734 beneficiaries and 169,465  disenrollees and for 1,410 other MA plans accounting for 4,488,653  beneficiaries and 392,704 disenrollees.", "We used risk scores for 2006\u2014an indicator of projected health care  expenditures\u2014to compare the health status of disenrollees to  beneficiaries overall in PFFS and other MA plans. To estimate average risk  scores of disenrollees from PFFS and other MA plans, we used 2006  beneficiary-level risk scores for 169,271 beneficiaries who disenrolled  from PFFS plans and for 391,126 beneficiaries who disenrolled from other  MA plans from January through April 2007. To estimate the average risk  scores of beneficiaries overall in these plans, we used 2006 plan-level risk  scores, which are based on 725,110 beneficiaries in 154 PFFS plans and  4,421,308 beneficiaries in 1,400 other MA plans in July 2006, and weighted  each plan\u2019s risk score by its July 2006 enrollment. According to a CMS  official, MA plans\u2019 risk scores generally decline over the course of a year,  so a plan\u2019s risk score based on beneficiaries in the plan in July 2006 could  be higher than it would have been based on beneficiaries in the plan in  December 2006. As a result, the actual percentage difference between the  average projected health care expenditures for disenrollees in PFFS and  other MA plans and beneficiaries overall in these plans may be larger than  our estimates indicate. To evaluate whether CMS met statutory  requirements to mail disenrollment rates to beneficiaries, we interviewed  CMS officials, analyzed relevant federal laws and regulations, and  reviewed information CMS provided to Medicare beneficiaries through, for  example, Medicare Options Compare (MOC) on Medicare\u2019s Web site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Other contributors to this report include Christine Brudevold, Assistant  Director; Jennie Apter; William Black; Daniel Lee; Ba Lin; Hillary Loeffler;  and Hemi Tewarson."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
