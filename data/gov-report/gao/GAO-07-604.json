The United States and its international partners have begun implementing a strategy to forestall (prevent or delay) a pandemic and prepare to cope should one occur. Disease experts generally agree that the risk of a pandemic strain emerging from avian influenza in a given country varies with (1) environmental factors, such as disease presence and certain high-risk farming practices, and (2) preparedness factors, such as a country's capacity to control outbreaks. This report describes (1) U.S. and international efforts to assess pandemic risk by country and prioritize countries for assistance and (2) steps that the United States and international partners have taken to improve the ability to forestall a pandemic. To address these objectives, we interviewed officials and analyzed data from U.S. agencies, international organizations, and nongovernmental experts. The U.S. and international agencies whose efforts we describe reviewed a draft of this report. In general, they concurred with our findings. Several provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Assessments by U.S. agencies and international organizations have identified widespread risks of the emergence of pandemic influenza and the United States has identified priority countries for assistance, but information gaps limit the capacity for comprehensive comparisons of risk levels by country. Several assessments we examined, which have considered environmental or preparedness-related risks or both, illustrate these gaps. For example, a U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) assessment categorized countries according to the level of environmental risk--considering factors such as disease presence and the likelihood of transmission from nearby countries, but factors such as limited understanding of the role of poultry trade or wild birds constrain the reliability of the conclusions. Further, USAID, the State Department, and the United Nations have administered questionnaires to assess country preparedness and World Bank-led missions have gathered detailed information in some countries, but these efforts do not provide a basis for making comprehensive global comparisons. Efforts to get better information are under way but will take time. The U.S. Homeland Security Council has designated priority countries for assistance, and agencies have further identified several countries as meriting the most extensive efforts, but officials acknowledge that these designations are based on limited information. The United States has played a prominent role in global efforts to improve avian and pandemic influenza preparedness, committing the greatest share of funds and creating a framework for managing its efforts. Through 2006, the United States had committed about $377 million, 27 percent of the $1.4 billion committed by all donors. USAID and the Department of Health and Human Services have provided most of these funds for a range of efforts, including stockpiles of protective equipment and training foreign health professionals in outbreak response. The State Department coordinates international efforts and the Homeland Security Council monitors progress. More than a third of U.S. and overall donor commitments have gone to individual countries, with more than 70 percent of those going to U.S. priority countries. The U.S. National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan provides a framework for U.S. international efforts, assigning agencies specific action items and specifying performance measures and time frames for completion. The Homeland Security Council reported in December 2006 that all international actions due to be completed by November had been completed, and provided evidence of timely completion for the majority of those items."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the end of 2003, a global epidemic of avian influenza among poultry  has raised concern about the risk of a global influenza epidemic\u2014a  pandemic\u2014occurring among humans. Though initially confined to  Southeast Asia, since mid-2005, this epidemic has spread to the Middle  East, Europe, and Africa and has caused the deaths of more than 250  million poultry, either directly or as a result of culling programs designed  to stop its spread. While thus posing a serious threat to farmer livelihoods,  the H5N1 strain of influenza that is causing this epidemic has also  demonstrated the ability to infect and kill humans. From 2003 through  2006, more than 260 humans contracted the H5N1 strain and more than  half of them died. Nearly all of these cases resulted from contact with  infected poultry. However, if H5N1 develops the ability to pass easily  among humans, an influenza pandemic could ensue. In contrast to the  more moderate health threat presented by annual outbreaks of seasonal  influenza, pandemic influenza poses a grave threat to global public health.  Scientists estimate that the pandemic of 1918 to 1919 killed more than 50  million humans, including an estimated 675,000 Americans, although the  last two pandemics (in 1957 and 1968) were milder.", "Disease experts caution that it is not possible to predict when or where  the next influenza pandemic will begin\u2014or whether it will involve H5N1.  Nonetheless, concern that H5N1 may spark a pandemic has increased as  the virus has spread among countries with comparatively high levels of  environmental and preparedness-related risk\u2014that is, countries where  the virus is already present, or is present in a neighboring country, and a  range of conditions, such as high-risk poultry farming practices, are  conducive to H5N1 spreading in poultry and infecting humans  (environmental risk) and    animal and human health systems are relatively unprepared to detect or  respond appropriately to this virus (preparedness risk).", "The United Nations World Health Organization (WHO) has concluded that  the H5N1 epidemic in poultry has brought the world closer to an influenza  pandemic than at any time in the last 40 years. Concern about this threat  has prompted the United States and its international partners to launch  efforts aimed at improving global preparedness to both forestall (prevent  or at least delay) the onset of an influenza pandemic and cope with a  pandemic should one occur. As agreed with your offices, we focused on  U.S. and international efforts to forestall a pandemic. This report  addresses (1) the extent to which U.S. agencies and their international  partners have assessed the country-by-country risk of H5N1 sparking a  pandemic and prioritized countries for international assistance and (2) the  steps that U.S. agencies and their international partners have taken to  improve global preparedness to forestall a pandemic.", "In related work, we are examining constraints on the use of vaccines and  antiviral drugs to help in forestalling a pandemic and efforts that are under  way to overcome these constraints. Our analysis of these issues will be  published in a separate report.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed relevant Department of  Agriculture (USDA), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  Department of Defense (DOD), Department of State, and U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) planning, funding, and reporting  documents for avian and pandemic influenza programs and discussed  them with agency officials. We examined and analyzed documents such as  country risk and preparedness assessments, operational plans, and budget  spreadsheets. We also analyzed the U.S government\u2019s strategy and plan for  addressing pandemic influenza and associated reports on progress  through December 2006. In addition, we studied relevant documents from  the United Nations (UN) and other international organizations, including  WHO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the  World Bank, and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Finally,  we consulted with nongovernmental and academic experts on avian and  pandemic influenza.

After appearing in southeastern China and Hong Kong in 1996 and  1997, the virus reappeared in late 2003 and early 2004 in a number of other  Southeast Asian countries. In 2005 and 2006, it spread rapidly to countries  in other parts of Asia and to Europe and Africa. Through December 2006,  H5N1 had been detected in poultry and wild birds in nearly 60 countries.  Figure 1 shows the progression of the disease across countries and also  notes which of those countries have experienced human cases.", "H5N1 has infected increasing numbers of humans. WHO confirmed only 4  cases of H5N1 infection among humans in 2003, and 3 of these occurred in  one country, Vietnam. In contrast, WHO confirmed 115 human cases in  2006, in nine different countries. Table 1 shows how the number and  distribution of human cases grew from 2003 through 2006. The largest  numbers of human cases occurred in Southeast Asian countries where the  virus is well established in wild and domestic birds.", "Pandemics can occur when influenza strains emerge that have never  circulated among humans but can cause serious illness in them and can  pass easily from one person to the next. H5N1 has shown that it can cause  serious illness in humans, and could spark a pandemic if it evolves into a  strain that has the ability to pass easily from one human to the next.", "H5N1 may evolve into such a strain gradually, through accumulation of a  number of small mutations, or suddenly, through the introduction of  genetic material from another influenza virus. Influenza A viruses, which  cause both avian influenza outbreaks and human influenza pandemics,  occur naturally in wild birds and can also infect pigs, humans, and other  mammals. The various subtypes, including H5N1, mutate as they  reproduce in their avian or mammal hosts. These small mutations  continually produce new strains with slightly different characteristics.  More rarely, when an animal or human is infected with two different  subtypes, an entirely new subtype can emerge. Scientists believe that the  1957 and 1968 pandemics began when subtypes circulating in birds and  humans simultaneously infected and combined into new subtypes in other  host animals, most likely pigs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pandemic Risk Varies with Environmental Conditions and Preparedness", "paragraphs": ["Disease experts caution that there are significant gaps in our  understanding of the H5N1 virus in wild and domestic birds and in  humans, and it is not possible to quantify the pandemic risk presented by  this strain.

At the  country level, agricultural agencies are responsible for addressing disease  threats to animals, while public health agencies are responsible for  addressing disease threats to humans. International organizations support  and coordinate these national efforts. In particular, OIE and FAO share  lead responsibility for addressing infectious disease threats to animal  health, while WHO leads efforts to safeguard humans. National agencies  with technical expertise, such as USDA and HHS, assist in these efforts.", "The animal and human health systems have traditionally approached  influenza in different ways. The animal health system has emphasized  measures to protect flocks from exposure to influenza\u2014for example, by  reducing contact with wild birds\u2014and, when outbreaks nonetheless  occur, taking action to contain them and eradicate threatening strains.  Outbreak control measures include (1) identifying and isolating infected  zones, (2) \u201cstamping out\u201d the virus by culling (killing) all poultry within  these zones, and (3) cleaning and disinfecting facilities before  reintroducing poultry. Vaccines that prevent clinical illness in poultry\u2014 and decrease the risk of transmission to both other poultry and humans\u2014 are available. However, these vaccines do not completely prevent  influenza viruses from infecting and replicating in apparently healthy  poultry and veterinary authorities recommend their use only in  conjunction with other disease control measures. No effective antiviral  drugs are available for poultry and thus animal health agencies do not  recommend their use.", "The human health system\u2019s approach to both seasonal and pandemic  influenza has traditionally emphasized development and application of  vaccines to limit spread and protect individuals. However, while vaccines  are likely to play a key role in mitigating the impact of the next pandemic,  they are likely to play little role in forestalling its onset, barring major  changes in technology. Prior to a strain being identified, the  pharmaceutical industry cannot currently produce vaccines that are  certain to be effective against it. Rather, when a new strain is identified, 6  months or more are required to develop and reach full production capacity  for new vaccines. Therefore, a pandemic will likely be well under way  before a vaccine that is specifically formulated to counteract the pandemic  strain becomes available. Antiviral drugs are also used to treat and  prevent seasonal influenza in humans and could be used in the event of a  pandemic to contain or slow the spread of the virus. In contrast to the  approach used with poultry, the human public health community has not  generally attempted to contain an initial outbreak of a pandemic-potential  strain or to eradicate it while it is still confined to a limited area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The United States and International Partners Have Adopted an Overall Response Strategy", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has developed a national strategy for addressing the  threats presented by H5N1, and has also worked with its international  partners to develop an overall global strategy that is compatible with the  U.S. approach. In November 2005 the Homeland Security Council  published an interagency National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza,  followed in May 2006 by an Implementation Plan that assigns  responsibilities to specific U.S. agencies. The U.S. strategy, in addition to  outlining U.S. plans for coping with a pandemic within its own territory,  states that the United States will work to \u201cstop, slow, or otherwise limit\u201d a  pandemic beginning outside its own territory. The strategy has three  pillars that provide a framework for its implementation: (1) preparedness  and communications, (2) surveillance and detection, and (3) response and  containment. The United States has also worked with UN agencies, OIE,  and other governments to develop an overall international strategy. Figure  2 shows key steps in the development of this international strategy in  relation to the spread of the H5N1 virus. These steps included the  appointment of a UN System Influenza Coordinator and periodic global  conferences to review progress and refine the strategy.

To guide efforts to improve capacity for performing  these tasks, the UN System Influenza Coordinator has identified seven  broad objectives.

USAID undertook this assessment to inform its decisions about  spending priorities in the initial phase of heightened concern about human  pandemic risk from H5N1, when very little risk information was available,  according to USAID officials. USAID used OIE data on reported animal  cases. For countries that had not yet reported cases, USAID estimated the  risk of introduction based on proximity to affected countries and available  information on poultry trade and bird migration patterns. USAID  concluded that the countries at highest risk for new or recurring H5N1  outbreaks, or both, were those in Southeast Asia where the disease was  well-established, with widespread and recurring infections in animals  since 2003 (see fig. 3). Countries that were comparatively distant from  those that had already reported cases were deemed at lowest risk.", "We identified three constraints on the reliability of these USAID  categorizations. First, global surveillance of the disease among domestic  animals has serious shortfalls. While OIE and FAO collaborate to obtain  and confirm information on suspected H5N1 cases, surveillance capacity  remains weak in many countries. Second, estimates of risk for disease  transmission from one country to another, as well as among regions within  countries, are difficult to make because of uncertainties about how factors  such as trade in poultry and other birds and wild bird migration affect the  movement of the disease. Specifically, illegal trade in birds is largely  undocumented and movement of the virus through the wild bird  population is poorly understood.

Through fiscal year 2006, USAID reported spending about              $56 million to create a stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE)  kits and other nonmedical commodities to facilitate outbreak investigation  and response. The USAID stockpile consisted of 1.5 million PPE kits to  be used by personnel investigating or responding to outbreaks, 100  laboratory kits, and 15,000 decontamination kits. As of October 2006,  USAID reported having deployed approximately 193,000 PPE kits for  immediate or near-term use in more than 60 countries (see app. VIII).", "To improve global surveillance and detection capacity, the  Implementation Plan assigns U.S. agencies responsibility for action items  that focus on   (1) ensuring rapid reporting of outbreaks and (2) using  surveillance to limit their spread.

In  2006, HHS established or augmented five regional global disease detection  and response centers located in Egypt ($4.4 million), Guatemala ($2  million), Kenya ($4.5 million), Thailand ($6.5 million), and China ($3.9  million) to enhance global disease surveillance and response capacity.  Among other things, these centers provide training in field epidemiology  and laboratory applications. For example, in July 2006, the Thailand center  conducted a workshop aimed at teaching public health officials what to do  when investigating a respiratory disease outbreak that may signal the start  of a pandemic. More than 100 participants from 14 countries participated  in this workshop, which was cosponsored by WHO and Thai authorities.", "To improve global response and containment capacity, the  Implementation Plan assigns U.S. agencies responsibility for action items  that focus on (1) containing outbreaks; (2) leveraging international  medical and health surge capacity; (3) sustaining infrastructure, essential  services, and the economy; and (4) ensuring effective risk communication.  Action item 4.3.1.5, for example, assigns USDA and USAID lead  responsibility for supporting operational deployment of response teams  when outbreaks occur in poultry (see fig. 11). In 2006, USDA and USAID  supported the creation of a crisis management center at FAO to  coordinate and respond to avian influenza outbreaks globally. According  to FAO, the center is able to dispatch its experts to any location in the  world in under 48 hours. USAID and USDA have provided approximately  $5 million in support to the center. USDA detailed three veterinary  specialists to the center for headquarters operations as well as an official  to serve as its deputy director. USDA is also providing experts to respond  to outbreaks.

Our  review of the progress report found that for 14 of the 22 action items, the  report directly addressed the specified performance measures and  indicated that these measures had been addressed within the specified  time frames. However, for 8 of the action items, the information in the  progress report did not directly address the performance measure or did  not indicate that the completion deadline had been met. Based on  interviews and information we obtained from the responsible agencies, we  determined that the lack of clarity in these cases was primarily because of  omission of key facts on agency activities or agency difficulties in  reporting on poorly worded performance measures. For example, 1  action item directed DOD to prepare to limit the spread of a pandemic- potential strain by controlling official military travel between affected  areas and the United States. The performance measure was designation  of military facilities that could serve as points of entry from affected areas.  The council\u2019s report described the department\u2019s preparedness for  controlling travelers\u2019 movements but did not state that DOD had identified  facilities that could serve as points of entry. Our review of DOD  documents indicated that the department had designated such facilities.

To describe how H5N1 has spread  internationally, we used country-specific data on cases among humans  assembled by the United Nations World Health Organization (WHO), and  on cases and outbreaks in humans and in wild and domestic birds  assembled by the United Nations (UN) World Food Program. World Food  Program officials told us their data on human cases were provided by  WHO, while their data on cases in birds were provided by the World  Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the UN Food and Agriculture  Organization (FAO). WHO, OIE, and FAO have cautioned that global  surveillance is imperfect, and some human and animal cases and  outbreaks may go unrecorded. However, these organizations work with a  wide variety of global partners, including national governments, to identify  and verify outbreaks of this disease. We determined that these data on  human and animal outbreaks were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report, which were to convey a general sense of the manner in which  the disease has spread across international boundaries and the extent to  which it has infected humans.

To describe the overall  strategy that the United States and its international partners have  developed to respond to the H5N1 epidemic, we interviewed and  examined relevant documents from U.S. and UN agencies, including the  U.S. National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and strategy statements  and progress reports produced by the UN System Influenza Coordinator  and the World Bank.", "To examine the extent to which U.S. and international agencies have been  able to assess the pandemic risk that H5N1 presents in individual  countries and prioritize them for international assistance, we reviewed  and analyzed assessments of environmental risk and preparedness.", "Specifically, we reviewed assessments prepared by the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID), the Department of State, the UN, and  the World Bank and spoke with cognizant officials at these agencies and  organizations about how they were conducted. These assessments  evaluated country-level pandemic risk deriving from environmental  conditions, country preparedness for responding to avian and pandemic  influenza, or both. We analyzed a sample of 17 country-specific avian  influenza preparedness assessments compiled by USAID and the State  Department to provide summary information on capacity in several  regions. (See app. V for a detailed description of the scope and  methodology for our analysis of sampled USAID and State Department  assessments.) We also reviewed the U.S. Homeland Security Council  Country Prioritization Matrix as of May 3, 2006, which designates country  priority levels for U.S. actions to address the avian and pandemic influenza  threat. We discussed this priority ranking with officials from the State  Department and USAID. We requested a meeting with officials from the  council, but the council declined, stating that we could obtain needed  information from other agencies and departments. In addition, we  reviewed analyses of environmental risk factors prepared by U.S.  intelligence community analysts during 2006 and early 2007 and discussed  these analyses with U.S. agency officials. We also reviewed assessments of  risks in particular countries prepared by a U.S. intelligence agency.", "To determine the actions U.S. agencies and their international partners  took to address these risks, we examined funding, planning, and reporting  documents and spoke with cognizant officials. To determine the overall  level of financial support that the donor community is providing for efforts  to improve global avian and pandemic influenza preparedness, we  examined World Bank and UN documents detailing donor pledges and  commitments resulting from the international pledging conferences on  avian and pandemic influenza, including funding levels by donor, by  recipient, and by purpose. We also reviewed World Bank and UN  documents describing recipient countries, regions, and organizations.", "To describe the international activities of the U.S. government, we  reviewed the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza and the National  Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan.

The pledges and commitments data  are self-reported by individual donor countries in response to a standard  request template. The World Bank staff responsible for this data collection  provided countries with standard definitions of key terms, such as  pledges, commitments, and in-kind and cash payments. However, because  countries\u2019 data reporting systems vary substantially, World Bank staff  conduct ongoing discussions with donor countries to establish the  correspondence between those systems and the World Bank terms. World  Bank staff also stated that the pledges and commitments totals provided  by countries may include funding not strictly related to pandemic  influenza and may therefore be somewhat overstated. Therefore, based on  our review, we use these data to identify general levels of pledges and  commitments made by particular countries or organizations; they should  not be relied upon to support precise comparisons of funding by donor or  recipient. Overall, we concluded that the World Bank pledges and  commitments data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.", "To obtain data on U.S. agency funding for international avian and  pandemic influenza preparedness by agency and by the three pillars of the  overall U.S. pandemic strategy, we requested separate submissions from  each of the five U.S. agencies, showing planned, obligated, and expended  funds by pillar. Two of the five agencies (USAID and USDA) maintained  funding data by pillar prior to our requesting these data. Two others (DOD  and the State Department) found it relatively easy to comply with our  request, since all of their reported activities fell within the preparedness  and communications pillar. However, providing this information was  comparatively complex for HHS. The various units within that agency (for  example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National  Institutes of Health) support a wide variety of relevant programs, many of  which involve more than one pillar. In addition, HHS can utilize other  sources of funding in addition to influenza-specific appropriations for  many of these programs. To respond to our request, the HHS Office of  Global Health Affairs collected data from relevant HHS units. The Director  of the Office of Global Health Affairs reviewed the final HHS submission  for accuracy before reporting back to GAO. The pillar-specific totals HHS  was able to provide were for planned funds and for obligated funds. Thus,  the funding information by agency that we provide is for these two  categories of funding data and not for expenditures.", "We identified a number of limitations in the data that the agencies  provided. First, the data are not from consistent periods. USDA and USAID  provided information on planned funding levels and obligations through  December 2006. HHS, DOD, and the State Department provided data  through September 2006. In addition, DOD and the State Department  received funding for international avian and pandemic influenza activities  through appropriations in 2006 only; whereas, USAID, HHS, and USDA  received funding through 2005 and 2006 appropriations. Second, the  distribution of funds among the pillars is somewhat imprecise. When  programs addressed more than one pillar, agency officials employed their  professional judgment to decide which pillar was most significant. This  limitation was most pronounced in the HHS data. While HHS decided how  to allocate most of its funds, the agency did not specify a pillar for about  $15 million of its planned funds. This total included about $5 million to  expand staffing levels in key global, regional, and country-level facilities,  including the WHO regional offices for Africa and the Western Pacific and  surveillance and response facilities in Thailand and Egypt, and about      $10 million for HHS headquarters management of its influenza-related  initiatives.", "Third, the total planned and obligated amounts are also somewhat  imprecise. Some of the agency funds come from programs that are not  dedicated specifically to avian or pandemic influenza. In such cases,  agency officials used professional judgment to decide what portion of the  funds should be designated as supporting avian or pandemic influenza  preparedness.", "Despite these limitations, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of this report, which was to provide information  on general levels of agency planned and obligated funding by pillar.

We did not include China in  our table of countries because the relevant reports were classified.", "USAID and the State Department conducted their assessments by sending  out sets of questions to personnel at their respective missions. The  questions asked in the two instruments differed in their wording, and as a  consequence, our first step in developing our analysis was to identify a set  of broader dimensions, or indicators, encompassing data from both sets of  assessments. Through a review of these two sets of questions, as well as  survey questions recently developed by WHO and the World Bank to  assess country preparedness, we identified a set of 15 qualitative  indicators covering a wide array of issues within the topic areas of  preparedness and communications, surveillance and detection, and  response and containment. These indicators then became the dimensions  along which we analyzed the data contained in the USAID and State  Department assessments.", "We reviewed USAID rapid country assessments and State Department  cables assessing the level of country preparedness for avian influenza. The  analysis of the 17 USAID and State Department assessments was  performed by two GAO analysts, reviewing the reports separately and  recording answers, with justifications, in workpapers. To enhance inter- rater reliability in our analysis of the USAID and State Department  assessments, we developed a code book to reflect the specific  characteristics needed for a country to be classified in one of three  categories for each indicator: yes, no, or limited. Subsequently, the two  analysts compared their answers and justifications, reconciled their  analyses when they diverged, and modified the code book as needed to  ensure consistent coding across indicators and countries. A methodologist  performed a final check on the consistency and accuracy of the analysis.", "The USAID and State Department instruments had a number of  limitations. First, the information provided in these assessments is limited  by the rapidly evolving dynamic of the H5N1 virus and ongoing efforts to  improve capacity. As a consequence the information provided in them is  already dated and should be understood as a snapshot of the countries  assessed at a particular point in time (fall 2005), rather than directly  reflecting the current status of country capacities. Second, the purpose of  these assessments was to rapidly assess country capacities in this evolving  environment, and as a result, the instruments developed were limited in  the design of the questions asked, restricted primarily to open-ended  questions that could be interpreted and answered in multiple ways. Third,  the instruments were limited in the manner in which they were  implemented. In particular, the data reported reflect the individualized  data-gathering and assessment efforts of the point of contact at USAID or  the State Department rather than a standardized approach to data  gathering and assessment.", "Fourth, while many respondents addressed the indicators we identified for  analysis, because the questions were open-ended, there is inconsistency in  the depth and coverage of responses. Furthermore, in some cases, the  response to a question was simply \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d without any details. When  this occurred, we recorded the answer the respondent gave. Fifth, some  indicators had only one source of information (they were addressed in one  report but left blank in another), and we could not compare them for  consistency. Sixth, in some instances, respondents did not answer  questions sufficiently for us to make determinations or left them blank. We  could not determine the level of these indicators based on available data  and rated them as missing and left them blank in those cases. Despite  these limitations, we determined that the data contained in these  statements were sufficient for the purpose of our report, which was to  provide information broadly demonstrating the limited capacities of  countries at a particular point in time with implications for the challenges  posed in subsequent periods."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Assistance to Regional and Global Organizations", "paragraphs": ["According to data submitted to the World Bank by the United States and  other donors, Asia-Pacific regional initiatives have received the largest  share of regionally focused funding from international donors, including  the United States (see table 3).
