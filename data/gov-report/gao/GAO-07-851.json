Federal financial accounting standards state that reliable information on the costs of federal programs and activities is crucial for effective management of government operations and recommend that full costs of programs and their outputs be provided to assist Congress and executives in making informed decisions on program resources and to ensure that programs get expected and efficient results. The full cost includes both those costs specifically identifiable to carry out the program, or direct costs, and those costs that are common to multiple programs but cannot be specifically identified with any particular program, or indirect costs. While the standards emphasize that full cost information is essential for managing federal programs, their activities, and outputs, the standards also provide that items may be omitted from cost information if that omission would not change or influence the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the cost information. Based on GAO's review of documentation provided by DOD and discussions with department officials, GAO found that DOD's estimate includes some direct costs, such as the start-up and operation of the NSPS PEO and the development and delivery of new NSPS training courses, but it does not include other direct costs such as the full salary costs of all civilian and military personnel who directly support NSPS activities departmentwide. Before developing its estimate, DOD had not fully defined all the direct and indirect costs needed to manage the program. Without a better estimate, decision makers--within DOD and Congress--will not have complete information about whether adequate resources are being provided for implementing NSPS. The total amount of funds DOD has expended or obligated to design and implement NSPS during fiscal years 2005 through 2006 cannot be determined because DOD has not established an oversight mechanism to ensure that these costs are fully captured. In May 2005, the NSPS Senior Executive established guidance for tracking and reporting NSPS implementation costs that requires the components to develop mechanisms to capture these costs and to report quarterly their costs to the NSPS PEO. However, this guidance does not define the direct and indirect costs DOD requires that the components capture. DOD's pervasive financial management deficiencies have been the basis for GAO's designation of this as a high-risk area since 1995. GAO's review of submitted reports from the components found that their official accounting systems do not capture the total funds expended or obligated to design and implement NSPS. Without an effective oversight mechanism to ensure that the official accounting systems capture all appropriate costs, DOD and Congress do not have visibility over the actual cost to design and implement NSPS."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Given a large-scale organizational change initiative, such as the National  Given a large-scale organizational change initiative, such as the National  Security Personnel System (NSPS), is a substantial commitment that will  Security Personnel System (NSPS), is a substantial commitment that will  take years to complete, it is important that the Department of Defense  take years to complete, it is important that the Department of Defense  (DOD) and Congress be kept informed of the full cost of implementing  (DOD) and Congress be kept informed of the full cost of implementing  NSPS.

Typical direct costs include salaries and benefits for employees  who work directly on NSPS activities; materials and supplies used in the  work; various costs associated with office space, equipment, facilities, and  utilities that are used exclusively to produce the output; and the costs of  goods and services received from other segments or entities that are used  to produce the output.", "DOD\u2019s estimate included several broad cost categories. These categories  are (1) design and implementation, (2) training, (3) evaluation, (4) human  resources automated systems, and (5) program office operations. DOD\u2019s  estimate contained some examples of the types of costs included in each  of these broad categories. However, before calculating its estimate, DOD  had not fully defined what direct and indirect costs should be included for  it to effectively manage NSPS. Neither could DOD provide us with  complete supporting documentation that identifies the specific types of  costs included in its estimate. The Standards for Internal Controls in the  Federal Government require that all transactions and other significant  events, such as cost estimates, be clearly documented.", "Based on our review of the documentation provided by DOD and  discussions with PEO and component officials, however, the estimate  does not include all direct costs of implementing the system. For example,  PEO and component officials stated that the estimate includes direct costs  for the start-up and operation of the Program Executive Office and the  National Security Labor Relations Board; development and delivery of  training materials, Web-based courses, and classroom sessions by DOD  contractor and civilian instructors; modification of existing automated  personnel and payroll transaction processing systems\u2014the Defense  Civilian Personnel Data System and the Defense Civilian Pay System\u2014to  accommodate changes brought about by NSPS; travel costs for NSPS  trainers and training participants; outreach with employees and other  parties; and collaboration activities with employee representatives.  However, PEO and component officials agreed that the estimate does not  include all direct costs of implementing the system. For example, PEO and  component officials agreed that the estimate does not include the full  salary costs of all civilian and military personnel who directly support  NSPS activities departmentwide and any of the direct costs that the  various organizations and defense agencies expect to incur to implement  the system, such as salaries and benefits for employees who work directly  on NSPS activities and materials and supplies used in NSPS activities.  Furthermore, PEO and component officials acknowledge that the estimate  did not include any of the typical indirect costs associated with the design  and implementation of NSPS such as costs of general administrative  services, general research, and technical support. Without a cost estimate  that includes all costs that the department expects to incur as a result of  implementing the new system, decision makers\u2014within DOD and  Congress\u2014will not have the complete cost information they need to make  decisions about whether adequate resources are being provided for  implementing NSPS.", "Moreover, component officials told us that certain categories of the  estimated costs provided by the components do not contain comparable  cost elements. One of DOD\u2019s key financial management regulation  principles\u2014comparability\u2014requires the reporting of financial  management data in the same manner throughout DOD, using common  definitions when necessary. However, officials from the Departments of  the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the Washington Headquarters Services  told us that they used different approaches to estimate NSPS funding  requirements when calculating this cost estimate. While the PEO issued  general instructions to the military services and the Washington  Headquarters Services for estimating the costs associated with the design  and implementation of NSPS, this office did not provide a description of  the specific types of direct and indirect costs to be included in the  estimate or a cost-estimating methodology containing assumptions and  approaches. The PEO guidance provided a general reporting template with  broad cost categories but did not contain detailed instructions for  ensuring comprehensive and comparable cost estimates. Army and Navy  officials told us that they estimated civilian personnel costs under the  category of \u201cProgram Office Operations\u201d; the Air Force officials noted that  they estimated civilian personnel costs under four other categories; and  Washington Headquarters Services officials stated that they did not  estimate their NSPS design and implementation costs in any of the eight  categories.

In addition,  the guidance requires the components to submit reports quarterly of their  NSPS obligations to the NSPS PEO. This guidance does not, however,  define the direct and indirect costs that DOD requires the components to  capture. Our prior work on DOD\u2019s financial and related business  management and systems has revealed pervasive deficiencies that affect  its ability to control costs; ensure basic accountability; anticipate future  costs and claims on the budget; measure performance; maintain funds  control; prevent and detect fraud, waste, and abuse; and address pressing  management issues.

According to Air Force officials, the remaining  reported amount, $17.9 million, was an estimate of expended and  obligated funds Air Force-wide. The Navy and the Washington  Headquarters Services reported $21.6 million and $13.1 million,  respectively, but neither component was able to provide any evidence that  these obligated funds had been captured in their official accounting  systems.", "While the quarterly NSPS cost reports are intended to provide DOD with  visibility over NSPS implementation costs, the PEO does not have an  effective oversight mechanism or internal controls in place to ensure that  the information contained in the reports is complete and accurate.

The  Standards emphasize the importance of management oversight and review  to ensure that programs, their activities, and outputs continue to meet  their intended goals and comply with the law and policies and recommend  that agencies establish internal controls to monitor and review operations  and programs to provide reasonable assurance that they meet their goals.  Moreover, although the PEO relies on the components to follow its  guidance for capturing NSPS costs in their official accounting systems, it  does not conduct an independent verification of the completeness or  accuracy of financial data reported by the components. Although  independent verification is an important internal control activity under  segregation of duties designed to reduce the risk of errors, PEO officials  told us that none of the reports submitted by the components are reviewed  by an independent or second reviewer to ensure that the information  reported is accurate or complete. Federal internal control standards  require that data control activities, such as verification and reconciliation,  be conducted and documented to help provide reasonable assurance that  the objectives of a program and its activities are being met. Moreover, we  consider establishing such controls, including policies and oversight  mechanisms, a best practice that can ensure greater visibility over the total  costs associated with the design and implementation of NSPS.

Moreover, the cost information that makes up the  components\u2019 portion of the overall DOD cost estimate was prepared using  different approaches and is therefore not comparable.

In an overall comment, DOD noted  that NSPS is not a program; however, it also noted that DOD modeled the  development and implementation of NSPS on the acquisition model. Also,  the department noted that costing and accounting requirements for NSPS  were never intended to be the same as those for the acquisition model. We  believe DOD raises this point because we used the federal financial  accounting standards to analyze DOD\u2019s costs associated with the  implementation of NSPS. We note in our report that federal financial  accounting standards not only apply to the cost of programs, but also to  the cost of activities such as NSPS. Therefore, we believe that the same  costing and accounting rigor and discipline that are applied to major  acquisition programs should apply to NSPS.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to define all direct and  indirect costs necessary to effectively manage the program, its activities,  and outputs, in accordance with internal control standards, federal  financial accounting standards, and DOD\u2019s financial management  regulation principle related to comparability. DOD stated that the PEO is  reconstituting the Financial Integrated Product Team (IPT) to define all  direct and indirect costs necessary to effectively manage the program;  relook at the original cost categories to determine if they are still  appropriate and change if appropriate; and stipulate the costs included in  each category. If the PEO follows through with its effort, we believe that it  will be responsive to our recommendation. Regarding indirect costs, DOD  stated that a test of reasonableness was applied. The department  explained that the components were allowed to weigh the cost/benefit of  collecting, tracking, and reporting indirect costs. While we agree that it is  indeed appropriate for the components to apply a test of reasonableness  to weigh the cost/benefit of collecting, tracking, and reporting indirect  costs, it is important to note that a crucial first step for the department to  lay a foundation for such decisions about reasonableness is to define what  direct and indirect costs are needed to effectively manage NSPS. It is also  important to note that we cannot verify DOD\u2019s statement that the  components applied a reasonableness test because DOD did not provide  documentation to reflect this during our review. DOD further stated that  the PEO had tracked both direct and indirect costs. While the PEO does  capture funds it expended or obligated to design and implement NSPS, we  continue to believe that the total amount of funds DOD has expended or  obligated to design and implement NSPS cannot be determined because  DOD has not established an effective oversight mechanism to ensure that  the cost information reported is accurate and complete.", "Regarding our recommendation to prepare a revised estimate of the full  costs of implementing NSPS in accordance with established definitions,  internal control standards, federal financial accounting standards, and  DOD\u2019s financial management regulation principle related to comparability,  the department concurred, noting that the PEO will develop an estimate  covering fiscal years 2008 through 2011.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the NSPS Senior Executive  develop a comprehensive oversight framework to ensure that NSPS funds  that are expended or obligated are fully captured and reported, noting that  the department should leverage existing policies and procedures to ensure  oversight of these costs. However, in the absence of more specific details  on its planned actions to leverage existing policies and procedures to  ensure oversight of NSPS costs, we continue to emphasize the  department\u2019s need for a comprehensive oversight framework because  without it DOD and Congress do not have adequate visibility over the  actual cost to design and implement NSPS.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees.
