Nationally, about 70 percent of youth served were in school, but percentages ranged from 38 to 86 percent by state. Officials in the five states GAO visited said that they focused on in-school youth because serving out-of-school youth was much more difficult and expensive, and less effective. Local areas emphasized learning-related summer employment for in-school youth and occupational skills training and supportive services for out-of-school youth. Over half of local boards nationwide used providers that had subcontracting arrangements with others to deliver youth services. The majority of youth were served primarily from educational institutions and community organizations. Despite Labor's guidance, local areas continue to face implementation challenges in identifying and retaining out-of-school youth, providing youth with mentoring and follow-up services, and using interim measures for ongoing program assessment. While Labor supports information exchange forums, a promising practices Web site, and technical assistance, some local areas may have difficulties gaining access to and using these resources. Little is known about the effectiveness of the WIA youth program because Labor has not yet conducted an impact evaluation. In addition, while the youth program exceeded most of its performance goals, these data were questionable because of problems with state information systems and inadequate oversight of data quality. While states will be required to verify data, concerns remain about their ability to fully implement the requirement and Labor's ability to monitor implementation consistently."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More than 5 million young people\u201415 percent of the nation\u2019s youth  population between ages 16 and 24\u2014are out of school and out of work,  according to a recent study. Further, many teenagers and young adults  who are in school are at risk of dropping out. According to some experts,  this indicates that a considerable portion of the country\u2019s emerging  workforce may face significant difficulty making the transition to  productive adulthood. At the same time, the Department of Labor projects  that some labor demands will go unmet because there will be too few  workers in the labor market with the necessary skills. Enacted in 1998, the  Workforce Investment Act (WIA) aims to address these issues by assisting  the nation\u2019s emerging workforce in realizing its full potential. As the  administering agency, Labor has budgeted about $1 billion annually on  WIA Title I-B youth employment and training programs to serve an  estimated 721,000 of the nation\u2019s most at-risk young people.", "WIA services are based on promising practices in the fields of youth  development and employment. Research suggests, for example, that youth  can achieve positive outcomes when they interact with caring adults,  engage in hands-on education and training activities, and receive support  for personal growth. The WIA program has sought to make these sorts of  experiences available to both in-school and out-of-school youth  participants. Under WIA, local areas can tailor their approach to the types  of youth served, the services provided, and how they are delivered. To  ensure that youth programs are tailored to local areas, WIA requires the  participation of a wide variety of people\u2014youth policy experts,  representatives from youth-serving agencies, parents, and others with a  vested interest in the local youth programs. These participants serve on  local workforce investment boards created by WIA to establish workforce  development policies and oversee implementation at the local level, or on  youth councils, subgroups of the local board that plan and coordinate the  local youth program.", "We previously reported on the implementation challenges local areas  faced during the first few years of implementation. Now that the program  has been ongoing for several years and WIA is undergoing reauthorization,  you asked us to review (1) what approaches local areas have taken to  serve at-risk youth, (2) whether Labor\u2019s youth program guidance has  addressed ongoing implementation challenges, and (3) what is known  about the effectiveness of the WIA youth program.", "To obtain information on what approaches local areas have taken to  deliver youth services, we administered a survey to the directors of all   604 local workforce investment boards across the nation, including those  in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. territories.  We received responses from 496 local workforce investment boards   (82 percent) and relied on self-reported data. To further understand local  area approaches to service delivery, we visited nine local workforce  investment areas in five states: California, Louisiana, New Hampshire,  Ohio, and Virginia. We selected these states to obtain a mix based on their  differences in geographic location, number of workforce investment areas,  amount of youth funding, and presence of a state youth council. In  addition, our selection was informed by recommendations from Labor,  youth policy experts, and state workforce officials. We interviewed  officials representing state and local boards, youth councils, one-stop  centers, youth-service providers, business representatives, and state and  local education agencies. We reviewed Labor\u2019s program evaluation agenda  and published guidance letters from program year 2000 to the present. We  also assessed the reliability of the performance data submitted by states in  their annual reports and compiled in Labor\u2019s WIA database known as the  Workforce Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD) by  performing checks for internal consistency, reviewing Office of Inspector  General reports and other relevant documents, and speaking with the  contractor for WIASRD. We determined that the data were not sufficiently  reliable to use for the purposes of this report.

The youth program falls under Title I   of WIA along with programs for adults and dislocated workers; Title II  deals with adult and family literacy; Title III pertains to employment  services under the Wagner-Peyser Act; and Title IV addresses vocational  rehabilitation. To better prepare low-income youth who face barriers to  employment and education, WIA requires youth programs to focus on  long-term, comprehensive services delivered year-round through a  coordinated network of service providers. In addition to meeting the low- income requirement, to be eligible for WIA services youth must be  between the ages of 14 and 21 and faced with one or more of six barriers  to employment. WIA serves both in-school and out-of-school youth. A  significant portion of out-of-school youth are high school dropouts and  unemployed youth who are struggling to succeed in the public education  system and lack financial, family, or social support. Thus, at least   30 percent of local WIA youth funds must be spent on out-of-school youth."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "WIA Youth Funding", "paragraphs": ["Since WIA\u2019s full implementation in 2000, funding for the youth program  has ranged between approximately $1 billion and $1.4 billion a year.

At the state level, the  governor can reserve up to 15 percent of the annual WIA allotment for  such statewide activities as developing the WIA strategic plan for the state.  States allocate the remaining 85 percent of funds to local boards that use  the funds to develop the local strategic plan, establish a youth council, and  award competitive contracts to youth service providers that have been  recommended by the youth council. In addition to recommending eligible  providers, the youth council coordinates youth activities in the local area,  oversees providers, and carries out other duties authorized by the local  board such as forging linkages with educational agencies. Youth councils  may also leverage additional public and private funds to supplement their  WIA funding in order to provide comprehensive youth services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Youth Services", "paragraphs": ["Once they are determined to be WIA eligible, youth receive an objective  assessment of their academic level, skills, and service needs.

Every local youth program must offer the  following 10 services, known as program elements, to eligible youth,  though participants may receive different combinations of these elements  depending on their service strategy. Labor groups the 10 required program  elements around four major themes:  1.  tutoring, study skills training, and instruction leading to completion   of secondary school, including dropout prevention,  2.  alternative school services,  Preparing for and succeeding in employment  3.  summer employment linked to academic and occupational learning,  4.  paid and unpaid work experiences, including internships and job  5.  occupational skills training,  Developing the potential of young people as citizens and leaders  6. leadership development, which may include community service and  peer-centered activities encouraging responsibility,  7.  supportive services (such as child care and housing assistance),  8.  adult mentoring for at least 12 months that may occur both during   and after program participation,  9.  follow-up upon program completion for at least 12 months, and  10.  comprehensive guidance and counseling.", "Eligible youth may obtain these services directly from approved youth  service providers or through WIA\u2019s one-stop system, which serves as a  gateway to a variety of employment and training services.

Nationally, about   70 percent of youth served were in school, according to local boards we  surveyed. However, this percentage varied across the nation, as shown in  figure 1. For example, 38 percent of youth served in South Dakota were in  school, compared with 86 percent in Nebraska.", "According to officials in four states that we visited, WIA youth programs  primarily targeted in-school youth because recruiting and retaining out-of- school youth for the WIA program was much more difficult and expensive.  For example, officials from a rural area in Ohio had difficulty identifying  and retaining out-of-school youth whose contact information changes  frequently, and Labor reports that the average cost of serving an out-of- school youth under the WIA program is about $4,000 a year, twice as much  as for an in-school youth. Officials from other local areas we visited  considered other factors. A local official in Louisiana said that in-school  youth are interested in the WIA program, unlike out-of-school youth, who  are difficult to engage. In contrast, a rural area in Virginia chose to focus  primarily on out-of-school youth because so few services were available  for this population.", "The Administration has proposed amending the WIA youth program to  focus more resources on out-of-school youth. Department of Education  officials said that WIA\u2019s services to in-school youth were not unique, since  schools already offer various services to their students to deter them from  dropping out. While Education officials said that the department\u2019s grants  geared exclusively toward dropout prevention would be insufficient to  address the national dropout problem, they also stated that funding is  available under many Education programs that could be used for dropout  prevention activities. However, local workforce and education officials  we spoke with in three states we visited said that they were either  unaware of or unable to gain access to other available federal resources  that could be used to provide intensive services to at-risk youth. In New  Hampshire, for example, officials told us that WIA provides the only  dropout prevention program, and that they were unaware of other  available education dropout prevention resources.", "State and local workforce and education officials we spoke with in the   five states we visited said that WIA funding complemented rather than  duplicated education services and was critical in preventing in-school  youth from dropping out of school. For example, in a rural area in Ohio,  workforce officials stated that the WIA program was the only dropout  prevention program and that WIA provided students with their only  chance at academic and career success. In addition, they said that WIA\u2019s  services were more intensive and comprehensive, and were delivered in a  one-on-one setting where each student received individualized attention.

As shown in figure 2, services  such as work experience and leadership development were provided fairly  equally to both youth populations, but there were differences in other  areas. For example, in-school youth were more likely to receive tutoring  services and summer employment linked to classroom learning, while out- of-school youth were more likely to receive occupational skills training  and supportive services to help prepare them for employment.", "WIA requires that summer employment programs be linked to academic  learning, and Labor guidance promotes meaningful summer enrichment  experiences to help youth attain skills throughout the school year. Local  youth programs in the five states we visited were providing youth with  various types of summer experiences. For example, a service provider in a  rural area of California enrolled in-school youth in a 6-week summer  enrichment program where students worked part-time while learning  reading skills. Another service provider in a rural area in Louisiana offered  in-school youth summer services that included academic enrichment,  community service, and exposure to different career options.", "Local youth programs provided out-of-school youth training in  occupational skills and job readiness, as well as offered them supportive  services. Labor\u2019s guidance states that enrolling youth in occupational skills  training and retaining them until program completion leads to better  outcomes. Local areas provided several different types of occupational  skills training, depending on local labor market needs. For example, one  urban local area in Ohio trained out-of-school youth in nursing, welding,  and computer repair, while another urban local area in Virginia offered  technology certification training. Local areas also provided job readiness  skills cited by employers as lacking in many youth seeking employment.  For example, a program for out-of-school youth in an urban area of Ohio  taught participants such job readiness skills as customer service, conflict  management, and other interpersonal skills. Supportive services were also  important for out-of-school youth who needed additional assistance to  help them overcome their multiple barriers to employment.

Nationwide, all but 3 percent  of local boards responding to our survey reported that their youth program  uses case managers. Local boards reported that, in addition to performing  other duties, case managers assessed youth upon enrollment in the WIA  program. These assessments typically included a review of educational  attainment, work readiness, work experience, and career interests. The  assessments are then used to develop an individual service strategy for  each youth participant.

Officials we spoke with in New Hampshire and Ohio said that  service providers or schools usually took youth on a field trip to the local  one-stop for basic orientation to expose them to employment services they  could use in the future. Although most youth were served by the WIA  program through other providers, one-stop usage varied considerably by  local area.

Officials we spoke with at  the local youth programs in all five states we visited provided such work  readiness training as punctuality, teamwork, respect for others, and  appropriate dress. In addition to identifying needed skills, businesses also  provided employment opportunities. Nationally, 34 percent of local boards  reported that businesses subsidized work experience for WIA youth. In  New Hampshire, for example, a financial services firm employed out-of- school youth and taught them about personal financial management. In  addition, an appliance-store owner, once an at-risk youth himself, hired  WIA youth and hoped to groom one of them to take over the business.

However, schools we visited  in four states shared dropout information by referring students who had  been expelled or had dropped out directly to the WIA service provider,  notified or provided contact information to the WIA provider when a  student had dropped out, or worked with the WIA program to develop a  list of dropouts. None of the schools, however, had procedures in place to  routinely connect all dropouts with local WIA programs.

In  one instance, a Virginia official in a rural area said that it was difficult to  identify sufficient numbers of qualified mentors to work with eligible  youth. In another instance, a local area official in California noted that  geographical distances within the county resulted in long commutes and  discouraged adults from mentoring youth.

However, state budgetary cuts  prevented many local areas from attending some of these forums in  person, according to an official from the sponsoring organization.  Although information and ideas shared at the Learning Exchanges were  later summarized and made available to all local areas, those that were  unable to attend missed the opportunity to network with their colleagues  and develop an action plan to take back and apply to their program.", "Labor has also supported the development of an online resource to  facilitate information sharing among local areas. The agency\u2019s Promising  Practices Web site was intended to provide a mechanism for local areas to  post and share promising workforce development practices, including  those pertaining to WIA youth programs. However, some state workforce  and regional Labor officials said that states and local areas may not even  have been aware of the site, that it has been difficult to enter practices for  inclusion, and that some users found it difficult to access the documents  described in the narrative.

Labor\u2019s national aggregation of WIA performance data for  program year 2001 indicated that the program exceeded its goals for five  of the seven youth measures. According to Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector  General (OIG), however, there is little assurance that the states\u2019  performance data for all WIA programs, including the youth program, are  either accurate or complete because of inadequate oversight of data  collection and management at the local, state, and federal levels. The OIG  also found that just 2 of 12 local areas and none of four states it reviewed  had formal policies on documentation requirements for participant  activities and outcomes. At the local level, for example, another OIG  report found that WIA youth program outcomes were adequately  documented only 37 percent of the time for a sample of 420 participants  across 14 local areas.

According to regional Labor officials,  some states had insufficient procedures in place for verifying the accuracy  of the data collected by their local areas. For example, officials in one  region said that state monitoring rarely addressed data accuracy or  included the verification of a sample of data items against original records.  In addition, some state information systems had significant flaws that  caused them to produce incorrect information, casting further doubt on  the quality of WIA performance data. For example, Ohio state officials said  they were in the process of replacing their old information system that had  caused such errors as data changing or disappearing entirely after it had  been entered in the system.", "At the federal level, Labor did not have a standard data-monitoring guide  in place, and officials in some regional offices\u2014who, according to agency  officials, are responsible for overseeing the quality of states\u2019 reported  data\u2014-said they followed their own oversight procedures. These  procedures did not usually include verifying the accuracy of a sample of  the data submitted by states. For example, an OIG report stated that while  regional offices conducted some data accuracy reviews, such as computer  edit checks, they did not verify the data\u2019s accuracy with such tests as  comparing the data with participant case files. Consistent with the OIG\u2019s  findings, officials in all six of Labor\u2019s regional offices said that they  examined state data submissions through desk reviews, which included  checking for errors such as incorrect calculation of performance  measures, extreme outliers, and miscoding of data. However, only the  Atlanta regional office checked a sample of data records against source  documentation. In its review of data records from six of the states it  oversees, the Atlanta office examined a sample of participant records  across all WIA programs from each state and found errors that affected the  calculation of one or more performance measures. In one state, for  example, 17 percent of participant records had at least one error,  compared with 83 percent of participant records in another state. The  regional office also found that two of six states it reviewed computed the  younger youth skill attainment measure incorrectly.", "Labor recognizes these problems with data reliability, but in accordance  with WIA regulations, uses states\u2019 annual performance reports\u2014-the only  reports that depict states\u2019 progress in achieving or exceeding negotiated  performance levels\u2014-to make incentive grant and sanction decisions.  States that exceed the WIA performance goals negotiated between Labor  and the states are eligible to receive incentive grants that generally range  from $750,000 to $3 million. States that fail to meet 80 percent of their  WIA performance goals for 2 years in a row are subject to sanction of up  to a 5 percent reduction in their annual WIA formula grant. However,  Labor\u2019s use of questionable performance data reported by the states may  hinder its ability to negotiate realistic performance goals and make  appropriate incentive grant and sanction decisions.

In the first year, states will be required to validate their annual reports and  data submissions for the program year 2002 period. According to agency  officials, Labor does not plan to publicly release these initial reports but  will use their findings to work with the states to correct their data  accuracy problems. In the second year, Labor will use validation reports  covering program year 2003 data to establish acceptable error rates. In the  third year, Labor will require states to meet the acceptable error rates for  their program year 2004 data submissions.

WIA  currently provides both the education and workforce systems with  strategies and resources to engage youth in academic and job training.   The opinion held by some federal education officials that WIA in-school  services overlap with existing education programs is not necessarily  seconded by officials in local areas. State and local workforce and  education officials believe WIA\u2019s educational, occupational, and support  services provide critical support and services to at-risk youth and that  without WIA\u2019s comprehensive services, schools may face an increasing  burden to keep these youth in school and ensure their academic success.  The connection between WIA youth services and schools could be made  more effective if Labor worked with Education to find ways to connect  school dropouts with local WIA youth programs.", "Since WIA\u2019s passage, Labor has provided general guidance and promising  practices in addressing implementation issues, but increased availability   of technical assistance may be necessary to overcome some of the more  difficult challenges some states and local areas face in providing youth  services.

In addition, states and local areas continue to struggle to collect  and document accurate and complete participant and performance data  and maintain data systems that can yield reasonably reliable outcome  information. For its part, Labor is taking action to improve data integrity  by requiring states to validate WIA performance data, beginning with data  from program year 2002. However, Labor\u2019s inconsistent monitoring  processes across regions will continue to challenge Labor\u2019s capability to  ensure that all states validate and report data consistently and effectively.
