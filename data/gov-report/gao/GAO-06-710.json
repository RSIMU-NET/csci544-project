Private sponsors have contracted with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide this benefit and are offering over 1,400 stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDP). Depending on where they live, beneficiaries typically have a choice of 40 to 50 PDPs, which vary in cost and coverage. MMA required each PDP sponsor to staff a toll-free call center, which serves as a key source of the information that beneficiaries need to make informed choices among PDPs. GAO examined (1) whether PDP sponsors provide prompt, courteous, and helpful service to Medicare beneficiaries and others and (2) the extent to which PDP sponsor call centers provide accurate and complete information to Medicare beneficiaries and other callers. To address these objectives, we made 900 calls to 10 of the largest PDP sponsor call centers during March 2006, posing one of five questions about their Part D plans during each call. We tracked the amount of time it took to reach a customer service representative (CSR), the number of calls that did not reach a CSR, and the appropriateness and clarity of CSRs' language. We developed criteria for determining accurate and complete responses based on CMS information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Call center service was generally prompt and courteous, and many CSRs offered helpful suggestions and information. GAO reached a representative in less than 1 minute for 46 percent of the calls CSRs fielded and in less than 5 minutes for 96 percent of the calls fielded. While GAO did not reach CSRs for 4 percent of the calls it placed, mainly because of disconnections, GAO found that 98 percent of CSRs with whom GAO spoke were easy to understand, polite, and professional. In addition, many CSRs provided helpful suggestions related to GAO's questions, such as details about a mail-order option to obtain drugs or lower-cost drugs. However, CSRs at 10 of the largest PDP sponsor call centers did not consistently provide accurate and complete responses to GAO's five questions, which GAO developed using information from CMS and other sources. GAO obtained accurate and complete responses to about one-third of the 864 calls for which GAO reached a CSR. The overall accuracy and completeness rate for each call center ranged from 20 to 60 percent. CSRs were unable to answer 15 percent of the questions posed, primarily those related to plan costs. Furthermore, CSRs within the same call center sometimes provided inconsistent answers. For example, in response to questions about PDP cost comparisons for specified sets of drugs, CSRs at 3 call centers told GAO that it was against the sponsors' policies to identify any of their plans as lowest cost. However, other CSRs at each of these call centers did not cite this policy and did identify a plan as lowest cost. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS criticized the analysis as based on inaccurate, incomplete, and subjective methods that limit the report's relevance and validity. GAO maintains that its methods are sound and its findings are accurate. CMS officials told GAO at a May 2006 meeting that CSRs should have been able to accurately answer the questions GAO posed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) established a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit,  2003 (MMA) established a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit,  known as Medicare Part D, beginning January 1, 2006.

For drugs subject to prior authorization,  beneficiaries need approval from their PDP before they can fill their  prescription and for drugs subject to quantity limits, the plan limits the  amount of the drug it covers over a certain period of time. For drugs  subject to step therapy, the PDP requires that the beneficiary first try a  less expensive drug for their condition before it will cover the  beneficiary\u2019s prescribed drug.

As noted in the draft report, we  selected topics that were addressed in the Frequently Asked Questions  section of the Medicare.gov Web site and regarded by policy experts and  beneficiary advocates as important to making an informed plan choice.  Furthermore, at a May 2006 meeting with CMS officials, the agency\u2019s  Deputy Administrator stated that CSRs should be able to accurately  answer all of the specific questions we posed during the study.", "CMS also stated that we asked for information that CSRs are not required  to provide. Specifically, for questions 1 and 2 on PDP comparisons for low  and high-utilization beneficiaries, CMS stated that it does not require  sponsor call centers to provide information on the annual costs of their  PDPs. However, while not necessarily required, agency officials had  indicated that the information we sought from CSRs was within the scope  of plan sponsor customer service efforts. In a discussion held before we  conducted our March calls, CMS officials told us that the agency had not  established any requirements regarding the specific types of information  plan CSRs must be able to provide, but that it was reasonable to expect  CSRs to give callers accurate information on the topics we included in our  review.", "In addition, as noted in the draft report, some call centers were relatively  successful in providing accurate and complete answers to questions 1 and  2, indicating that call center CSRs can handle such questions  appropriately. One call center\u2019s CSRs answered the question accurately  and completely in 88 percent of the calls for the low-utilization  beneficiary, and one call center\u2019s CSRs responded correctly in 81 percent  of the calls for the high-utilization beneficiary. In addition, we found that 7  of the 10 PDP sponsors had cost calculators on their Web sites that could  have been used to answer these questions.", "CMS commented that, to be counted as providing a complete response to  questions 1 and 2 on PDP comparisons, we expected CSRs to recommend  a specific plan to the caller, a practice that often constitutes \u201csteering,\u201d  which is prohibited under Medicare marketing guidance. As noted in the  draft report, our callers identified themselves as family members wishing  to assist beneficiaries in choosing a drug plan. Providing assistance to  beneficiaries\u2014which is encouraged by CMS\u2014generally consists of  learning the characteristics of various PDPs and assessing their relative  merits given the potential enrollee\u2019s needs. This is clearly allowed in CMS\u2019s  Marketing Guidelines, which distinguish between assistance based on  objective information and steering to a drug plan for financial gain.", "CMS also took issue with how we counted a specific CSR response to  questions 1 and 2. The agency incorrectly claimed that a CSR\u2019s referral to  1-800-MEDICARE was categorized as an incomplete response. As noted in  the draft report, we categorized responses as incomplete if the CSR  accurately named the lowest annual cost plan, but either inaccurately  calculated or could not provide the annual cost. If the CSR did not answer  the question and instead referred the caller to 1-800-MEDICARE for  information on PDPs, we classified the response as \u201cno answer provided.\u201d", "CMS stated that the wording of question 3 on the low-income subsidy was  inaccurate and therefore misleading. This question specifies that the  beneficiary automatically qualifies for extra help because Medicaid pays  part of her Medicare premiums. According to CMS, the wording of  question 3 is incorrect because only Medicare pays the drug premium for  low-income beneficiaries and Medicaid would fully (not partly) pay the  Part B premium. However, CMS\u2019s comment conflicts with the information  we obtained from its Medicare.gov Web site in developing the wording and  answer for this question. Using the Web-based PDP finder tool on this Web  site, the user can select one of several options specifying why the  beneficiary qualified for extra help. We selected the option specifying that  the beneficiary automatically qualified for extra help because they receive  \u201chelp from  State paying Medicare premiums.\u201d We agree that only  Medicare, and not Medicaid, pays the Medicare Part D premium for low- income beneficiaries and Medicaid would fully (not partly) pay the Part B  premium. Therefore, for such a beneficiary, Medicaid would pay part of  the beneficiary\u2019s Medicare premiums.", "CMS also stated that, for certain questions, many reasonable answers were  not counted as correct. The agency cited our question regarding a  beneficiary\u2019s options should he or she be prescribed a nonformulary drug,  and asserted that our criteria for a correct response\u2014switching to a  covered drug or asking for an exception\u2014was too limited. The agency  stated that other reasonable answers should have been counted as correct  because we conducted our calls at a time when all plans covered all Part D  drugs. We obtained the answer to this question from a script that CMS  approved for use by CSRs operating its 1-800-MEDICARE help line. In  addition to the two options we used as criteria for an accurate and  complete answer, the script mentioned that PDPs are required to provide  beneficiaries with temporary transitional coverage (generally for 30 days  after enrollment) of drugs not on the PDP\u2019s formulary. However, according  to CMS, the purpose of this temporary coverage is to provide beneficiaries  with sufficient time to switch to another drug or to request an exception to  the formulary. Therefore, in specifying our criteria for an accurate and  complete answer, we chose to include only the two options that CMS sees  as longer-term solutions for the beneficiary.", "CMS stated that we did not examine certain features of the support  services that plan sponsors\u2019 call centers are required to provide, such as  hours of operation, wait times, disconnection rates, and language services.  It also noted requirements that plans report a range of performance  measures, such as beneficiary complaint rates and timeliness of  exceptions and appeals decisions.
