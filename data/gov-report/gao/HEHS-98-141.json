Three-quarters of those teenage mothers were unmarried. Families started by teenagers received an estimated $39 billion in federal assistance in fiscal year 1995 through programs such as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), Medicaid, Food Stamps, and others. Teenage parenting also has implications for the health and well-being of the mother and the child. Studies have shown that the children of teen mothers are at greater risk for lower birth weights, lower cognitive scores, and school failure. Studies also show that children of teen mothers have a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves. We reported in 1994 that a significant percentage of teen mothers who receive welfare do not have high school diplomas and tend to have larger families\u2014characteristics associated with longer stays on welfare.", "Recognizing the importance of this issue, the Congress, federal and state governments, and the private sector are encouraging and implementing initiatives to prevent teen pregnancies and births. The Congress recently enacted welfare reform legislation that contains provisions directed at reducing out-of-wedlock childbearing and welfare dependency and promoting abstinence education. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is developing a national strategy to prevent teen pregnancy; state and local governments are implementing new strategies that they believe hold promise for addressing the problem; and private entities, such as the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, are supporting actions related to teenage childbearing. A better understanding of the characteristics of teen mothers and antecedents of teen motherhood could help these efforts as public and private entities try to develop and implement more effective prevention strategies.", "Because of the impact of teen pregnancies and births and your interest in teen mothers and their children, you asked us to provide social and demographic information about teen mothers. Specifically, we agreed to (1) show the trends in birth rates for teens; (2) provide a profile of teen mothers; and (3) identify factors, such as education or family background, that may influence the likelihood of teen motherhood. To provide this information, we relied on national birth certificate data and the most current analyses of four nationally representative surveys: the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), and the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA).
