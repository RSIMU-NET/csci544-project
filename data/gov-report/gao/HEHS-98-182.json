Today, about half a million children are in foster care, and many of them have been in the system for years. The mid-1980s also marked the onset of the crack-cocaine epidemic. More recently, the use of other hard drugs such as methamphetamines and heroin has been on the rise in some parts of the country. Research suggests that the escalating use of hard drugs has contributed to the growth in the foster care population. While we know that children often enter foster care because of neglect associated with parental substance abuse, little information exists on the effect parental substance abuse has on how and when children leave the system. Because of concerns about children languishing in foster care, the Congress recently enacted legislation that places a greater emphasis on adoptions for children who cannot be safely returned to their parents in a timely manner.", "Because of your concern that children whose parents abuse drugs or alcohol may remain in foster care for long periods of time before they are placed in a safe, permanent home, you asked us to provide information on (1) the extent and characteristics of parental substance abuse among foster care cases, (2) the difficulties foster agencies face in making timely permanency decisions for foster children with substance abusing parents, and (3) initiatives that address reunifying families or achieving other permanency outcomes in a timely manner for foster children whose parents are substance abusers.", "Data on the extent and characteristics of parental substance abuse among foster care cases are limited. To obtain such information, we developed and administered a questionnaire that was completed by caseworkers for random samples of foster care cases in California and Illinois that were in the system as of June 1, 1997, and had been in continuously since at least March 1, 1997. Together, these two states account for about one-quarter of the nation\u2019s foster care population. To provide information about the difficulties foster care agencies might have making timely permanency decisions for foster care cases involving parental substance abuse, we conducted case studies of foster care programs in Los Angeles County, California; Cook County, Illinois; and Orleans Parish, Louisiana. We focused on these three urban counties because they have large foster care caseloads and large populations of substance abusers. We selected these particular counties because they provide a geographic mix and have foster care laws or initiatives that address parental substance abuse and permanency decisionmaking. In each of our case study locations, we interviewed foster care program and policy officials, caseworkers, dependency court judges and attorneys, and drug treatment providers. At each location, we also reviewed the files for a small number of foster care cases with different outcomes, each involving parental substance abuse. We conducted our fieldwork in compliance with generally accepted government auditing standards between April 1997 and June 1998. Our scope and methodology are discussed further in appendix I. Appendix II contains the questionnaire that we used to collect data on the extent and characteristics of parental substance abuse among foster care cases, and appendix III contains the survey results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Foster care laws and regulations have historically emphasized the importance of both reunifying families and achieving permanency for children in a timely manner. Permanency outcomes from foster care include family reunification, adoption, and legal guardianship. The Congress recently enacted legislation that places a greater emphasis on adoption when foster children cannot be safely returned to their parents in a timely manner. Failing to secure a safe, permanent home for foster children before they reach age 18\u2014sometimes referred to as aging out of the foster care system\u2014can have damaging consequences for their emotional stability and future self-sufficiency.", "Although federal law requires states to make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to reunify foster children with their parents, neither federal laws nor regulations clearly define \u201creasonable efforts.\u201d At a minimum, the law does require states to develop a case plan with a permanency goal. When family reunification is the goal, the case plan must describe the services\u2014such as drug or alcohol treatment, counseling, or parenting classes\u2014that will be provided to help parents rectify the problems or conditions that led to their children entering foster care. In order to evaluate the progress that parents have made in complying with their case plan requirements, states are required to hold court or administrative reviews every 6 months. They also must hold permanency planning hearings at which the judge must determine whether to continue family reunification efforts or begin to pursue some other permanency goal, such as adoption or guardianship. In determining if and when to end efforts to reunify the family, foster care agencies and the courts must balance the goals of reunifying children with their parents and meeting children\u2019s need for timely permanency.", "The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-89) emphasizes that a child\u2019s health and safety are of paramount concern by specifying situations in which states do not have to make reasonable efforts to reunify the family before parental rights can be terminated. This law also stresses the importance of securing safe, permanent homes for children in a timely manner by (1) requiring states to file a petition to terminate parental rights (TPR) if the child has been in foster care for at least 15 of the most recent 22 months, (2) shortening from 18 to 12 months the time period within which a permanency planning hearing must be held, and (3) providing incentive payments to states for increasing the number of foster children who are adopted. This law also authorizes funds for time-limited family reunification efforts.", "Currently, data on foster care outcomes\u2014including family reunification rates\u2014and length of stay in foster care are limited. A longitudinal study of foster care outcomes in California found that, while 44 percent of children who entered foster care in 1990 as infants were reunified with their families within 4 years, 37 percent were still in care after 4 years.This study also showed that foster care outcomes vary by placement type, age at entry, and ethnicity. Data on how parental substance abuse may affect the length of time children spend in foster care and their outcomes are particularly limited. However, Illinois reported that the percentage of foster children who were reunified with their families dropped between 1990 and 1995, which foster care agency officials attribute to the \u201cepidemic level of parental drug abuse.\u201d Parental substance abuse may also result in children re-entering foster care. The California study cited above found that among those who were reunified with their families, 28 percent re-entered foster care within 3 years. This study found that parental substance abuse was particularly common among cases in which children had re-entered foster care.", "Research suggests that children who spend long periods of time in foster care, or age out of the system before a permanency outcome has been achieved, may have emotional, behavioral, or educational problems that can adversely affect their future well-being and self-sufficiency. A study of the title IV-E foster care independent living program, which assists children in their transition from foster care to self-sufficiency, found that about 2-1/2 to 4 years after aging out of the system, 46 percent of foster children had not completed high school; 38 percent had not held a job for longer than 1 year; 25 percent had been homeless for at least 1 night; and 60 percent of those who were female had given birth to a child. Furthermore, 40 percent had been on public assistance, incarcerated, or a cost to the community in some other way.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is responsible for the management and oversight of federal programs providing services to foster children. HHS issues federal foster care regulations, monitors states\u2019 compliance with them, and administers federal funding. Federal foster care funds are authorized under title IV-E of the Social Security Act of 1935. Title IV-E is an uncapped entitlement program that reimburses states for a portion of the maintenance cost for foster children whose parents meet federal eligibility criteria related to their income level. Federal expenditures for the administration and maintenance of children eligible for title IV-E funding increased from about $546 million in 1985 to an estimated $3.3 billion in 1997. States and counties must bear the full cost for maintaining foster children who are not eligible for title IV-E funding.", "Children are exiting foster care at a slower rate than they are entering. As a result, the foster care population nationwide has nearly doubled since the mid-1980s, increasing from about 276,000 in 1985 to about 500,000 in 1997. Following the advent of crack-cocaine in the mid-1980s, cocaine use increased dramatically and reached alarming proportions by the end of the 1980s. Research indicates that the \u201ccrack epidemic\u201d may have contributed to the increase in foster care caseloads. We reported that, in 1991, nearly two-thirds of foster children 36 months of age or younger in Los Angeles County, New York City, and Philadelphia County combined were known to have been prenatally exposed to drugs or alcohol. Most of them were exposed to cocaine. Although research indicates that the number of new crack-cocaine users is declining, chronic use among parents of foster children is still common.", "While crack-cocaine use is declining, the use of other hard drugs is on the rise. Methamphetamine use has been growing, particularly in the West and Southwest, and there is a resurgence of heroin use throughout much of the country. Heroin\u2019s growing popularity may stem from its sharply increased availability; decreased cost; and higher purity level, in a form that does not need to be injected. Both crystallized methamphetamines and crack-cocaine are inexpensive, smokable drugs that produce immediate and intense highs and increased alertness.", "In March 1998, we reported that major studies have shown that drug treatment is beneficial, although concerns about the validity of self-reported data suggest that the degree of success may be overstated.Nonetheless, substantial numbers of clients do report reductions in drug use and criminal activity following treatment. Research also indicates that those who remain in treatment for longer periods generally have better treatment outcomes. Methadone maintenance has been shown to be the most effective approach for treating heroin abuse. Research on the best treatment approach or setting for other groups of drug abusers, however, is less definitive. To date, there is no effective pharmacological treatment for cocaine abuse, but studies have shown that several cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches show promise for treating cocaine addiction. Little is known about the effectiveness of treating methamphetamine addiction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Parental Substance Abuse Is Prevalent Among Foster Care Cases and Makes Reunifying Families Extremely Difficult", "paragraphs": ["According to our survey, most children in foster care in California and Illinois had at least one parent with a serious and long-standing substance abuse problem that makes recovery extremely difficult. Most of these parents had been abusing drugs or alcohol for 5 years or more. About two-thirds of these parents had used one or more hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or methamphetamines. These hard drugs are highly addictive and debilitating and can greatly diminish the ability to parent. These substance-abusing parents often neglect their children because their primary focus is obtaining and using drugs. In addition, substance abusers often engage in criminal activity that can threaten the safety and well-being of their children.

(See fig. 1.) In about 40 percent of these cases in each state the father was required to undergo drug or alcohol treatment, while the mother was required to undergo treatment in over 90 percent of these cases in each state. In about one-third of the cases involving parental substance abuse in each state, either the father was deceased or his whereabouts were unknown. As a result, the mother was usually the focus of the foster care agency\u2019s family reunification efforts.

Alcohol was often used in combination with one or more of the hard drugs mentioned above, although alcohol abuse alone was much less common in both states. Less than 10 percent of the substance-abusing mothers in each state used only alcohol. In some instances, substance-abusing parents in each state were using marijuana.", "According to our survey, substance-abusing parents of foster children not only abused hard drugs but most had been doing so for a long time.

Cocaine was most often the drug of choice among substance-abusing mothers of foster children in each state. We identified some variation in other drugs of choice, by state. Methamphetamines were often the drug of choice among the substance-abusing mothers of foster children in California but were seldom used by mothers in Illinois. Heroin was the drug of choice for about 10 percent of substance-abusing mothers in each state. (See fig. 3.) Foster care agency officials and drug treatment providers in all three of our case study locations believed that heroin use was on the rise among parents of foster children within their jurisdictions.", "Parents who use hard drugs may be unable to meet even the basic needs of their children. Their use of hard drugs can lead to erratic behavior that places the safety and well-being of their children at risk. For example, the immediate effects of both crack-cocaine and crystallized methamphetamines include hyperstimulation and an amplified sense of euphoria. Crack-cocaine users may also experience feelings of depression, restlessness, irritability, and anxiety, and prolonged use can lead to paranoid behavior. Because the high produced by crystallized methamphetamines can last between 8 and 24 hours, when the effects wear off, users go into a deep sleep that can last for several days. Users sometimes are susceptible to psychological problems including depression, paranoia, and hallucinations. In extreme cases, methamphetamine use may also lead to suicidal tendencies and violent outbursts. Heroin and other opiates tend to relax the user, but users may also experience restlessness, nausea, and vomiting. Heroin causes users to go back and forth from feeling alert to feeling drowsy. With very large doses of heroin, users can become unconscious and, in some cases, may die.", "A foster care case we reviewed illustrates the extreme effect drug abuse can have on parents\u2019 ability to care for their children. A mother with a long history of abusing crack-cocaine and other hard drugs reportedly pointed a gun at her two daughters and threatened to kill them and herself. The child this case pertains to had marks on her body from physical abuse she had suffered at the hands of her mother. She was removed from her mother\u2019s custody and never reunified with her. This child was quoted in the case file as saying that \u201ccocaine took over her  mind\u2014she used to be a good mother.\u201d A more detailed description of this case, and the other cases we reviewed, is contained in appendix IV.", "Most children with substance-abusing parents enter foster care because their parents fail to meet their basic physical and emotional needs. In both California and Illinois, neglect was the primary reason for entry into foster care in over 80 percent of the foster care cases in our survey involving parental substance abuse. Physical and sexual abuse were far less often the reason for entry, together accounting for only about 14 percent of the cases involving parental substance abuse in California and 7 percent in Illinois. Because of the nature of addiction, obtaining and using drugs or alcohol are the most important focus in the lives of substance abusers. As a consequence, the safety and well-being of their children is often secondary to their addiction. Research suggests that substance-abusing parents of children in foster care do not always form healthy emotional attachments with their children and may have limited parenting skills.These parents may abandon their children at birth or sometime later in their lives, be periodically absent from the home, or leave their children in unsafe environments. According to our survey, in both California and Illinois, over 80 percent of the foster children with substance-abusing parents had at least one other sibling who was also in foster care as of September 15, 1997.", "We found many examples of neglect associated with drug abuse in the cases we reviewed. In one case, the mother\u2019s crack-cocaine use caused her to leave her children for the night with unrelated adults after telling them she would return in only a few minutes. In another case, the mother left her children with her brother, who also abused drugs, while she went out to sell diapers, cigarettes, bus tokens, and food stamps in order to buy cocaine. In a third case, after the family was evicted from its apartment, the mother left her three children with a friend. They had not seen their mother for about 2 weeks when the friend contacted the foster care agency.", "Finally, when parents abuse illicit drugs, they also expose their children to crime. In addition to purchasing illicit drugs, substance abusers sometimes engage in criminal activity such as theft, prostitution, and drug sales to support their habits. In both California and Illinois, over one-third of the foster care cases in our survey that involved parental substance abuse also involved some type of criminal activity by at least one of the parents around the time of the child\u2019s foster care episode. Children whose parents abuse illicit drugs also sometimes witness, or are the victims of, violence. For example, in a case we reviewed, the mother, who was pregnant and abusing cocaine, was attacked by drug dealers for allegedly stealing drugs. This attack exposed her unborn child to considerable physical harm, and the infant had to be delivered by emergency cesarean section as a result of the attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recovery From Drug and Alcohol Addiction Depends on Many Factors and Relapse Is Common", "paragraphs": ["According to research on drug and alcohol treatment, the potential for recovery depends on many factors, including the types of substances used, the length of time they are used, readiness for recovery, access to appropriate treatment, and the length of time in treatment. In addition, other problems, such as mental illness, medical conditions, and a criminal lifestyle can greatly complicate the recovery process. Treatment providers we spoke with said that some drug addicts or alcoholics may not be ready to recover until they \u201chit bottom\u201d or recognize that they can no longer continue their drug or alcohol abusing lifestyle. According to HHS officials, placement of their children in foster care is often the \u201cbottoming out\u201d experience needed to get parents into treatment for their substance abuse problems. Some treatment providers believe that, regardless of whether or not a parent has hit bottom, effectively engaging the addict in treatment is key to recovery.", "Many experts believe that a successful course of drug treatment involves a continuum of treatment approaches and services. Women with children often need intensive treatment because their fear of losing custody of their children often prevents them from seeking treatment on their own. As a consequence, by the time they come to the attention of the child welfare system their addiction is usually far advanced. In addition, according to HHS, informed sources generally believe that treatment for women must address issues unique to women, such as sexual abuse, domestic violence, child care, and health problems.", "Recovery from drug and alcohol addiction is generally characterized, by drug treatment professionals, as a difficult and lifelong process that frequently involves periods of relapse. According to some treatment experts, relapse is a stage in the recovery process that indicates progress toward recovery when it is accompanied by increasing periods of abstinence from drugs or alcohol. Brief relapses may enable recovering addicts to understand what triggers their return to drugs and help them develop ways to prevent future relapses.", "Among substance-abusing mothers in our survey whose children had been in foster care for at least 1 year, about 40 percent of these mothers in each state had entered treatment programs but failed to complete them, usually because of relapse. In some instances, mental illness, incarceration, or medical conditions were cited as the reasons these mothers had failed to complete treatment.", "The following case we reviewed illustrates how difficult the recovery process is for parents who abuse drugs. This case involved one of six children. He and most of his siblings were known to have been prenatally exposed to cocaine. As a result of neglect related to his mother\u2019s crack-cocaine and alcohol abuse, he entered foster care shortly after birth. His mother also had a criminal record, having been convicted of felony theft and misdemeanor drug possession, and had been incarcerated for probation violations. The identity of the father was unknown. His mother successfully complied with most of the requirements in the case plan for reunification\u2014including visitation, a parenting class, and family therapy. However, about 2 years after this child entered foster care, his mother was dropped from a drug treatment program for lack of attendance. About that time, the permanency goal was changed from family reunification to long-term foster care. Over the next few years, the mother entered treatment several additional times but failed to complete any of these programs. About 3 months prior to the birth of his youngest sibling, the mother entered a 12-month residential treatment program, which she successfully completed. Because of her success in treatment, the child who was the focus of this case was returned to his mother for several trial visits after spending about 7 years in foster care. However, the mother subsequently failed several drug tests, indicating she had relapsed. At the time we reviewed the case, this child was still in foster care after almost 8 years.", "Although many parents, like the mother in this example, are unable to make sufficient progress toward recovery to regain custody of their children after many years, caseworkers and drug treatment providers told us that some parents, even those with long histories of substance abuse, do recover and are able to provide a safe home for their children. Another case we reviewed involved the third oldest of five children. He entered foster care when he was 6 years old after his mother gave birth to her youngest and third prenatally cocaine-exposed child. The mother had a 14-year history of substance abuse and had previously come to the attention of the child welfare agency in the mid-1980s for medical neglect of one of her older children. She was unemployed, and the father was incarcerated at the time the children were placed in foster care. Despite the complicated family situation, the mother successfully complied with all of the case plan requirements during this child\u2019s foster care episode. She spent about 1 month in a women\u2019s residential treatment program and another month in an outpatient program and participated in follow-up drug treatment support groups. She visited this child as prescribed in the case plan, attended parenting classes and counseling sessions, and obtained subsidized housing. The child was returned to his mother on a trial basis about 16 months after he entered foster care. About 21 months after this child entered foster care, his mother was granted permanent custody, and this case was closed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Foster Care Agencies Face Many Challenges in Achieving Timely Permanency When Parental Substance Abuse Is Involved", "paragraphs": ["In cases involving parental substance abuse, foster care agencies face several challenges when attempting to secure permanent homes for foster children in a timely manner.

We learned at our case study locations that many parents who are substance abusers resist entering treatment. To parents, caseworkers represent the agency that took their children from them. As a result, many parents feel considerable anger toward caseworkers and anxiety about interacting with them, which can deter parents from entering treatment and delay their progress in fulfilling case plan requirements. Furthermore, according to drug and alcohol treatment providers and attorneys, some caseworkers lack sufficient understanding of the nature of drug and alcohol addiction, its role in individual foster care cases, and what they can do to help motivate parents to address their substance abuse problems.", "Among substance-abusing mothers in our survey whose children had been in foster care for at least 1 year, less than 20 percent in each state had either completed treatment or were currently in a treatment program. In California, about half of the remaining mothers had never entered treatment and about half had failed to complete it; in Illinois, a greater portion of the remaining mothers had failed to complete treatment than had never entered treatment. (See fig. 4.) Many factors influence whether an individual enters and completes treatment, including individual readiness for recovery.", "High caseloads and turnover among caseworkers make it even harder for caseworkers to help substance-abusing parents comply with their case plans. Several caseworkers we spoke with said it is an ongoing challenge to meet the needs of these families, particularly because foster care caseworkers operate in a crisis-management mode.", "We learned at the locations we visited that foster care agencies may have limited familiarity with treatment resources in the community, which can delay parents\u2019 entry into drug or alcohol treatment programs. Experts believe that if entry into treatment is delayed, parents may lose the motivation to recover that the loss of custody of their children provided. Caseworkers said that they do not always know what treatment programs exist in the community, or whether there are slots available in these programs. As a result, parents are sometimes provided with a referral list that contains treatment programs that are no longer in operation or do not have immediate openings. A parent\u2019s entry into treatment and progress toward recovery can also be delayed while various treatment programs are contacted to find an opening or place the parent on a waiting list.", "Caseworkers and judges alike told us that a full array of alcohol and drug treatment settings is not available in some communities. Many parents either are referred to or find it much easier to access less costly outpatient treatment programs because funding for residential treatment programs is limited. Although research has shown that outpatient treatment can be as effective as extended residential care, some treatment providers said that many mothers whose children are in foster care require some period of residential treatment to stabilize before being referred for outpatient care.", "Experts on drug treatment generally believe that, following either residential or outpatient treatment, recovering parents need after-care services. According to treatment providers in our case study locations, after-care services related to drug and alcohol treatment are particularly important in foster care cases in which timely permanency decisions are being emphasized. These services, however, are not always provided to parents with children in foster care. After-care services for these parents might include ongoing caseworker visits to follow up with parents after they have been reunified with their children, to ensure their participation in self-help groups, and to provide referrals for additional social services. According to some agency officials, if after-care is not provided to parents who have completed drug treatment, judges may delay reunifying them with their children. These families often live in drug-infested neighborhoods. Without after-care services, these parents may be more likely to relapse, and their children may be more likely to re-enter foster care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Foster Care Agencies Face Challenges in Monitoring Parents\u2019 Progress in Treatment", "paragraphs": ["Another challenge facing foster care agencies arises from the problems in monitoring parents\u2019 progress in drug or alcohol treatment. Detailed information on parents\u2019 progress in treatment is not always available to judges when determining whether a family should be reunified, reunification efforts should continue, or some other permanency goal should be pursued. This information may not always be provided to judges because foster care agencies do not always communicate regularly with treatment providers. Judges told us about instances in which permanency decisions were delayed because attorneys did not have access to the treatment provider\u2019s records of the parent\u2019s participation or because reports from the caseworkers did not include sufficient information about the parent\u2019s progress in treatment. Again, high caseloads and turnover among both caseworkers and attorneys exacerbate the problem. Caseworkers may have limited time to discuss in detail a parent\u2019s progress with the treatment provider, just as attorneys may have limited time to review reports on parents\u2019 progress in treatment in advance of a permanency hearing. Confidentiality requirements to protect the privacy of clients in drug or alcohol treatment may also interfere with obtaining information about parents\u2019 progress in treatment. Some foster care agencies ask parents, before they enter treatment, for their written consent to obtain information on their progress in treatment. If agencies do not obtain written consent, a court order may be needed to access this information.", "When information on parents\u2019 progress in treatment is not sufficiently detailed or not provided on a timely basis, permanency decisionmaking may be delayed because the judge does not know if it is safe to return children to the custody of their parents. Because relapse is common, judges also need information about the significance of any relapses in terms of the parents\u2019 overall progress toward recovery. For example, providing results of periodic, random drug tests may indicate a brief relapse followed by a long period of abstinence, indicating overall reduced drug use. In addition, without this information, parents are able to manipulate or \u201cgame\u201d the system, and judges may not be able to determine when laws on permanency decisionmaking for cases involving parental substance abuse apply. Furthermore, judges may have difficulty determining if agencies have made reasonable efforts to help reunify the family.", "Manipulative behavior was described by child welfare officials and treatment providers as often characteristic of addicts who are consumed by their need to use drugs and alcohol. When parents are aware that their progress in treatment is not being closely monitored, they may falsely claim to be in treatment and making progress in an attempt to prevent the court from moving toward terminating their parental rights. Caseworkers also told us that parents sometimes try to manipulate the system to extend the period during which the permanency goal is family reunification by entering treatment just before hearings, only to drop out of treatment immediately after. A treatment provider characterized this behavior as a negative consequence of how permanency decisions have historically been made. These parents are often aware that, in the past, years have elapsed before some permanency decisions were made because the period of family reunification was extended, thereby providing parents with additional opportunities to recover from their addictions and regain custody of their children.", "Judges also need information about parents\u2019 progress in drug treatment, as well as their drug abuse and treatment history, to determine when existing state laws governing permanency decisionmaking in these cases apply. Thirty states have laws specifying that parental substance abuse is either a consideration in or grounds for terminating parental rights, and a number of states are very specific in how they address permanency decisionmaking for cases involving parental substance abuse. For example, California law does not require foster care agencies to offer reunification services if the parent has a serious and longstanding substance abuse problem and has resisted treatment during the previous 3 years or has failed or refused treatment at least twice. Illinois law does not require the foster care agency to make efforts to reunify the family if the foster child is at least the second child of that parent to have been prenatally substance-exposed and the mother had been given the opportunity to participate in treatment when the first child was prenatally exposed. State laws on permanency decisionmaking for foster care cases involving parental substance abuse are discussed further in appendix V.", "Given the lack of consensus as to what constitutes reasonable efforts to help reunify families, judges also need detailed information about what foster care agencies have done to help parents recover from their drug or alcohol addictions in order to determine whether reasonable efforts have been made. According to some officials, if judges do not have sufficient information to determine whether reasonable efforts have been made, they may extend the family reunification period. When drug and alcohol treatment resources are limited within a community and this delays a parent\u2019s entry into drug treatment, foster care agencies may also hesitate to begin proceedings to terminate parental rights."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers Hinder Foster Care Agencies\u2019 Ability to Quickly Achieve Adoption or Guardianship", "paragraphs": ["When family reunification efforts fail, foster care agencies face several barriers to quickly achieving adoption or guardianship in cases involving parental substance abuse. Before parental rights can be terminated,foster care agencies are required to attempt to locate any parents whose whereabouts are unknown, notify parents of the court\u2019s intent to terminate their parental rights, and provide reunification services to parents who are located and interested in regaining custody. The whereabouts of substance abusing parents\u2014particularly fathers\u2014are often unknown, perhaps because they lack a stable residence, are involved in drug-related activity themselves, or are incarcerated. In addition, mothers sometimes try to delay proceedings to terminate their parental rights by identifying the probable father just before a TPR hearing. Consequently, foster care agencies often overlook fathers and their extended families as potential adoptive resources, according to one judge, because the whereabouts of fathers are so often unknown. Termination of parental rights also may be delayed when a parent for whom reunification services must be provided is incarcerated or repeatedly disappears, which is common among foster care cases involving parental substance abuse. This can disrupt the provision of reunification services, and parents may then appeal a decision to terminate parental rights on the grounds that the agency failed to make reasonable efforts to reunify the family.", "Health problems of foster children can be another barrier to adoption. In a prior study we found that over half of the young foster children in selected locations in 1991 had serious health problems\u2014such as fetal alcohol syndrome, developmental delays, and HIV\u2014which may have been caused or compounded by prenatal substance exposure. However, some experts believe that caution should be used when predicting adverse developmental outcomes on the basis of prenatal substance exposure because these outcomes are greatly affected by the quality of health care and the developmental supports the child receives and the social environment that the child is exposed to. Other barriers to adoption include the age of the child and behavioral and emotional problems that many children have as a result of abuse or neglect.", "Placement of foster children with relatives may also present a barrier to adoption in cases involving parental substance abuse. In both California and Illinois, we found that over half of the foster children in our survey with substance-abusing parents were placed with relatives. In these cases, when reunification efforts were discontinued and the permanency goal was changed to something other than adoption, the reason often given for not pursuing adoption was that the relatives with whom the child was placed did not want to adopt the child. There are many different reasons why relatives, in general, might not want to adopt these children. According to some foster care caseworkers and agency officials, relatives may fear that if they adopt these children, the parents will no longer be motivated to recover. Relatives may also fear the damage that terminating parental rights will have on their own relationship with the parents of these children. Relatives may also be reluctant to assume legal guardianship of the children placed with them without financial assistance to help support them.", "Adoption staff at our case study locations also raised concerns regarding the limited number of adoptive homes that may be available in these cases, although they believed current outreach and recruitment efforts might help increase the number of potential adoptive homes, particularly if children were freed for adoption when they were younger. Demand for adoptive resources, however, is likely to increase because many foster care cases involving parental substance abuse have been in the system for long periods of time, and states are now required to begin legal proceedings to terminate parental rights in large numbers of these cases. Among the cases in our survey involving parental substance abuse in which family reunification was no longer the goal, children had been in foster care for an average of about 5-1/2 years in California and over 4 years in Illinois. (See table III.5 in app. III.)", "On the basis of our survey, we estimate that about 61,700 children in California and 43,100 in Illinois had been in foster care for at least 17 months as of September 15, 1997, and in each state, over 60 percent had parents who were substance abusers.

This same child had been placed in foster care for a brief period of time prior to this episode while her mother was incarcerated on drug-related charges. During this foster care episode, which began with the abandonment in the hospital, she was placed with a foster family. Her mother was subsequently incarcerated again for 2 years. The mother\u2019s history of criminal convictions and incarcerations included a felony conviction for drug possession.

Her substance abuse problems continued to escalate during this foster care episode to a point at which, according to a family member, she was reportedly using cocaine every day. His father was uninvolved and failed to maintain any contact with the child welfare agency.

Further, the child\u2019s oldest brother was experiencing behavioral and emotional problems in this placement that were serious enough to warrant placing him temporarily in a residential treatment center when he threatened to commit suicide. This older brother was later returned to the home of the paternal aunt. In the meantime, his mother failed to comply with any of the requirements for family reunification. Although records indicate that she entered several residential and outpatient treatment programs, she did not stay in any program for a sustained period of time. Her visits with the children were described by the paternal aunt as typically unannounced, disruptive, and upsetting to the children.

Two of his siblings\u2014one older and one younger\u2014reportedly died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
