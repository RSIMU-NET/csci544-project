A substantial majority of that debt is issued in the form of marketable Treasury securities. U.S. Savings Bonds today account for about 3 percent of total Treasury securities outstanding. A majority of these bonds have lower minimum denominations or face amounts than marketable Treasury securities and generally pay lower interest rates as well, but provide the same assurance of the full faith and credit of the United States, making them an alternative for investors unable or unwilling to pay the minimum denominations of marketable Treasury securities. Savings bonds continue to be issued as paper certificates, rather than in the format of the \"book entry\" system for marketable Treasury securities; however, this increases the administrative costs of issuing, servicing, and redeeming savings bonds, relative to the marketable securities. The cost-effectiveness of the savings bond program depends on whether Treasury's savings--in terms of the generally lower interest payments on savings bonds relative to marketable Treasury securities--exceed the costs that Treasury incurs with processing the paper savings bond certificates. The question is complicated by the fact that the interest savings occur over the life of a savings bond, and that Treasury pays costs upfront at issuance and in the future when the savings bond is redeemed. As prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget and common financial practice, in dealing with savings or costs over time, the value of future savings or costs must be discounted to present value. Treasury has reported that its cost-effectiveness model does calculate the present values of the relative costs of savings bonds and marketable Treasury securities. However, because of flaws in the design and implementation of the spreadsheet used to calculate these present values, the cost-effectiveness model's results do not provide the Bureau of the Public Debt, Treasury, or Congress with accurate information that is needed to assess the relative costs of issuing debt through savings bonds or marketable Treasury securities, or to manage the savings bond program. Further, the bureau has not updated some key data elements in the cost-effectiveness model. In particular, citing budget considerations, the bureau uses data on the redemption patterns for savings bonds that date back to 1993, which do not reflect the effects of the wide variety of financial instruments now available to investors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Savings bonds, which offer low-risk, affordable investment opportunities to  many Americans, represent almost 3 percent of the total Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) securities outstanding but nearly 6 percent of the total  nonmarketable Treasury securities outstanding.

Since then, however, a wide variety of financial instruments have  become available to investors, which could affect the patterns of  redemption. Further, the redemptions do not reflect current interest rates.", "As previously discussed, the model also applies the redemption  probabilities of Series EE bonds to similarly priced Series I bonds (that is,  the redemption probabilities for a $100 Series EE bond and a $50 Series I  bond are equal).

As a result, we do not know to what degree the present value errors  and these data affect the model\u2019s cost-effectiveness ratio.", "BPD\u2019s ability to assess the impact of policy changes to the savings bond  program, project cost centers for the savings bond program, and determine  cost-effectiveness in relation to marketable Treasury securities is  hampered by fundamental errors in the present value calculations.

At a minimum,  Treasury and BPD should collect data for a sample of the more recent  time period to test the validity of the 1957-93 data.", "Base Series I bond redemption patterns on actual experience with those  bonds.", "Validate the cost estimate of education bond program participation  based on the historical, 12-year data to date.", "Replace the 30-year equivalent marketable rate.", "Update the software used for the model to enhance BPD\u2019s ability to  maintain the model and protect against unauthorized modification.", "Put in place a process for ongoing verification, sensitivity analysis, and  independent external review of the model."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In a June 4, 2003, letter commenting on a draft of this report, the  Commissioner of the Public Debt wrote that the cost-effectiveness model  conformed to OMB Circular A-94, sec. 5b, since it \u201cmeasures Treasury\u2019s  relative financial benefit from two borrowing options whose overall costs  are identical. Treasury\u2019s benefit from each alternative is the amount of  financing realized at the time borrowing occurs.\u201d Noting that the model \u201cis  not intended to be a classic present value exercise,\u201d the Commissioner  explained that the model \u201ccompares the present value of a projected  stream of payments associated with the sale of savings bonds with the  amount realized from the sale.\u201d BPD suspects it may have inadvertently  misused the terms \u201cdiscount factor\u201d and \u201cpresent value\u201d in internal  Treasury discussions. Further, BPD said that we did not understand the  model\u2019s life-cycle duration, the minimum holding period, and the Series I  redemption values.", "The Commissioner noted that while BPD disagreed with our conclusion  that the model\u2019s comparisons were invalid, BPD generally agreed with our  recommendations for updating the model. However, the Commissioner  also noted that, with Treasury\u2019s goal of moving toward a totally electronic  environment for the savings bond program, \u201cwe think it's appropriate for us  to shelve the existing model, which is based on paper bonds, and focus our  attention on the transition to a fully electronic program.\u201d", "The model compares the amount of funds raised by selling a given amount of Series EE and  I bonds in various denominations and the present value of the future costs to Treasury in  connection with issuing the bonds. If the amount raised is greater than the present value of  the future costs associated with the bonds, taking into account administrative costs and tax  benefits, then the program is deemed to be cost-effective.", "While we agree that an approach comparing the benefits of two approaches  having identical costs would be a valid alternative to the present value  approach that we described in our report, the model\u2019s calculations do not  support this analysis. Marketable Treasury securities and savings bonds  can be compared by either comparing the costs of raising identical sums  using two alternative debt instruments or by comparing the funds raised  when the costs of the two instruments are identical. However, if BPD were  to base the cost-effectiveness model on a comparison of the \u201cfinancial  benefit from two borrowing options whose overall costs are identical,\u201d the  key issue that this approach would have to address is that marketable  Treasury securities and savings bonds do not necessarily have identical  overall costs.", "The challenge of this modeling approach would be to appropriately  measure costs over time of the two options in a way that would permit  treating the costs as identical. Since the costs vary over time, accurately  calculating the present value of the costs of the two options would be an  essential step. However, we did not find, for reasons noted in the report,  that the model accurately or reliably calculates the present value of the  stream of costs associated with the sale of savings bonds. In particular, the  report explains that the discount rate used to calculate the present value of  the projected stream of costs is inappropriate.", "We have changed the report to recognize that BPD allocates a small  number of redemptions prior to 6 months to reflect hardship waivers; these  waivers are not discussed in BPD\u2019s model documentation. We have not,  however, changed the report in response to the Commissioner\u2019s statements  regarding life cycle costs and Series I redemption values. As the report  notes, the 20-year extension on the life cycle appears to be inconsistent  with regulations that provide that bonds for which no claims have been  filed within 10 years of the maturity date are presumed to have been  properly paid. Our analysis of the Series I savings bond redemption value  found that the formula does not correctly recognize the savings bond\u2019s  accrued value at the beginning of each semiannual period.", "The Commissioner\u2019s letter noted that BPD generally agrees with the  recommendations for updating the model, but that BPD believes it  appropriate to \u201cshelve\u201d the existing model and focus on the transition to a  fully electronic retail securities program. We agree that the importance of  many administrative costs will decline if BPD successfully transforms the  current paper-based savings bond program to an electronic environment.  Further, there may be changes in investors\u2019 purchases and redemptions of  savings bonds in an electronic environment.", "However, important differences will continue to exist between the costs of  savings bonds and marketable Treasury securities, particularly the  payment of coupons and the tax treatment of the two debt instruments. A  model that accurately recognizes these differences will continue to be as  crucial to understanding the relative cost-effectiveness of the two debt  instruments as it is in the current paper-based environment. That model,  furthermore, will have to be updated regularly to reflect the effect of any  changes in investor preferences and behavior on the savings bond program  as it moves into this new electronic environment. Our recommendations  will remain appropriate for assessing the cost-effectiveness of the savings  bond program managed in an electronic environment.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its  date.
