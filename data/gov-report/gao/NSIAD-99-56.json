Because central training is the third largest of eight DOD infrastructure categories, and DOD is looking, in part, to infrastructure savings and efficiencies to buy modern weapons, you requested that we examine the significant differences in the two central training programs. Specifically, you requested that we identify the (1) training categories and military services with the most significant funding changes from the 1998 to the 1999 FYDP, (2) bases for the changes, and (3) potential impact of the changes on the services\u2019 future training budgets.

To achieve modernization goals, DOD plans to reduce the cost of its infrastructure, which includes central training. A focus of the QDR was to build a solid financial foundation for a modernization program that could reliably support future war-fighting capabilities. The key to that foundation was to stop the chronic diversion of procurement funds to pay for underestimated operating costs, unrealized savings, and new program demands by properly projecting and funding DOD\u2019s operating and support activities. To address the problem of the migration of these procurement funds to other activities, the QDR redirected resources to modernization through program adjustments that streamline infrastructure as well as reduce force structure and revise modernization plans. For example, the QDR proposed reducing active military personnel by 61,700 and reserve component personnel by 54,000. These QDR actions and initiatives were reflected in the fiscal year 1999 FYDP and caused some of the net decrease in central training funding.", "The services consider a number of factors in formulating their central training requirements. Factors include projected authorized end strength, losses in each occupational specialty/category by grade and years in grade, accessions, promotions, and reenlistments. Therefore, a change in end strength levels may not lead to a proportional change in training requirements. For example, lower-than-expected retention rates may necessitate increased training requirements even though personnel levels are lower.

The total decrease in funding between the two FYDPs was $8.4 billion. Figure 1 compares the annual funding levels for the two FYDPs.", "Army funding changes account for $7.2 billion (86 percent) of this projected decline. The Air Force projected slightly lower funding levels in the 1999 FYDP. Although Navy funding in the 1999 FYDP shows an increase for 1999 and 2000, it too fell below projected 1998 FYDP levels in 2001 through 2003. Annual funding for the Marine Corps, which accounted for less than 9 percent of central training funding in 1999, was projected to decrease by less than 3 percent annually in the 1999 FYDP from the levels projected in the 1998 FYDP.

Most of the decrease ($4 billion) was to correct an error in the Army\u2019s allocation of military salaries. During the development of the 1999 program, Army personnel found that they had been overestimating the salaries of enlisted trainees that were allocated to new personnel training and underestimating salary costs in other programs. An Army official stated that the error had no impact on the Army\u2019s budget requests for military personnel salaries and benefits. Moreover, there were funding reductions due to programmed personnel cuts from the QDR. According to Army training officials, instructors and training support staff will be reduced as a result of consolidating training functions and increased contractor support.", "According to Army training officials, the Army did not fully fund several training initiatives in the 1999 FYDP such as improvements in the Army\u2019s human relations training. Because these are high priorities for the Army, the Army officials expect that these initiatives will be fully funded in the 2000 FYDP, probably at the expense of other major commands.", "Further, Army training officials stated that the funding levels in the 1999 FYDP do not fully support a projected increased workload. The Army projected that workload for the training of new personnel would increase because of increased attrition and a 1-week extension of recruit and One-Station Unit Training. As a result, the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command has already requested additional funds for the 1999 budget year and the Army will likely have to increase the funding levels for this training category in the 2000 FYDP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Professional and Skill Training", "paragraphs": ["The 1999 FYDP programmed $1.2 billion less in total for this category than the 1998 FYDP. Several factors contributed to the lower projected funding. Programmed personnel reductions (a result of the QDR) contributed to a decrease in Army Reserve funding. In addition, as part of the implementation of the Total Army School System program, the Army Reserve reviewed its professional development training programs and cut its budget for students, instructors, and overhead. However, according to Army training officials, the Army Reserve underestimated its training requirements, and as a result, requested and received a $48-million increase in the fiscal year 1999 appropriations that offset the shortfall programmed in the 1999 FYDP. Army training officials stated that funding for Reserve professional and skill training in the 2000 FYDP will be increased.", "Changes in and programmed savings from the Army\u2019s Distance Learning Program also contributed to lower programmed funding for professional and skill training. In 1998, funding for the management of this program was moved from the central training infrastructure to another infrastructure category. In addition, funding was reduced beginning in 1999 to reflect both training load decreases and projected savings through the Army\u2019s ongoing investment in distance learning technology. These savings are to accrue as classroom training time is shortened and student travel and per diem costs are reduced. Army training officials informed us that the Army continues to fully implement its Distance Learning Program, so the service can achieve the savings planned from the program, but substantial savings are not projected to begin until 2004 because of the lengthy implementation process.", "The decline in Army funding would have appeared even greater if the Army had not received additional funding for its professional and skill training programs from Defense-wide central training activities.

As a result, the aviation and flight training workload will be even higher than projected in the 1999 budget to meet the increased demand for training new pilots. Increased workload may result in increased funding requirements for this training category in the 2000 FYDP.

The efficiencies are projected to result from such efforts as the outsourcing and privatization of installation support functions, lower lease costs, the elimination of less energy-efficient structures, and the upgrade of existing utilities. The Army has assumed some risk by making these projections because it does not know whether the savings can be achieved.", "The Army is also assuming risk by delaying some real property maintenance to free up additional funds for modernization and readiness.

One such initiative, the Training Technology Initiative, plans to upgrade classrooms and produce interactive software to enhance instruction and reduce the overall cost and time of training. Until the initiatives are implemented, it is difficult to determine if and how much savings will accrue from the initiatives.

The number of aircraft planned for procurement in fiscal year 2003 dropped from six to four. Planned procurement funding in 2001 and 2002 is projected to be lower in the 1999 FYDP, even though the number of aircraft increased, because of projected savings from the multiyear procurement contract. Funding is projected to drop further in 2003 because of the procurement contract savings and the reduction in the number of aircraft to be purchased that year. The grounding of the T-2 trainer aircraft from April to November 1997 because of flight control problems caused a decrease in workload and associated funding for 1997 and 1998, but workload and funding were projected to increase for 1999 to make up some of the shortfall in pilot production in the previous 2 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Command Managed Training", "paragraphs": ["Total funding for command managed training was projected to be $267 million higher in the 1999 FYDP than in the 1998 FYDP.
