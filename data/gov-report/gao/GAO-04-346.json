Participating working families are more likely to receive greater food stamp benefit amounts than those eligible working families that do not participate. Also, participating working families were more likely to participate in other government assistance programs and to rent rather than own their home. Factors that can impede an eligible working family's participation in the program include whether the family is aware of the program's existence and eligibility criteria and whether a family considers the program's administrative process--including having to make frequent trips to a food stamp office during working hours and providing documentation of income--overly burdensome. However, there are some potentially significant benefits, including error and fraud prevention, to some of the administrative requirements. Evidence also suggests that some families weigh the perceived burdens of participation against the benefits of doing so and perceive a stigma attached to receiving food stamps. The Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) and several states and localities have taken or suggested steps to address the impediments to participation in the program for working families, while also considering ways to balance easier participation with program integrity. These efforts include increasing food stamp outreach, adopting new administrative processes to ease participation and reduce program error, developing tools to help families estimate food stamp benefit amount, and re-naming the program to reduce the stigma associated with food stamps. Compiling a complete picture of these steps was not possible, however, because FNS does not systematically track these efforts, and the outcomes of their use are still largely unknown."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal Food Stamp Program, established in 1964 and administered by  the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), is designed to provide basic  nutrition to low-income individuals and families in the United States by  supplementing their income with food stamp benefits; however, many  individuals who are likely eligible to participate in the program do not.  According to USDA data, while an average of almost 16 million Americans  a month received food stamp benefits in fiscal year 2001, almost 11 million  individuals who were likely eligible to receive food stamps in September  of that year did not participate in the program. Overall, the program paid  almost $16 billion in benefits in fiscal year 2001.", "Working families, defined here as those who live in households with  earned income, that are eligible to receive food stamps participate in the  program at a lower rate than the eligible population as a whole. As a  result, many federal, state, and local officials believe that the Food Stamp  Program is not living up to its potential as a component of the nation\u2019s  work support system. Work support programs assist low-income working  families by subsidizing some of the expenses associated with work outside  the home as well as everyday necessities. These supports have grown in  importance following 1996\u2019s welfare reform legislation, which placed a  priority on work and economic self-sufficiency. Although the Food Stamp  Program\u2019s primary mission is to ensure that low-income Americans have  access to a healthy diet, targeting food assistance to eligible low-income  working families also helps adults enter and stay in the workforce by  freeing up limited resources for other necessities.", "USDA has made it a priority to increase working families\u2019 access to the  nutrition assistance they need, while at the same time ensuring that only  those who are eligible for benefits receive them. To better understand how  the Food Stamp Program serves working families, you asked us to  examine: (1) what proportion of eligible working families participate in the  Food Stamp Program and what family characteristics are associated with a  family\u2019s participation; (2) what factors may be acting as impediments to  whether a working family participates in the Food Stamp Program; and   (3) what steps are being taken, or have been suggested, to help eligible  low-income working families participate in the Food Stamp Program while  ensuring program integrity.", "To answer these questions, we held discussions with program  stakeholders, including officials at USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service\u2019s  (FNS) headquarters and regional offices, state food stamp officials,  representatives of advocacy organizations, and other program experts.   We also conducted a search of the literature to identify recent (1996 or  later) studies that specifically addressed participation in the Food Stamp  Program among eligible working families. In addition, we analyzed  simulated data prepared by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., to produce  program participation estimates for FNS. The simulated data are based on  the most recently available public data primarily collected by USDA and  the U.S. Census Bureau. Finally, we visited four states\u2014 Florida,  Massachusetts, New York, and Oregon\u2014with programs identified by  federal officials, researchers, and other program stakeholders as having  innovative approaches to encouraging participation in the Food Stamp  Program among working families. During each of those site visits, we met  with the state officials responsible for oversight of the Food Stamp  Program, visited two local offices in different parts of the state,  interviewed advocacy groups charged with doing formal and informal food  stamp outreach for the state, and met with community-based organizations  that had frequent contact with food stamp recipients as well as likely  eligible individuals who were not participating in the program. In addition,  we reviewed documentation about the rationale for, and the  implementation of, state- and local-level strategies to increase  participation in the four states we visited.

FNS pays the full cost of food  stamp benefits and shares the states\u2019 administrative costs\u2014with FNS  usually paying 50 percent\u2014and is responsible for promulgating program  regulations and ensuring that state officials administer the program in  compliance with program rules. The states administer the program by  determining whether households meet the program\u2019s income and asset  requirements, calculating monthly benefits for qualified households, and  issuing benefits to participants, usually on an Electronic Benefits Transfer  (EBT) card. The program is usually administered out of an assistance  office and, oftentimes, assistance offices also offer other benefits,  including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid,  and child care assistance. Figure 1 outlines the general steps a household  must take to participate in the Food Stamp Program and how each step  occurs.", "Eligibility for participation in the Food Stamp Program is based on the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 poverty guideline for  households. In most states, a household\u2019s gross income cannot exceed   130 percent of the poverty guideline (or about $1,654 per month for a  family of three living in the contiguous United States) and its net income  cannot exceed 100 percent of the poverty guideline (or about $1,272 per  month for a family of three living in the contiguous United States). In  addition, most states place a limit of $2,000 on household assets, and basic  program rules limit the value of vehicles an applicant can own and still be  eligible for the program. Other factors affecting benefit levels include size  of household, income level, shelter expenses, child care costs, and child  support payments. (Eligibility requirements are less stringent for  households with elderly or disabled members.) Participants must also  periodically recertify by documenting their continued eligibility for  program benefits.", "In fiscal year 2003, the Food Stamp Program issued more than $21 billion  in benefits. In September 2003, more than 22.7 million individuals  participated in the program. This is an increase from the same month in  2002, when the Food Stamp Program provided benefits to almost   19.8 million Americans. As shown in figure 2, the increase in the average  monthly participation of food stamp recipients in 2003 continues a recent  upward trend in the number of people receiving benefits.", "The decrease in number of recipients from 1996 to 2001 can be explained,  in part, by the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work  Opportunity Act of 1996 (PRWORA), which toughened eligibility criteria  and made certain groups ineligible to receive benefits, and had the effect  of un-tethering food stamps from cash assistance. In some cases, this  caused participants to believe they were no longer eligible for food stamps  when TANF benefits were ended. In addition, studies have suggested that  the economic growth in the late 1990s played a major role in the decrease  of recipients. Since 2000, that downward trend has reversed, and  stakeholders believe that the downturn in the U.S. economy, coupled with  changes in the program\u2019s rules and administration, has led to an increase  in the number of food stamp recipients. Although the total number of food  stamp recipients is still below the 1996 level, since February 2001, the  number of recipients has increased over 30 percent.", "Despite this increase, it remains the goal of FNS and several states to  increase participation in the program among eligible families, while  maintaining program integrity. FNS\u2019s fiscal year 2000 strategic plan makes  it a goal of the administration to improve the rate of food stamp  participation among all eligible people to 68 percent by 2005. According to  FNS officials, eligible immigrants, elderly Americans, and members of  working families are the major subgroups targeted to increase  participation.", "The administration has chosen to focus on participation among working  families, in part, because of the increased emphasis placed on the need for  work supports such as food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit  (EITC), and child care and transportation subsidies\u2014since PRWORA.", "In addition, the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002  Farm Bill) included provisions intended to encourage participation among  underserved groups, including working families, and simplify program  administration. For example, the 2002 Farm Bill gave states the option to  maintain food stamp benefits at a consistent level for a transition period  for individuals who left TANF to go to work. The 2002 Farm Bill also made  it possible for FNS to provide financial awards to states with higher or  improved performance in program administration. In response, FNS has  targeted improving program participation in addition to its existing focus  on payment accuracy and lowering error rates. The food stamp error rate  was 8.26 percent in fiscal year 2002, the lowest in the program\u2019s history.", "In the last few years, working families have become a greater proportion  of the overall food stamp participant population. As of fiscal year 2002,  about 40 percent of those individuals receiving food stamps were members  of households with earnings, up from about 33 percent in 1997. As shown  in figure 3, this increase occurred at the same time that the proportion of  food stamp recipients receiving TANF declined dramatically. This can be  explained, in part, by the fact that when TANF recipients leave that  program, they may still be eligible for food stamp benefits. Thus, if TANF  recipients leave that program because they have found employment, they  can continue to receive food stamps until their income increases enough  to disqualify them from the program or until they are no longer eligible for  other reasons. Because of the increase in the proportion of food stamp  participants who are living in households with earned income, serving low- income working families has taken on an increased importance for the  Food Stamp Program in recent years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligible Working Families Participate in the Food Stamp Program at a Lower Rate than Eligible Nonworking Families", "paragraphs": ["A lower percentage of food stamp-eligible individuals in working families  received food stamp benefits than those in eligible nonworking families,  and certain family characteristics are associated with the likelihood of  participation.

This amount is more than the $159 average benefit received by  households with no earned income. The fact that working families  received more benefits, on average, than nonworking families is, in part,  due to family size. In general, the larger the family size, the larger the  family\u2019s benefit. Working food stamp families have an average of   3.2 persons per household, as opposed to nonworking families that receive  benefits, which average fewer than two persons per household. In addition  to household size, household income level also affects benefit level, as do  other factors such as cost of shelter, child care costs, and child support  payments.", "While it is true that the amount of food stamp benefits that a working  family is eligible for decreases as the family\u2019s gross income increases,  there is not an immediate drop-off in benefit level as income increases, nor  is there a one dollar drop in benefits for every additional dollar in income  earned.", "To demonstrate the effect of additional earned income on working  families that receive food stamps, FNS provided us with an example of  how earnings might impact a hypothetical family consisting of a single  mother with two children.

This is the most current data available.  Table 1 shows the differences between participating working families and  those we estimate are eligible but not participating in 2000, the last year  for which information was available.", "Some characteristics are associated with the increased likelihood of  participation. For instance, food stamp participation was more likely  among working families that were eligible for a larger amount of food  stamp benefits; specifically, each $100 increase in monthly benefits for  which families were eligible increased the likelihood of participating in the  program by approximately 30 percent. Working families with young  children\u2014under 5 years old\u2014in the household were also more likely to  participate than likely eligible working families without young children.", "Other characteristics are associated with the reduced likelihood of  participation. For example, working families with higher shelter expenses  were less likely to participate; each $100 increase in monthly shelter  expenses decreased the likelihood of participating by about 10 percent. In  addition, working families that owned rather than rented their dwellings,  were less likely to participate in food stamps than other working families,  by about 50 percent. Families with a noncitizen head of household, and  families with elderly or married individuals in the household, were also  only about half as likely to participate in the program.", "Finally, families with any unearned income were more than 2 times as  likely as those without any unearned income to participate in the Food  Stamp Program. And, the likelihood of participating was almost 11 times  higher for those families that received Medicaid benefits than for those  who did not, over 6 times higher for those who received energy assistance  and over 4 times higher for households in which someone received job  training. Similarly, the likelihood of participating in the Food Stamp  Program was about 3 times higher for working families participating in  free or reduced school lunch program or in the Special Supplemental  Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) than for those  eligible nonparticipating working families that did not participate in those  programs.", "In assessing the results of our analysis, it is worth noting that some of the  characteristics that are associated with the participation by likely eligible  working families also are likely to be associated with the participation of  all eligible participants. For this study, however, the analysis focuses on  how these characteristics are associated with working families. By  focusing on the differing characteristics of participating and  nonparticipating working families, it is possible to develop a better  understanding of how working families that receive food stamps are  different from likely eligible working families that do not receive benefits.  This analysis does not, on its own, offer any explanation for why these  families choose to participate, but it does help identify characteristics of  those families who do and do not participate.

Participation, therefore, is dependent  on the family being aware of the program\u2019s existence and its possible  eligibility. Yet, studies of participation in the program that we reviewed  offer evidence that many eligible families lack such awareness. For  example, a study done by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., for FNS,  based on interviews with likely eligible individuals that do not participate  in the program, found that 72 percent of those surveyed were not aware of  their probable eligibility.", "Program stakeholders, too, said that lack of information about the  program and how it works plays a key role in nonparticipation for working  families. For instance, according to officials in Florida, working families  may not participate because they are uncertain about the program\u2019s rules  and eligibility criteria and how to participate. A worker for a community- based organization in Florida who did outreach to working families said  that many individuals are unfamiliar with the program\u2019s workings, making  food stamp receipt difficult.", "Program officials also suggested that many working individuals assume  that their having a job makes their family ineligible for the program. As  one official in Oregon said, she believes that some working people do not  think of themselves as food stamp recipients, because they believe that  food stamps are something for the very poor, and thus do not think they  would be eligible given that they have jobs. Officials in Florida and  Massachusetts agreed that some potentially eligible working families do  not participate because they do not know that they are potentially eligible  for food stamps.", "Confusion about the relationship between food stamp eligibility rules and  TANF eligibility rules can also contribute to working families wrongly  believing that they are ineligible for food stamps, according to program  officials that we talked with. An official for the New York Office of  Transitional and Disability Assistance said that some people still believe  that when one\u2019s TANF case closes, one\u2019s food stamp case closes as well.  The official said that, despite New York\u2019s best effort to combat this false  information, some people leave the Food Stamp Program when they leave  TANF because they believe that they are no longer eligible for food  stamps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Perception that the Food Stamp Program\u2019s Administrative Process Is Burdensome Can Deter Participation", "paragraphs": ["Another factor influencing whether a family participates in the Food  Stamp Program is how the food stamp administrative process is perceived.  In other words, according to the literature we reviewed and the program  officials we spoke with, if the administrative process is seen as being  burdensome, families may not participate because of the effort required to  apply for and receive food stamps. In addition, our analysis of CPS data  demonstrates that, in 2000, working families that participate in the Food  Stamp Program are more likely to receive other types of government  assistance\u2014such as Medicaid, WIC, and energy assistance\u2014than  nonparticipating working families. One possible explanation for this  difference is that those that have a comfort level with the administrative  process of applying for and receiving assistance might be more likely to  participate in the Food Stamp Program.", "We identified certain administrative practices during our site visits to food  stamp offices in Florida, Massachusetts, New York, and Oregon, that could  be considered burdensome by potential recipients who work and that  might deter participation. Among the practices identified were multiple  required office visits, food stamp office operating hours, food stamp  applications, requirements for eligibility documentation and verification,  finger imaging for program participants, and the requirement for workers  to report changes in their income and hours worked. However, we found  that not all of these practices that are potential impediments to  participation were in place in every local office that we visited and that  these practices are not in place in exactly the same fashion at each office.  In addition, it is clear that there are potentially significant benefits\u2014 including fraud and error prevention, targeting benefits to need, and the  provision of more cost-effective service\u2014to some of the administrative  processes.", "Among the practices that can influence whether a family participates in  the Food Stamp Program are:    Required office visits. In some cases, potential recipients make a trip to  the assistance office to fill out a food stamp application and a separate trip  for the recipient to meet with a caseworker to determine eligibility. In  addition, potential clients may have to return to the food stamp office if  they do not bring all the required documentation to their first visit. This  means that a family often has to make two or more trips to the office to  participate in the program, which can be difficult for individuals who are  working.", "Office hours. Assistance offices are often only open during regular  working hours. For example, we visited an office that opened from   8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday. For working individuals,  getting to a food stamp office during the work week can be difficult. A  recent study by the Urban Institute supports the notion that a working  families\u2019 participation status is influenced by the hours they work and,  perhaps, by the hours a food stamp office is open. The study found that  those who work so-called traditional hours are less likely to participate  than those who work a less traditional schedule. However, offering longer  hours of service can have cost implications such as additional personnel,  utility, computer, and security costs.", "The food stamp application. During our site visits, program advocates  said that applications, which often serve both food stamps and other  assistance programs, such as Medicaid and TANF, are too complex. For  instance, an advocate said that she believed that the food stamp  application was too long and required a reading level that was too  advanced for most potentially eligible individuals. State officials in  Oregon, however, said that having a slightly longer food stamp application  allows for better integration of assistance programs, which can benefit  recipients, as well as a reduction of workload for caseworkers at  assistance offices.", "Eligibility documentation and verification. Participating in the  program requires proof of income level, residency, and family size, among  other information. Providing such proof usually is done by bringing  documentation to the food stamp office at the time of enrollment. This,  however, can be perceived as being burdensome for potential clients. For  example, current and former food stamp clients surveyed in an Oregon  focus group reported that various documentation forms in that state are  intrusive and often excessive. However, under current program rules,  these requirements are an essential component of ensuring that food  stamp applicants are eligible to receive food stamps and that they receive  the proper benefit amount.", "The finger-imaging requirement. Four states in the country have  requirements that new recipients of food stamps are finger-imaged at the  assistance office before they receive their benefits. New York was the  only state we visited that had such a requirement. Advocates in that state  complained that being finger-imaged was a deterrent to participation, in  that it potentially required them to make an additional trip to the food  stamp office. However, quality control officials in that state believed that it  was a vital way to prevent people from defrauding the Food Stamp  Program by allowing officials to verify that the applicant did not already  have a case open somewhere else in the state.", "Change reporting requirement. Participating in the program often  requires families to report income changes, meaning that some working  families would have to be in frequent contact with their caseworker as the  amount of hours they worked or the wages they received fluctuated. The  requirement has the potential to add to the burden of participation, and  program officials said that the requirement was a potential deterrent for  working families. However, doing so also ensures that food stamp  recipients continue to receive the correct benefit amount. These income  changes can result in either an increase or decrease of benefit levels.", "Government officials we talked with acknowledged that the food stamp  administrative process can be burdensome and that participating in the  program is complex. However, officials spoke positively of many of the  practices in their states, such as finger imaging and the requirement for  multiple office visits. Many of the practices that might be perceived by  potential recipients as causing burdens contribute to other priorities of the  program, such as streamlining the eligibility process and keeping the  program\u2019s error rate as low as possible. The perceived impediments  associated with many of the administrative processes, and the justifiable  reasons the processes exist, highlight the tradeoffs between the various  program goals, including increasing program access and reducing error  rates, that are inherent with the design of the Food Stamp Program. Some  of these practices probably contribute to some eligible working families  not participating in the program, but they also probably help to ensure that  only eligible families receive benefits, which is vital to maintaining public  support for the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evidence Suggests that Food Stamp Participation Is Often Driven by Whether a Family Considers the Benefits Worth the Effort and Cost of Participating", "paragraphs": ["Another factor influencing whether eligible working families participate in  the Food Stamp Program is how much they value the food stamp benefit,  according to evidence from available public data, the literature we  reviewed, and visits to four states. Working families may make an informal  cost-benefit analysis of whether their need for the benefits they would  receive outweighs the effort and cost of participation. Costs can include  taking time off from work and the transportation costs of getting to a food  stamp office. Our analysis of 2000 CPS data\u2014which demonstrates that  working families that receive other government assistance are more likely  to participate in the Food Stamp Program\u2014is consistent with that. Given  that many assistance programs are administered at the same office and  sometimes using the same application as food stamps, participating in  other programs is likely to reduce the cost of food stamp participation,  which makes a working family more likely to participate in food stamps.", "Our analysis of the 2000 data also demonstrates that working families that  are eligible for larger benefits are more likely to receive food stamps than  those that are eligible for smaller benefit amounts. Program officials also  cite the amount of benefits as a reason that some working families do not  participate. An official in Massachusetts said that some working families  may qualify only for a small dollar amount a month, which our evidence  supports, and, because of that fact, some potential recipients believe that  the effort associated with applying is not worth the small amount.", "In addition, available research shows that whether a family is willing to  participate in the program can also be influenced by the extent to which  the family believes it needs the benefit. In a survey and focus groups  Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., conducted for FNS, it found that many  likely eligible working families did not participate because they believed  that they could get by without food stamps and that others need them  more. Such families seem to be placing a minimal value on their food  stamp benefit. Moreover, research done by USDA\u2019s Economic Research  Service suggests that families that are food insecure are more likely to  participate than families that are food secure. Both of these research  efforts suggest that a family\u2019s level of need plays a role in whether a  working family participates in the Food Stamp Program. Those families  believe that they do not need food stamps are less likely to bear the costs  of participating in terms of lost time and inconvenience, while those  families that are in need may be more likely to participate no matter what  the benefit level is.", "A study published by The Lewin Group reinforces the idea that need plays  a role in the decision to participate. In a study using data from the Survey  of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the authors found that  likely eligible nonparticipating working households differed from  participating working households in their income variability.  Nonparticipating households were more likely to have experienced a  short-term drop of income than participants and were more likely to have  had recent past income that exceeded 100 percent of the federal poverty  level. From these findings, the authors suggest that many nonparticipants  have expectations of higher future income and do not see the need for  food stamps, which helps to explain why they do not participate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Stigma Associated with the Food Stamp Program Can Cause Some Families Not to Participate", "paragraphs": ["The stigma associated with the Food Stamp Program is one of the reasons  some eligible families do not participate in the program, according to  existing research and interviews with program stakeholders. Although the  program\u2019s primary mission is nutrition assistance, program stakeholders  believe the stigma associated with food stamps is largely related to the  program\u2019s welfare connotations. Focus groups of current and former food  stamp recipients, conducted by a community-based organization in  Oregon, echoed that sentiment. A theme that ran through the focus group  responses was that people were ashamed, or too proud, to receive food  stamps. The focus group responses indicated that individuals can have  personal shame about receiving food stamp benefits and may be worried  about being looked down upon for receiving them.", "For working families, the welfare stigma can be a particular deterrent  toward food stamp participation. For example, program officials cited the  occasional need to verify a food stamp recipient\u2019s wages and employment  status with the recipient\u2019s employer as one stigma associated with food  stamp receipt for working families. A related deterrent for working  families is that to participate in the program, a family usually has to make  a trip to the food stamp office, which is also the \u201cwelfare office.\u201d Advocacy  groups said that this was a requirement that discouraged participation  among working families. Former Florida food stamp recipients told us that  caseworkers ask personal questions regarding how they manage their  finances.

For example, in Miami, the  Human Services Coalition of Dade County, as part of the Greater Miami  Prosperity Campaign, is attempting to reach out to employers of low- income workers to promote certain available work support programs for  their employees. The goal is to convince employers that these work  supports are a win for employees because they augment the wages of low- income workers; they are a win for employers, because they bring stability  to the life of their employees who, therefore, feel more loyalty to their  employer; and, they are a win for the community at large, because more  federal dollars are brought into the local economy through the spending of  those who receive work supports. Representatives of the coalition and its  partners are working with the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce and  are making presentations to employers and their low wage employees and  human resource manager associations around the region focusing on this  message. The coalition representatives ask employers to take three  actions to support the campaign: (1) send letters to employees about  available work supports; (2) provide information about the EITC,  children\u2019s health care, and food stamps when sending out copies of  government documents such as Internal Revenue Service W-2 earning  statements; and (3) allow coalition workers to pre-screen employees at the  workplace. The prescreening allows the advocates to more fully explain  the eligibility requirements and what steps applicants must take to qualify  for benefits. As of August 2003, the advocates had convinced a large  Miami-based cruise line to send out information about the work support  programs with employees\u2019 W-2 forms and pay stubs, and they had also  conducted on-site pre-screening for employees at several local businesses.", "Some state and local programs we visited have also partnered with other  assistance programs, such as the EITC, Medicaid, Head Start, school lunch  program, and WIC, to make working and nonworking families aware of  their potential eligibility for food stamps.

In addition, New York, Oregon, and Massachusetts  shortened and simplified their food stamp applications. While well  received, shortening the application has had some drawbacks. For  example, New York officials told us that because their shortened  application was for food stamps only, it limited the client\u2019s ability to apply  for more than one assistance program at the same time. Also, local  officials in Oregon told us that their shortened form required their already  overburdened caseworkers to spend more time with clients gathering  information previously captured on the longer application forms.", "States are also facilitating the food stamp application process by adopting  certain available administrative options that can simplify the application  process. For example, when considering the value of a vehicle as an asset,  states may choose to substitute the more generous asset rules from other  assistance programs in place of Food Stamp Program rules thereby  reducing the amount of documentation collected from individuals applying  for more than one program. All four states we visited have adopted similar  vehicle policy options.

Three local offices we visited experimented with offering extended office  hours during the week or on Saturdays. State and local officials reported  mixed success with these options. For example, officials at one local  office in Oregon said that adopting client friendly policies such as these  has led to an increase in the caseload while local officials in New York and  Massachusetts dropped these efforts after few potential clients took  advantage of the extended hours. In addition, in an effort to help working  families avoid missing work and overcome transportation impediments,  Massachusetts adopted liberal rules allowing local offices to interview  clients and take food stamp applications over the telephone or via the mail  if coming to the office would be a hardship for them. Using this practice,  clients still must submit the necessary documentation to ensure program  integrity.

As a result of  these concerns, FNS established regulations in November 2000 that gave  states the option to require working families to report changes in income  between 6 month certification periods only when a change in their income  made them ineligible for food stamps. All of the four states we visited  chose this option. In addition, FNS continued to support efforts to further  expand states\u2019 flexibility to streamline complex rules, simplify program  administration, and help ease the transition from welfare to work through  their support of the 2002 Farm Bill amendments.  For example, the   2002 Farm Bill simplifies on-going reporting requirements by allowing  states to disregard changes in certain amounts deducted for child care  expenses, child support payments made, and medical expenses.

This is because Mathematica\u2019s  procedures were not amenable to multivariate procedures that would  allow an estimate of the \u201cnet\u201d effects of different factors on Food Stamp  Program participation \u2013 for example, the effect that food stamp benefit  amounts have on the likelihood of participating after the associations of  benefit amounts and participation likelihoods with other potentially  confounding factors are taken into account.

It is worth noting that variations from the  procedures produced by Mathematica for estimating eligibility could yield  results that differ from our analysis since our work relies on  Mathematica\u2019s simulation of eligibility.", "To estimate the net effect of different factors affecting the likelihood of  participating, we used logistic regression models that produce odds ratios  to indicate how the odds on participating differed across different types of  households, or across various levels of continuous variables (like income  or the value of food stamp benefits that households were eligible for) that  are associated with each unit. Overall, the odds on participating were   0.35; that is, 35 eligible households participated for every 100 that did not.  These odds differed markedly across different households, however, and  the odds ratios from bivariate models shown in table 5 indicate the  bivariate effects of various factors on the odds on eligible food stamp  working families participating in the Food Stamp Program, when each  factor is considered in isolation, or independently, from every other factor.  Model 1 and model 2 test for the effect of any characteristic using  multivariate models, in order to control for other factors in measuring  whether any single factor effects likelihood of participation.", "These bivariate results demonstrate that, based on our estimates, food  stamp participation was more likely in eligible households in which the  benefits of participation were greater; that is, each $100 increase in  monthly benefits for which household members were eligible increased  the odds on participating by a factor of 1.31, or by 31 percent. Likely  eligible households with higher shelter expenses were, at the same time,  less likely to participate; each $100 increase in monthly shelter expenses  decreased the odds on participating by a factor of 0.91. While households  with higher incomes were not significantly different from households with  lower incomes to participate, households with any nonearned income  were 2.6 times as likely as those without any nonearned income to  participate. Larger households were also more likely to participate than  smaller ones (i.e., every additional person in the eligible household  increases the odds on participating by a factor of 1.1). While the presence  of elderly or married individuals in a household reduces the odds on  participation by roughly half, the presence of young children (under age 5)  in the household nearly doubles the odds of participating. Households  consisting of all black members (including black Hispanics) were nearly  twice as likely as families with all white (non-Hispanic) members to  participate, though there were no significant differences between  households consisting of other races and households that were all white.  Households with any noncitizen unit head, and households involving  owned rather than rented dwellings, were also less likely to be  participating in food stamps than other households.", "Participation in the Food Stamp Program was also greatly affected by  whether the persons in the eligible household participate in other  programs. That is, the odds of participating were over 10 times higher for  those working households that received Medicaid benefits (than for those  who do not), over six times higher for those who received energy  assistance, and over four times higher for households in which someone  was receiving job training. Similarly, the odds of participating in the Food  Stamp Program were about three times higher for those working  households participating in free lunch programs or in WIC than for those  not participating in those programs, and they were roughly twice as great  for those who received any SSI benefits.", "The first multivariate model (Model 1) provides estimates of the effects of  the various socioeconomic and demographic factors when they are  estimated simultaneously, using a multivariate logistic regression model.  While odds ratios estimating the different effect sizes change modestly in  some cases, most of the factors that appeared significant when they were  estimated from bivariate models remain significant when they are  estimated in a multivariate context and the effects of other factors are  controlled.", "Model 2 of the multivariate analysis shows the estimates of the effects of  participating in other programs, net of each other, and net of the effects of  the socioeconomic and demographic factors. Here too, most of these  effects remain consistent with what was found in the bivariate analyses,  except that receiving SSI does not appear to affect Food Stamp Program  participation net of the other factors and, when other factors are  controlled, households involved in the Children\u2019s Health Insurance  Program appear to be only a third as likely as households that do not  receive food stamps. While our estimates of the effects of participating in  other programs on food stamp participation are somewhat attenuated or  diminished when they are estimated simultaneously, rather than  independent of one another, it remains the case that households, including  someone who receives Medicaid, energy assistance, or job training are the  most likely to receive food stamps. We believe that, these multivariate  estimates of the effects of program participation are, by virtue of being  estimated simultaneously and while controlling for the socioeconomic and  demographic characteristics of the eligible households, somewhat better  estimates than those obtained in our bivariate analyses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Summary of Farm Bill Provisions", "paragraphs": ["Appendix II: Summary of Farm Bill Provisions  Treats legally obligated child support payments to a nonhousehold member as an income  exclusion rather than a deduction.", "Excludes types of income that are not used to determine eligibility for TANF or Medicaid,  with some exceptions  Simplified definition of resources (option)  Excludes certain types of resources that the state does not count for TANF or Medicaid.", "Simplified determination of housing costs  (option)", "Allows states to use a standard deduction from income of $143 per month for homeless  households with some shelter expenses  Disregard reported changes in deductions during certification periods except for changes  associated with a new residence or earned income until the next recertification.", "Expand simplified/semiannual reporting systems to most households, not just  those with earned income.", "Transitional food stamps for families  moving from welfare (option)", "Continue food stamp benefits to households for up to 5 months after they lose  TANF cash assistance.", "Simplifies the Standard Utility Allowance to promote its use.", "Pilot project to assess feasibility of issuing standardized rather than individual benefits to  certain residents of group homes.", "Require state agencies that have a Web site to post applications on these sites.", "Authorizes up to $5 million annually to pay for projects to improve access for food stamp- eligible households or to develop and implement simplified application and eligibility  systems.", "Reform of quality control (QC) system  This provision makes substantial changes to the QC system that measures states\u2019  payment accuracy in issuing food stamp benefits.
