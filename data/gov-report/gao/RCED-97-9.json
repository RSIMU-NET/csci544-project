States with large land areas that have comparatively small populations and most northeastern states generally elected not to apply for a variety of reasons.

The House of Representatives rejected the administration\u2019s proposal on the grounds that the pilot program is still in its very beginning stages and that any further expansion of the program should be considered in the context of the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA). The Senate provided $250 million for the SIB Pilot Program and allowed the Secretary of Transportation to distribute SIB funds to more than 10 states on the grounds that SIBs are a promising way of facilitating needed infrastructure investment, especially when all levels of government are facing constrained resources. The conferees agreed to provide $150 million for the SIB Pilot Program, which is to remain available until expended, out of the general fund rather than the Highway Trust Fund. In addition, no distribution of funds is to be made until 180 days from the date of enactment.

Furthermore, a longer-term anticipated benefit is that repaid SIB loans can be \u201crecycled\u201d as a source of funds for future transportation projects. Thus projects with potential revenue streams will be needed to make a SIB viable.

Until recently, states have generally not been able to tailor federal funding to a form other than a grant.", "Under the pilot program, a SIB is essentially an umbrella under which a variety of innovative financing techniques could be implemented. Much like a bank, a SIB would need equity capital to get started. This capital could come partially from federal funds. Once capitalized, the SIB could offer a range of loans and credit options. For example, through a revolving fund, states could lend money to public or private sponsors of transportation projects. Although new for federal transportation projects, revolving funds have been used for other infrastructure investment, such as wastewater treatment facilities required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).", "EPA\u2019s state revolving funds are structured in two different ways and can be used to illustrate how a transportation SIB might be set up. The first model is a basic revolving loan fund. Under this model, a state SIB would lend capital directly to projects; project-based revenues (such as tolls or dedicated taxes) would be used to repay loans with interest. The repayments would replenish the fund so that a new generation of loans could be made. The second model is a leveraged revolving fund. In this instance, states would use federal capital as reserves or collateral against which to borrow additional funds, usually by issuing bonds. The SIB would pay interest on the bonds but would in turn lend out the bond proceeds to individual projects. With this type of model, leveraging would increase the pool of capital available to support project loans. Furthermore, like the basic revolving fund, repayment of project loans plus interest would support the SIB\u2019s repayment of its bonds as well as provide funds for the SIB to loan to future projects. For example, Ohio plans to initially capitalize a SIB with $65.5 million, and issue $87 million in revenue bonds. As a result, the SIB could loan out a total of $152 million to projects.", "SIB funds could also be used to provide credit enhancements for transportation projects. Credit enhancements, such as loan guarantees or bond insurance, provide additional security to commercial lenders or private investors who may be providing funds as part of an overall financing package. Credit enhancements can also result in lower interest costs or greater borrowing power for a project.", "Some states view SIBs as complementary to their existing innovative financing efforts. For instance, Ohio\u2019s SIB application notes that as a result of numerous funding requests coming from the state transportation department\u2019s long-range multimodal transportation program, state law was modified to allow the state\u2019s Director of Transportation to make loans to agencies, organizations, and persons to acquire, develop, and/or construct transportation facilities. The law also authorized the director to deposit payments from such loans into a revolving fund for subsequent loans. While this fund is not identified as a SIB, Ohio\u2019s SIB application notes that essentially it is one, because the ability to make loans and receive payments is the basic underlying tenet of a SIB. Similarly, Arizona\u2019s SIB application notes that one of the state\u2019s key fiscal strategies has been to accelerate highway construction through the issuance of $3.1 billion in state transportation bonds. Arizona\u2019s SIB application stated that the SIB will build on the state agencies\u2019 recognized strengths in the bond-financing area, where there is a proven track record in accessing capital markets and maintaining high credit quality for bonds issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expedited Project Completion and Increased State And/or Local Investment Is an Important Benefit", "paragraphs": ["As shown in figure 3, officials from eight states we contacted said that the most important benefit of SIBs over the next 5 years is the expedited completion of the projects. By drawing on diverse sources for funds, more capital can be amassed, thus enabling a project to get started and completed sooner than otherwise possible. For instance, Arizona\u2019s SIB application listed five potential projects for SIB financing. With SIB financing, the state estimated that four of the projects could get under way in fiscal year 1997, rather than fiscal years 1999 through 2004 and that the fifth potential project, although not scheduled, may be able to get under way in fiscal year 1997 with SIB assistance.", "Some states also told us that in addition to completing individual projects faster, a SIB may provide the flexibility to complete a financial package for worthwhile projects that may be lower on the state\u2019s priority list because of their cost, demographic reasons, or political changes in priorities. For example, a major new road may simply be too costly to build, given that many small competing projects could be built with the same state funding. But if the project is financed in part from other sources, such as a local community and private investors, less state funds are needed, which in turn, may permit a state to fund more roads on its priority list.", "As the Texas SIB application notes, over the next 5 years, the state will be able to finance less than half of its identified transportation needs with currently available funding. The availability of SIB financial assistance will allow local communities to provide assistance and help bridge the funding gap. Communities that are willing to dedicate local revenue sources to complete particular projects but do not have well-established credit ratings or lack experience in capital financing will be aided by financial assistance from SIBs and associated technical assistance. Ohio plans to foster increased local contributions. Specifically, Ohio notes that its SIB will be reinforced by a project-rating system that identifies priorities for the selection of projects. Under this rating system, local communities can receive bonus points that upgrade the priority of their projects if they provide a significant portion of the project\u2019s funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits of Attracting Investment From the Private Sector", "paragraphs": ["Ten of the states we surveyed viewed SIBs\u2019 ability to attract private funds as providing some or great benefit. Private investment has not traditionally been involved in transportation projects because of the general lack of authority under federal law and because of some states\u2019 legislative and constitutional restrictions on giving or lending state funds to private entities to build and operate roads.", "A SIB may increase private investment by reducing the risk to the private investors. Credit enhancements, such as a loan guarantee, would help to ensure that federal and/or state funds committed to the project will be there when the bills come due. Members of the infrastructure finance community told us that one common fear among investors is that the political commitment and funds planned for a given project will not materialize because of competing state priorities. Even a relatively small government investment could increase the private sector\u2019s confidence. For example, California officials believe that state SIB investments of only 10 percent equity in some projects will give private lenders and investors the confidence to participate in funding the remaining 90 percent of the cost.", "Private investment can help close the gap for transportation needs that may otherwise go unmet or be forestalled for years. For instance, Oklahoma\u2019s SIB application explained that there are a number of growth industries in the state, all of which require enhanced transportation. For example, the southeast quadrant, the state\u2019s poorest quadrant, supports a growing food-processing industry and is experiencing an influx of hog farms, feed plants, and poultry-processing facilities. But further industry development depends on substantial improvements to the rural transportation network. State officials view a SIB as a vehicle to help facilitate private investment from businesses that would benefit from an improved transportation network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SIB\u2019s Goal Is to Be Self-Sustaining in the Future", "paragraphs": ["Looking toward the future, states that create revolving funds want the SIBs to be self-sustaining, and if the funds are leveraged, they would want the pool of resources available for loans to grow. However, this growth may take many years. Whether and when a SIB achieves growth depends on a number of factors, including (1) the degree to which loan interest rates are lower than market rates, (2) loan repayment periods, (3) the reliability of forecasted revenue streams, and (4) the amount of leverage employed. And not all SIBs will leverage funds.", "Only 18 states have leveraged funds under EPA\u2019s State Revolving Fund Program. In the State Revolving Fund context, leveraging means that states have the discretion to use the federal capital grants, as well as their matching shares, as collateral to borrow in the public bond market to increase the pool of available loan funds for projects. According to the Council of Infrastructure Financing Authorities, leveraging the State Revolving Fund has substantially increased the funds available for lending. The Council reported in August 1994 that close to $4 billion has been added to the loan pool by the 18 states that have leveraged their funds\u2014half as much as the nearly $8 billion provided in federal capital grants thus far. Furthermore, when assessing the future growth for those funds that are leveraged, the Council assumes conservatively that $1 for the State Revolving Fund program will generate an additional $2 in investments.", "Arizona\u2019s plans are an example of how a SIB could grow. The state plans to capitalize an initial SIB at $71.5 million, representing $64 million in federal funds and $7.5 million in state and/or local funds. The state plans to use that investment as a base for issuing bonds and make $20 million in initial loans to transportation projects with the bond proceeds. In approximately 20 years (by 2017), the state anticipates that loan repayments plus interest on the loans will increase its initial $71.5 million investment to $260 million in SIB loans. This amount in turn could be the basis for supporting an even larger bond issuance if the state decided to leverage its funds again.", "DOT estimated that $2 billion in federal capital provided through SIBs could be expected to attract an additional $4 billion for transportation investments, thus achieving a leverage ratio of 2 to 1. FHWA officials told us that this estimate is conservative and is based on EPA\u2019s State Revolving Fund program. FHWA officials said that SIBs could achieve a leverage ratio as high as 4 to 1. But as Washington State officials point out, FHWA\u2019s assertion is too general to prove or disprove. The return depends heavily upon individual projects and how \u201cleverage\u201d is defined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Barriers That May Impede States From Participating in a SIB Pilot", "paragraphs": ["Some state officials and industry experts remain skeptical that SIBs will produce the expected benefits. Some of the barriers cited include the following: (1) there are no additional federal funds to support SIB capitalization, (2) there are not enough revenue producing projects to sustain a SIB, and (3) there may be legal or constitutional state problems, such as prohibitions against the private sector\u2019s profiting from using government funds channeled through a SIB. Figure 4 shows states\u2019 responses to possible barriers to their participation in the pilot program.", "As figure 4 shows, states considered the lack of additional federal funds as the primary barrier to participating in the program.

Funding SIBs from existing funds, however, can act as a disincentive for states participating in the SIB Pilot Program. As figure 4 showed, 8 of the 15 states cited the absence of additional federal funds to capitalize a SIB as a factor that definitely diminished their likelihood of participating in the SIB Pilot Program. For instance, New York transportation officials told us that all their available federal and state funds are fully committed to planned highway and transit projects; thus, no funds are available to capitalize a SIB.", "Of the 11 states we surveyed that indicated interest in participating in the SIB Pilot Program, 9 provided us with estimates of the percentage of their available federal highway funds they expected to use to capitalize a SIB. Six of these states indicated that for fiscal years 1996 and 1997, they expected to use less than half of the federal highway funds allowed to capitalize a SIB.", "Some of the states\u2019 decisions reflect the fact that federal funds are already fully committed to planned projects, often for the next 3 to 5 years. Therefore, state officials do not expect to be able to rechannel funds for an alternative use, particularly in the early start-up years. According to a Texas transportation official, capitalizing a SIB within the next 5 years would mean diverting funds from planned projects with existing constituencies. This official was more optimistic that with the passage of time, rechanneling federal funds to a SIB would become easier as projects that could be supported through a SIB developed their own constituencies.", "To help with capitalization for SIBs in a constrained budget environment, some projects already planned with established financing may be brought under the SIB financing umbrella. Thereby, the SIB will be able to capture future project loan repayments. For instance, one of four potential projects identified in South Carolina\u2019s SIB application will receive financing through a planned issue of up to $60 million in state highway bonds. The proceeds of this bond issue will be loaned to the state turnpike authority to complete construction of a four-lane highway that will bypass the overcrowded main artery on Hilton Head Island. Under the terms of a loan agreement, tolls collected by the turnpike authority from the project will be used to repay the state DOT. It is the intention of the state DOT to move this transaction under the SIB.", "Similarly, one of the projects identified in the Texas SIB application already has financing, but the Texas DOT indicated its intent to bring the project under the institutional framework of the SIB, thus allowing loan repayments to be used for future SIB-assisted projects. If this is the only source of the SIB\u2019s capitalization, however, the operation of the Texas SIB will be delayed because repayment of the $135 million loan does not begin until 2004 and is spread over 25 years.", "A provision in DOT\u2019s fiscal year 1997 appropriation should also help with capitalization for SIBs. As previously mentioned, the appropriation provides $150 million for the SIB Pilot Program. The funding is to be made available until expended. DOT will need to decide how the funds will be allocated. DOT will have various options for allocating the funds, including (1) a proportional distribution based on states\u2019 historical share of federal highway funds for those states participating in the pilot program, (2) an equal distribution of the funds to all participating states, (3) an incentive to induce states to participate in the SIB pilot, or (4) a performance award to encourage certain actions or projects, such as fund leverage or particularly innovative project financing.

In turn, the states\u2019 and regions\u2019 population density and fiscal capacity, the acceptance of tolls by the public and legislators, and the availability and cost of the rights-of-way for start-up projects are factors in how much demand there will be for SIB-financed projects. Six of the states that we surveyed told us that an insufficient number of projects with a potential revenue stream would diminish the prospects that their state would participate in the SIB Pilot Program.", "Repayments for highway projects\u2019 debt could be derived through a number of ways; principal ones would include (1) vehicle tolls; (2) other project revenues, such as air or other rights of way, and revenues from commercial rest stops; (3) dedicated public revenues linked to the project, such as revenue districts or special benefit taxes, and general public revenues, such as development or sales taxes. Figure 5 shows the types of revenues that states indicated they would likely use to repay SIB loans.", "Ten of 11 states said they are considering tolls.

Michigan, for instance, said that it does not currently have the constitutional authority to lend money to the private sector. While Minnesota does have the authority to lend money to the private sector, state officials noted that they would need legislative changes, because their authority is currently restricted to lending funds interest-free to private firms to build toll roads. Thus, the state would need the legislative authority to charge interest on loans to the private sector. In addition, Minnesota officials stated that the SIB would need authority to reloan the money because any repayment of a transportation loan must currently be deposited into the state\u2019s general fund.", "Texas officials noted that participation in the SIB Pilot Program would be based on a two-phased approach. In the first phase of implementation (1996-97), the Texas SIB would use existing statutory and constitutional authority to provide financial assistance for highway toll projects. In January 1997, legislative changes would be sought to enable the Texas SIB to begin the second phase of the program\u2019s implementation and expand the types of recipients and projects eligible for assistance.", "Another impediment can arise if the SIB exposes the state to debt. Backing SIB financial assistance with the full faith and credit of the state is not legally permitted in some states. Without the guarantee of the full faith and credit of the state, the SIBs will have to rely on the strength of their project portfolio and initial capitalization as the basis for borrowing.", "For instance, South Carolina officials noted that the state constitution prohibits the outright guarantee of the full faith and credit of the state for the indebtedness of a private party. In addition, South Carolina officials note that any security or debt financing instrument or guarantee issued by their state SIB is not and should not be construed to be backed by the full faith and credit of the state of South Carolina or its agencies and does not constitute a commitment, guarantee, or obligation of the state. However, these officials do not believe that this prohibition will significantly affect the operations of a SIB because proposed legislation will limit the SIB\u2019s obligations to exclude the full faith and credit of the state. Similarly, Oregon\u2019s Department of Justice advised that Oregon\u2019s constitution prohibits lending the credit of the state. Therefore, SIB agreements will be structured to protect the state from assuming any prohibited obligations.", "Finally, some infrastructure finance experts question SIBs\u2019 prospects for attracting private sector involvement\u2014one of the program\u2019s primary goals. One principal barrier to attracting private capital is the fact that the Internal Revenue Code restricts private involvement in tax-exempt debt. In the case of state and local bonds, bondholders\u2019 interest earnings are exempt from federal taxes. However, the tax exemption does not apply to a bond issue if (1) the private sector uses more than 10 percent of the proceeds and finances more than 10 percent of the debt or (2) more than 5 percent of the proceeds or $5 million (whichever is less) is used to make loans to the private sector. Exempt facility bonds that meet volume and other statutory requirements are not subject to this rule. Exempt facility bonds are bonds for which 95 percent or more of the issue\u2019s net proceeds are to be used to provide specified facilities, including airports, docks and wharves, and mass-transit facilities.", "A number of infrastructure finance experts told us that states that choose to leverage their infrastructure banks will likely do so with tax-exempt debt because bondholders are willing to accept lower interest rates in exchange for the bonds\u2019 tax-exempt status. Restrictions on private involvement in tax-exempt debt are not unique to infrastructure banks. However, as a result of the restrictions, private participation in projects financed by leveraged banks could be inhibited under the terms of existing tax law."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["SIBs offer the promise of helping to close the gap between transportation needs and available resources by helping to attract other revenue sources.

The legislation authorizing the SIB Pilot Program provides that DOT submit a report to the Congress on the financial condition of each infrastructure bank established under the pilot program.

DOT agreed with our matter for congressional consideration and thought that a postponement of DOT\u2019s due date for reporting on the financial condition of SIBs to a date later than March 1, 1997, would allow the program time to develop and enable DOT to provide a more useful, substantive report. Regarding legal barriers to SIBs, officials from FHWA observed that states may be able to create SIBs under existing law. However, some states may have to overcome specific legal restrictions for their SIBs to engage in the full array of financing activities that can be used to address transportation needs.", "We performed our review from August 1995 through September 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As figure I.1 shows, advance construction was the finance tool that most states (8 of 15) believed they would make great use of in the next 5 years.

At the request of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the Chairman of that Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, we also briefly summarize information on states\u2019 interest in using other innovative financing mechanisms that are contained primarily in the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 in appendix I.", "To attain these objectives, we reviewed relevant sections of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the National Highway System (NHS) Designation Act of 1995, and the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Test and Evaluation Pilot Project. We reviewed the notice inviting states to apply for the pilot program, the application instructions, and application material submitted by individual states.", "We selected states for interviews prior to learning whether they applied and were selected to participate in the program. We were interested in obtaining the views of states that wanted to apply for participation in the pilot program as well as states that were not interested. We contacted transportation officials from 16 states and were able to obtain information from 15 states on their views, expectations, and plans (if any) to use SIBs, as well as their expectations on using certain other innovative finance tools. We conducted a telephone survey with the selected states and collected documentation from the surveyed states and from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) about states\u2019 SIB plans. The 15 states that provided us with information were Arkansas, California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington. These states were judgmentally selected to include states with interest in innovative finance tools and geographical balance.
