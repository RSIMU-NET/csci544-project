Seafood (finfish and crustaceans)  represented about 15 percent of the documented foodborne illness  outbreaks in the United States, according to CDC\u2019s data for 1997, the latest  year for which such data are available. Seafood-related illnesses could  result in a variety of problems, ranging from mild gastrointestinal  discomfort to neurological damage or death.", "Recognizing the potential for foodborne illness posed by seafood, the Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) implemented a new science-based seafood  safety program in 1997\u2014the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point  (HACCP) system. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) also adopted  a HACCP system for meat and poultry products. HACCP systems are  designed to improve the safety of food by having industry identify and  control known microbiological, physical, and chemical hazards in products  before they enter the market. FDA\u2019s HACCP regulations require that  domestic seafood-processing firms conduct an analysis to identify hazards  that are reasonably likely to occur and to develop and implement a plan to  control them. In addition, the HACCP regulations require seafood- processing firms to implement a written sanitation-operating procedure to,  among other things, avoid spreading contamination from one work surface  to another, control employee health conditions, and control pests. FDA  inspects seafood-processing firms to verify their compliance with these  HACCP requirements. Some state regulatory authorities also conduct  HACCP verification inspections under contract or in partnership with FDA.", "Imported seafood\u2014which constitutes more than one-half of all the seafood  consumed in the United States\u2014must meet these requirements as well.  That is, U.S. importers are required to demonstrate that seafood products  from foreign countries are produced in accordance with HACCP  regulations for U.S. seafood. The easiest way for importers to meet HACCP  responsibilities and requirements is to obtain seafood from foreign firms in  countries having an agreement with FDA that documents the equivalent  seafood safety systems. Currently, FDA has not completed any agreements  for seafood; therefore, importers are required to take affirmative steps to  demonstrate that seafood products from foreign countries are produced in  accordance with regulations for U.S. seafood. Such affirmative steps  include, for example, maintaining a copy of the foreign firms\u2019 HACCP plan  on file or obtaining a certificate from a foreign government\u2019s appropriate  inspection authority. FDA also inspects some foreign seafood firms as well  as U.S. importers to determine their compliance with FDA\u2019s HACCP  regulations and some imported seafood products at the U.S. port of entry to  verify their safety.", "In response to your request, we evaluated the effectiveness of FDA\u2019s system  to control the risk of foodborne illness resulting from unsafe domestic and  imported seafood. To conduct this review, we visited the three FDA  districts in which the largest volumes of seafood are produced\u2014Seattle,  New England, and Florida\u2014to analyze the results of FDA\u2019s inspections, to  conduct a probability sample of FDA\u2019s inspection reports, and to interview  FDA and industry personnel. We also reviewed selected aspects of the  seafood programs of Chile and Canada because these countries are large  exporters of seafood products to the United States and they have  implemented HACCP systems. In addition, we reviewed the status of  pending seafood equivalence agreements, FDA\u2019s inspection reports of  foreign seafood firms, the results of FDA\u2019s seafood inspections of U.S.  importers, and seafood examinations at ports of entry. Appendix I provides  additional details on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["CDC estimates that contaminated food causes 76 million illnesses, 325,000  hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States each year. On the  basis of the number of confirmed outbreaks of foodborne disease in 1997,  the latest year for which CDC\u2019s data are available, seafood is one of the  leading causes of foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States. For  example, seafood products represented about 15 percent, or 26, of the 169  foodborne illness outbreaks with a confirmed source\u2014a level greater than  that associated with meat and poultry products, which are consumed at,  respectively, 8 and 6 times the rate of seafood. However, CDC officials said  that foodborne illness outbreaks are generally underreported and that it is  easier to identify the source of some diagnosable illnesses, such as  scombroid poisoning from seafood, than illnesses resulting from some  nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms caused by other foods. FDA also  noted that some seafood-related illnesses may be caused by fish caught  recreationally. The actual number of individual cases of illness resulting  from traced outbreaks were higher for meat and poultry (619 and 353  cases, respectively) compared with 108 cases for seafood. Seafood  outbreaks may have involved fewer individual cases of illness because  seafood has much lower consumption rates than meat and poultry.", "Biological, chemical, and physical hazards can cause seafood-related  illnesses. Biological hazards include clostridium botulinum, listeria  monocytogenes, salmonella, and pathogenic staphylococcus. Chemical  hazards include compounds such as methylmercury, which can cause  illness from long-term exposure. Physical hazards include foreign objects  in food that can cause harm when eaten, such as glass or metal fragments.  According to FDA officials, two naturally occurring marine toxins with  potentially serious health effects\u2014scombrotoxin and ciguatoxin\u2014cause  most reported seafood-related illnesses, including gastrointestinal and  neurological problems. These naturally occurring toxins are biological in  origin but are categorized as chemical hazards, are heat resistant, and  cannot be inactivated by cooking. Appendix II provides additional  information on seafood-related illnesses and their symptoms.", "Since 1980, seafood consumption in the United States has risen about 22  percent, from 12.5 pounds per person in 1980 to 15.3 pounds per person in  1999. According to data from the National Marine Fisheries Service, the  United States imported about 3.9 billion pounds of fishery products during  1999 from about 160 countries. The top five seafood-exporting countries\u2014 Canada, Thailand, China, Ecuador, and Chile\u2014accounted for 50 percent of  the volume of imported seafood. Imported products include fresh and  frozen tuna and salmon as well as crustaceans, such as shrimp and  lobsters. Figure 1 shows the proportion of U.S. seafood imports from five  leading exporting countries.", "FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of both domestic and imported  seafood under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). In  1997, following recommendations by the National Academy of Sciences  and others, FDA adopted a program of preventive controls designed to  identify hazards early in the seafood-production process and minimize the  risk of contamination. The HACCP regulations made seafood-processing  firms responsible for identifying harmful microbiological, chemical, and  physical hazards that are reasonably likely to occur and for establishing  critical control points to prevent or reduce contamination. The HACCP  system is based on seven principles that each seafood firm must address.", "Conduct a hazard analysis. Identify hazards that are reasonably likely to  occur.", "Identify the critical control points (CCPs). Identify a point, step, or  procedure in the production process where controls can be applied to  prevent, eliminate, or reduce a food safety hazard that is reasonably  likely to occur to an acceptable level.", "Establish critical limits for each CCP. Set the maximum or minimum  value at which a hazard must be controlled at each CCP to prevent,  eliminate, or reduce the hazard to an acceptable level.", "Monitor each CCP. Establish monitoring activities that will ensure that  the process is under control at each CCP.", "Establish corrective actions. Define actions to be taken when  monitoring discloses a deviation from established critical limits.", "Establish verification procedures. Establish verification procedures to  ensure that HACCP plans accomplish their intended goal\u2014ensuring the  production of safe products.", "Establish record-keeping and documentation procedures. Maintain  documentation, including the HACCP plan, CCP monitoring, critical  limits, and verification activities.", "Under the HACCP rule, seafood-processing firms are responsible for  conducting a hazard analysis and for developing and implementing HACCP  plans for hazards determined to be reasonably likely to occur: natural  toxins, microbiological contamination, chemical contamination, pesticides,  drug residues, decomposition in certain species, parasites, unapproved use  of food or color additives, and physical hazards. For each hazard identified,  the firms must establish critical control points to prevent or reduce  contamination. Firms must also establish and monitor sanitation  procedures to ensure, among other things, the (1) general cleanliness of  food contact surfaces, including utensils, gloves, and outer garments, and  (2) control of employee health conditions.", "To assist industry with HACCP compliance, FDA published the Fish and  Fisheries Products Hazards and Controls Guide, which discusses, among  other things, how to perform a hazard analysis, develop a HACCP plan, and  identify critical control points. The guide provides species-specific and  process-related examples of hazards reasonably likely to occur, but as its  name suggests, this document is only guidance; seafood firms are not  required to follow it. The guide, according to FDA, has been translated into  other languages, is used by regulatory authorities in other countries, and  has served as a catalyst for discussions between the seafood industry, other  interested stakeholders, and FDA about the scientific merits of hazards and  controls.", "According to the National Fisheries Institute, seafood firms generally  support the HACCP system because it has, among other things, caused the  industry to look at how best to manage hazards and how to look at food  safety from a science-based perspective\u2014for example, what hazards are  likely to cause illness, how frequently people are becoming ill, and how  serious those illnesses are. Also, according to FDA, two surveys of the  industry taken by the New York Sea Grant Extension program and others  report that in response to HACCP, the industry is engaging in upgrades to  facilities, equipment, and daily plant operations to ensure safety.", "To help implement and oversee HACCP systems, for industry personnel  and FDA inspectors, FDA developed a training and certification program  that is intended to ensure that they have the necessary expertise to  evaluate HACCP systems. The training program is offered by the National  Seafood HACCP Alliance\u2014an academic, government, and industry  consortium. The Alliance\u2019s course is the standardized curriculum by which  FDA evaluates other HACCP courses; it contains the information necessary  to meet the HACCP-training requirements. Course participants receive a  certificate. The seafood HACCP regulations require that industry personnel  responsible for developing HACCP plans, reassessing and modifying the  plan, and performing record reviews successfully complete training in the  application of HACCP principles for fish and fishery products at least  equivalent to those received under the FDA-approved course. However, the  regulations also state that job experience will qualify an individual to  perform these functions if he or she has provided knowledge at least  equivalent to that provided through the standardized curriculum.", "FDA periodically inspects seafood firms to check on their sanitary  conditions and to verify compliance with the HACCP requirements. To  determine whether seafood firms identify all safety hazards and whether  they are consistently controlling those hazards, FDA inspectors survey the  plant and then review the HACCP records. From 1998 through 1999, FDA  inspected all seafood firms in its inventory at least once to verify  compliance with the new HACCP-based system. In the budget for fiscal  year 2000, Congress provided $267 million for FDA\u2019s food programs\u2014a $32  million increase over FDA\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1999. Some of this  increase was to enhance the coverage of both domestic and imported  foods, including the increased inspection of high-risk food and continued  implementation of the HACCP requirement for seafood. While FDA  believes that additional funds are needed to ensure the safety of the food  supply, it now inspects seafood firms annually. Prior to these annual  inspections, FDA inspected seafood firms once every 4 years on average,  according to FDA officials.", "Generally, FDA personnel inspect one or two seafood products at each firm  inspected. The number of seafood products handled by each firm varies.  According to FDA, seafood-processing firms collectively handle over 350  species of fish. For example, the seafood firms that we visited in Norfolk  and Philadelphia processed a wide range of products, including fresh and  frozen fish, such as salmon, tuna, bluefish, mahi-mahi, mackerel, and  grouper; crustaceans, such as lobster and crabs; and shellfish, such as  oysters and clams. FDA\u2019s policy was to give priority to inspecting products  considered to be high-risk, including  vacuumed-packaged seafood (these products are subject to the growth  of Clostridium botulinum, a toxin producing bacteria);  ready-to-eat seafood, such as cooked shrimp and crabmeat and hot or  cold smoked fish (these products are subject to the growth of pathogens  from post-process contamination);  histamine-forming species, including mahi-mahi, tuna, and bluefish  (these products are subject to histamine formation\u2014a toxic substance);  and  stuffed seafood products (processing and handling may allow toxins to  develop in these products).", "FDA can take several regulatory actions when firms are cited for HACCP  violations. For example, if in the agency\u2019s judgment the violation cited is of  regulatory significance, it may issue the firm a warning letter. FDA issues  warning letters in cases where violations raise safety concerns that may  lead to enforcement action, such as product seizure or injunction (a court  order to refrain from distributing a product), and/or prosecution if not  promptly and adequately corrected. In the case of importers, a warning  letter could advise them of a forthcoming detention. Firms that receive  warning letters are asked to respond to FDA in writing within 15 working  days to indicate what actions will be taken to correct the problems  identified. If the firm does not correct the violation promptly and  adequately, FDA can pursue enforcement actions, such as product seizure  or injunction through the courts.", "In 1996, USDA issued HACCP regulations for meat and poultry firms.  However, before implementing HACCP, USDA established the prevalence,  or baseline, levels for a number of microbial organisms in meat and poultry,  including salmonella, E-coli, listeria, and campylobacter. These baseline  data provided USDA with a starting point for evaluating the effectiveness of  HACCP in terms of lowering the bacterial levels in the product. For  example, USDA regularly collects and tests samples of meat and poultry  products for the presence of salmonella and then compares the results with  pre-HACCP baseline data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Domestic Seafood Safety System Does Not Effectively Protect Consumers From Unsafe Seafood", "paragraphs": ["FDA has made some progress in ensuring the safety of domestic seafood  consumed by the public. According to FDA\u2019s December 2000 report on the  evaluation of the HACCP system for seafood, the percentage of seafood  firms with a HACCP plan that included all of the required components  increased from 31 percent in 1998 to 44 percent in 1999. However, FDA  recognizes that gaps still exist in HACCP\u2019s implementation and that certain  segments of the industry are lagging behind. Our evaluation shows that  several flaws in FDA\u2019s system for ensuring the safety of domestic seafood  may allow unsafe seafood products to reach consumers. First, a significant  number of seafood firms and/or products are not operating under the  HACCP regulations. Second, even when seafood-processing firms are  subject to HACCP requirements, FDA inspections do not fully evaluate the  firms\u2019 operations because such inspections were frequently limited to a  paperwork review rather than actual observation of product processing.  Furthermore, at both these inspections and those where FDA observed the  processing of products subject to HACCP requirements, the agency found  that over half of the HACCP plans had serious violations. Third, when  violations of regulatory significance were identified, FDA did not take  timely action to issue warning letters notifying seafood firms that they must  correct the violations promptly and adequately to avoid further  enforcement action, such as seizure or injunction. Finally, FDA lacks, and  has no immediate plans to obtain, the basic information needed to assess  the effectiveness of its HACCP requirements to ensure the safety of  seafood."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Seafood Firms Are Excluded From HACCP Requirements", "paragraphs": ["HACCP regulations apply to all seafood-processing firms, but a significant  number do not operate HACCP systems. As a result, the benefits of  HACCP\u2014identifying and controlling food safety hazards\u2014are not being  fully obtained, thus placing consumers at risk of consuming unsafe  seafood.", "While FDA is responsible for overseeing all seafood-processing firms  operating in interstate commerce, it does not have an effective system to  identify such entities because it does not have a registration requirement  for seafood firms. Although the exact number of seafood firms under FDA\u2019s  jurisdiction is unknown, industry and government officials believe it is  larger than the approximately 3,600 or so seafood firms in FDA\u2019s official  inventory. FDA officials stated that the agency has the authority to register  some seafood-processing firms under its authority to impose emergency  permit control regulations. However, the agency does not require  registration of any seafood-processing firm except those that process low- acid or acidified canned food. FDA uses a variety of ways to identify  seafood firms under its jurisdiction, including checks of the telephone  book yellow pages, newspapers, magazines, trade periodicals, state  inventory records, and consumer complaints. However, we reported in the  past that such identification efforts are time-consuming, costly, and  ineffective and pointed out to FDA that a simple registration system based  on a requirement that processors operating in interstate commerce notify  FDA when they begin operations would cost little.", "Furthermore, while all land-based seafood-processing firms are subject to  HACCP requirements, thousands of commercial fishing vessels are exempt,  even though they may present hazards and risks similar to those posed by  land-based seafood-processing firms. FDA\u2019s HACCP regulations exempt  vessels that (1) harvest and transport fish without any further processing  and (2) head, eviscerate, or freeze fish on board solely to prepare them for  holding. Fishing vessels that process fish beyond these provisions, (e.g.,  factory ships that fillet or pack their catch), are subject to HACCP  requirements. Currently, FDA\u2019s inventory shows that 250 vessels are subject  to HACCP requirements. However, the number of vessels that should be  subject to HACCP requirements and inspections is not known because  neither FDA nor any other organization we contacted has information on  vessels that process fish on board. An official for the state of Alaska noted  that the number of vessels that process fish on board and are thus subject  to state inspections is almost twice as large as the number of vessels in  FDA\u2019s inventory. Also, an official in one of FDA\u2019s district offices noted that  from 400 to 800 fishing vessels in his district may perform some type of  processing.", "FDA officials said they decided to exempt most vessels from the regulatory  definition of \u201cprocessors\u201d and thus exempt them from HACCP regulations  because of practical considerations. Namely, the fishing fleet is so large  that FDA believes that inspecting the fleet would overwhelm the inspection  system. FDA also believes that if it requires the fleet to comply with  HACCP requirements, some fishing vessels may decide to avoid heading  and gutting fish on board. FDA officials said that this would pose a greater  risk for product safety and quality. While these observations have merit, the  HACCP regulations are intended to cover the heading, eviscerating, or  freezing of seafood products so that hazards reasonably likely to occur  during these processing steps may be controlled.", "Finally, about one-third of the seafood products FDA inspected are not  required to have a HACCP plan, including many products at warehouses  and repacking firms. Under the seafood HACCP regulations, seafood- processing firms are required to identify the food safety hazards that are  reasonably likely to occur and implement measures to control these  hazards; then FDA inspectors independently make a similar assessment  during their inspections. If the seafood firm determines and the FDA  inspector agrees that no hazards are reasonably likely to occur, the seafood  firm is not required to have a HACCP plan for the products inspected. FDA  inspectors may determine that a firm does not need a HACCP plan because,  in their view, the product is of low risk.", "According to FDA\u2019s statistics for inspections in 1999, HACCP plans were  not required for 30 percent, or 1,055, of the 3,525 products inspected  because the inspector determined that no hazards were reasonably likely to  occur. For example, on the basis of the seafood hazards guide, FDA  inspectors concluded that there were no risks associated with 516 products  because storage at warehouses and repacking firms did not present a  significant hazard. Therefore, HACCP plans were not needed for seafood  products at these locations. FDA officials said that most warehouses do not  handle high-risk products, such as scombroid species. However,  temperature controls for refrigerated products are very important to  prevent certain hazards, such as botulism in smoked vacuum-packed  products or scombroid poisoning in certain fish species. FDA officials said  that final product storage, especially for nonfrozen product, is a weakness  at some seafood firms because refrigeration problems, such as equipment  breakdowns or uncalibrated thermometers, may prevent these firms from  keeping seafood products at appropriate temperatures. Our review of a  sample of FDA inspection reports from three districts verified that some  firms experience problems ensuring that temperatures are maintained. For  example, we estimate that in about 30 percent of these reports, FDA  inspectors found that instruments such as freezer and cooler thermometers  were not properly calibrated. Without a HACCP plan with critical controls  and monitoring procedures, such problems may go undetected for  prolonged periods of time and jeopardize product safety.", "In contrast, USDA\u2019s regulations for meat and poultry products require that  every plant in its inventory of approximately 5,700 plants, identify at least  one critical control point for each identified hazard. Agency officials said  they are not aware of any meat and poultry operations that can be deemed,  categorically, to pose no likely hazards. Some USDA officials involved  with meat and poultry regulation, including the Assistant Deputy  Administrator for District Enforcement Operations, stated that it is difficult  to understand how no hazards are likely to occur in seafood firms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Is Not Effectively Ensuring HACCP Implementation", "paragraphs": ["FDA uses on-site unannounced inspections to assess a firm\u2019s compliance  with HACCP requirements. As part of this process FDA inspects the  general sanitary conditions of the firm and equipment. Critical components  of the inspection also include an evaluation of HACCP plans, review of  HACCP records, and in-plant observations of the product selected for  inspection. However, we found that FDA inspectors frequently could not  conduct in-plant observations of the selected product. We estimate that in  almost half (48 percent) of the seafood inspections at three FDA districts in  fiscal year 1999, the selected product was not being processed on the day  of the inspection. In other words, FDA inspectors did not make an in-plant  observation of the product but instead conducted a paperwork review. FDA  officials said that because inspections are unannounced, there were  instances where the product selected was not being processed and FDA  inspectors were limited to a review of plant records to verify compliance.  FDA\u2019s compliance manual recommends that inspectors return to physically  inspect the product if at the time of their plant visit, the product was not  being processed. However, FDA inspectors generally did not return to the  firm to inspect the products originally selected for inspection. Officials in  the three districts we visited said that, as a general rule, insufficient  inspection resources prevent them from returning to observe the selected  product. FDA inspection records did not show such follow-up inspections,  and FDA inspectors told us they did not conduct them. In an October 1999  memorandum to FDA District Directors, FDA acknowledged the need to  observe the selected product during processing by stating that HACCP  inspections emphasized the need for more in-plant observations of the  selected products. An FDA official explained that inspectors should spend  most of their inspection time observing the selected product in the  processing environment, especially those that are considered high-risk.", "In addition, almost 3 years after HACCP was implemented, FDA\u2019s data on  industry compliance shows that many seafood firms have yet to meet the  basic requirements for a HACCP plan. That is, 22 percent (542 of 2,470) of  the products inspected by FDA in 1999 that required a HACCP plan did not  have one. Of those that did have a HACCP plan as required, FDA\u2019s data  show that more than half (1,080 of 1,928) contained serious deficiencies,  according to FDA inspectors. The plans were judged to have serious  deficiencies because, according to FDA\u2019s compliance manuals, they (1) did  not identify hazards that FDA considers serious, such as pathogens and  toxins; (2) did not identify an appropriate critical control point where the  hazard could be controlled; (3) did not identify an appropriate critical limit,  or operating parameter for the critical control point; (4) did not identify  appropriate monitoring procedures; (5) did not identify appropriate record- keeping procedures; and (6) did not identify adequate corrective action  procedures.", "According to FDA officials, the grading system used for this evaluation  required that HACCP plans have all five of the most significant components  adequately addressed and, therefore, was a rigorous evaluation of the  industry\u2019s compliance. FDA said that it was not easy for seafood firms to  score 100 percent on all elements, even though they succeeded in many of  the individual elements. In general, FDA believes that it will take time for  all of the seafood firms subject to HACCP regulations to fully comply with  the requirements. In its December 2000 HACCP evaluation report for  seafood, FDA said it would intensify its inspection efforts to focus on  improving compliance.", "Our analysis of a probability sample of inspections\u2019 records from three FDA  districts yielded similar results. We estimate that in about 55 percent of the  FDA inspections of products with HACCP plans, the inspector found one or  more serious violations. Table 1 summarizes the type and estimated  frequency of the violations identified by FDA inspectors.", "The potential health risks associated with these violations are significant  because they can involve the failure to establish critical limits for high-risk  products, such as cooked ready-to-eat seafood. The failure to establish  cooking critical limits for cooked ready-to-eat products can allow  pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes to survive, and possibly cause  listeriosis\u2014a serious and often fatal condition to humans. FDA\u2019s  compliance data for fiscal year 1999 show that 40 percent of the HACCP  plans covering cooked ready-to-eat products did not establish adequate  time and temperature critical limits to prevent, reduce, or eliminate these  types of hazards.", "Even if the plans were complete, according to FDA requirements, they  would still omit a serious hazard because methylmercury, a highly toxic  substance, is not identified or covered in FDA\u2019s seafood guide as a hazard  reasonably likely to occur. According to a July 2000 National Research  Council report, contaminated fish is the major source of human exposure  to methylmercury in the United States and can cause, among other things,  serious neurological problems, such as mental retardation in young  children. The risk to public health posed by methylmercury is based on  how much of the contaminant is in fish and how much fish people eat.", "FDA\u2019s guidance to industry does not discuss the identification and control  of methylmercury even though FDA\u2019s tests for methylmercury in shark and  swordfish found that 9 of 18 samples analyzed in 1998 and 1999 met or  exceeded FDA\u2019s 1.0-part-per- million action level. These test results  pertained to imported products.", "FDA officials said that most commercial seafood species have very low  levels of methylmercury. They also said that the species that contain the  highest average amounts of methylmercury\u2014shark and swordfish\u2014are  expensive and, therefore, consumed infrequently. Thus, FDA considers  that, in most species, methylmercury is not a hazard that is reasonably  likely to occur and that HACCP controls are not needed. Furthermore,  FDA\u2019s position is that if there were an industrial incident or similar event  that could raise the levels of mercury in commercial seafood, they would  examine whether HACCP controls are warranted and issue new guidance  as necessary.", "FDA has been evaluating new data on the health effects of methylmercury  from the consumption of fish. However, the agency has not established a  timeline for completing its evaluation. Moreover, FDA officials stated that  the agency is unlikely to include any guidance to industry in the next  edition of its Fish and Fisheries guide to be issued in calendar year 2001. In  the meantime, FDA advises industry and inspectors not to identify  methylmercury as a hazard reasonably likely to occur. However, before  HACCP\u2019s implementation, FDA\u2019s draft Fish and Fisheries Guide identified  methylmercury as a potential hazard in certain seafood species consumed  by humans, including swordfish and tuna. Furthermore, in 1995, FDA  updated its consumer advisory warning pregnant women and women of  childbearing age to limit their consumption of shark and swordfish because  of potential methylmercury contamination. In January 2000, FDA revised  its methylmercury advisory and now recommends that women who are  pregnant, or who are of childbearing age and may become pregnant, avoid  eating the four species of fish known to have the highest levels of  methylmercury: shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish.", "Even when FDA identifies serious violations at a seafood-processing firm,  it does not take timely regulatory action to ensure compliance. When  interactions between inspection personnel and plant personnel fail to  obtain compliance, warning letters are the principal means of notifying the  plants of serious violations and achieving prompt corrective action before  proceeding to more stringent enforcement actions. Warning letters are to  be issued for violations of regulatory significance\u2014i.e., violations that  affect product safety and may lead to enforcement action, such as product  seizure or injunction, if not promptly and adequately corrected. To ensure  the prompt and adequate correction of serious violations, FDA\u2019s regulatory  procedures manuals state that warning letters should be approved within  15 working days of the receipt of the district office\u2019s recommendation.", "According to FDA\u2019s analysis of 52 warning letters processed in calendar  year 2000, 94 percent, or 49, exceeded recommended issuance time frames  thus significantly delaying notification to industry of observed problems  that needed correction. On average, 73 days elapsed between the receipt of  the district offices\u2019 recommendation and the approval of the warning  letters.", "Our analysis of 162 warning letters issued to domestic firms nationwide  after inspections conducted in fiscal year 1999 parallels these findings\u2014 that is, three-quarters of the letters exceeded the issuance time frames by  30 days or more. More significantly, we found that 67 percent of these  letters were associated with high-risk products, including scombrotoxin- susceptible seafood, which, if not properly handled, could cause serious  health problems requiring hospitalization, particularly in the case of elderly  individuals.", "FDA headquarters officials explained that issuance time frames are  exceeded primarily because of the need to ensure that recommendations in  district offices\u2019 warning letters are consistent with agency policy. They  explained that changes in agency policy are sometimes necessitated by  changes in the science associated with HACCP systems and that, in some  cases, a significant amount of time is needed to review new or updated  policy to ensure that it is interpreted correctly. Also, a significant number  of the recommendations in the domestic warning letters submitted by the  districts require changes because the letters did not correctly cite serious  or critical deficiencies. FDA district officials cited an increase in the  number of warning letters issued and the lack of adequate resources as  reasons for not meeting the issuance time frames for warning letters.

More importantly, U.S. consumers may continue to be placed at risk of  contracting foodborne illness from contaminated domestic and imported  seafood products.", "Without requiring registration of all domestic seafood firms, FDA cannot  effectively ensure that all seafood products are processed under the  HACCP regulations. Similarly, FDA cannot ensure that all seafood products  are operating under HACCP systems if it continues to exclude vessels that  meet its criteria for land-based seafood firms. Unless FDA verifies that  industry identifies and controls all hazards reasonably likely to occur, it  cannot ensure that industry is implementing an effective HACCP system.  And without the actual observation of the seafood products selected for  inspection, FDA inspectors cannot ensure full compliance with HACCP  requirements. Also, without prompt completion of its ongoing evaluation of  methylmercury, FDA is unable to give direction to the industry on whether  it should establish HACCP controls for this hazard, thus potentially placing  consumers at risk of exposure to unsafe levels of methylmercury.  Furthermore, without FDA\u2019s timely notification to industry when  deficiencies are observed, serious problems are not corrected promptly.

FDA  stated that it had made significant improvements in the regulation of the  seafood industry through the establishment of the HACCP system, but  recognized that areas need to be strengthened. FDA said it plans to or has  begun actions to address these areas. Regarding the eight specific  recommendations we made to FDA, the agency generally concurred with  six and disagreed with two. FDA also raised some concerns about  inferences that could be drawn from the report. For example, FDA said that  our draft report implied that seafood was, on the whole, riskier than other  commercial sources of animal protein because of the way we presented  foodborne illness outbreak data for seafood in comparison to data for meat  and poultry. FDA said that, according to CDC, outbreak data should not be  used to determine whether seafood is more or less dangerous than other  foods. We modified our report to include the actual number of cases  associated with seafood and meat and poultry outbreaks. We also added  CDC\u2019s observation that diagnosable illnesses, such as scombroid poisoning  from seafood, are more easily recognized than illnesses from nonspecific  gastrointestinal symptoms caused by other foods. (See app. IV for FDA\u2019s  written comments and our response. FDA also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate.)", "FDA generally concurred that it should (1) verify that HACCP systems  identify and control all hazards reasonably likely to occur; (2) emphasize to  inspectors the need to revisit firms to observe actual product processing  and establish a system to ensure that those visits occur; (3) develop  milestones for completing its ongoing evaluation of methylmercury and  determining whether it is a hazard reasonably likely to occur; (4) issue  warning letters in a more timely manner; (5) develop baseline data, such as  testing for a specific hazard, to measure the effectiveness of its seafood  safety program; and (6) communicate HACCP system deficiencies  identified during FDA importer inspections and foreign country inspections  to port of entry personnel.", "FDA did not concur with our recommendation to require that all seafood- processing firms, including vessels, operate under HACCP requirements.  FDA said that the vast majority of vessels currently exempt from the  HACCP requirements conduct limited processing on board, making it  unlikely that they would introduce significant food safety hazards that need  to be controlled. While FDA\u2019s comments provide additional information on  the agency\u2019s position on this issue, we continue to believe that our  recommended action is warranted. Numerous fishing vessels handle high- risk products, such as tuna, which if not kept at appropriate temperatures,  can result in foodborne illness. Absent a comprehensive inventory of all  seafood-processing operations, including those on board vessels, FDA is  unable to ensure that the HACCP system for identifying and controlling  hazards is uniformly and consistently applied. If upon reviewing a vessel\u2019s  operation, FDA determines that food safety hazards are not reasonably  likely to occur, FDA may decide that a HACCP plan is not required for that  vessel. Furthermore, seafood processors and vessels that are not exempted  from HACCP requirements are required to establish and implement a  written sanitation standard operating procedure. Therefore, bringing  vessels under the HACCP regulatory requirements would require them to  have written sanitation operating procedures, even if FDA determined they  do not need a HACCP plan.", "FDA also did not concur with our recommendation that the agency develop  specific goals and time frames for establishing equivalence agreements  while Congress considers mandating the certification of other countries\u2019  equivalence before their seafood products are allowed entry into the  United States. In commenting on this recommendation, FDA noted that  foreign equivalencies is one of its priorities for fiscal year 2001, but said  that a considerable exchange of data among the countries involved must  take place before equivalency determinations can be made. We continue to  believe, however, that this recommendation has merit for a variety of  reasons. First, without goals and time frames, there is little or no incentive  to complete equivalence agreements. For example, FDA and the Canadian  Food Inspection Agency have had discussions and have engaged in  activities aimed at determining equivalence of the two countries\u2019 systems  for over 3-1/2 years, since Canada first requested such action in 1997.  Second, importers are responsible for ensuring that imported seafood  meets HACCP requirements either by importing from countries with an  equivalence agreement or by providing documentary support. However,  because FDA has no equivalence agreements, seafood importers must use  the more difficult and costly alternative of providing documentary support.  Finally, it is generally recognized that establishing equivalence agreements  with countries that have comparable safety and sanitation systems is the  most effective way to ensure the safety of imported food. Equivalence  agreements will help FDA reduce its reliance on importer and port of entry  inspections and enable it to leverage its staff resources by sharing the  responsibility for seafood safety with the exporting countries. Establishing  goals and time frames will help FDA measure its progress toward obtaining  such agreements and assist Congress in determining when to mandate that  FDA certify an exporting countries equivalence, if Congress decides to do  so.", "We conducted our review from February through December 2000 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the  date of this letter.

In 1996, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and industry formed  a task force to further study and improve the system. The resulting Quality  Management Program (QMP) requires that all seafood companies develop,  maintain, and implement comprehensive quality and safety plans. Seafood  companies are required to register with the inspection agency, and each  processor\u2019s QMP plan must include the following:  Management roles and responsibilities, which may include a written  description of each manager\u2019s accountability or a written statement of  commitment signed by all management staff.", "Product and process information that includes product descriptions and  processing steps.", "A prerequisite plan that addresses facilities design; construction;  maintenance; and all potential sources of contamination, including  employee hygiene; and company recall procedures.", "A regulatory action point plan that describes controls designed to  ensure that the products meet fish inspection regulations addressing  tainted, decomposed or unwholesome products, packaging materials  and ingredients, and labeling requirements.", "A HACCP plan identifying and addressing any health and safety hazards  related to the product or process by applying the seven HACCP  principles.", "Steps for verifying and maintaining the QMP plan.", "The inspection agency reviews the QMP plans, including HACCP plans,  before they are put into effect by seafood firms. A written hazard analysis is  part of the required documentation. Once the plan is implemented, the  inspection agency conducts in-depth audits of the QMP\u2019s implementation.", "For imported seafood products, Canada adopted a two-tier regulatory  system. Importers that have a regular license can import seafood products  from any country but must notify the inspection agency within 48 hours of  the product\u2019s entry. Depending on the product\u2019s history, the inspection  agency decides whether to detain the product for visual examination  and/or testing. Inspection agency officials stated that, on average, they test  about 15 percent of all imported seafood in this category. Alternatively,  importers may voluntarily participate in the QMP for Importers. The  program allows seafood importers to develop their own system for  monitoring and evaluating products that they import while the inspection  agency conducts quarterly audits of participating companies to ensure  compliance with seafood safety standards. Importers must perform or have  performed product testing at a minimum frequency of 15 percent or as  otherwise established in Canadian agreements with other countries. The  inspection agency has also provided an incentive for importers to obtain  products from foreign companies that have a good history of compliance.  Under this arrangement, foreign seafood firms with a good compliance  record are considered for reduced inspection frequencies at an importer\u2019s  request. If approved, they are incorporated in the \u201cA\u201d list. To be part of this  list, a foreign seafood firm must, at a minimum, have 10 acceptable  inspections from at least 30 imported lots of seafood. Firms on the \u201cA\u201d list  are subjected to unannounced inspections at predetermined frequencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chile\u2019s Seafood Safety Program", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, Chile implemented a HACCP-based inspection program for  seafood to improve the effectiveness of its seafood exporters\u2019 certification  program and to respond to future requirements of Chile\u2019s major export  markets\u2014the European Union (Directive 91/493/CEE) and the United  States. The Chilean National Seafood Service (Servicio Nacional de Pesca,  Sernapesca) administers Chile\u2019s seafood safety program. Chilean officials  said that the HACCP system in Chile is modeled after the U.S. National  Marine Fisheries Service System and Canadian systems. Therefore, it  incorporates sanitation, safety, and quality features. Seafood exporters,  including factory vessels, must be registered and authorized to export  through the certification program. It is illegal to operate without registering  with Sernapesca. In order to receive an export certification, exporters must  implement the HACCP requirements.", "Sernapesca issued procedures manuals, technical norms, and inspection  instructions. Together, these documents instruct industry and inspectors  on how to review and validate HACCP plans, how to collect official  samples, and how to conduct objective inspections. Sernapesca must  review and approve HACCP plans. Seafood exporters are required to  maintain a written hazard analysis plan and to have it available for  inspection. Officials think it is important to know the reasoning for  inclusion or exclusion (in the HACCP plans) of hazards reasonably likely to  occur.", "Sernapesca conducts monthly sanitation inspections of seafood exporters.  If the exporter fails the sanitation inspection, it is removed from  Sernapesca\u2019s approved exporter list and thus can no longer receive export  certification. Vessels are inspected when they come into port\u2014every 3  months on average. Seafood firms are instructed to conduct biweekly  verifications of their HACCP systems, and Sernapesca inspects firms once  every 2 to 3 months, depending on the product.

These categories determine whether firms will continue to  be certified."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Food and Drug Administration", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s  letter dated January 17, 2001."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We modified our report to include the actual number of cases associated  with seafood and with meat and poultry outbreaks. We also added CDC\u2019s  observation that reported illness outbreaks tend to be for illnesses more  likely to be recognized. According to CDC, diagnosable illnesses, such as  scombroid poisoning from seafood, are more easily recognized than  illnesses from nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms caused by other  foods. 2. We believe that until FDA develops an inventory that identifies and  assesses each vessel\u2019s on-board activities, FDA\u2019s view that vessels not  performing functions beyond preparing the catch for holding pose little or  no risks lacks credibility. Numerous fishing vessels handle high-risk  products, such as tuna, which if not properly handled or held\u2014kept at the  appropriate temperature\u2014may result in foodborne illness. Furthermore,  although the number of vessels processing seafood on-board is unknown,  federal and state officials\u2019 estimates lead us to conclude that a significant  number could be conducting on-board processing similar to that conducted  by land-based seafood firms. Land-based seafood firms that head,  eviscerate, and freeze products are required to comply with the HACCP  regulations. Exempting vessels from the HACCP regulations also  eliminates the requirement for a written standard operating procedure for  sanitation aimed at ensuring basic sanitation procedures and practices. We  modified the report to clarify the HACCP regulatory requirements for  vessels.", "With respect to FDA\u2019s comments on domestic firms found not to need  HACCP plans, we did not mean to suggest that all 1,055 of FDA\u2019s  determinations exempting products from needing HACCP plans were  incorrect. We do question, however, whether FDA inspectors were justified  in exempting as many as 516 of these products on the grounds that storage  and repacking firms do not handle products presenting significant hazards.  In our view, many of these firms handle products with significant hazards  and should have HACCP plans. We did modify the report to include FDA\u2019s  view that frozen products do not present significant food safety risks. 3. We agree that since the publication of our 1998 report, FDA has initiated  actions to improve controls over imported foods aimed at preventing  unscrupulous importers from bypassing or subverting port-of-entry  activities. However, the fact remains that without equivalence agreements,  FDA has to rely on labor-intensive inspections of products at the port of  entry as its primary line of defense against the entry of unsafe foods. We  continue to believe that port-of-entry inspections alone do not effectively  ensure the safety of imported seafood. Using port-of-entry inspections to  augment a program certifying that imported products are produced under  equivalent food safety systems is a much more efficient and effective way  to ensure the safety of imported foods. Providing FDA with authority  similar to that provided for the Food Safety and Inspection Service would  allow FDA to leverage its resources and provide greater assurance that  imported seafood is safe. Accordingly, we did not modify the report. 4. We agree with FDA\u2019s comment that its efforts to gather and analyze  seafood firms\u2019 compliance with HACCP requirements have merit but  continue to believe that compliance information alone is not a good  indicator of the seafood program\u2019s impact on reducing contamination that  could cause foodborne illness. A performance-based measurement, such as  that used by USDA, would improve FDA\u2019s evaluation of the effectiveness of  its programs for ensuring seafood safety. While there may not be any single  widespread hazard in seafood, scombrotoxin and ciguatoxin caused 46 and  42 percent of seafood illness outbreaks, respectively. Therefore, we  continue to believe that FDA should identify the hazards of most concern  (e.g., scombrotoxin), develop baseline information on such hazard(s), and  use that information to assess the effectiveness of its programs in reducing  the prevalence of such hazards. We modified the report to provide  additional information regarding FDA\u2019s compliance-based data. 5. We continue to believe that an emphasis on equivalence agreements by  establishing goals and time frames is appropriate because equivalency is  generally a more effective way to ensure the safety of imported food.  Equivalence agreements will help FDA reduce its reliance on importer and  port-of-entry inspections and enable it to leverage its staff resources by  sharing the responsibility for seafood safety with the exporting countries.  Goals and time frames are standard management tools used to monitor the  progress of important initiatives, such as equivalence agreements. Without  them, there is less incentive to complete the initiatives. In this regard, FDA  and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency have had discussions and  engaged in activities aimed at determining the equivalence of the two  countries\u2019 systems since Canada first requested such action in 1997.  Furthermore, without any equivalence agreements for seafood, importers  must use the more difficult and costly alternative of providing documentary  support that the exporting seafood processor has a HACCP system that  meets U.S. requirements. We also recommend that Congress consider  mandating that FDA certify other countries\u2019 equivalence before their  seafood products are allowed entry into the United States. If Congress  decides to act in this regard, we would envision that Congress would  provide FDA a number of years to complete such determinations. By  establishing goals and time frames for equivalence agreements, FDA would  assist Congress in this effort. FDA could establish alternative provisions for  countries that export seafood to the United States and have systems that  are not equivalent, such as requiring them to provide laboratory tests or  other assurances that the seafood meets U.S. standards.", "See comment 2.", "See comment 5. 6.
