First, BLM estimated the amount of crude helium that can be produced from the reserve each year based on a geologic model. Second, under Phase A, BLM determined sale volumes, set the sale price and required participants to disclose certain information, among other things. Third, BLM has begun planning for the required Phase B auction and sale of helium for fiscal year 2015 and a one-time sale of a portion of the helium that will be made available in fiscal year 2016. BLM plans to hold this auction and these sales in July 2014 to comply with an August 1, 2014, statutory deadline. BLM officials told us the agency plans to offer for auction or sale most of the helium estimated to be produced in fiscal year 2015 and use the remainder to meet federal users' needs and to deliver privately owned helium to refiners for processing. However, refiners disagree with the agency's approach, stating the act requires BLM to offer for auction or sale the maximum amount that it can produce from the reserve each year. BLM officials said they are taking this approach to help ensure that the agency can deliver the privately owned helium that remains in storage before the end of fiscal year 2021.", "BLM faces challenges in implementing the act's tolling provision and identifying incentives. Under the provision, refiners, as a condition of sale or auction in Phases A and B, are to make excess refining capacity available at commercially reasonable rates to certain entities. In implementing this provision, however, BLM faces challenges in knowing whether refiners (1) have excess refining capacity available and (2) if so, are offering tolling services to nonrefiners at commercially reasonable rates. For example, although BLM asked refiners to report excess refining capacity as a condition of the Phase A sales, BLM did not define the term \u201cexcess refining capacity\u201d because, according to BLM officials, they were still in the process of interpreting the act. According to refiners GAO interviewed, they used different methods to calculate the excess refining capacity they reported to BLM. In preparation for Phase B and the fiscal year 2015 auction and sale, BLM has proposed a definition of excess refining capacity, although some nonrefiners noted that it leaves room for interpretation. Regarding rates, BLM has not defined or identified criteria for determining what is a commercially reasonable rate. BLM officials said they prefer to take a \u201chands off\u201d approach, allowing the companies involved and the marketplace to determine what is commercially reasonable, but it is unclear how BLM would implement the tolling provision without a definition or criteria for what is commercially reasonable. Moreover, BLM officials told GAO that they are considering various ways to incentivize tolling by refiners, but the agency's ability to create incentives is limited by the terms of existing contracts governing helium delivery that remain in effect through fiscal year 2015. GAO plans to conduct additional work after the July 2014 auction and sales on BLM's implementation of the act's tolling provision. Therefore, GAO is not making any recommendations at this time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Bureau of Land  Management\u2019s (BLM) implementation of the Helium Stewardship Act of   Enacted on October 2, 2013, the act extends the federal helium  2013.program\u2014which is responsible for the conservation and sale of federally  owned helium\u2014to no later than September 30, 2021.

The form  provides guidance on how BLM expects refiners to report excess refining  capacity, but some nonrefiners commented to BLM that this definition  leaves room for different interpretations. For example, BLM asks refiners  to report \u201cplanned demand\u201d for the applicable fiscal year in order to  determine excess capacity. BLM, however, does not make clear whether  such demand should already be under contract or just anticipated at the  time its form is submitted. BLM also is requiring refiners to certify the  accuracy of their reports of excess refining capacity on this form and to  update it within 2 weeks if the reported data vary by 10 percent at any  time. If a refiner fails to report excess refining capacity or to update BLM  when the data change, BLM is proposing to bar that refiner from  participation in helium auctions and/or sales. However, BLM has not  specified for how long or from which auctions or sales such a refiner  would be barred. We plan to conduct additional work after the July 2014  auction and sales on BLM\u2019s efforts to obtain excess refining capacity data  from refiners using its data collection form. Therefore, we are not making  any recommendations at this time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercially Reasonable Rates", "paragraphs": ["BLM is also challenged in determining whether refiners that reported  having excess refining capacity are offering tolling services at  \u201ccommercially reasonable rates,\u201d as required by the act. BLM did not  define commercially reasonable rates for Phase A or identify criteria it  would use to evaluate offered rates. As a result, BLM officials told us they  did not make determinations of whether the rates offered by refiners in  Phase A were commercially reasonable. Moreover, BLM officials told us  they do not intend to define commercially reasonable rates or identify  criteria for evaluating such rates for the upcoming July 2014 Phase B  auction and sales. Until BLM identifies criteria or a definition of what  constitutes a commercially reasonable rate, it is unclear how BLM would  implement the tolling provision, if necessary.", "BLM officials told us they are not planning on defining commercially  reasonable rates because it is more appropriate for the companies or a  court to make that determination. BLM officials said they do not have  complete information about the full spectrum of refiners\u2019 costs that are  included in their tolling rates. Also, these officials said that refiners and  nonrefiners are interpreting what is a commercially reasonable rate  differently and that the officials are hesitant to be drawn into that dispute.  BLM officials told us they would have a hard time finding that a rate was  not reasonable if the parties involved agreed to it. These officials said  they received multiple comments from refiners, nonrefiners, and helium  end users that support BLM\u2019s \u201chands-off\u201d approach to determining what is  a commercially reasonable rate. However, some of the nonrefiners we  interviewed said that they would like BLM to be more involved in setting a  commercially reasonable rate.

However, the agency\u2019s ability to create incentives is restricted by the  terms of existing storage contracts that predate the act and remain in  effect until September 30, 2015. Under the existing contracts\u2014which the  act does not affect or diminish\u2014BLM\u2019s delivery of helium through the  pipeline is based on the refining capacities of the four refiners in 2000.  For example, if BLM delivered 100 million cubic feet of helium into the  pipeline over the course of a month, that amount would be divided among  the refiners per the allocations determined by their 2000 refining  capacities (see table 3).", "Therefore, for nonrefiners to actually receive helium they have purchased  from BLM, one or more of the refiners\u2019 allocations would need to be  reduced so it could be delivered.helium that could be delivered to a refiner for its own use, potentially  meaning lost revenue for that refiner. Some of the refiners we spoke with  said this reduction in the volume of helium they would receive is a  significant reason why they have been reluctant or unable to toll.", "This directly reduces the amount of  In planning for the fiscal year 2015 auction and sale, BLM officials told us  they considered various ways to address this delivery issue within the  confines of the existing storage contracts. In its May 16, 2014, Federal  Register notice, BLM proposed reducing the total volume of helium that is  subject to the delivery allocations. This approach could allow BLM to  deliver any helium that nonrefiners purchased at auction separately from  helium that is subject to the allocations. Under this approach, tolling could  represent an opportunity for refiners to receive helium they otherwise  would not be receiving. BLM and other Interior officials told us they  believe the existing storage contracts provide the flexibility to BLM to  make such adjustments. At least one refiner, however, has notified BLM  that it finds that BLM\u2019s interpretation violates the act and the terms of the  current storage contract.", "Although potentially significant for fiscal year 2015, the challenges posed  by the existing storage contracts may be reduced under certain market  conditions. Specifically, BLM officials noted that the disincentive may be  moot if refiners are not interested in receiving their full allocation of helium  each month. For example, although the refiners have used their full  allocations since fiscal year 2010, according to BLM officials, some  refiners recently notified BLM that they are reducing their requested  monthly delivery amounts from the pipeline because additional helium  supplies have become available from other, private sources in other  locations in the world. According to these officials, these conditions could  make tolling more likely because, if refiners were accepting less helium  from the federal system for their own use, they could have excess refining  capacity available in their plants on the pipeline. At least one nonrefiner  told us, however, that the availability of the additional supplies from other  sources means they are not interested in having their federal helium  tolled.", "Furthermore, this challenge could be alleviated when new storage  contracts are signed. BLM officials told us they plan to begin developing  the terms of new storage contracts, and these contracts will go into effect  in fiscal year 2016. These officials said they can modify the delivery  allocations in the new contracts so that delivery of nonrefiners\u2019 helium  does not result in a reduction of a refiner\u2019s delivered volume and instead  would represent an opportunity for the refiner to accept delivery of helium  it otherwise would not have received.", "However, even with an incentive from BLM, refiners\u2019 and nonrefiners\u2019  conflicting interests will make it challenging for tolling to occur. BLM  officials said that, even if refiners report having excess refining capacity,  and that capacity is offered at commercially reasonable rates, the parties  may still have difficulty finding mutually agreeable terms for delivering the  refined helium. These officials said a major reason why more tolling has  not occurred is that refiners and nonrefiners disagree over delivery terms.  For example, some nonrefiners told us they are looking for some  assurance of when and how much refined helium the refiners will deliver  to them in certain months. Such an agreement might specify an overall  volume to be tolled spread out over a number of months. These  nonrefiners said they need some predictability so they can meet  contractual obligations with their customers. However, some refiners said  they cannot offer predictable volumes to nonrefiners, both because of  existing obligations to their own customers and because their supplies are  subject to interruptions that occur in the federal helium system, such as  unexpected plant shutdowns. Some of these refiners told us they would  offer to toll for nonrefiners as capacity comes available, but some of the  nonrefiners we interviewed said that they are typically unable to use  helium offered on short notice, in part because they need to secure  commitments to provide refined helium in advance in order to satisfy their  existing contracts.", "Chairman Lamborn, Ranking Member Holt, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
