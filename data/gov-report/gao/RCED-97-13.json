The international aviation market is, however, heavily regulated by bilateral agreements between countries, which often limit airlines\u2019 traffic rights\u2014the routes they can fly and the frequency with which they can fly those routes. The departments of Transportation (DOT) and State have traditionally negotiated these agreements as part of a comprehensive exchange covering both passenger and air cargo services. However, air cargo services have characteristics and needs that differ significantly from those of passenger services\u2014most prominently the need to move and store cargo on the ground. When these needs are not met, the competitiveness of these services is compromised."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Air Cargo Services Are Vital to U.S. Trade", "paragraphs": ["International air cargo services play a vital role in facilitating U.S. trade.As shown in figure 1.1, since 1975 the airborne share of the value of U.S. exports has more than doubled, and the airborne share of imports has almost tripled. In 1995, the value of U.S. airborne trade reached $355 billion, accounting for 31 percent of U.S. exports and 23 percent of imports\u2014or 27 percent of all U.S. trade. U.S. airlines generated about $3.9 billion in revenues from international freight operations that year, according to DOT\u2019s data.", "The development of global systems for producing and distributing goods and an attendant increase in the use of \u201cjust-in-time\u201d inventory systems, which reduce the need to warehouse spare parts and finished products, have contributed, in part, to the growth of international air cargo services. Some analysts consider the efficiency of such supply chains to be an increasingly important competitive advantage in numerous industries. International air transport is critical to shippers who need speed and reliability. This means of transport is particularly appropriate for moving goods that (1) have high value-to-weight ratios, (2) are fragile, (3) are physically or economically perishable, and/or (4) are subject to unpredictable demand patterns. Almost 70 percent of the exports of U.S. computers and office equipment and over half of the exports of U.S. communications equipment moved by air in 1994.", "From 1990 to 1995, airfreight traffic between the United States and foreign countries grew by 50 percent. This traffic accounted for approximately 38 percent of the world\u2019s estimated total airfreight traffic in 1994, the last year for which data are available. The trade to and from Latin America almost doubled. Europe and the Asia/Pacific region are the largest air trade markets for the United States, accounting for about 70 percent of the country\u2019s air trade by weight in 1995. Furthermore, according to the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group\u2019s forecast for airfreight traffic,international markets offer the greatest opportunities for U.S. airlines to expand their freight operations\u2014the rate of growth in almost all international airfreight markets is forecast to exceed that of the U.S. domestic market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Cargo Industry Has Unique Operating Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The international air cargo industry comprises three types of carriers: (1) integrated all-cargo carriers, such as Federal Express, that operate cargo-only aircraft and primarily offer express door-to-door delivery of shipments; (2) scheduled and charter all-cargo carriers that operate cargo-only aircraft and primarily offer airport-to-airport service; and (3) passenger/cargo carriers that carry cargo on board passenger aircraft but also may operate cargo-only aircraft, and primarily offer airport-to-airport delivery.", "Air cargo services have significantly different operating requirements from passenger services. First, unlike most passengers, air cargo moves in one direction only. This frequently results in directional imbalances in the flow of cargo traffic. To operate economically, a cargo carrier must have the flexibility to alter routings to take advantage of changes in traffic flows. Because most cargo is inanimate, it is also less sensitive than passengers to the number of stops made en route, to the directness of routing, or to changes in aircraft. Nevertheless, speed is usually critical to competitive air cargo services. According to DOT, rights to serve destinations without restrictions, along with the ability to route services flexibly, are even more important for efficiency in cargo operations than in passenger operations. Finally, the movement and storage of air cargo on the ground are vital for cargo services. For express carriers offering door-to-door service, the ability to operate pickup and delivery service\u2014that is, to have intermodal rights\u2014is essential for competitiveness.", "All-cargo carriers hauled almost 60 percent of the international freight carried by U.S. airlines\u2014over 1.3 million tons in 1994. As shown in table 1.1, services by U.S. all-cargo airlines are particularly important in Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region, where they carried over 70 percent of the freight transported by U.S. airlines in 1994."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Airlines Enjoy Less Success in International Freight Markets Than in Passenger Markets", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, U.S. airlines flew more scheduled international freight ton-miles\u2014about 16 percent of the world total\u2014than the airlines of any other country. Nonetheless, U.S. carriers have not competed as successfully in international freight markets as they have in international passenger markets. From 1990 through April 1995, U.S. airlines achieved a 40.7-percent share of the U.S. international freight market, on average. By comparison, U.S. passenger/cargo airlines averaged a 53.3-percent share of the U.S. international passenger market during the same period. Notably, according to DOT\u2019s data for 1994, airlines from foreign countries other than those where the freight originated or was destined\u2014so-called third-country carriers\u2014obtained a 21-percent share of the traffic in the 20 leading U.S. international freight markets.", "Most international airfreight is carried by major foreign passenger/cargo airlines. In contrast to the U.S. domestic market, where integrated all-cargo carriers carry about 60 percent of the freight traffic, the majority of the world\u2019s scheduled freight traffic is carried by passenger/cargo airlines\u2014almost 60 percent in 1994, according to the Air Cargo Management Group, an air cargo consulting firm. The comparatively small U.S. share of international freight traffic is due, in part, to the greater emphasis foreign passenger/cargo airlines have traditionally placed on freight operations compared with U.S. passenger airlines. U.S. passenger/cargo airlines have historically viewed cargo services as a by-product of their passenger services, and all but one of these airlines had ceased operating cargo-only aircraft until this year. Northwest Airlines was the only major U.S. airline operating such aircraft in 1995, though both United Airlines and Continental Airline\u2019s subsidiary, Continental Micronesia, recently announced plans to begin all-cargo services in the Asia/Pacific region. By contrast, many major foreign passenger/cargo airlines, such as KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Air France, and Lufthansa, operate all-cargo aircraft or so-called \u201ccombi\u201d aircraft, on which cargo is carried in the main compartment of the passenger aircraft in addition to the bellyholds.", "Appendix I contains additional information on the status of the international airfreight industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT and the State Department Negotiate Bilateral Agreements and Try to Resolve Problems", "paragraphs": ["Under a framework established by the Chicago Convention in 1944, international aviation is largely governed by bilateral agreements. Two countries negotiate the air transport services between them and award airlines traffic rights. In general, traffic rights determine (1) which routes can be served between the countries and between them and third countries; (2) what services airlines can provide (e.g. scheduled or charter); (3) how many airlines from each country can fly the routes; and, in some case (4) how frequently flights can be offered.", "For the United States, the responsibility for developing international aviation policy and negotiating bilateral agreements resides with DOT and the State Department. Traditionally, these agencies have negotiated bilateral agreements as part of a comprehensive exchange of rights covering both passenger and cargo services. In 1989, DOT issued a statement of U.S. air cargo policy that established specific negotiating objectives designed to ensure the least restrictive operating environment for U.S. air cargo services. The 1989 statement reiterated DOT\u2019s traditional policy of conducting comprehensive negotiations as the best means to accommodate the international interests of all-cargo airlines. DOT\u2019s 1995 international aviation policy added the agency\u2019s willingness to consider negotiating bilateral agreements that cover only cargo services. The State Department also helps develop aviation policy and is responsible for chairing negotiations with foreign governments and coordinating DOT\u2019s actions with overall U.S. foreign policy.", "Under 49 U.S.C., section 41310, the Secretaries of State and Transportation, as well as the heads of other agencies, are required to take all appropriate action to eliminate any discrimination or unfair competitive practices faced by U.S. airlines overseas. U.S. carriers can file formal complaints with DOT about such practices.

The questionnaire was pretested with representatives of five all-cargo airlines. We then surveyed the 26 U.S. air carriers that, as of September 1995, operated cargo-only aircraft and were authorized by DOT to offer scheduled or charter international all-cargo services.

The vast majority of these problems, which make U.S. carriers less effective competitors in the international marketplace, occur at airports located in Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region. The U.S. all-cargo carriers noted that they often accept these problems as a cost of operating at the airports involved or attempt to resolve them without the U.S. government\u2019s assistance in an effort to preserve good relations with the host country.

These airlines contend that these requirements limit their flexibility to serve their customers and raise their operating costs at 25 foreign airports, increasing the costs that they then must pass on to their customers. For example, one airline complained that the aviation authorities of one Latin American country required it to purchase liability insurance from one of the country\u2019s national insurance companies for its aircraft operating on routes to that country, even though the aircraft was already insured by a U.S. company. Likewise, two of these airlines maintain that foreign governments in Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region require excessive documentation from carriers before allowing them to inaugurate service at their airports, imposing a burden in terms of both personnel costs and management oversight. In addition, these requirements, airlines report, can be applied in a discriminatory manner by foreign government agencies to reduce the competitiveness of the U.S. airlines\u2019 services.", "According to 10 of the airlines, foreign governments also frequently limit access to their markets by refusing to grant the U.S. airlines the authority to operate on routes authorized by bilateral agreements (cited as affecting operations at 17 airports) and by delaying the issuance of permits to overfly their territory or serve their airports (cited as affecting operations at 15 airports). These problems were cited at airports in 5 of the 10 largest U.S. international airfreight markets in 1994. U.S. airlines contend that foreign governments take such actions to protect their national airlines from competition from U.S. carriers. According to some all-cargo airlines, difficulty in obtaining flight permits, although also a problem for scheduled airlines, is particularly troublesome for all-cargo airlines offering charter services because they often must operate flights on short notice to meet the needs of their customers. According to the charter airlines we surveyed, some countries in Latin America require notice of proposed charters far in advance of when the airlines typically receive requests for flights. The airlines said that if they cannot obtain the appropriate authorization in sufficient time before a proposed flight, they frequently lose the business to competing, often local airlines, thereby losing revenues and dissatisfying customers.", "Seven all-cargo carriers also report that curfews banning airlines from operating during night hours at 10 key airports in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia/Pacific region limit their ability to provide their customers with adequate levels of service. According to two of these airlines, curfews disproportionately affect all-cargo carriers because these airlines typically operate during night hours in order to meet delivery deadlines. Prohibitions against night operations, according to these airlines, reduce all-cargo airlines\u2019 flexibility to schedule their flights. These curfews affect all the airlines operating at the airports, including the national carriers of the host countries.

According to three U.S. all-cargo airlines, several countries require that locally owned companies pick up and deliver or transport freight shipments. Such restrictions, according to the airlines, limit their ability to provide time-sensitive delivery of packages, or deliver packages at all, at 12 foreign airports. For example, one airline reported that one Latin American government prohibits foreign companies from operating trucks with a capacity of more than 4 1/2 tons, reserving that sector of the market for its nationals. Because the airline cannot use a larger vehicle to transport shipments, its delivery of time-sensitive shipments slows and the airline\u2019s cost of operations increases. Five airlines also reported difficulties and delays in clearing customs at 10 airports. For example, one airline attributed the slow handling of time-sensitive shipments and excessive costs to the airports\u2019 having too few customs inspectors and cumbersome clearance processes. Such delays frustrate one of the primary purposes of air cargo transportation\u2014speedy delivery. DOT officials noted that problems in clearing customs tend to be nondiscriminatory and also affect local airlines.", "According to U.S. airlines, the cumulative effect of such problems is to reduce their operating efficiency and make their services less competitive with those of foreign airlines.

One airline complained that it must pay about $3,000 for landing services at these airports, while fees for equivalent services for the same type of aircraft at airports in nearby countries range between $750 to $1,500. In addition, the other airline contends that these high fees are discriminatory because that country\u2019s national carriers pay about $2,000 less in fees than U.S. and other foreign airlines pay.

U.S. airline representatives stated that such restrictions raise operating costs, lower the quality of airlines\u2019 services, and reduce efficiency.", "Problems with cargo-handling include restrictions on airlines\u2019 ability to load or unload cargo themselves, discriminatory or excessive cargo-handling fees at those airports where airlines are prohibited from performing this task themselves, and inadequate warehouse facilities. U.S. carriers particularly object to being forced to use monopoly handling agents\u2014frequently the local carrier against whom they compete\u2014because they contend that such agents provide less efficient, reliable, and responsive service than they could provide themselves. For example, one airline complained that the government-owned monopoly ground-handling agent at the airports of one Asian country it served gives priority services to national aircraft at all times and that the workers providing the services do not work as efficiently for foreign airlines as for national airlines. Cargo carriers want the freedom to perform their own ground-handling services or to contract for them among several competing agents.", "Inadequate warehouse facilities at foreign airports also pose problems, according to two U.S. all-cargo airlines. One U.S. airline reported that the government\u2019s warehouses at a Latin American airport are very disorganized because they lack space, equipment, and trained personnel. The problems include not separating stored cargo according to the airline, not designating an area for dangerous goods, not having proper weighing equipment, and not designating a storage area for live animals.

Of the 28 complaints filed under the statute since 1989, only 6 were filed by all-cargo carriers. According to one airline, it is also costly to request DOT\u2019s assistance because the agency asks the airline to collect and present to it all the necessary evidence concerning a problem before the agency will attempt to address the problem. DOT officials responded that they must have reasonable assurance of a problem\u2019s validity, as well as detailed facts, before intervening with a foreign government on a formal basis. DOT officials told us that although the number of formal complaints is small, DOT spends a great deal of time attempting to resolve complaints informally.", "Some airline officials were also unaware of the processes for requesting DOT\u2019s or the State Department\u2019s assistance to help solve problems in doing business abroad. Officials of three airlines\u2014one small charter, one large regional, and one national airline\u2014stated that they were unfamiliar with how to request the U.S. government\u2019s aid but would appreciate any information on how to do so. Officials at two of these airlines were not even aware that such assistance was available from the U.S. government.

According to DOT officials, most U.S. airlines prefer using cooperative methods to resolve problems out of fear that a foreign government will retaliate or a desire to preserve good relations with the host country.", "Recently, in response to a recommendation we made in our 1994 report, DOT began to collect information on the status, nature, and severity of U.S. airlines\u2019 problems in doing business abroad and established a consolidated database on such problems to ensure that they are prioritized and given attention. However, DOT did not notify all U.S. all-cargo airlines of the system. Instead, DOT worked through the Air Transport Association (ATA) and the National Air Carrier Association (NACA) to notify their members of the database and to request information on current doing-business problems. Only 9 of the 22 air cargo carriers that responded to our survey, however, are members of either association. As a result, the airlines that are not members\u2014mostly regional airlines\u2014were unaware of DOT\u2019s efforts and have provided no information.

Nonetheless, 7 of the 10 airlines were generally satisfied with the assistance they received from DOT or the State Department, even if the assistance provided did not resolve the problem.", "As we reported in November 1994, DOT and the State Department are more successful in resolving issues that come under bilateral agreements or issues that DOT has determined denied U.S. airlines a fair and equal opportunity to compete. For example, one cargo airline reported that during recent bilateral negotiations with a European country, U.S. negotiators were successful in including in the bilateral agreement a statement that prevents that country from arbitrarily assessing landing fees. The U.S. government also intervened successfully on behalf of an all-cargo airline that reported experiencing cargo-handling restrictions and discriminatory cargo-handling fees at airports in an Asian country. In response to a formal complaint, the U.S. government imposed sanctions on the foreign government, and the foreign government ceased its discriminatory practices.", "According to carriers responding to our questionnaire, DOT and the State Department have had less success in resolving problems that are not covered by specific, detailed provisions in bilateral agreements or that do not represent discrimination against U.S. airlines. For example, according to one U.S. airline, the departments were not able to resolve restrictions that limited the airline\u2019s operations to the less commercially desirable of a foreign city\u2019s two airports. According to another airline, DOT and the State Department have been negotiating for 2 years with a Latin American country to drop a restriction that reserves for national companies and denies to others the right to transport international freight shipments in vehicles with a capacity of more than 4-1/2 tons.

For example, the United States may deny the schedule of flights to the United States proposed by a country\u2019s carriers or may impose other sanctions. Such stern measures have limited application, however, in addressing practices that do not clearly violate bilateral accords or discriminate against U.S. carriers. DOT interprets its authority under 49 U.S.C., section 41310, as requiring a finding of a violation of a bilateral accord or other instance of unfair or discriminatory treatment before it may impose sanctions. We found in our November 1994 report that efforts by DOT and the State Department to resolve the range of doing-business problems that do not overtly discriminate against U.S. carriers are complicated by several constraints, such as the need to negotiate with foreign governments that are often protecting their own carriers from increasing U.S. competition."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["According to U.S. all-cargo airlines, their success is limited by a range of problems in doing business at key airports in Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region.

Nevertheless, restrictions persist. As a remedy, most U.S. all-cargo airlines advocate separating negotiations of cargo rights from broader negotiations that include passenger services.", "Separate discussions about air cargo services could allow negotiators to focus on all-cargo airlines\u2019 unique operating requirements, according to airline representatives and DOT and State Department officials. Some all-cargo airlines also believe that such discussions could ensure that progress on cargo services is not delayed because of disputes about passenger issues. In addition, several industry observers believe that successful negotiations on cargo issues could create momentum to achieve progress on contentious passenger issues in several U.S. aviation relationships. Airline representatives and DOT and State Department officials also point out several obstacles to such an approach. Most foreign countries do not have major international all-cargo airlines. Instead, they have passenger/cargo airlines. In these countries, the governments might be unable to separate negotiations of air cargo and passenger services. Furthermore, U.S. negotiators would be unable to reciprocally exchange cargo rights for passenger rights, which could lessen their flexibility in negotiations and make it difficult for them to obtain the maximum benefits for U.S. all-cargo airlines.

However, these officials assert that the U.S. government has addressed cargo issues as they have arisen and has paid markedly greater attention to the interests of all-cargo airlines over the past several years, citing their success in liberalizing cargo services with several countries. State Department officials attributed this increased attention, in part, to (1) the growing importance of U.S. air trade with the countries of Latin America and the Asia/Pacific region and (2) the emergence of Federal Express and United Parcel Service alongside U.S. passenger/cargo carriers as major competitors in the international market.", "Our analysis of DOT\u2019s and the Air Transport Association\u2019s (ATA) records showed that the United States conducted formal aviation negotiations with 56 foreign governments between January 1989, the year that DOT issued its air cargo policy statement, and March 1996. U.S. officials discussed air cargo issues in at least one negotiating session in talks with 44 of these governments. However, most negotiating sessions focused on passenger issues; about one-third of the more than 300 individual sessions dealt with air cargo issues. According to DOT officials, passenger issues receive more attention than cargo issues during negotiations because they arise more frequently. The officials said that foreign countries frequently focus on passenger issues and such issues are the principal reason talks are held. They noted that certain kinds of disagreements that continue to arise in the passenger context, such as pricing issues, have not been raised with respect to cargo for many years.", "During this period, the United States amended or inaugurated 74 aviation agreements. Thirty-two of these agreements contained specific provisions governing all-cargo services. Of these, 18 agreements specify separate routes for all-cargo services and 21 agreements define the intermodal rights available to airlines. The United States has also signed \u201copen skies\u201d agreements with 12 European countries, under which most bilateral restrictions are eliminated, and an agreement with Canada substantially liberalizing the transborder aviation market. Finally, in March 1996, the United States successfully completed negotiations with Japan that dealt exclusively with air cargo services.", "Our analysis showed that air cargo issues were addressed in the majority of the negotiating rounds with 20 countries: Argentina, Brazil, China, Fiji, Greece, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Peru, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Spain, and Thailand. U.S. negotiators reached agreements with most of these countries that generally expanded service opportunities for U.S. all-cargo airlines. For example, the agreement concluded with the Philippines in 1995 (1) increased the number of routes for all-cargo services and the number of U.S. airlines allowed to operate on those routes, (2) granted U.S. carriers the unrestricted right to change the type of aircraft for flights beyond the Philippines, and (3) ensured that U.S. airlines could operate pickup and delivery services in the Philippines. These service enhancements gave Federal Express the operating freedom necessary to establish a viable hub at Subic Bay.", "Still, 24 of the 32 U.S. agreements or amendments negotiated since 1989 that incorporated provisions on cargo services contained various restrictions on these services. Currently, aviation agreements governing cargo services in 7 of the 20 leading international airfreight markets for the United States\u2014including the two largest markets, Japan and the United Kingdom\u2014directly restrict the operations of U.S. all-cargo carriers. These seven restricted markets accounted for about one-third of the U.S. international freight traffic in 1994. Restrictions include limits on (1) the number of airlines allowed to operate on all-cargo routes, (2) the ability of U.S. airlines to carry freight to and beyond the other country, and (3) the frequency of all-cargo airlines\u2019 flights. Agreements with some countries do not guarantee the right of U.S. airlines to perform their own ground-handling services or to truck cargo off airport property for final delivery. State Department and DOT officials note, however, that bilateral aviation agreements that restrict cargo services also tend to restrict passenger services. For example, the U.S. agreements with Japan and the United Kingdom restrict both types of service.

Eleven of the 19 airlines that stated their views on this issue believe that, overall, DOT\u2019s policy addresses their principal concerns to a moderate or great extent. However, only 7 of 20 respondents believe that DOT has been similarly effective in representing their interests during bilateral aviation negotiations, while 4 respondents believe that DOT has done little or nothing to represent their interests.", "Respondents were split as to whether the State Department has represented them well or poorly.

While acknowledging that DOT and the State Department have been more responsive to the needs of all-cargo carriers when negotiating aviation agreements over the past several years, several of these airlines assert that under the current framework of comprehensive talks, negotiators primarily focus on the needs of passenger/cargo carriers, often to the detriment of all-cargo carriers\u2019 interests. In addition, some of these airlines believe that the traffic needs of all-cargo operations are sufficiently different from those of passenger/cargo airlines to justify separate negotiations. Some carrier representatives also contend that when substantial consensus on cargo issues is reached during negotiations, progress on an agreement can be delayed because of disputes about passenger services.", "According to some U.S. all-cargo charter airline representatives, separate negotiations could facilitate agreement on specific provisions guaranteeing the airlines liberal operating rights. Many U.S. aviation agreements either do not contain a formal provision governing charter services or require that charter services be performed according to the rules of the country in which the traffic originates. According to DOT and airline officials, the regulation of charter services by foreign governments can reduce the viability of such services. For example, Argentina requires that its national airlines have the first opportunity to carry charter freight originating in Argentina.", "Finally, the two major international all-cargo carriers believe that separately negotiating cargo services would recognize the intrinsic link between the growth of international trade and liberalized air cargo services. Because of this connection, these airlines think air cargo services should be considered as a trade issue rather than as a transportation issue and that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) should play a more active role in negotiating cargo rights. One of these airlines holds that the best way to promote the liberalization of international air cargo services is by convincing U.S. negotiating partners of the benefits of increased air trade to their economies. Similarly, a State Department official pointed to the U.S. talks with Brazil in 1995 as an example of the influence that a country\u2019s broader trade interests may have on the outcome of negotiations. The United States and Brazil amended the aviation agreement to increase the number of scheduled and charter all-cargo flights permitted, as well as to expand passenger service opportunities. Brazil\u2019s growing air export trade to the United States, which includes shipments of automotive parts and other finished industrial products, was among the incentives for Brazil to liberalize air cargo services, he explained. DOT officials, on the other hand, believe that it was Brazil\u2019s desire for enhanced passenger services to the United States that allowed the United States to obtain cargo rights in return.", "The six major U.S. passenger/cargo airlines with significant international operations are opposed to any negotiating policy that would routinely exclude them from air cargo talks with foreign countries. Two of these airlines expressed concern that separate talks for air cargo rights would place their own cargo operations at a competitive disadvantage. Several U.S. passenger/cargo airlines are dedicating increasing resources to transporting freight in international markets. While most passenger/cargo carriers do not compete directly with integrated carriers in the door-to-door, express delivery market, they do compete for traditional airport-to-airport freight traffic, according to industry analysts. Two passenger/cargo airline executives conveyed their companies\u2019 concern that the results of air cargo talks could have profound implications for passenger services by setting unfavorable precedents for issues of common interest, such as the right of U.S. airlines to serve destinations beyond a foreign country.", "DOT officials stated that retaining the flexibility inherent in comprehensive discussions is entirely consistent with the U.S. government\u2019s formal policy on negotiating bilateral aviation agreements. They explained that while the 1995 U.S. International Air Transportation Policy Statement commits DOT not to forgo agreements covering only air cargo services when circumstances warrant, the 1989 air cargo policy obligates the agency generally to retain flexibility in the interest of obtaining agreements that comport with the United States\u2019 overall economic interests.

Holding successful all-cargo talks in advance of more contentious discussions about passenger services, some observers explain, could create a climate of goodwill and an understanding that differences over passenger services could be resolved. These observers believe that this approach would foster liberalization much as did the deregulation of the domestic U.S. airline industry during the 1970s. The deregulation of domestic cargo services in 1977 led to the development of new service options for shippers, most prominently overnight express delivery, and stimulated dramatic growth in domestic cargo traffic. This growth partially contributed to the confidence that passenger markets could be deregulated the following year, according to these observers. Similarly, according to this point of view, a working demonstration of successfully liberalized international air cargo markets may encourage many of the United States\u2019 foreign trading partners to negotiate for the same benefits in international passenger markets. This view, however, has yet to be proved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Separate All-Cargo Negotiations Face Several Obstacles", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to such arguments for separate negotiations are obstacles suggesting that this approach may not be routinely practical or appropriate. First, most foreign governments have little incentive to conduct all-cargo negotiations because their countries do not have major international all-cargo carriers. Even though many scheduled foreign passenger/cargo airlines also operate cargo-only aircraft, many of these airlines still carry a significant amount of cargo in the holds of passenger aircraft. As a result, their market needs are defined primarily in terms of initiating or expanding passenger services, which are their primary source of revenue, according to DOT and State Department officials. When foreign officials negotiate, they often do so with the acknowledged goal of expanding their national carriers\u2019 passenger services.", "In 1995, 75 foreign carriers from 44 countries operated all-cargo services to the United States. However, many of these carriers are small and their interests are considered secondary by foreign aviation officials, according to DOT officials and industry analysts. Only three foreign all-cargo airlines serving the United States\u2014Cargolux, Nippon Cargo Airlines, and TAMPA\u2014rank in the top 25 international airfreight carriers. Foreign negotiators, therefore, may find it difficult to bargain exclusively on behalf of small all-cargo carriers, seeking instead to gain cargo rights from the United States in the general course of comprehensive discussions. For example, a British government representative told us that while his country\u2019s largest passenger/cargo airline, British Airways, carries significant amounts of cargo across the North Atlantic on board its passenger aircraft, its income from cargo revenue on these routes is largely a function of the frequency of its passenger flights between the United Kingdom and the United States.", "A second obstacle to separate all-cargo talks is the possibility that they could reduce the flexibility of U.S. negotiators to obtain new rights for all-cargo and passenger/cargo airlines. In particular, DOT and State Department officials and passenger/cargo airline representatives believe that separating talks diminishes opportunities to exchange cargo rights for passenger rights, and vice-versa. With comprehensive discussions, negotiators can seek the best overall deal, which might mean allowing more passenger flights for foreign carriers in exchange for increased flights by U.S. all-cargo carriers, according to these officials. DOT and State Department officials with whom we spoke urged adherence, in most cases, to the current framework for negotiating, which relies on comprehensive talks, with separate negotiations available as an alternative. According to these officials, the service gains available to U.S. all-cargo carriers will usually be greater when agreements arise from flexible, comprehensive talks. They cited as examples the agreements reached with Canada, Mexico, and several of the European countries with which the United States now has an \u201copen skies\u201d agreement. Moreover, according to the officials, the interests of large integrated all-cargo airlines are often dissimilar to those of smaller, traditional freight carriers. This diversity of interests suggests that cargo-only talks may not, in many cases, be more effective than comprehensive negotiations in meeting the needs of all members of the community of all-cargo airlines. Indeed, two of the all-cargo airlines that responded to our survey supported this assessment. These carriers expressed the fear that the specific interests of the large integrated all-cargo airlines\u2014Federal Express and United Parcel Service\u2014are likely to receive favored treatment in cargo-only negotiations.", "Finally, according to DOT and State Department officials, the U.S. government would incur additional costs by negotiating passenger and cargo rights separately. Each round of negotiations requires advance preparation to identify goals and develop strategies to achieve them. Importantly, preparation also includes consultation with the affected parties, including carriers, airports, and local communities. Aviation negotiations can involve multiple rounds of talks conducted over several months and demand negotiators\u2019 attention before, during, and after the actual talks. Finally, when the foreign government hosts the discussions, typically for every other round, both DOT and the State Department also incur often significant travel costs. The U.S. negotiators that we spoke with are hesitant to pursue a policy of routinely separating passenger and cargo negotiations. They expressed concern that they would have insufficient time and funding to split each round of talks so that cargo issues and passenger issues would receive equal amounts of attention."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Talks With Japan Illustrate Advantages and Disadvantages of Separate Negotiations", "paragraphs": ["Air cargo talks with Japan, concluded in March 1996, illustrate both the advantages and disadvantages of negotiating exclusively for the expansion of cargo services. One major advantage, according to DOT and State Department officials, is that the negotiations addressed cargo issues on their own merits and were not overshadowed by the contentious passenger issues in the relationship. Under the terms of the U.S.-Japan agreement, the United States received Japan\u2019s consent for an additional U.S. airline to begin all-cargo services to Japan; for United Parcel Service to expand its service to and beyond Japan; and for Federal Express, United Airlines, and Northwest Airlines to route their flights more flexibly.", "However, the agreement also focuses attention on the difficulties inherent in concluding similar agreements with other countries. First, the United States and Japan were able to hold cargo negotiations because their relationship\u2014unlike U.S. relationships with other countries\u2014allows the cargo needs of each to be considered separately and distinctly from the passenger needs, according to DOT. Each country has at least one major all-cargo carrier, and each has passenger/cargo carriers that operate cargo-only aircraft on bilateral routes.", "Second, both the U.S. and the Japanese governments had concerns over the precedent that an agreement on cargo services could set for subsequent passenger talks. Japanese negotiators, in particular, did not wish to set a precedent in which the United States could regard expanded cargo rights as a precursor to similarly expanded passenger rights, according to State Department officials. Foreign negotiators representing other major U.S. trading partners are likely to express similar reservations.", "With Japan, the United States originally sought an agreement that would allow all-cargo carriers the maximum flexibility to respond to business opportunities with little regulatory interference. During the discussions, U.S. negotiators argued that granting the right to carry freight to destinations beyond Japan to U.S. all-cargo carriers is essentially a trade issue and that significant economic benefits would accrue to Japan from unreservedly allowing such flights. However, Japan has not accepted this reasoning, and it limited the ability of U.S. all-cargo airlines to carry cargo originating in Japan from Japanese points to points beyond Japan. One U.S. airline representative expressed concern that continuing such limits on U.S. carriers\u2019 right to serve destinations beyond Japan may have set an unwelcome precedent for passenger services.", "Finally, concluding the U.S.-Japan agreement on all-cargo services has not proved to be a catalyst for accelerating progress on passenger service issues. In fact, the recent agreement on air cargo services has not prevented conflict over the pre-existing traffic rights of U.S. all-cargo airlines. The two countries resumed negotiations on passenger issues on April 29, 1996, but the talks have been at an impasse since then because of a dispute over Japan\u2019s refusal to approve flights by two U.S. passenger/cargo airlines\u2014United and Northwest\u2014and Federal Express through Japan to other destinations in Asia. The United States believes these flights are authorized under current U.S.-Japan agreements. On July 16, 1996, DOT proposed to prohibit Japan Air Lines from carrying cargo from points elsewhere in Asia on its scheduled all-cargo services through Japan into the United States unless the Japanese government approved Federal Express\u2019s request. As of September 25, 1996, the negotiations had achieved little progress on these issues and DOT had reaffirmed the U.S. intent to resolve outstanding disputes over the rights of U.S. carriers to operate flights beyond Japan before undertaking passenger negotiations over new opportunities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Modified Approaches Could Create Negotiating Efficiencies and Promote Liberalization, but Offer No Panacea", "paragraphs": ["Two modifications to the U.S. strategy have been under discussion within government and the industry.

In 1991, in 1994, and again in 1996, DOT and State Department negotiators held exploratory talks with representatives of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union (EU). During the earlier talks, U.S. and EU officials reached an understanding on a broad array of cargo issues, which included deregulating pricing, eliminating numerical restrictions on the number of all-cargo airlines allowed to operate, allowing for an unrestricted amount of cargo to be transported between the United States and the EU, and a host of doing-business issues.", "Nonetheless, the Commission no longer supports holding multilateral talks on cargo services in advance of and in isolation from discussions on passenger issues, believing this approach to be counterproductive to its ultimate goal of negotiating air services between the United States and EU member states.
