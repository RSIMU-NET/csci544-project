Until April 2014, DHS pursued a next-generation autonomous detection technology (Gen-3), which aimed to enable collection and analysis of air samples in less than 6 hours, unlike the current system (Gen-2), which requires manual intervention and can take up to 36 hours to detect the presence of biological pathogens. DHS is taking steps to address the capability gap that resulted from the cancellation of Gen-3 by exploring other technology upgrades and improvements to the Gen-2 system.", "GAO was asked to review (1) the technical capabilities of the currently deployed BioWatch system, (2) the Gen-3 testing effort, and (3) characteristics of autonomous detection as a possible option to replace the current BioWatch system. GAO analyzed key program documents, including test plans, test results, and modeling studies. GAO assessed Gen-3 testing against best practices, reviewed relevant literature, and discussed the BioWatch program and testing efforts with key agency officials and national laboratories staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) lacks reliable information about BioWatch Gen-2's technical capabilities to detect a biological attack and therefore lacks the basis for informed cost-benefit decisions about upgrades to the system. DHS commissioned several tests of the technical performance characteristics of the current BioWatch Gen-2 system, but has not developed performance requirements that would enable it to interpret the test results and draw conclusions about the system's ability to detect attacks. Although DHS officials said that the system can detect catastrophic attacks, which they define as attacks large enough to cause 10,000 casualties, they have not specified the performance requirements necessary to reliably meet this operational objective. In the absence of performance requirements, DHS officials said computer modeling and simulation studies support their assertion. However, none of these studies were designed to incorporate test results from the Gen-2 system and comprehensively assess the system against the stated operational objective. Additionally, DHS has not prepared an analysis that combines the modeling and simulation studies with the specific Gen-2 test results to assess the system's capabilities to detect attacks. Finally, we found limitations and uncertainties in the four key tests of the Gen-2 system's performance. Because it is not possible to test the BioWatch system directly by releasing live biothreat agents into the air in operational environments, DHS relied on chamber testing and the use of simulated biothreat agents, which limit the applicability of the results. These limitations underscore the need for a full accounting of statistical and other uncertainties, without which decision makers lack a full understanding of the Gen-2 system's capability to detect attacks of defined types and sizes and cannot make informed decisions about the value of proposed upgrades.", "The actions and decisions DHS made regarding the acquisition and testing of a proposed next generation of BioWatch (Gen-3) partially aligned with best practices GAO previously identified for developmental testing of threat detection systems. For example, best practices indicate that resilience testing, or testing for vulnerabilities, can help uncover problems early. While DHS took steps to help build resilience into the Gen-3 testing, future testing could be improved by using more rigorous methods to help predict performance in different operational environments. DHS canceled the Gen-3 acquisition in April 2014, but GAO identified lessons DHS could learn by applying these best practices to the proposed Gen-2 upgrades.", "According to experts and practitioners, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects genetic signatures of biothreat agents, is the most mature technology to use for an autonomous detection system. DHS is considering autonomous detection as an upgrade to Gen-2, because according to DHS, it may provide benefits such as reduction in casualties or clean-up costs. But the extent of these benefits is uncertain because of several assumptions, such as the speed of response after a detection, that are largely outside of DHS's control. As a result, the effectiveness of the response\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the number of lives that could be saved\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis uncertain. Further, an autonomous detection system must address several likely challenges, including minimizing possible false positive readings, meeting sensitivity requirements, and securing information technology networks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DHS not pursue upgrades or enhancements for Gen-2 until it reliably establishes the system's current capabilities.

Given the  relative speed and intensity with which a biological weapon of mass  destruction could affect the nation, experts and practitioners have sought  to augment traditional surveillance activities with biosurveillance  programs and systems to achieve early detection and warning. The  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) BioWatch program, begun in  2003, was designed to provide early indication of an aerosolized  biological weapon attack. Overseen by DHS\u2019s Office of Health Affairs  (OHA), the BioWatch program involves a system of aerosol collectors  deployed in more than 30 cities, as well as laboratory facilities and  personnel to analyze samples from these collectors. The program aims to  reduce the time required to recognize and characterize potentially  catastrophic aerosolized attacks by monitoring for the presence of certain  biological agents considered to pose high risk for an aerosolized attack.", "The currently deployed BioWatch system, known as Generation-2 (Gen- 2), operated on an annual budget of nearly $87 million in fiscal year 2015.  Gen-2 is designed to detect the presence of biothreat agents in 12 to 36  hours. The National Academies questioned Gen-2\u2019s technical capability in  2011, including its ability to detect attacks and the reliability of results that  indicate a possible attack. Although Gen-2 has been used in the field for  over a decade, the National Academies stated in 2011 that the rapid  initial deployment of BioWatch did not allow for sufficient testing,  validation, and evaluation of the system and its components.", "Questions have also been raised about testing conducted during the  evaluation of a next-generation technology for BioWatch, known as  Generation-3 (Gen-3) Phase I testing. The goal of the Gen-3 effort was  an autonomous system, that is, a single device that would collect airborne  particles, analyze them, and communicate the results to decision makers  automatically. Such a device, known as a lab-in-a-box, would contrast  with the current BioWatch system, in which samples are retrieved  manually and transported to laboratories for analysis. The new  technology aimed to reduce detection time, potentially generating a result  in under 6 hours, and to eliminate certain labor costs. The Gen-3  acquisition was canceled in April 2014, after testing difficulties and after  an analysis of alternatives was interpreted by DHS as showing any  advantages of an autonomous system over the current manual system  were insufficient to justify the cost of a full technology switch. Our prior  work has shown that BioWatch Gen-3 was among other DHS acquisitions  that, in an effort to deploy quickly, faced challenges because of testing  performance.", "Having canceled the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS continues to rely on the  Gen-2 system for early detection of an aerosolized biological attack.  Some Gen-2 equipment will reach the end of its life cycle in the next year,  and DHS will need to make decisions about reinvesting in the program.  Further, OHA and DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) are  collaborating on next steps for the BioWatch program in an attempt to  address the capability gap that Gen-3 was intended to fill, as well as other  technology upgrades and improvements to the Gen-2 system. Cost- benefit decisions about future investment in BioWatch will require reliable  information about Gen-2\u2019s current capabilities. More broadly, as the  National Academies noted in 2011, stakeholders in the biosurveillance  enterprise must consider not only the extent to which early detection can  make a difference given the challenges of effective response and medical  countermeasures, but also the trade-offs of allocating funding across the  range of biosurveillance activities. In this context, you asked us to review  technical aspects of the BioWatch program. This report addresses the  following questions:  1.  To what extent has DHS assessed the technical capability of the  currently deployed system (Gen-2) to detect a biological attack, which  is necessary to inform decisions about upgrades and enhancements?  2.  To what extent did DHS adhere to best practices for developmental  testing during Gen-3 Phase I, and what lessons can be learned as  DHS considers upgrades to Gen-2?  3.  Which technology is currently most mature for an autonomous  detection system as a possible upgrade from Gen-2, and what would  the potential benefits and likely challenges be if DHS were to pursue  an autonomous detection system in the near future?", "To determine the extent to which DHS has assessed the technical  capability of the Gen-2 system to detect an attack, we reviewed and  analyzed test reports and other agency and agency-commissioned  documents containing information on the design, development,  deployment, and technical performance characteristics of the system. We  also reviewed reports of modeling and simulation, conducted by  Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories for DHS, that analyzed  the performance and capabilities of the system. To assess the strengths  and limitations of tests and studies of the Gen-2 system, we used (1) a  framework for testing and evaluation of biodetection systems developed  by the National Research Council; (2) leading practices in risk analysis  and cost-benefit analysis; and (3) judgment of internal and external  experts in the fields of engineering, aerobiology, microbiology, and testing  and evaluation of biodetection systems.", "To determine whether DHS\u2019s actions during Gen-3 Phase I adhered to  best practices for developmental testing and to identify lessons that could  be learned, we reviewed the best practices previously developed in  conjunction with the National Academies to assess their appropriateness  to our review. We analyzed Gen-3 Phase I acquisition and testing  documents, such as the test and evaluation master plans, individual test  plans and results, and the operational requirements documents (which lay  out the minimum acceptable operational performance requirements). We  analyzed other DHS documentation on lessons learned, including the  Post Implementation Review assessment in which DHS identified its own  lessons learned on the Gen-3 acquisition. We reviewed the acquisition  decision memorandum (ADM) on the cancellation of the Gen-3  acquisition. We also compared the steps outlined in the test planning  documents with the recommended steps described in the best practices.  We consulted with internal and external experts on our evaluation of  DHS\u2019s actions and decisions against the best practices. We reviewed  prior GAO reports on the Gen-3 acquisition and the biosurveillance  enterprise. We also reviewed prior GAO work on other DHS acquisitions  that met challenges during early phases of testing to draw comparisons  with other DHS acquisitions that may have benefited from more robust  testing guidance.", "To identify the most mature technology for autonomous detection, we  reviewed a report of a 2013 workshop conducted by the National  Academies that assessed the state of technologies that are potentially  suitable for autonomous detection for the BioWatch program. We also  performed a literature review of journals and conference proceedings  published since 2012. Our literature review was not intended to be a  comprehensive examination of all technologies that might possibly be  applied to BioWatch, but rather a supplement to the National Academies  workshop report and a check to help ensure that the conclusions of that  workshop were not affected by more recent developments in the field. To  assess the potential benefits and likely challenges of autonomous  detection, we analyzed reports published by the Sandia National  Laboratories, as well as our prior work on the Gen-3 BioWatch system.  We performed a literature review for the past 12 years on models of how  response timing to a positive detection of agent release may affect  response effectiveness, in terms of lives saved. We interviewed officials  at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at DHS\u2019s Office  of Health Affairs, and at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)  who were familiar with BioWatch and biodetection technologies. We  asked for their views on the state of autonomous detection technology  and the potential benefits and likely challenges of autonomous detection  in the next 5 years.", "For additional insight and contextual sophistication supporting our  analysis across all research objectives, we interviewed DHS officials from  the BioWatch Program Office and S&T who had knowledge of the history  of the BioWatch program, the Gen-2 and Gen-3 technologies and  changes that had been made to the Gen-2 technology over time, and the  tests and studies that had been conducted on the Gen-2 and Gen-3  systems\u2019 technical capabilities. We also collected information from these  officials on DHS\u2019s actions and decisions during Phase I testing and  compared that with the recommended actions outlined in the best  practices for developmental testing.

These units rely on a vacuum-based  collection system that draws air through a filter. These filters are manually  collected and transported to state and local public health laboratories for  analysis using a process called polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Sometimes also called molecular photocopying, PCR is a technique used  to amplify (or copy) segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the  building blocks of genetic material. By targeting specific segments of  genetic material, PCR can be used as the basis for a test, or assay, for  the presence of genetic signatures associated with specific biological  organisms, such as the five BioWatch threat agents. (The program  monitors for six distinct biothreat agents, but two of these are closely  related, although they cause different diseases, and the BioWatch  program has treated them as a single agent. For consistency, we will treat  them as a single agent and report that there are five BioWatch threat  agents in total.) In the BioWatch Gen-2 system, multiple PCR assays are  used for each threat agent. In an initial \u201cscreening\u201d step, one assay is run  for each threat agent. If any of these assays yields a positive result,  suggesting the presence of one of the threat agents, then the analysis  proceeds to a \u201cverification\u201d step in which multiple additional assays are  run targeting different genetic signatures for that agent. If the verification  step also yields a positive result, then a BioWatch Actionable Result  (BAR) is declared. Using this manual process, the determination of a  BAR can occur from 12 to 36 hours after an agent is initially captured by  the aerosol collection unit. This 36-hour timeline consists of up to 24  hours for air sampling, up to 4 hours for retrieving the sample from an  aerosol collection unit and transporting it to the laboratory, and up to 8  hours for laboratory testing.", "Each BioWatch jurisdiction has either a BioWatch Advisory Committee or  equivalent decision-making group in place, composed of public health  officials, first responders, and other relevant stakeholders. The BioWatch  Advisory Committee is responsible for the day-to-day BioWatch  operations, including routine filter collection and laboratory analysis of  filter samples. In the event of a BAR, the BioWatch Advisory Committee,  in partnership with OHA and other stakeholders, is also responsible for  determining whether that BAR poses a public health risk and deciding  how to respond. The declaration of a BAR does not necessarily signal  that a biological attack has occurred. BARs have been triggered by  biological agents that occur naturally in numerous areas of the United  States. From 2003 through 2014, 149 BARs were declared, but none was  linked to an attack or to a public health threat. For a more detailed  discussion of this issue, see appendix II. Figure 1 shows the process that  local BioWatch jurisdictions are to follow when deciding how to respond to  a BAR."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A History of BioWatch", "paragraphs": ["In cooperation with other federal agencies, DHS created the BioWatch  program in 2003. The goal of BioWatch is to provide early warning,  detection, or recognition of a biological attack. When DHS was  established in 2002, a perceived urgency to deploy useful\u2014even if  immature\u2014technologies in the face of potentially catastrophic  consequences catalyzed the rapid deployment of many technologies. In  the initial deployment of BioWatch\u2014known as Generation-1\u2014DHS  deployed aerosol collectors to 20 major metropolitan areas, known as  BioWatch jurisdictions, to monitor primarily outdoor spaces. DHS  completed the initial deployment quickly\u2014within 80 days of the  President\u2019s announcement of the BioWatch program in his 2003 State of  the Union Address. To accomplish this rapid deployment, DHS adapted  an existing technology that was already used for other air monitoring  missions. In 2005, DHS expanded BioWatch to an additional 10  jurisdictions, for a total of more than 30. The expanded deployment\u2014 referred to as Gen-2\u2014also included the addition of indoor monitoring  capabilities in three high-threat jurisdictions and provided additional  capacity for events of national significance, such as major sporting events  and political conventions. The technology used in Gen-1 and Gen-2 was  deployed rapidly and, according to the National Academies in 2011,  without sufficient testing, validation, and evaluation of its technical  capabilities.", "To reduce the time required to detect biothreat agents, DHS began to  develop autonomous detection capability in 2003 for the BioWatch  program\u2014known as Gen-3. Envisioned as a laboratory-in-a-box, the  autonomous detection system would automatically collect air samples,  conduct analysis to detect the presence of biothreat agents every 4 to 6  hours, and communicate the results to public health officials via an  electronic network without manual intervention. By automating the  analysis, DHS anticipated that detection time could be reduced to 6 hours  or less, making the technology more appropriate for monitoring indoor  high-occupancy facilities such as transportation nodes and enabling a  more rapid response to an attack. DHS also anticipated a reduction in  operational costs by eliminating the program\u2019s daily manual sample  retrieval and laboratory analysis. In 2008, DHS OHA initiated a  competitive bid process for the first testing phase of the Gen-3  acquisition, known as Gen-3 Phase I. Five vendors responded to the  request for proposal, and DHS awarded contracts to two, for technologies  known as the Bioagent Autonomous Network Detector (BAND, later  named M-BAND) and the Next Gen Automated Detection System (NG- ADS).", "From May 2010 through June 2011, the BioWatch program conducted  Phase I testing on these candidate Gen-3 technologies. The testing  goals included characterizing the state of available autonomous detection  technology on the market and evaluating the candidate systems\u2019 abilities  to meet performance requirements developed by the BioWatch program.  The Phase I testing consisted of testing of individual system components,  such as the aerosol sampling component (the component that collects  particles from the air) and the analytical subsystem (the component that  detects and identifies biothreat agents), whole system chamber testing,  and an operational field test in a BioWatch jurisdiction. Characterization  testing did not demonstrate the system\u2019s end-to-end ability to detect the  five BioWatch threat agents in an operational environment because these  agents cannot be released into the air in such environments.", "Expressing concern in 2011 about the rigor of DHS\u2019s effort to help guide  its Gen-3 decision making, Members of the Congress asked us to  examine issues related to the Gen-3 acquisition. We released a report  that evaluated the acquisition decision-making process for Gen-3 in  September 2012. We recommended that before continuing the Gen-3  acquisition, DHS should carry out key acquisition steps, including  reevaluating the mission need and systematically analyzing alternatives  based on cost-benefit and risk information. DHS subsequently  commissioned an analysis of alternatives, which was interpreted by DHS  as showing that any advantages of an autonomous system over the  current manual system were insufficient to justify the cost of a full  technology switch. DHS\u2019s April 24, 2014, ADM announced the  cancellation of the Gen-3 acquisition and made Gen-2 the official program  of record for aerosol biological threat detection. The ADM also directed  S&T to explore development and maturation of an effective and  affordable automated aerosol biodetection capability, or other operational  enhancements, that meets the operational requirements of the BioWatch  system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methods and Measures for Assessing System Performance", "paragraphs": ["The capabilities of the BioWatch system can be assessed at three  different levels (fig. 2). At the highest level, BioWatch consists of an array  of aerosol collectors deployed in an operational environment and the  associated laboratory processes for analyzing samples. The operational  environment might be outdoors, as in a metropolitan area (shown in the  fig.); indoors, as in an airport; or a subway or other transit system. At this  level, the capability of the system to detect an attack depends on factors  that include the performance characteristics of the technology (including  the aerosol collector and the technology used for laboratory analysis of  samples), the number and locations of the collectors, the location of an  attack (that is, where a biothreat agent is released into the air), and wind  patterns (for an outdoor attack).", "At the next level is the detector, which consists of the aerosol collector  unit and the process by which samples collected by this unit are  transferred to a laboratory and analyzed. Performance and  effectiveness at this level depend on the technical performance  characteristics of the aerosol collector itself, the extent to which the  sample is preserved intact during the collection cycle and during transport  to the laboratory, and the laboratory processes that are used to prepare  and analyze the sample.", "Finally, performance can also be assessed at the level of individual  components of the detector. These include (1) the aerosol collection unit,  which collects and retains aerosol particles on a filter; (2) the sample  recovery process, by which samples are removed from the aerosol  collector and transported to a laboratory; (3) the filter extraction process,  in which aerosol particles are removed from the filter and put into a liquid  solution; (4) the DNA extraction process, in which DNA is extracted from  the aerosol particles in liquid solution in preparation for further analysis;  and (5) the PCR assays, which are used to test for the presence of  specific genetic signatures of biothreat agents (as described earlier).", "At the highest level\u2014an array of detectors deployed in an operational  environment\u2014measures of performance include the system\u2019s probability  of detection (Pd) for attacks of different types and sizes. The BioWatch  program employs a variation on the Pd measure that is designed to  assess the system\u2019s ability to detect attacks that could cause large  numbers of casualties. Because BioWatch threat agents cannot be  released into the air in operational environments, the performance of an  array of detectors cannot be tested directly. One method of testing that  can be used to address this limitation is the use of simulants for biothreat  agents. A simulant is a selected nonpathogenic organism that mimics all  or some of the physical or biological characteristics of one or more  pathogenic agents. Another method that has been used for BioWatch  involves computer modeling and simulation of attack scenarios.", "At the level of a single detector, key measures of system performance  include limits of detection, probability of detection, and specificity. The  limits of detection are the lowest aerosol concentrations at which the  system can detect the presence of a biothreat agent with a defined level  of reliability. Probability of detection is the likelihood that the system will  correctly detect the presence of a biothreat agent when it is present at a  given aerosol concentration in the immediate vicinity of the detector.  Specificity is the probability that the system will correctly yield a negative  result when a biothreat agent is not present (that is, the probability that  the system will not generate a \u201cfalse positive\u201d). The term specificity may  also refer to the system\u2019s ability to distinguish a biothreat agent from  other, similar organisms.", "At this single detector level, limits of detection and probability of detection  reflect the sensitivity of the system and help determine the ability of an  array of detectors in an operational environment to detect attacks; all else  being equal, a more sensitive system will have greater ability to detect  attacks. (Note, however, that the sensitivity of a single detector reflects its  ability to detect an aerosol at the location where the detector is placed;  additional analysis must be done to say what this means for the ability of  an array of detectors in different locations to detect attacks of defined  types and sizes.) The specificity of the system may contribute to the  confidence that stakeholders and decision makers have in a positive  result; a system with higher specificity is less likely to generate false  positives, so users can have greater confidence in a positive result.", "Detector-level performance is assessed primarily through testing. Such  tests may be conducted in laboratory chambers or in open air and may  involve live biothreat agents or simulants. End-to-end tests using live  agents are currently not possible for the BioWatch system, as the  BioWatch threat agents cannot be released in open-air environments, and  at present there is no indoor chamber in which testing the Gen-2 system  with live agents is technically feasible. Consequently, end-to-end tests  of BioWatch must rely on simulants, which may be inactivated, or killed,  forms of the same agents that the system is designed to detect.  Alternatively, simulants may be related organisms, either live or killed.  Testing a biodetection system outdoors with killed related organisms  presents the most realistic opportunity to evaluate performance in an  operationally representative environment.", "Individual components of a detection system, such as the aerosol  collector or the assay component, may be tested under strictly defined  conditions. This type of testing could support comparisons of components  with live agents and simulants and provides for a tight control of test  conditions and variables for a robust characterization of components.  However, testing components in a laboratory or chamber setting typically  excludes some factors that might affect system performance in an  operational environment, such as meteorological factors and materials in  the air that might interfere with system performance (called interferents).  Important meteorological factors include relative humidity, temperature,  and solar irradiance; important interferents include pollutants (e.g.,  nitrates or carbon monoxide), as well as smoke and dust, all of which can  influence the performance of a biodetection system. Also, the operational  environment is difficult to reproduce in a biological containment chamber  in terms of the aerosol concentration, particle size distribution, aging of  the agent, and dispersion dynamics. The metrics used for components of  a system depend on the component being tested. For example, for an  aerosol collection component, they might include efficiency (i.e., the  percentage of aerosol particles successfully collected on the filter and  retained intact for subsequent analysis). For laboratory tests or assays,  other metrics are used, including sensitivity, limits of detection, and  specificity, as well as the efficiency of the processes by which samples  are removed from the filter and prepared for analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Biodefense, BioWatch, and the Biosurveillance Enterprise", "paragraphs": ["Concerned with the threat of bioterrorism, in 2004, the White House  released Homeland Security Presidential Directive 10 (HSPD-10), which  outlined four pillars of the biodefense enterprise and discussed various  federal efforts and responsibilities to help support it. The biodefense  enterprise is the whole combination of systems at every level of  government and the private sector that can contribute to protecting the  nation and its citizens from potentially catastrophic effects of a biological  event. It is composed of a complex collection of federal, state, local, tribal,  territorial, and private resources, programs, and initiatives, designed for  different purposes and dedicated to mitigating various risks, both natural  and intentional. The four pillars of biodefense outlined in HSPD-10 were  (1) threat awareness, (2) prevention and protection, (3) surveillance and  detection, and (4) response and recovery. The BioWatch program falls  under the surveillance and detection pillar, as an example of an  environmental monitoring activity. Biosurveillance also includes disease  monitoring and reporting to protect humans, animals, and plants from  potentially catastrophic effects of intentional or natural biological events.", "However, in 2011, the National Academies evaluation of BioWatch noted  considerable uncertainty about the likelihood and magnitude of a  biological attack, and about how the risk of a release of an aerosolized  pathogen compares with risks from other potential forms of terrorism or  from natural diseases. BioWatch was deployed rapidly to meet a  perceived need for a system to detect catastrophic attacks. More recently,  as we reported in 2012, OHA officials told us they use the Bioterrorism  Risk Assessment (BTRA) to inform BioWatch because it is the most  relevant risk assessment available to them and because it allows OHA to  focus BioWatch detection efforts on the biological agents of significant  concern. However, in 2008, the National Academies raised concerns  about the methods used to develop the BTRA, particularly the methods  used to assess the probability of an attack. The last full BTRA was  issued in 2010 and did not address all the recommendations made by the  National Academies.", "The National Academies\u2019 evaluation of BioWatch in 2011 also stated that  to achieve its health protection goals, the BioWatch system should be  better linked to a broader and more effective national biosurveillance  framework that will help provide state and local public health authorities,  in collaboration with the health care system, with the information they  need to determine the appropriate response to a possible or confirmed  attack or disease outbreak. In our earlier work, we highlighted the  uncertainty about the incremental risk-mitigating benefit of the kind of  environmental monitoring offered by BioWatch because of its relatively  limited scope and the challenges agencies face in making investment  decisions. In our June 2010 report on federal biosurveillance efforts, we  recommended the Homeland Security Council direct the National Security  Staff to identify a focal point to lead the development of a national  biosurveillance strategy. We made this recommendation because we  recognized the difficulty that decision makers and program managers in  individual federal agencies face prioritizing resources to help ensure a  coherent effort across a vast and dispersed interagency,  intergovernmental, and intersectoral network. Therefore, we called for a  strategy that would, among other things, (1) define the scope and  purpose of a national capability; (2) provide goals, objectives and  activities, priorities, milestones, and performance measures; and (3)  assess the costs and benefits and identify resource and investment  needs, including investment priorities. In July 2012, the White House  released the National Strategy for Biosurveillance to describe the U.S.  government\u2019s approach to strengthening biosurveillance, but it did not  fully meet the intent of our prior recommendations, because it did not offer  a mechanism to identify resource and investment needs, including  investment priorities among various biosurveillance efforts. Further, in  2005, we reported that because the nation cannot afford to protect  everything against all threats, choices must be made about protection  priorities given the risk and how to best allocate available resources.  The strategic implementation plan has not been publicly released, but  according to the strategy, it will include specific actions and activity scope,  designated roles and responsibilities, and a mechanism for evaluating  progress.

The outdoor demonstration, performed by the Naval Surface  Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, involved releasing a simulant for one  of the BioWatch threat agents and showed that the Gen-2 technology  could successfully detect this simulant in an open-air environment.

DHS officials told us that the system\u2019s operational  objective is to detect catastrophic attacks, which they define as attacks  large enough to cause 10,000 casualties, and they stated that the system  is able to meet this objective. However, as we have previously reported,  the BioWatch system was deployed quickly in 2003 to address a  perceived urgent need; it was deployed without performance  requirements and, as the National Academies has reported, without  sufficient testing. In keeping with Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) guidance on making decisions about federal programs, decisions  about upgrades for BioWatch will require comprehensive information  about the benefits and costs associated with the current system, including  its capability to meet its operational objective. However, DHS officials  told us that in the 12 years since BioWatch\u2019s initial deployment, they have  not developed technical performance requirements against which to  measure the system\u2019s ability to meet its objective. Nevertheless, DHS has  already taken steps to pursue enhancements to the Gen-2 system.  Because DHS lacks targets for the current system\u2019s performance  characteristics, including limits of detection, that would enable  conclusions about the system\u2019s ability to detect attacks of defined types  and sizes with specified probabilities, it also cannot ensure it has  complete information to make decisions about upgrades or  enhancements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS-Commissioned Modeling and Simulation Studies Have Not Directly and Comprehensively Assessed Gen-2 Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["In the absence of technical performance requirements for Gen-2, DHS  officials said they have used modeling and simulation studies,  commissioned from multiple national laboratories, to link test results to  conclusions about the system\u2019s ability to detect attacks.

However, while DHS officials  provided reports to illustrate the modeling and simulation work that has  been done, none of the studies that were provided or described to us  incorporated specific test results, accounted for uncertainties in those  results, and drew specific conclusions about the Gen-2 system\u2019s ability to  achieve the defined operational objective. Further, according to officials,  DHS has not prepared an analysis of its own that combines the modeling  and simulation studies with the specific Gen-2 test results to demonstrate  DHS\u2019s assertions about the system\u2019s capabilities to detect attacks of  defined types and sizes.", "The modeling and simulation studies were designed for purposes other  than to directly and comprehensively assess Gen-2\u2019s operational  capabilities. For example, one set of modeling and simulation studies,  conducted by Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) in collaboration with  other national laboratories, was designed to predict the capabilities of  hypothetical biodetection systems (similar to BioWatch) with different  performance characteristics and deployed in different ways. For instance,  these studies, which Sandia researchers called trade-space studies,  assessed possible trade-offs in deploying fewer detectors with higher  sensitivity or deploying more detectors with lower sensitivity. Sandia  constructed models of hypothetical biodetection systems and then  analyzed how these hypothetical systems would respond to simulated  attacks of different sizes, using different agents, in different locations, and  under different conditions (e.g., outdoor attacks with different wind speeds  and directions, which affect how an aerosol disperses over an area).  Because the goal was to assess hypothetical biodetection systems,  Sandia analyzed ranges of hypothetical system sensitivities rather than  incorporating the results of the four key tests of the performance  characteristics of Gen-2. These studies drew no conclusions about the  actual capabilities of the deployed Gen-2 system.", "Further, the trade-space studies did not incorporate information about the  actual locations of Gen-2 collector units. Rather, these studies were  designed to model hypothetical BioWatch deployments in which collectors  were placed in optimal locations. If the Gen-2 collectors were not actually  placed in these optimal locations, then model results might not accurately  describe the capabilities of the system as currently deployed.", "In addition to the trade-space studies, DHS officials described modeling  and simulation work they commissioned for the purpose of selecting sites  for Gen-2 collector units; however, this work also had limitations that  prevent specific conclusions about the Gen-2 system\u2019s operational  capabilities. Unlike the trade-space studies, the collector-siting analyses  do include a test result that is meant to describe the sensitivity of the  Gen-2 system. However, the test result used in this work was for just one  of the five BioWatch threat agents, as decisions about collector siting are  based on just this one agent. Consequently, these collector-siting  analyses contain no information about the system\u2019s capabilities to detect  attacks using any of the other four BioWatch threat agents. Further, the  test result used in this work was not from the four key tests of Gen-2  described earlier, but from an older test from 2004. An internal DHS  analysis in 2013 noted that there were differences between the system  tested in 2004 and the currently deployed system that limit the ability to  draw conclusions from the 2004 results. Finally, the collector-siting  studies use a measure of operational capability that does not directly  support conclusions about the BioWatch objective of detecting attacks  large enough to cause 10,000 casualties. In general, these studies use a  measure called fraction of population protected, or Fp. Roughly speaking,  Fp represents a system\u2019s probability of successfully detecting simulated  attacks, but calculated in a way that gives more weight to attacks that  infect more people and less weight to attacks that infect fewer people. We  believe this metric does not directly support conclusions about the  system\u2019s ability to detect attacks causing more than 10,000 casualties.  Such conclusions would be supported by another metric that has been  used by Sandia but is not preferred by the BioWatch program: the  probability of detection (Pd) for attacks causing more than 10,000  casualties. DHS officials told us that they use Fp because BioWatch has  a public health mission and so the system should be assessed in a way  that reflects its ability to detect attacks that infect more people. However,  Pd for attacks causing more than 10,000 casualties also incorporates  public health impact; unlike Fp, it could directly support conclusions about  the BioWatch operational objective, and, as noted in a Sandia report, is  straightforward to communicate. Sandia officials told us that Fp has  certain strengths and is appropriate for certain purposes. However,  because the collector-siting studies focus on Fp, their results are not  straightforward to communicate and do not support conclusions that align  directly with the BioWatch operational objective.", "Finally, because none of the modeling and simulation work was designed  to interpret Gen-2 test results and comprehensively assess the  capabilities of the Gen-2 system, none of these studies has provided a full  accounting of statistical and other uncertainties\u2014meaning decision  makers have no means of understanding the precision or confidence in  what is known about system capabilities. Best practices in risk analysis  and cost-benefit analysis require an explicit accounting of uncertainties so  that decision makers can grasp the reliability of, and precision in,  estimates to be used for decision making. Estimates of the Gen-2  system\u2019s limits of detection, produced by the four key tests described  earlier, contain multiple sources of uncertainty, which we describe in the  next section of this report. None of the modeling and simulation studies  that were provided or described to us incorporated information about the  uncertainties associated with estimates of the system\u2019s limits of  detection.", "We also found that these studies did not account for uncertainty in some  model inputs and assumptions, including estimates of how infectious  each of the BioWatch threat agents is and how quickly each agent decays  after it is released in the air. For example, Sandia researchers and a  subject matter expert told us that there is considerable uncertainty in even  the best available estimates of the infectious dose of anthrax, as these  estimates are based on data from nonhuman primates. In an earlier  study, Sandia researchers and others reported that \u201cgaps in our  knowledge of the correct dose-response relationship significantly limit our  ability to predict the outcome of outdoor anthrax attacks.\u201d For many of  the assumptions the Sandia models used, researchers dealt with  uncertainty by using not just single estimates but ranges of estimates.  However, for the infectious doses of the five BioWatch threat agents,  researchers used single estimates that DHS provided. The uncertainty in  these estimates is important because DHS officials have characterized  the operational objective of the BioWatch system as detecting attacks  large enough to cause 10,000 casualties. In order to assess the system\u2019s  capability to achieve this objective, DHS must be able to correctly define  the types and sizes of attack that fall into this category. If anthrax were  less infectious than the models assumed, then DHS would be  underestimating the system\u2019s ability to detect catastrophic anthrax  attacks. Conversely, if anthrax were more infectious than the models  assumed, then DHS would be overestimating the system\u2019s ability to  detect such attacks. We recognize that more precise infectious dose  estimates may not exist, but this underscores the uncertainty in the ability  of the BioWatch system to meet its operational objective\u2014uncertainty that  should be articulated to better inform decision makers about the  capabilities of the Gen-2 system and inform cost-benefit decisions about  any possible enhancements to the system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations and Uncertainties in Test Results", "paragraphs": ["We found limitations and uncertainties in the four key tests of the Gen-2  system\u2019s performance characteristics\u2014in particular, in the use of test  chambers instead of operational environments and the use of simulants in  place of live biothreat agents. As noted earlier, it is not possible to test the  BioWatch system directly by releasing live biothreat agents into the air in  operational environments. Because of this constraint, which is beyond  DHS\u2019s control, the agency commissioned tests that involved aerosols in  test chambers or were limited to components of the system for which  aerosols were not necessary. Further, officials and experts told us there  are no test chambers where testing the Gen-2 system with live agent is  technically feasible; thus some tests have involved simulants in place of  live biothreat agents.", "Using laboratory chambers and simulants effectively addressed certain  challenges, but both introduced uncertainties into testing results.  Chambers often differ from operational environments in ways that can  affect a system\u2019s performance. For example, chamber environments are  generally not designed to be representative of operational environments  in such factors as air temperature, humidity, and, according to an expert,  the presence of potential interferents in the air. Similarly, simulants may  not mimic the biothreat agents that the system is designed to detect in all  of the ways that matter for system performance; therefore, the system  might perform differently when presented with the target biothreat agents  than when tested with simulants. As a result, chambers and simulants  create uncertainty as to whether test results accurately describe how the  system would perform in an operational environment against live  BioWatch threat agents, and this uncertainty should be clearly articulated  for decision makers.", "Additionally, while one of the four tests assessed the performance of the  whole Gen-2 system, the three other tests were limited by their focus on  components of the system, including (1) the aerosol collection  component; (2) the filter wash process, in which aerosol particles are  transferred from the filter into a liquid solution; (3) the DNA extraction  process, in which genetic material is extracted from the particles in liquid  solution; and (4) the analytical component, in which PCR assays are used  to detect genetic signatures of the BioWatch threat agents. According to a  National Research Council (NRC) committee, it is uncertain whether test  results from individual components of a biodetection system will  accurately reflect the performance of the whole system. An expert told  us that components may perform differently when combined than when  tested separately, and parts of samples may be lost during transitions  from one component to another in ways that affect the end-to-end  performance of the system.", "DHS took steps to mitigate the limitations associated with not testing the  Gen-2 system in an operational environment with live biothreat agents,  but these limitations could not be eliminated entirely. For example, to  address the fact that killed agents might not perfectly mimic live biothreat  agents, the Dugway tests included a direct comparison of live and killed  agents, but this could be done only for the analytical component of the  system (that is, the PCR assays). The Edgewood Chemical Biological  Center test of the aerosol collection component included variations in  temperature and humidity. This somewhat mitigated the fact that  chambers may not be representative of operational environments;  however, only a small number of combinations of temperature and  humidity were tested, and an expert told us other characteristics that  might differ between chambers and operational environments were not  varied. The Los Alamos National Laboratory tests of the PCR assays  included testing the assays with a set of environmental organisms and  substances. However, this test was limited to the specific organisms and  substances used, and results do not generalize to other organisms and  substances that might occur in BioWatch operational environments. In  sum, although the key tests of the Gen-2 system took steps to mitigate  limitations, uncertainties remain, and test results constitute only limited  measures of key system performance parameters in an operational  environment.", "While challenges associated with testing a system like BioWatch make  some limitations unavoidable, according to experts and agency officials,  we found that some limitations could likely have been mitigated. In 2004,  an NRC committee proposed a framework for testing biodetection  systems that was designed to minimize the uncertainties associated with  laboratory chambers and simulants. In this framework, both the whole  system and its components are systematically tested with simulants and,  where possible, live biothreat agents. This is done in both laboratory  chambers and environments that are more representative of operational  environments where the system will be deployed. Importantly, this  framework entails an integrated, systematic approach to testing in which  some factors (e.g., agents, simulants, and environmental factors) are held  constant while others are varied. The committee recommended focusing  on a certain category of simulants, known as killed related strains, that  have potential to mimic live biothreat agents while also enabling more  realistic and frequent testing. The overall goal of the NRC framework is to  home in on the true performance of the system when challenged with live  agents in an operational environment\u2014and, in so doing, to reduce the  risk that the system will perform differently in the real world than it did  during testing.", "DHS has not systematically tested the Gen-2 system under the most  realistic possible conditions. Although DHS officials said they based their  approach to testing Gen-2 on the NRC framework, we found that the  Dugway test of system sensitivity did not incorporate killed related strains  as simulants, as recommended by the NRC. Killed related strains would  offer greater flexibility for use in more operationally representative  environments. Furthermore, the Dugway test did not attempt to  incorporate potential environmental interferents. As noted earlier, DHS  also commissioned a demonstration that the Gen-2 technology could  detect a simulant in an outdoor environment. However, aerosol  concentrations were not varied systematically and measured  independently in such a way as to produce statistical estimates of the  system\u2019s sensitivity. Furthermore, this open-air demonstration involved a  simulant for just one of the five BioWatch threat agents, and, unlike the  killed related strains recommended by the NRC, this simulant required  that the system be modified to use a different PCR assay than is used for  the actual threat agent. A GAO subject matter expert on outdoor testing of  biodetection systems with simulants assessed the Dahlgren trials to be  deficient in the equipment that was used to characterize the aerosols; if  alternative equipment known as slit-to-agar samplers had been used,  they could have provided more useful information on aerosol  concentrations and exposure times. According to this expert, additional  problems were associated with an inadequate dissemination system and  inadvisable testing at wind speeds below 2.0 meters/second. In general,  DHS\u2019s understanding of the performance characteristics of the current  system would benefit from a more systematic approach to testing under  more realistic conditions.", "In the next year, some Gen-2 equipment will reach the end of its lifecycle,  and DHS will need to make decisions about reinvesting in the program.  Further, DHS officials told us they are considering potential improvements  or upgrades to the Gen-2 system. Based on OMB guidance, cost-benefit  decisions about investing in new equipment and in potential system  improvements will require information about current operational  capabilities. However, because of the limitations we have identified,  decision makers are not assured of having sufficient information to ensure  future investments are actually addressing a capability gap not met by the  current system. As noted earlier, some limitations in testing are  unavoidable given the nature and purpose of the BioWatch system.  Likewise, some limitations and uncertainties are unavoidable in the  modeling and simulation work that DHS has commissioned to link test  results to operational capabilities (e.g., the uncertainty in infectious dose  estimates for the BioWatch threat agents). These limitations underscore  the need for a full accounting of statistical and other uncertainties, without  which decision makers lack an understanding of the precision in what is  known about the system\u2019s capability to detect attacks of defined types  and sizes and cannot make informed decisions about possible upgrades  to Gen-2."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Gen-3 Testing Partially Aligned with Best Practices, and Gen-2 Upgrades Could Benefit by Applying Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["In 2013, in collaboration with the National Academies, we identified eight  best practices for developmental testing of threat detection systems.

According to the experts, the best  practices apply if the system is commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS), modified  COTS, or newly developed for a specific threat detection purpose by a  vendor or the government. In discussing the role of testing early in an  acquisition, officials from S&T\u2019s Office of Operational Test and Evaluation  (OT&E) said programs face a significant challenge in acquiring COTS  products, like the BioWatch Gen-3 acquisition, because these products or  systems are not designed to operate or initially tested with the same  requirements needed by the federal government. Typically, OT&E officials  said, program officials underestimate the testing needed to acquire a  COTS product for their mission, but said testing is needed to ensure the  COTS solution is reliable, scalable, and secure. We reported in 2012 that  according to BioWatch program officials, developing autonomous  biological detection had proved challenging, in part because some of the  technology required was novel, but also because even the existing  technologies\u2014for example, the aerosol collection unit and the apparatus  that reads the PCR results\u2014had not been combined for this specific  application in an operational environment before. S&T OT&E officials  reflecting on the acquisition said Gen-3 Phase I testing became  developmental in nature, with additional steps built into the test design to  ensure the technology could progress to the next level, particularly to  ensure assay detection met the program\u2019s requirements.", "We consider the best practices for developmental testing applicable to  Phase I of the Gen-3 acquisition because they could have helped identify  challenges early in the acquisition process. Additionally, applying the best  practices and lessons learned during the Gen-3 testing could help  mitigate the risk that DHS acquires immature technology as part of its  effort to make enhancements to Gen-2. Appendix I has more information  on our methodology for developing the best practices, and appendix III  has a description of each best practice. Our analysis of DHS\u2019s alignment  with the eight best practices for developmental testing of Gen-3 follows  below and is summarized in table 2.", "DHS\u2019s Actions Partially Aligned with Best Practice 1  DHS took some risk-mitigating steps during Gen-3 Phase I, but did not  conduct a full risk assessment at the outset of the acquisition. According  to program officials, Phase I of the overall Gen-3 acquisition was itself a  risk mitigation activity, designed to assess the capability of industry to  provide mature autonomous detection solutions before committing to a  rapid and extensive program to procure and field operational systems.  For example, according to BioWatch program officials, DHS conducted  market research to assess whether solutions potentially capable of  meeting DHS performance and maturity (and therefore schedule)  requirements existed. In an effort to ensure accountability, OHA held a  \u201cDemonstration Day\u201d early in the Phase I source selection process, where  vendors participated in tests designed to confirm their technical maturity  claims. This reduced (but did not eliminate) the risk of awarding Phase I  contracts to a vendor not capable of completing the tests planned under  Phase I. Additionally, officials said OHA initially planned to conduct all  testing in parallel. However, because of schedule slips associated with  contract issues, program officials ended up scheduling the tests  incrementally to allow for the insertion of decision points on whether  testing should continue. This allowed program officials to engage in the  testing and evaluate test results to help reduce technical and financial  risk. As a result of this multi-stage Phase I testing approach, DHS  identified limitations to one vendor\u2019s detection system that could not be  overcome before proceeding with the next stages of testing.", "DHS Could Apply Lessons Learned  An earlier evaluation of risk may have eliminated difficulties with cost and  schedule estimates of the Gen-3 acquisition that in part led to its  cancellation in April 2014. According to this best practice, risk needs to be  assessed when the system is COTS, modified COTS, or a newly  developed system, because even with commercial items, significant  modifications may be needed. DHS ultimately performed a formal risk  assessment of the Gen-3 acquisition but not until after Phase I testing  ended. The absence of a risk assessment at the start of the acquisition  led to challenges that the acquisition could not overcome because of its  inflexibility. In 2012, we reported that DHS did not fully engage in the  early phases of its acquisition framework to ensure that the acquisition  pursued an optimal solution in the context of its costs, benefits, and  risks. Our prior work has found that stable parameters for performance,  cost, and schedule are among the factors that are important for  successfully delivering capabilities within cost and schedule expectations.  Our work has also found that without the development, review, and  approval of key acquisition documents, agencies are at risk of having  poorly defined requirements that can negatively affect program  performance and contribute to increased costs. For example, despite  having limited assurance that the acquisition would successfully deliver  the intended capability within cost and on schedule, the Deputy Secretary  approved the initial stages of the acquisition. DHS\u2019s Post Implementation  Review Report, which lays out lessons learned on the Gen-3 acquisition,  states that the Phase I testing demonstrated that schedule risk analyses  should be used to set realistic test and evaluation schedule expectations.  According to program officials, they set the acquisition schedule estimate  aggressively because there was pressure to quickly deploy an  autonomous detection capability. However, schedule revisions were  needed because of significant changes in performance, deployment  schedule, and cost expectations as a result of the Phase I testing.", "By not engaging in the initial steps of the acquisition framework to  effectively account for risks early in the acquisition, DHS did not  demonstrate full accountability and exceeded its cost and timeframe  estimates. As a result of the Phase I testing, and on the basis of outside  reviews of the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS directed OHA to conduct a more  robust analysis of alternatives that included assessing risk. This led to the  cancellation of the Gen-3 acquisition in April 2014. The identification of  potential risks, and strategies to overcome these risks, helps ensure  accountability on the part of the agency and may alleviate problems with  the acquisition of threat detection systems if they are part of the early  planning for testing. As DHS considers upgrades to the currently  deployed Gen-2 BioWatch system or considers the acquisition of new  detection technologies, early identification of risks may help better guide  DHS by identifying areas for enhanced engagement that may be needed  during the testing and to help ensure proper accountability for decision  making during the acquisition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Practice 2: Include Representatives from the User Community in Design and Developmental Testing Teams to Ensure Acceptance of the System by the User Community", "paragraphs": ["Acquisition Decision Event (ADE) 2A  An acquisition decision event, where the  Acquisition Review Board\u2014a cross- component board of senior DHS officials\u2014 determines whether a proposed acquisition  has met the requirements of the relevant  Acquisition Life-Cycle Framework phase and  is able to proceed.

As we reported in 2012, the process used to set the  sensitivity requirement did not reflect stakeholder consensus about how  to balance mission needs with technological capabilities. Specifically, the  BioWatch program did not prepare a concept of operations (CONOPS)  before ADE-2A. According to DHS acquisitions guidance, in developing  a concept of operations, stakeholders engage in a consensus-building  process regarding how to balance technological capabilities with mission  needs in order to gain consensus on the use, capabilities, and benefits of  a system. For BioWatch, this could include specifying the level of  population protection the system should provide and then specifying the  sensitivity levels needed to provide that level of protection. According to  OHA officials, the high-level capability gaps documented in the mission  need statement (timeliness, population coverage, time resolution, and  cost-effectiveness) were representative of feedback from this user  community with respect to improvements needed on the Gen-2 system,  particularly for indoor deployment.

For a program like BioWatch,  SMEs may have expertise in epidemiology,  environmental health, public health laboratory  systems, infectious diseases, genetics, and  detection technology, among other  disciplines. Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) acquisitions policy includes guidance  on using independent technical advisors as  part of the test and evaluation process.

These included  requirements for system sensitivity, time needed to detect an attack, and  the probability of false positives, among other things. According to OHA  officials, jurisdictions (especially the four that were selected for OT&E)  were kept informed through meetings with the program office,  independent test agencies, and the two competing vendors in the Phase I  testing. OHA officials also said they conducted numerous updates at  events such as the National BioWatch Stakeholders Workshop, webinars,  and invitations to all jurisdictions to submit questions to the Gen-3 or  BioWatch program managers. According to OHA officials, the end user  community was also invited to observe testing at two special testing  events during Phase I. However, informing end users of the status of  testing is not the same as including them in the development of  requirements and testing. If DHS had involved end users as part of the  testing process, it could have shed additional light on the potential  challenges for end users to operate the technology being considered.

More closely involving the end users in the testing may  have revealed additional end user views on their ability and willingness to  use the equipment, given its complexity. Additionally, in December 2010,  the Undersecretary for Management issued an ADM that, among other  things, highlighted the continued need to develop a CONOPS, citing  significant risk to the program because of the high-level coordination  required for acting upon detection information produced by the  autonomous detection system and that there was insufficient detail in the  program documentation describing the necessary coordination process  among end users and other stakeholders.", "DHS Could Apply Lessons Learned  DHS recognized in its Post Implementation Review that stakeholders and  end users need to be involved earlier in the acquisition process, including  validating advanced detection systems and methods before they are  fielded.

However, testing revealed that evaluation of these detection systems may  benefit from more robust testing methods, particularly to test performance  against environmental contaminants. The primary purpose of the Phase I  testing was characterizing the systems\u2019 performance through a series of  tests that included an aerosol collection subsystem test, evaluation of  assays, an analytical subsystem test, a system chamber test, and a field  test. The TEMP clearly identified these test boundaries and stated that all  technologies must meet the five key performance parameters (KPP)  during Phase I testing before selection would be made and Phase II  testing (operational testing) was initiated. KPPs included detection of the  biological agents, system sensitivity, the time to detect, achieved  availability (for example, the probability the detector will operate under  normal conditions), and the probability of a false positive.", "The TEMP recognized inherent limitations to the systems engineering  testing for the Gen-3 system. For example, whereas the environmental  conditions under which the Gen-3 system must operate were outlined in  the TEMP, no chamber yet exists in which these requirements can be  fully tested.

The TEMP outlined the  systems engineering approach for Gen-3 testing by articulating the major  issues that needed to be addressed in testing the system, including the  key performance parameters, and accounted for the limitations given  constraints on the type of testing that can be done.", "DHS Could Apply Lessons Learned  Although DHS clearly articulated the boundaries of the testing for Phase I  and took steps to test the autonomous detectors against likely  environmental contaminants that might interfere with detection, the  systems engineering approach could have benefited from more robust  and comprehensive testing methods. For example, tests at Dugway also  attempted to account for the possibility that environmental pollutants  might interfere with the performance of the PCR assays by placing  samples in liquid solutions taken from actual BioWatch filters retrieved  from operational environments. However, researchers told us they were  unaware of which operational environments the filter washes had come  from, and there was no sub-analysis by type of environment (e.g., outdoor  versus indoor versus subway), which raises the possibility that pollutants  from certain environments may not have been represented in the test or  that pollutants from certain environments may have been diluted with filter  wash from other environments. The pooled filter wash was used to test  the Gen-3 analytical process in order to look for possible inhibition (e.g.,  interference) of the PCR assays. Officials said that during the Gen-3  testing, the pooled filter wash used to test the analytical process never  showed interference in acquiring a result to an extent that would have  required additional testing steps.", "However, in the final Phase I test, DHS fielded detectors in Chicago to  demonstrate the performance of the candidate technology\u2019s full system in  a representative environment. Results of the testing showed that the  candidate system\u2019s performance was inconsistent in different operational  environments. Specifically, detectors located on underground subway  platforms had higher incidences of malfunction than detectors in other  locations. These malfunctions may be associated with the presence of  metallic brake dust, which demonstrates that different operational  environments pose different challenges. Additional rigor in the testing  design could have identified limitations earlier and perhaps mitigated  them prior to the field testing in Chicago. In fact, the final report by the  National Assessment Group on the operational assessment of the Gen-3  Phase I testing concluded that in retrospect, and based on the outcome of  testing in the Chicago field test, levels of some possible environmental  inhibitors, such as metallic brake dust, represented in the Dugway testing  were significantly diluted or did not represent a concentration that  compared with concentrations in some of the more problematic operating  environments. Therefore, a more robust systems engineering approach to  testing contaminants may have helped identify challenges like this earlier.  The BioWatch program office agreed that the limited environmental  contaminant testing was insufficient to draw any conclusions about  system performance on this issue. According to program office officials,  the program planned to implement robust interferent tests during Phase II  to characterize performance against all of the operational requirements  and said Phase I was only meant to characterize the state of the market  for autonomous detection systems. However, the TEMP for Gen-3 states  that the goal of Phase I testing was to evaluate the ability of the candidate  systems to meet performance requirements specified in an operational  requirements document (ORD). The ORD for Gen-3 specifically outlines  the indoor and outdoor environmental conditions under which the system  is expected to operate, including, but not limited to, exposure to dust,  metallic dust, diesel exhaust, pollen, rain, snow, ice, wind, salt spray, as  well as ranges in temperature, humidity, and altitude. DHS\u2019s plan to defer  more robust testing of conditions representative of Gen-3\u2019s intended  operational environment does not align with best practices, as  performance problems uncovered in later stages of testing can be more  costly and require additional testing.", "While a basic approach to account for environmental contaminants was  included in the systems engineering approach, the program office  recognized that the results of the field testing highlighted additional  limitations to the test approach for environmental contaminants.

However, the statistical experimental design constructed by DHS was not  sufficient to estimate system performance in a realistic environment and  did not link KPPs in the ORD to overall program objectives via creation  and use of an appropriate model of system performance. In the analytical  subsystem test, conducted at Dugway, the candidate Gen-3 system was  challenged with aerosols of different concentrations in order to estimate  its probability of detection for four of five BioWatch threat agents.  Concentrations were systematically varied and were selected using a  statistical method that was designed to yield reliable estimates of the  system\u2019s probability of detection as efficiently as possible (i.e., reducing  the experimental effort required to obtain sufficiently reliable information).  Statistical uncertainties were calculated for the resulting estimates, and  statistical modeling was used to characterize the relationship between  aerosol concentration and the system\u2019s probability of correctly detecting  the presence of each biothreat agent. Statistical experimental designs  were also used in the tests of the aerosol collection component,  conducted at Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, and the PCR  assays, conducted at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

This could be  achieved, for example, by linking KPPs in the ORD to overall program  objectives and user needs via creation and use of an appropriate model  of system performance, but this was not done prior to the Gen-3 testing.  Operational requirements, from which the KPPs were derived, were not  clearly linked to an overall mission need or program goal. The absence of  these linkages among mission need, requirements, and parameters for  measuring system performance means results from the Gen-3 testing  cannot speak to whether the system would address an established  mission need or users\u2019 needs. According to program officials, the  operational requirements outlined in the ORD were directly linked to the  approved Mission Needs Statement for Gen-3. However, in 2012, we  reported that officials were aware that the Mission Needs Statement did  not reflect a systematic effort to justify a capability need and we reported  that the program wrote the Mission Needs Statement later to justify a  predetermined solution of acquiring an autonomous detection capability.", "Additionally, these tests did not cover all of the system requirements  specified by the ORD. For example, one of the system requirements was  a maximum false positive rate. DHS noted in the TEMP that the  probability of false positives would be estimated from test results using  statistical techniques; however, the TEMP did not explain how this would  be done. In testing, DHS did not address this. Instead DHS tested 20  times (per agent) in the assay tests and 15 times (per agent) in the  Dugway tests, and drew conclusions despite not having designed  experiments that would produce estimates of the system\u2019s false positive  rate with defined levels of statistical precision.", "By using statistical experimental designs in the testing of the Gen-3  technologies, DHS was able to characterize some uncertainty in the test  results.

As DHS considers upgrades to the Gen-2 system or future  technology switches for the BioWatch program, DHS could apply lessons  learned from the Gen-3 testing to help develop meaningful requirements  that are linked to a mission need and where operational objectives (e.g.,  lives saved) are linked to measurable KPPs, such as system sensitivity.

System sensitivity was  characterized using an adaptive methodology to determine, for a range of  concentrations of agents, the probability of detection at each  concentration. These probabilities were associated with confidence  intervals to allow assessment of the range of performance one may  expect. Both live and killed agents were used to assess detection  sensitivity so that results from component testing could be extrapolated to  whole system performance, because currently no facilities exist to  perform whole-system live agent testing. Additionally, DHS evaluated  suitability requirements by testing variables such as human factors;  reliability, availability, maintainability (RAM); supportability; and  survivability in an operational environment.", "DHS Could Apply Lessons Learned  Whereas the TEMP and other test plans list the five KPPs for the Gen-3  BioWatch candidate systems, there is no specific link between these  metrics and the mission objectives for the Gen-3 system.

By testing  in a variety of modes intended to replicate an operating environment,  results of the tests can be used to characterize and evaluate relevant  system performance. However, the tests that were intended to account  for factors seen in operational environments were of limited range and  scope. For example, the test plan for the Chicago field test suggested  that the system would be exposed to dust, metallic dust, smoke, diesel  exhaust, and pollen, under extended temperature, altitude, and relative  humidity ranges. However, there was no design of statistical tests  intended to address these variations in Phase I. The analytical sub- system testing did not allow for sub-analysis of pollutants from different  environments (e.g., outdoor, indoor, subway), and so it was not possible  to identify effects of any specific pollutant, such as subway brake dust.  Additionally, the Edgewood test of the aerosol collection component  included tests at different temperatures and humidities; however,  relatively few combinations of temperature and humidity were tested, a  fact that limited the range of environmental conditions represented and  limited the utility of their results in determining how the system would  perform under various operational environments.", "Because DHS performed only limited testing in this regard, it was not able  to draw conclusions early in the testing process to determine whether the  systems would meet performance requirements.

According to OHA officials, the Phase I  acquisition and test and evaluation (T&E) strategies were specifically  designed to address the concern of identifying potential vulnerabilities in  the systems under test. As part of this strategy, for example, Edgewood  tested the collection efficiency of the filters under varying temperature and  humidity conditions. The system was also tested in an operational  environment in Chicago to assess the effects of environmental  interferents, among other things, to help identify vulnerabilities in  operating the system. Further, DHS recognized that developing  autonomous detection had proved challenging because in addition to  some of the technology required being novel, even the existing  technologies\u2014for example, the aerosol collection unit and the apparatus  that reads the PCR results\u2014had not been combined for the specific  application of autonomous detection in an operational environment  before. By executing assay evaluation and subsystem- and system-level  characterization tests incrementally, this allowed for the insertion of  decision points to reduce technical and financial risk. As a result of its  multi-stage approach to testing the systems, DHS identified limitations to  one vendor\u2019s detection system that could not be overcome before  proceeding with the next stages of Phase I testing, so that vendor did not  complete the entire Phase I testing plan. DHS also included provisions in  the Phase I contracts for engineering change proposals to allow the  vendors, at DHS discretion, to address deficiencies found during testing  to inform DHS decisions on proceeding to Phase II.", "DHS Could Apply Lessons Learned  While DHS took some steps to build resilience into the Phase I testing,  additional rigor could have been built into the testing design to reveal  potential vulnerabilities in the performance of the systems tested. DHS\u2019s  final test in Phase I, designed to test resilience, involved fielding the  detectors in Chicago to demonstrate the performance of the candidate  technology\u2019s full system in a representative environment. DHS was able  to identify some limitations\u2014such as environmental contaminants\u2014to the  detection systems being evaluated. However, this occurred late in Phase  I testing, and represented only a limited cross-section of possible  challenges, including temperature, humidity, and vibrations. For example,  while the test plan for the Chicago test lists a range of temperatures and  humidities the system is expected to operate under, the field testing did  not reflect the entire operational range.", "Additionally, other tests on temperature and humidity conditions were  performed in limited combinations, such as high temperature and low  humidity, but not others, such as high temperature and high humidity.  Further, these temperature and humidity tests were done only on the  aerosol collection unit, and not the entire Gen-3 system. Because the  Gen-3 system as a whole was expected to operate continuously under  such conditions, just as Gen-2 currently operates, simply testing one  component, the aerosol collection unit, under a limited combination of  temperatures and humidities does not adequately test the system for  purposes of building in resilience. Some of these conditions may have  provided earlier indications of vulnerabilities that did not arise until near  the end of Phase I testing. For example, to assess the effect of  interferents, Dugway testing used pooled filter washes provided by DHS.  The environments from which the filters came were not provided to  Dugway and interferents from different filters were combined. In doing so,  the effect of individual interferents was diluted. When the systems were  tested in Chicago near the end of Phase I, DHS found that system  problems occurred, attributed to petrochemicals near highways and to  brake dust in subway stations. If specific interferents, such as subway  brake dust, were tested prior to the Chicago testing at representative  concentrations, they may have revealed issues earlier in Phase I.", "Other conditions, such as network communication performance, were not  tested or were tested in a limited fashion.

According to OHA officials, at the  time OHA began Phase I planning and execution, there was not a robust  analytical capability to determine mission-based requirements for key  technical parameters (such as system sensitivity). Officials said absent  that, a consensus on the technical parameters was made based on the  collective best judgment of OHA BioWatch Program Office and S&T  Chem Bio Defense subject matter experts.

However, as we reported  in 2012, when the technologies were unable to meet the technology push  requirement as determined by some Phase I testing, DHS encountered  delays and uncertainty about how to move forward. In response to these  concerns, the BioWatch Program Office conducted a detailed  requirements analysis through a national lab consortium led by Sandia  National Laboratory. The study assessed the utility of biodetection  systems with varying levels of sensitivity in terms of detection timeliness,  population coverage, and lives saved in a bioterror attack. As we  reported in 2012, the study, which was completed in January 2012,  contained findings that, according to BioWatch Program officials, confirm  that the sensitivity requirement could be relaxed without significantly  affecting the program\u2019s public health mission. As a result, DHS set a  new sensitivity requirement based on the modeling studies.", "DHS Could Apply Lessons Learned  According to experts, developmental testing should be viewed as a tool in  helping to refine performance requirements, and a meaningful  performance requirement is one that is not only achievable but also  strives to maximize the fulfillment of a mission need. As we reported in  2012, according to BioWatch program officials, the original sensitivity  requirement was set based on interest in pushing the limits of potential  technological achievement rather than in response to a desired public  health protection outcome. They said that this led to a requirement that  may have been too stringent, resulting in higher costs and schedule  delays without demonstrated mission imperative.", "Further, having requirements based on operational objectives would allow  the results from Phase I testing to inform the users regarding the  anticipated capabilities of the system and the likelihood that a tested  system would be able to meet mission needs. According to experts,  developmental testing may help to identify the performance envelope of  the system and inform decisions about refined performance requirements.  Failure of the Gen-3 candidate system to meet the initial performance  requirements resulted in delays and uncertainty regarding the Gen-3  acquisition. DHS took steps to refine the sensitivity requirement for Gen- 3, but it was the modeling study, rather than the developmental testing  protocol, that led to the change. However, we found that even the relaxed  sensitivity requirement did not link system performance to a clear  operational objective (e.g., to detect attacks of certain types and sizes),  as discussed earlier in this report. Instead, the relaxed requirement was  based on ideas about the performance characteristics of the current  (Gen-2) system\u2014the idea being that Gen-3 could be less sensitive than  Gen-2 but still achieve comparable public health outcomes because of its  greater speed. According to DHS, the change in sensitivity requirement  was linked to casualty reduction, and the agency does not agree with our  assessment. However, as noted earlier in this report, the performance of  Gen-2 has not been linked to a clear operational objective; therefore,  because the revised sensitivity requirement for Gen-3 was based on Gen- 2, it was not grounded in an operational objective, either. In any future  acquisition, upgrade, or enhancement to Gen-2, having initial  requirements based more closely on mission need and operational  objectives may prevent delays and uncertainty.

However, given the expectation of rapid acquisition and deployment, DHS  missed opportunities to fully engage in a broader testing approach  needed for a novel system approach to biodetection. By not engaging in a  more rigid testing approach, when the autonomous detection systems  tested did not yield favorable outcomes, it raised too much uncertainty  about cost and performance for the program.

DNDO considered these to be  key limitations of radiation detection equipment used by Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) at U.S. ports of entry. Based on our body of work  on ASP testing, one of the primary lessons to be learned is to avoid the  pitfalls in testing that stem from a rush to procure new technologies. We  have previously reported on the negative consequences of pressures  imposed by closely linking testing and development programs with  decisions to procure and deploy new technologies. In the case of ASPs,  as well as the Gen-3 acquisition, the push to replace existing equipment  with the new portal monitors led to a testing program that initially lacked  the necessary rigor. DNDO\u2019s schedule consistently underestimated the  time required to conduct tests, resolve problems uncovered during  testing, and complete key documents, including final test reports. We also  found that testing of the ASPs lacked sufficient rigor to demonstrate  performance of the detectors in an operational environment. For example,  ASP testing did not include a sufficient amount of the type of materials  that would mask or hide dangerous sources that ASPs would likely  encounter at ports of entry, which is fundamental to the performance of  radiation detectors in the field. As noted above, Gen-3 testing of possible  environmental contaminants also lacked sufficient rigor to identify  potential vulnerabilities in the system\u2019s detection capabilities prior to  placing them in the field.

The set of all  genes of an organism is known as its  genome.  Protein signatures: Proteins are long chains  of building blocks called amino acids.  Because there are many types of amino  acids, the way each protein interacts with  different stimuli, such as light, can be unique.  For example, shining one color of light on a  protein can result in its emitting different  colors. The set of colors the protein gives off  can be considered an \u201coptical fingerprint\u201d of  the protein, commonly referred to as a type of  protein signature.  Antibodies: Antibodies are proteins created  by the immune system that attach to specific  chemicals on the surface of disease-causing  organisms, resulting in the organisms\u2019 being  rendered harmless. Antibodies can be  designed to attach to a given target and  modified to be detectable under certain  conditions. Thus it is possible to use  antibodies to see whether a target is present  by soaking a sample with the antibodies,  washing off unattached antibodies, and then  measuring those that remain.", "PCR, which is used to detect nucleic acid signatures, is used to amplify  and detect genetic material, or nucleic acids, of organisms. By  amplifying (i.e., repeatedly duplicating) those sections of genes  associated with certain biological agents, it is possible to distinguish the  agents among various organisms. Because of the amplifying capability of  PCR, small amounts of genetic material are sufficient for detection,  resulting in high sensitivity for this technology. Specificity can be high if  the sections of the genes being amplified are unique to the agent.  However, related organisms, called genetic near-neighbors, may contain  similar gene sections and lead to a PCR detection when the agent itself is  not present. PCR is the method used in the current (Gen-2) BioWatch  system.", "Immunoassays and protein signatures use antibodies or light to identify  organisms. Immunoassays use antibodies that attach to chemicals that  primarily appear on certain biological agents; thus immunoassays can be  tailored for high specificity. Protein signatures analyze how light interacts  with different chemicals (such as proteins) on target agents, using light  \u201csignatures\u201d emitted by specific proteins to be identified. However, neither  of these methods is as specific as PCR. Also, because there is no  amplification, the sensitivity of these methods is not as high as that of  PCR.", "Genomic sequencing provides a genetic sequence for all or part of a  detected organism\u2019s genes. Because each agent contains unique genetic  sequences, this method is very specific and could eventually provide  information regarding antibiotic susceptibility. However, the method is not  considered standalone since it depends on another method, such as  PCR, to work. If used with PCR, then this method is also very sensitive.  Of the four broad technologies examined by the National Academies, this  method is also the least mature because of issues with systems  integration\u2014for example, developing the software to perform the analysis  locally (within the device itself).", "Mass spectrometry breaks apart a sample (for example, by directing a  laser onto the sample) and analyzes the resulting fragments. Different  chemicals yield different types and amounts of fragments, so it is possible  to reconstruct the chemical composition of the original sample. Because  the chemical make-up of agents is unique, it is possible to identify their  presence in the sample.

Most of these potential  benefits were owing to faster detection; however, we determined that the  extent to which faster detection confers benefits depends on specific  assumptions, some of which are uncertain and some of which are outside  of DHS\u2019s control. Additionally, from our review of literature, we identified  potential benefits that included decreasing user errors, such as dropped  collection filters. However, since these benefits depend on the actual  design and implementation of the system, it is difficult to predict the extent  to which they would be realized. The benefits and challenges discussed  in this report apply broadly to autonomous detection; that is, they do not  depend on which of the four broad classes of technology is deployed.", "According to a 2011 National Academies report, an autonomous  detection system could detect agents more quickly than the Gen-2  system because of a shorter sample collection period, elimination of  sample transport, and completion of the detection step within the system  itself (see fig. 3). In particular, the report stated that while the current  Gen-2 BioWatch system could detect agents in 10-36 hours, an  autonomous detection system could detect agents in as little as 4-6  hours. Further, DHS officials and Sandia modeling studies state that  faster detection enabled by automation can provide:  1.  reduction in casualties and/or fatalities because of faster detection  and faster situational assessment;  2.  lowering costs, including clean-up costs by halting the entrance of  transport vehicles, such as trains or airplanes, into contaminated  areas; and  3.  reduction in the total annual cost of the detection system, per  detection cycle.", "DHS officials told us that an autonomous detection system would offer  many of these benefits but did not provide evidence to support them,  saying that their assertion is \u201ccommon sense.\u201d DHS officials also referred  to Sandia\u2019s modeling studies. However, we determined that these  benefits and the conclusions of the Sandia modeling studies depend on  specific assumptions, some of which are uncertain and some of which are  outside of DHS\u2019s control, although DHS officials stated that they believe  the modeling assumptions are reasonable for the intended purpose.  However, a CDC official cautioned against relying on models to determine  program effectiveness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Life-Saving Benefits of Early Detection Are Uncertain and Depend on Factors Outside of DHS\u2019s Control", "paragraphs": ["The number of lives saved from faster detection could not be determined,  because some key factors affecting response time are uncertain. For  example, the time it takes decision makers to determine that a detection  represents a threat to public health and warrants dissemination of medical  countermeasures is variable. The time between a BAR and dissemination  of medical countermeasures may include the time needed to characterize  the incident, determine who was exposed, make decisions regarding  evacuation of contaminated regions and relocation of individuals,  determine where to set up medication \u201cpoints of dispensing\u201d and to  actually mobilize the medication stockpile, and distribute medication to  potentially exposed people and keep track of who received medication.  According to the National Academies report and current DHS guidelines,  steps taken after detection, to instill confidence for requesting medication,  include assessing known threats, conducting additional local lab work,  and initiating a national conference call (see fig. 4). There may be  additional tasks such as culturing of the agents to determine their viability  and antibiotic resistance. If local stakeholders follow the guidelines, there  could be considerable delay prior to mobilization of stockpiled medication.  For example, an official at the National Academies workshop reported  that he takes an additional hour to perform an assessment prior to any  national conference call. According to another National Academies report,  the BioWatch national conference call usually occurs 1-2 hours after a  local call of the BioWatch Advisory Committee. Thus, the time between  an attack and when medication is fully distributed\u2014and the number of  lives potentially saved by minimizing this time\u2014could vary from  jurisdiction to jurisdiction. DHS officials agreed that the jurisdictional  response can vary and conducts exercises and training to help plan for a  response. However, it is not clear what effect such exercises have on  response time variability.", "In addition, faster detection may not be the most effective way to save  lives. For example, a modeling study showed results indicating that an  attack detected in 2 days, but requiring 10 days to distribute medication,  would result in more deaths than an attack detected in 5 days, but  requiring only 2 days to distribute medication. Thus, according to this  model, a jurisdiction that shifts resources from medical distribution  capacity to faster detection may end up with more deaths. Decisions of  resource prioritization are not under BioWatch program control, neither is  the part of the response involving medication or other intervention.  However, the benefits from early detection depend on such resource  prioritization and effective overall responses. DHS officials agree, noting  that biosurveillance is a coordinated, holistic endeavor.", "Sandia ran a response model to estimate, among other things, the  number of casualties and fatalities given the time that passes between  the attack and detection (time to detection). Sandia\u2019s modeling studies  showed that a faster detection system would reduce the number of  casualties and fatalities, but that the extent of these reductions would  depend on assumptions in the model. One such assumption was the  probability that BioWatch correctly detected the attack. As discussed  earlier in this report, the probability that BioWatch correctly detects an  attack depends on many factors, including the performance  characteristics of the technology and the characteristics of the attack  itself. Many of Sandia\u2019s estimates of the life-saving benefits of a detection  system\u2014automated or not\u2014are downstream analyses presuming that an  attack was detected. If the attack was not detected, the faster response  enabled by a detection system would not occur, and there would be no  life-saving benefits from operating such a detection system. Therefore, if  those results are read out of context of this presumption, the expected  reductions in casualties and fatalities may be overestimated. This  limitation applies to autonomous detection as well as the Gen-2 system.", "Estimated reductions in casualties and fatalities from faster detection also  depend on assumptions about the infectivity of the BioWatch threat  agents. In the Sandia modeling studies, infectivity was represented by  infectious dose estimates\u2014that is, estimates of the doses that would lead  to illness; however, we found uncertainty in these estimates. As described  in our earlier discussion of the current (Gen-2) system, Sandia  researchers and other experts told us there is considerable uncertainty in  even the best available infectious dose estimates for anthrax, as these  estimates are based on data from nonhuman primates.", "Finally, the life-saving benefits of faster detection that Sandia reported  varied significantly, depending on the properties of the illness that the  agent caused. These properties included how long it takes for symptoms  to exhibit in a patient after exposure and how effectively medication can  prevent death in ill people. According to Sandia, some agents act very  slowly\u2014that is, they have long incubation periods\u2014which diminishes the  effect of faster detection. For example, an agent that takes over 7 days to  cause symptoms will be detected by a 36-hour and a 4-hour detection  system with similar outcomes. Another factor is how effectively a  developed illness can be treated. According to Sandia, this factor is also  variable, so that for some agents, the numbers of lives saved in shifting  from 36-hour to 4-hour detection change little. Thus, reducing fatalities by  faster detection depends largely on the agent used in an attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Lowering of Cleanup Costs Is Uncertain because of Traffic Variability", "paragraphs": ["Sandia reported that faster detection improves the ability to divert  transport vehicles\u2014such as trains and airplanes\u2014 from contaminated  areas so that they do not have to be subsequently cleaned up.

For example, according to Sandia, the number  of subway cars entering New York City\u2019s Grand Central Terminal over a  period of 5 hours can range from as few as 250 to as many as 1,750,  depending on the time of day and the day of the year. Clean-up effort  reduction is thus uncertain because of an attack\u2019s unpredictability. A  similar analysis can be made for people entering a contaminated area\u2014 while early detection could lead to exposure prevention and mitigating the  need for additional medication, the actual number of people affected is  similarly variable.", "We recognize that much of the uncertainty described regarding lives  saved or reduction in clean-up costs is out of the control of the BioWatch  program. However, when describing benefits of faster detection,  particularly concerning the number of lives possibly saved by an  autonomous system or any early-warning system, it is important to  understand the uncertainties in these assumptions, such as response  time or infectious dose of the agent.

We reported in 2012 that  cost per detection cycle was lower with an autonomous detection system,  but that overall annual program costs would increase from the current  Gen-2 system program costs. From figures DHS provided in 2015  regarding the cost of switching to an autonomous detection system with  coverage comparable to that of the current Gen-2 system, our analysis  yielded results similar to our 2012 findings.", "To determine potential cost savings between the Gen-2 system and an  autonomous system, DHS compared an autonomous system with a  modified Gen-2 BioWatch system. Gen-2 generally runs one detection  cycle daily, but for DHS\u2019s analysis the agency compared an autonomous  system with a modified Gen-2 system which would run three daily  detection cycles. We determined that total annual program costs would  increase if current operations for Gen-2, which involve one detection  cycle per day, were replaced with an automated detection system. Only  by comparing the total annual program costs of operating Gen-2 with  three detection cycles per day with the total program costs of operating  an automated system were cost savings realized (see table 4). As we  reported in 2012, conducting a more complete analysis of costs and  benefits would help DHS develop the kind of information that would  inform trade-off decisions regarding changes to BioWatch technology.", "Automation may lead to additional potential benefits including fewer user  errors and greater efficiency\u2014for example, using fewer resources to  accomplish the same amount of work\u2014and greater worker safety by  facilitating the handling of dangerous materials, according to literature on  automation. However, because automated detection systems have not  been deployed, assessing these benefits is difficult. Additionally,  uncertainty about how the technology will work means that its benefits  might be countered by new problems. For example, according to a 2007  DHS Inspector General report, transferring BioWatch system filters was  done improperly several times in 2004. By eliminating the need for  transporting filters, automation could avoid this problem, but new  problems could arise, such as system crashes. For example, repeated  system crashes occurred when the BioWatch Program Office conducted  a trial deployment of an autonomous detection system, in New York in  2008.

From a National Academies workshop and  interviews with agency officials, we identified five likely challenges (shown  in fig. 5).", "According to DHS, ensuring that the autonomous detection system meets  BioWatch sensitivity requirements represents a major technical hurdle. As  discussed earlier, the original sensitivity requirement for the Gen-3  system was based on a technology push because DHS lacked the  analytical tools needed to generate a mission-based sensitivity  requirement. DHS later revised the sensitivity requirement based on a  Sandia-led modeling study. As we described earlier, the Sandia model is  subject to limitations and assumptions, and how the sensitivity  requirement may be linked to mission outcomes, such as detecting  attacks that lead to 10,000 casualties, remains uncertain. Additionally,  challenges may be associated with designing a technology to meet a  given sensitivity requirement.", "One way to manage sensitivity requirements is to assess whether the  technology in a detection system conforms to performance standards.  The standards may be subject to validation by independent groups or  agencies, and constitute guidelines for the technology. For example, the  number of times a test should be run and the verification of reagents are  standardized so that results can be interpreted meaningfully. With the  development of newer technologies for detection, a method known as  multiplexing is being increasingly used. However, validating the use of  multiplexing in detection systems has no performance standards. DHS  commissioned the National Academies to examine performance  standards for PCR, including multiplexed PCR. However, the report  recently released by the National Academies does not provide clear  standards for multiplexing, instead noting that combining Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) multiplexing guidance with certain standards, such  as SPADA, which discuss multiplexing, should form a starting point for  validation testing. The report also notes that changing to multiplexing  (from singleplexing) reduces the sensitivity of the assay, although the  effect of this reduction is unclear.

Similarly, according to a  Sandia workshop in 2009, public health officials largely felt that wrongly  taken high-consequence actions would result in loss of credibility.

Since that time,  DHS has commissioned tests of the system, but has not defined technical  performance requirements that would link test results to conclusions  about the types and sizes of attack that the Gen-2 system could reliably  detect. DHS has also commissioned modeling and simulation studies, but  none of these studies was designed to directly and comprehensively  assess what is known about the capabilities of the currently deployed  system, using specific test results and accounting for statistical and other  uncertainties. Finally, while DHS has addressed certain limitations in  testing, it has not systematically tested the system against realistic  conditions, and there remains potential to reduce risk and uncertainty in  what is known about the system\u2019s capabilities when deployed in a real- world environment. As a result of these gaps and limitations, considerable  uncertainty remains as to the types and sizes of attack that the Gen-2  system could reliably detect. DHS officials have stated that the system\u2019s  operational objective is to detect attacks large enough to cause 10,000  casualties, but DHS cannot conclude with any defined level of statistical  certainty that the system can reliably achieve this objective. In the wake  of the cancellation of the Gen-3 acquisition, DHS is planning for  technology upgrades or improvements to the Gen-2 system, and some  Gen-2 equipment is nearing the end of its life-cycle and will need to be  replaced if the program is to continue. However, effective and cost- efficient decisions cannot be made regarding upgrades and  reinvestments if the operational capabilities of the Gen-2 system are  uncertain. Assessing the operational capabilities of the Gen-2 system  against technical performance requirements directly linked to an  operational objective, incorporating specific test results, and explicitly  accounting for statistical and other uncertainties would help ensure that  decisions about future investments are actually addressing a capability  gap not met by the current system and address a clear mission need.", "In recent years, DHS has canceled major acquisitions that we previously  found could have been more rigorous in their test design or execution,  including Gen-3. The nation\u2019s ability to detect threats against its security  requires judicious use of resources directed toward systems whose  capabilities can be demonstrated. Applying lessons learned from the  Phase I testing of Gen-3 candidate technologies, as well as incorporating  the best practices we identified, may help enable DHS to mitigate risk in  future acquisitions for these types of threat detection technologies.  Specifically, DHS could apply them to the BioWatch program once  informed decisions have been made regarding upgrades or  enhancements to Gen-2.", "Furthermore, DHS officials have continued to express interest in an  autonomous detection capability as a possible upgrade or enhancement  to Gen-2. If DHS were to pursue an autonomous detection system in the  near future, PCR would be the most mature technology available.  However, the extent to which the potential benefits of such a system  would materialize is uncertain, because of uncertainty in the assumptions  upon which these benefits depend. Additionally, pursuit of such a system  faces several likely challenges. Understanding the inherent challenges to  faster detection and contextualizing the benefits of autonomous detection  technologies will help decision makers make informed decisions  regarding use of limited resources. BioWatch is just one biosurveillance  activity used to detect potential biological threats to our national security,  and as we have previously reported, because the nation does not have  unlimited resources to protect the nation from every conceivable threat, it  must make risk-informed decisions regarding its homeland security  approaches and strategies. In July 2012, the White House released the  National Strategy for Biosurveillance to describe the U.S. government\u2019s  approach to strengthening biosurveillance, but it is too soon to tell what  effect the strategy and corresponding implementation plan may have on  determining resource allocation priorities across the interagency. As  some Gen-2 equipment reaches the end of its lifecycle, DHS will need to  make decisions about investing in the future of the BioWatch program.  DHS initiated the BioWatch program in 2003 to address the perceived  threat at the time. Since then, numerous Bioterrorism Risk Assessments  have been issued, but these have been criticized for the methodology,  and none has been issued in the last 5 years. Consequently, as the  National Academies has noted, there is considerable uncertainty about  the likelihood and magnitude of a biological attack.

DHS also stated the BioWatch program will consider including additional  measures of system performance, such as probability of detection, to  augment and validate the system\u2019s ability to detect attacks, pending  available resources and at a time yet to be determined.", "However, using existing test results as a baseline for future technological  improvements provides no information about the current\u2014or any future\u2014 system\u2019s ability to meet a clearly defined operational objective. DHS  should first establish requirements for the current system, which will  enable DHS to assess its system performance measures, such as  sensitivity, against its stated mission goal: to detect attacks causing  10,000 casualties. Without establishing such performance requirements,  the agency does not know what the existing test results mean for the  system\u2019s ability to detect attacks, and thus cannot establish the benefits  of any future improvements. Further, DHS mentioned using additional  system performance measures to augment and validate the system\u2019s  capability.

These officials  told us that they have not commissioned or produced an analysis in which  the best available test results have been combined with modeling and  simulation to reach specific conclusions about the system\u2019s ability to  detect attacks of defined types and sizes. As we detailed in the report,  modeling and simulation studies commissioned by DHS either considered  ranges of hypothetical values for the system\u2019s sensitivity or else involved  old test results, based on an earlier version of the system, for just one of  the BioWatch threat agents. Furthermore, we identified important  limitations in the tests DHS has conducted that could be addressed  through a more systematic approach to reducing risk and uncertainty in  what is known about the system\u2019s capabilities when deployed in a real- world environment. While it is true that the system cannot be tested  directly by releasing live biothreat agents in the environments where  BioWatch is deployed, both the National Research Council and subject  matter experts with whom we spoke identified methods by which the  system can be tested and its performance characteristics estimated in  more realistic environments.", "DHS concurred with our recommendation to produce a full accounting of  statistical and other uncertainties and limitations in what is known about  the system\u2019s capability to meet its operational objectives.

However, DHS also agreed that there is value in consolidating this  information into a single, comprehensive document and plans to do so by  April 30, 2016.", "As described in the report, DHS does not have a sufficiently  comprehensive accounting of the uncertainties and limitations in what is  known about the system\u2019s capabilities. A comprehensive analysis of  uncertainties and limitations should account for how such uncertainties  and limitations affect the key outcome: the system\u2019s ability to meet its  operational objective by detecting attacks of defined types and sizes.  Statistical uncertainties should be represented with clearly defined  confidence intervals; for uncertainties that are difficult to quantify, such as  uncertainties associated with testing in chambers rather than operational  environments, the judgments of subject matter experts may be useful.  This full accounting of uncertainties and limitations should be provided to  administration and congressional decision makers so they better  understand the precision in what is known about the system\u2019s capabilities  in an operational context. Decision makers should be able to use this  information not only when comparing the costs of the current system to  the benefits it may provide, but also when weighing decisions about  proposed upgrades or enhancements to the system.", "DHS concurred with our recommendation to use the best practices we  outline in the report to inform test and evaluation actions for any future  upgrades or changes to technology for BioWatch. DHS stated that  changes to BioWatch will adhere to new DHS acquisition guidance that  incorporates the best practices outlined in our report.", "DHS\u2019s reference to new acquisition guidance is to DHS-wide guidance  that was issued in 2010, after DHS began testing the Gen-3 technology.  This guidance includes additional detail on factors to consider when  planning and testing new acquisitions and addresses many of the  practices described within this report. However, when it comes to  ensuring the acquisition will not only meet technical requirements but also  perform as intended in an operational environment, we believe more  robust testing earlier in the acquisition to test resilience can help reduce  the risk of acquiring immature technologies. This is especially important  for a system like BioWatch, which cannot be fully tested in an operational  environment. While we see proper implementation of DHS\u2019s updated  acquisition guidance as a positive step towards addressing our  recommendation, as we reported in April 2015, DHS\u2019s Director of  Operational Test and Evaluation expressed interest in becoming more  involved in testing earlier in the development process. Therefore, we  believe the lessons learned on Gen-3 testing and full adoption of testing  practices aimed at establishing the operational performance of a system  earlier in the acquisition should also be considered to help inform future  DHS decisions.", "While DHS concurred with the three parts of our first recommendation,  the agency did not agree with key findings that led to these  recommendations; therefore, it is important to address parts of their  response for clarification.", "DHS took exception to our conclusion that it has not defined technical  performance requirements that would link test results to conclusions  about the types and sizes of attack that the Gen-2 system could reliably  detect. DHS stated it uses the metric called fraction of population covered  (Fp) to make this linkage. However, when asked about this directly,  agency officials declined to explain how specific values of Fp would  enable DHS to conclude what types and sizes of attack the system can  detect. Furthermore, officials said they have not commissioned or  produced an analysis in which the best available test results are used to  calculate Fp values and draw conclusions about the system\u2019s ability to  detect attacks of defined types and sizes. How a given value of Fp would  provide information about the types and sizes of attacks BioWatch Gen-2  can detect remains uncertain, and how Fp relates to the probability of  detecting attacks large enough to cause 10,000 casualties\u2014DHS\u2019s stated  objective for the BioWatch program\u2014remains unclear. As we note in this  report, we recognize that Fp is a useful metric for certain purposes, but it  does not directly support conclusions that align with the BioWatch  operational objective.", "DHS stated that it disagreed with the conclusion that the BioWatch  Program does not incorporate empirical data gathered on the current  Gen-2 system to inform modeling and simulation studies. However, DHS  incorrectly attributed this conclusion to us. We did not state that DHS did  not use any empirical data to inform their modeling and simulation  studies. We stated that (1) the modeling and simulation studies did not  incorporate specific, best available test results (for example, particular  estimates of the system\u2019s limits of detection) to draw specific conclusions  about the BioWatch Gen-2 system\u2019s capability to detect attacks of defined  types and sizes, and (2) the modeling and simulation studies did not  incorporate uncertainties in the empirical test results that are important for  understanding the precision or confidence in the modeling and simulation  results.", "Finally, DHS acknowledged the evolving threat of bioterrorism and its  continued commitment to following DHS-wide acquisition policy for any  future upgrade or enhancement to the current BioWatch system.  Analogous to what we reported in 2012 regarding the Gen-3 acquisition,  by ensuring any future upgrades or enhancements to the BioWatch  system align with the earliest steps in DHS\u2019s acquisition process, such as  being grounded in a justified mission need, and reflect a systematic  analysis of costs, benefits, and risks, DHS can gain assurance that it is  pursuing an optimal solution. Because, as DHS stated, the threat of  bioterrorism continues to evolve, and because the last full Bioterrorism  Risk Assessment (BTRA) was issued in 2010, it will be important for DHS  to demonstrate that any proposed upgrades or enhancement address the  threat posed by the intentional release of select aerosolized biological  agents at the time upgrades are considered.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We  also reviewed reports of modeling and simulation studies, conducted by  Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories for DHS, that analyzed  the performance and capabilities of the system. We interviewed DHS  officials from the BioWatch Program Office and from the Science and  Technology Directorate (S&T) who had knowledge of the history of the  program, the Gen-2 technology and changes that had been made to the  technology over time, and the tests and studies that had been conducted  on the Gen-2 system\u2019s technical capabilities. We also interviewed officials  and researchers who conducted or were familiar with the tests and the  modeling and simulation studies; these included officials and researchers  at Dugway Proving Ground, Sandia National Laboratories, Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory, and Los Alamos National Laboratory. In  interviews with researchers who had conducted tests and studies, we  questioned them about the scope and purposes of their work; the  methods they had used; conclusions drawn, as well as any caveats on  those conclusions; and the strengths and limitations of the tests and  studies. We conducted a site visit to Dugway Proving Ground and saw  facilities and equipment that had been used to test the Gen-2 system, as  well as facilities under construction that could potentially be used for  future testing of the BioWatch system. To assess the strengths and  limitations of tests and studies of the Gen-2 system, we used (1) a  framework for testing and evaluation of biodetection systems developed  by the National Research Council, (2) leading practices in risk analysis  and cost-benefit analysis, and (3) judgment of internal (GAO) and  selected external experts in the fields of engineering, aerobiology,  microbiology, and testing and evaluation of biodetection systems. To  gather information on the field of biodetection and the strengths and  limitations of alternative technologies, we attended two conferences on  biodetection technologies.", "To determine whether DHS\u2019s actions during Gen-3 Phase I adhered to  best practices for developmental testing and to identify lessons that could  be learned, we reviewed the best practices previously developed in  conjunction with the National Academes to assess their appropriateness  to our review. We consulted with GAO specialists familiar with the best  practices for developmental testing to discuss their proper application. We  determined the practices that could be applied to Gen-3 Phase I testing,  as the testing was developmental in nature and presented opportunities  for DHS to de-risk the Gen-3 acquisition, which is the intent of the  practices\u2014to de-risk acquisitions of binary threat detection technologies  by the government. We analyzed Gen-3 Phase I acquisition and testing  documents, such as the test and evaluation master plans, individual test  plans and results, and the operational requirements documents. We  analyzed other DHS documentation on lessons learned, including the  Post Implementation Review assessment, in which DHS identified its own  lessons learned on the Gen-3 acquisition. We reviewed the acquisition  decision memorandum on the cancellation of the Gen-3 acquisition.", "We interviewed DHS officials in the BioWatch Program Office, the Office  of the Director of Test and Evaluation at the Science and Technology  Directorate, and officials at the national laboratories and Department of  Defense (DOD) test agencies who were familiar with the testing  performed during Gen-3 Phase I. We collected information from these  officials on DHS\u2019s actions and decisions during Phase I testing and  compared that with the recommended actions outlined in the best  practices for developmental testing. We also compared the steps outlined  in the test planning documents with the recommended steps described in  the best practices. We consulted with internal and external experts on our  assessment of DHS\u2019s actions and decisions compared with the best  practices and acquisitions more broadly. We reviewed prior GAO reports  on the Gen-3 acquisition and the biosurveillance enterprise. We also  reviewed prior GAO work on other DHS acquisitions that met challenges  during early phases of testing to draw comparisons with other DHS  acquisitions that may have benefited from more robust testing guidance.", "To develop the best practices for developmental testing of binary threat  detection systems, we conducted a 1-day meeting on June 4, 2013, with  12 experts we selected with assistance from the National Academies.  These experts were from academia, industry, and the federal government  and had experience in developmental testing methodologies, binary  threat detection systems, automatic target recognition, and advanced  imaging technologies, from fields that included homeland security,  defense, and standards development. To identify the experts, the  National Academies considered experts with previous experience on  appropriate National Academy studies, requested suggestions from the  members of the National Academies\u2019 National Materials and  Manufacturing Board and the Computer Sciences and  Telecommunications Board, searched internal databases and the Web,  and contacted other relevant individuals for recommendations. We  facilitated the experts\u2019 identification of best practices with pre-meeting  interviews, structured questioning during the meeting, and post-meeting  expert voting and ranking procedures. According to the experts, the best  practices apply to the process of developmental testing of binary threat  detection systems; they also apply if the system is commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS), modified COTS, or newly developed for a specific threat  detection purpose being created by a vendor or the government.", "To identify the most mature technology for autonomous detection, we  reviewed a report of a 2013 workshop conducted by the National  Academies that assessed the state of technologies that are potentially  suitable for autonomous detection for the BioWatch program. We also  interviewed officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Health Affairs, Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory, and the Department of Defense who were  familiar with BioWatch and biodetection technologies to gather their views  on the state of autonomous detection technology. A conclusion of the  National Academies workshop held in 2013 was that the polymerase  chain reaction (PCR) was the most mature technology suitable for  autonomous detection for BioWatch. As a check for any more recent  developments that might affect this conclusion, we performed a literature  review of journals and conference proceedings published since 2012 to  identify any technologies potentially more mature than PCR based on the  following criteria:  1. whether the detection technology is specified, meaning the technology is defined and not just referred to as biodetection or detection technology; 2. capacity to detect at least bacteria and virus; 6. having both indoor and outdoor performance capabilities in realistic 7. ability to detect independently (standalone); 8. technology readiness level (TRL) of 6 or higher, if reported; 9. sampled from aerosols/air; 10. whether the technology is used for disease surveillance or modeling instead of pathogen detection; and 11. whether the technology depends on, or is a variant of, PCR.", "We excluded press releases and news articles, studies that did not  include sufficient detail for evaluating technological detection capability,  technologies that were intended for non-aerosol detection (such as for  food or clinical specimen testing), or technologies that were intended to  be used alongside other technologies for detection (for example, used to  supplement or verify a finding, or used as a trigger warning system). Our  literature review was not intended to be a comprehensive examination of  all technologies that might possibly be applied to BioWatch, but rather a  supplement to the National Academies workshop report and a check to  help ensure that the conclusions of that workshop were not affected by  more recent developments in the field.", "To assess the potential benefits and likely challenges of autonomous  detection, we analyzed reports published by the Sandia National  Laboratories, as well as our prior work on the Gen-3 BioWatch system.  We performed a literature review for models of how response timing to a  positive detection of agent release may affect response effectiveness, in  terms of lives saved. We searched for models published in the last 12  years, a range that was designed to cover work done following the  anthrax attacks of 2001. We interviewed officials at the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  Office of Health Affairs, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to  gather their views on the potential benefits and likely challenges of  autonomous detection in the near future, which we defined as the next 5  years. Additionally, we reviewed Gen-3 BioWatch testing reports to  identify likely challenges to autonomous detection systems.", "To determine the potential cost saving benefits of an autonomous  detection system, we analyzed cost data provided by DHS. The agency  provided annual operation and maintenance costs and total annual  program costs for the current BioWatch system under the assumption that  detection cycles would be increased to three per day (up from once per  day, which is the current practice in most jurisdictions), as well as total  annual costs for running a hypothetical autonomous detection system  with six to eight detection cycles per day, with comparable coverage. The  total annual cost for operating the current BioWatch system was  calculated by dividing the annual operation and maintenance costs by  three but keeping the remaining costs constant under the assumption that  non-operation and maintenance costs remain the same.", "Our analysis of potential benefits and likely challenges represent key  ones that were identified by the sources listed above, and is not intended  to be comprehensive. In particular we did not assess or mention  characteristics that were difficult or impossible to meaningfully discuss  within the context of this report (for example, deterrent effects of a  biodetection system, or finding qualified personnel to hire).

From the program\u2019s inception in  2003 through 2014, there were 149 BARs. None was found to be  associated with the release of a biothreat agent, and these BARs have  been termed false positives by Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) officials and others.", "We found that all of the BARs from 2003 through 2014 were associated  with PCR assays for two biothreat agents: Brucella and Francisella  tularensis. The majority were associated with the assays for Francisella  tularensis, and these have been attributed to detections of a non-disease- causing relative, or near-neighbor, of the Francisella tularensis bacterium  that occurs naturally in the environment. Expert stakeholders told us that,  before BioWatch, scientists had no reason or occasion to assess the  presence or prevalence of these naturally occurring, non-disease-causing  near-neighbors.", "Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials and other stakeholders  said several adjustments were made to the Gen-2 system in 2011 and  2012 to reduce the number of false positives. In August of 2011, a stricter  criterion for deciding that PCR assays revealed the presence of biothreat  agents was adopted. Between November of 2011 and December of  2012, BioWatch adopted new PCR assays for the screening step of  analysis. Previously, assays developed by CDC for use in its Laboratory  Response Network (LRN) had been used for both screening and  verification. The new assays were from the Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) Critical Reagents Program (CRP) and were designed to look for  different genetic signatures of the BioWatch threat agents. In general,  assays designed to detect greater numbers of unique genetic signatures  will provide greater specificity\u2014that is, greater ability to distinguish  between the agents of interest and other, genetically similar agents. In  December of 2012, BioWatch adopted new PCR assays specifically  intended to distinguish between disease-causing and non-disease- causing species of Francisella; under the new analysis protocol, these  new assays are run in the verification step if the screening step returned a  positive result for Francisella.", "Another adjustment to the system was not made in order to reduce the  number of false positives but likely had this effect. In March, 2008, the  PCR assays for Brucella were discontinued. According to BioWatch  officials, this was because CDC had reclassified Brucella into a lower- threat category. Some of the BARs prior to March of 2008 were  associated with the PCR assays for Brucella, and such BARs were no  longer possible after this agent was discontinued as a BioWatch threat  agent.", "The annual number of BARs decreased during the years when the  adjustments designed to reduce false positives were made, and after the  final adjustment (the adoption of the new Francisella assays) there were  no BARs through 2014 (see fig. 6). This decrease is consistent with the  possibility that the adjustments have provided greater specificity, as  intended; however, there was large, unexplained variability in the annual  numbers of BARs in earlier years, and we did not conduct an independent  analysis to assess the extent to which the decrease since 2010 might be  associated with the specific adjustments DHS made to the system.", "According to a recent report by the National Academies, there is no once- and-for-all solution to the problem of false positives for a biodetection  system based on PCR assays. This is because biological agents  continue to evolve, and new strains and near-neighbors continue to arise.  Consequently, a biodetection system based on PCR assays, such as  BioWatch, will likely require ongoing adjustments to manage or prevent  false positives, and the National Academies recommended that the  BioWatch program continue to test its assays against panels of near- neighbors as these panels are reviewed and updated over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Best Practices for Developmental Testing", "paragraphs": ["In 2013, in collaboration with the National Academies, we identified eight  best practices for developmental testing of threat detection systems.

The  BioWatch sensors might be exposed to dust, metallic dust, smoke, and  diesel exhaust in indoor environments, as well as to rain, fog, snow, ice,  wind, salt spray, sand, and pollen in outdoor environments. To the extent  possible, these potential contaminants should be part of the testing of a  detection system to help identify vulnerabilities to performance in these  environments.", "According to experts, the further the system moves down the  development path, the more fixed the design becomes. Thus, when the  developmental testing team uncovers an error (i.e., the system failed a  test), it is increasingly expensive to fix. Any time there is a change in the  design, everything that worked before needs to be re-tested to make sure  the change did not undo something that already has been shown to work.
