This policy reduced the locality rate payable for each full day at the location, depending on the duration of the TDY: for TDYs of between 31 and 180 days the flat rate per diem is 75 percent, and for TDYs of greater than 180 days it is 55 percent.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 included a provision that GAO assess the impact of DOD's policy change to the JTR on shipyard and depot workers. This report assesses the extent to which (1) depot officials identified benefits and challenges resulting from the policy change, and any effects on civilian employees and operations; (2) DOD established clear guidance regarding the policy; and (3) DOD followed its processes when considering the policy change and included an assessment of benefits and costs. GAO collected and analyzed responses to a questionnaire disseminated at DOD's 17 depot maintenance industrial sites, reviewed relevant documentation, and interviewed cognizant officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Officials at depots responding to a GAO questionnaire identified various benefits, such as cost-savings, and challenges, such as increased processing time for vouchers, resulting from the Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) flat rate per diem policy change for long-term temporary duty (TDY) travel. While more than half of depot officials reported that the policy has affected civilian employees' willingness to volunteer for long-term TDYs, a majority of depot officials reported that the policy has generally not affected depot operations.", "GAO's review of the JTR and analysis of questionnaire responses found that certain aspects of DOD's flat rate per diem policy are not clear. For example, the requirement to provide lodging receipts for long-term travel was replaced by a requirement to provide proof that lodging costs were incurred, but according to depot officials it is not clear what constitutes proof of lodging. As a result, the majority of the depots still require long-term travelers to submit lodging receipts. Such lack of clarity may hinder DOD's ability to achieve the policy's intended objectives, such as simplifying the administrative aspects of travel.", "DOD did not ensure that certain required processes established in DOD guidance were completed prior to the policy's approval, and its assessment of the policy's costs and benefits was not comprehensive. Specifically, GAO found that prior to the flat rate per diem policy's approval certain required steps, such as providing cost data and budgetary impact statements and a legal sufficiency review, were not completed. This occurred because DOD has not established procedures to ensure that these required steps are completed prior to approving a major change to the JTR. Further, although DOD's Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) estimated total savings of approximately $194 million resulting from the flat rate per diem as of January 2017, GAO found that DOD's cost-savings assessment did not comprehensively consider all potential costs and benefits of the policy change. DOD guidance, which applies to all DOD components, establishes responsibilities for following Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94 guidelines concerning benefit-cost analysis of federal programs. OMB Circular A-94 states that a comprehensive enumeration of the different types of benefits and costs, monetized or not, can be helpful in identifying the full range of program effects when conducting a benefit-cost analysis of a policy. However, DTMO's assessment of the JTR policy change was not comprehensive and did not include the full range of potential costs and benefits. For example, it included some potential costs to implement the policy, but not others, such as the cost to update the travel system with the needed functionality to support the policy. DTMO has recently developed a draft Performance Measurement Plan, which officials described as a first step in a larger effort to track and report savings from the flat rate per diem policy. However, GAO's review of the draft plan found that it also does not include a comprehensive approach to capture costs and benefits of the policy. As a result, DOD may not be well positioned to understand whether the flat rate per diem policy is cost-beneficial and meeting its objectives to reduce travel costs without negatively affecting the traveler and the mission."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DOD should clarify certain aspects of the flat rate per diem policy; establish procedures to ensure required steps are completed before major JTR policy changes are approved; and ensure that OMB benefit-cost analysis guidelines are followed in future policy assessments.

In May 2012 the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) also issued a memorandum that called  on executive agencies to reduce travel costs. The memorandum  specifically required the Department of Defense (DOD) to review the Joint  Travel Regulations (JTR) to ensure, among other things, that DOD\u2019s  policies reduced travel costs, and that DOD employees received per diem  reimbursement-\u2013that is, lodging and meals and incidental expenses  (M&IE)\u2014only to the extent to which costs were incurred. In response to  these government-wide requirements and prior internal efforts to reduce  travel costs, on November 1, 2014, DOD added a flat rate per diem policy  to the JTR for long-term temporary duty (TDY) travel. According to the flat  rate per diem policy, for TDYs of between 31 and 180 days\u2019 duration, the  flat rate per diem is 75 percent of the locality rate (i.e., the per diem rate  for lodging and M&IE expenses) payable for each full day at the location.  For TDYs of greater than 180 days\u2019 duration, the flat rate per diem is 55  percent of the locality rate. In January 2017 Defense Travel Management  Office (DTMO) officials estimated the total savings from the flat rate per  diem policy to be approximately $194 million for travel vouchers approved  between November 2014 and September 2016.", "The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016  included a provision for us to study the effect of policy changes to the JTR  concerning the flat rate per diem for long-term TDY travel. Specifically,  the provision asked us to assess the impact of such changes on shipyard  and depot workers who travel on long-term TDY, and whether the  changes have discouraged civilian employees from volunteering for long- term TDY. In this report, we assess the extent to which (1) depot officials  identified benefits and challenges resulting from the flat rate per diem  policy, and any effects on civilian employees and operations at the  selected depots; (2) DOD established clear guidance regarding the policy;  and (3) DOD followed its processes for considering the flat rate per diem  policy change and included an assessment of benefits and costs prior to  making the change.", "To determine the extent to which depot officials identified benefits and  challenges resulting from the flat rate per diem policy, including any  effects on civilian employees and operations at the selected depots, we  focused on DOD civilian employees at DOD\u2019s 17 depot maintenance  industrial sites. We selected the depot maintenance industrial sites  because in their mix of depots they reflect diversity across the military  services, and because they account for a majority of the department\u2019s  depot-level workload. We sent a questionnaire to the 17 depots to obtain  the commanders\u2019 perspectives as well as documentation on the policy\u2019s  benefits and challenges to civilian employees and operations, and we  received responses from all 17. We conducted quantitative and qualitative  analyses of the responses. At the time of our review the flat rate per  diem policy was in effect at 13 of the 17 depots for bargaining unit  employees and at all depots for non-bargaining unit employees, and  therefore we believed that the depots could provide knowledgeable  perspectives on the benefits and challenges of the policy. However,  subsequent to our dissemination of the questionnaire, Marine Corps  officials indicated that civilian employees at the Production Plant in  Barstow, California, never travel on long-term TDY, and therefore we  excluded their questionnaire responses from our analysis related to  benefits and challenges of the policy. We also conducted discussion  groups with depot workers at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard to obtain the  perspectives of civilian employees affected by the policy.

We  also reviewed Department of Defense Instruction 7041.03, Economic  Analysis for Decision-making, which establishes responsibilities for the  DOD components in following OMB Circular A-94 guidelines for benefit- cost analysis of federal programs. Further, we compared the Per Diem,  Travel and Transportation Allowance Committee\u2019s (hereinafter the  Committee) documents and actions with its Organization and Functions  Manual and relevant guidance included in Committee memorandums.

Depot workers at  Puget Sound Naval Shipyard explained in our discussion groups that  the accommodations willing to accept the flat rate per diem may be  farther from the job site, which increases the employees\u2019 commuting  time.", "Administrative burden: According to the questionnaire responses  we received from depot officials from 4 of the 16 depots, the flat rate  per diem policy is administratively burdensome, in that it has  increased processing and adjustments related to travel. This was also  a challenge explained during a meeting with Puget Sound Naval  Shipyard officials who provided a comparison of voucher-processing  times before and after the flat rate per diem policy change, showing  that the processing time has nearly doubled. According to their  estimates, processing a voucher took up to 10 minutes and  processing an authorization took up to 5 minutes before the policy  change, but after the policy change these tasks have taken twice the  amount of time (20 minutes and 10 minutes, respectively). According  to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard officials, this represents a significant  increase in workload for the four full-time employees who process  travel vouchers.

This  unclear guidance may hinder the policy\u2019s achieving its intended  objectives, such as simplifying travel. In its November 2014 changes to  the JTR regarding the flat rate per diem policy, the Committee removed  the receipt requirement for lodging, but it added language that is not clear  regarding what is required to demonstrate that lodging costs were  incurred. Before the flat rate per diem policy was added, the JTR required  travelers to provide receipts for all lodging costs. According to DTMO  officials, the requirement to provide lodging receipts for long-term travel  was removed to simplify the reimbursement process, which had required  long-term travelers to provide lodging receipts and to divide the charges  evenly throughout the travel period, either on a weekly or monthly basis.  According to these officials, those procedures were burdensome for both  the traveler and the approving official. The Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Military Personnel Policy stated that the removal of the  receipt requirement for long-term TDY was intended to make the process  less stressful for travelers. The lodging receipt guidance in the new flat  rate per diem policy states that lodging receipts are not required, but  proof that lodging costs were incurred shall be required; however, the  policy does not specify what is meant by proof that lodging costs were  incurred. As a result of the unclear guidance, a majority of depots still  require lodging receipts. Based on results from our questionnaire, we  found that 15 out of 16 depots still require long-term travelers to submit  lodging receipts, which is contrary to the intent of the flat rate per diem  policy to simplify the reimbursement process for long-term travelers.  DTMO officials told us that they intentionally did not define \u201cproof of  lodging costs\u201d in the JTR so as not to be too prescriptive. Officials said  that they were concerned that if they were to provide a list, authorizing  officials and travelers would view it as a definitive list.", "Similarly, the M&IE waiver, approved by the Committee Chair in May  2016, does not clearly state when long-term travelers should submit  requests to receive actual expenses. While the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy maintains that the  submission process is clearly explained in the JTR, our review of the JTR  flat rate per diem policy and our contact with depot officials showed that  there was a lack of clarity in the guidance. Specifically, we found that the  flat rate per diem policy does not specify when long-term travelers should  submit requests to receive actual expenses for M&IE\u2014that is, whether  before going on the TDY, or after returning from it. Additionally, we found  that depot officials from across the military services varied as to when the  traveler would receive approval for the M&IE waiver. Army officials said it  would be granted prior to the TDY, while Navy, Marine Corps, and Air  Force officials varied as to when the waiver would be granted. Further, a  senior DTMO official we met with told us that the waiver should be  approved before the traveler leaves for TDY, and that it did not make  sense for the approval to occur after returning from TDY\u2014especially if the  point of the policy is to not harm the traveler. If the waiver were not to be  approved until the traveler returned, the traveler would be unsure during  the trip whether actual expenses for M&IE would be approved.", "According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government related to information and communications, information  should be recorded and communicated to management and others within  the entity in a form and within a timeframe that enables them to carry out  their internal control and other responsibilities.

Without establishing procedures to track what processes  related to a major JTR change have been completed, the Committee may  lack the full range of information and data necessary to understand how  the policy may affect diverse workforces, such as depots, prior to its  approval."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DTMO Assessed Cost- savings, but the Assessment Was Not Comprehensive in That It Did Not Assess Other Potential Costs or Benefits That Could Result from the Policy", "paragraphs": ["DTMO conducted a cost-savings (i.e., benefits) assessment to estimate  the savings resulting from the flat rate per diem policy, but that  assessment was not comprehensive and did not assess other potential  costs or benefits that may result from the policy. For example, according  to DTMO officials, they performed their cost-savings assessment in  October 2012 using fiscal year 2011 voucher travel data from the  Defense Travel System. However, as previously noted, the Defense  Travel System contains only 70 percent of department-wide travel data.  Because DTMO\u2019s cost-savings assessment includes only Defense Travel  System data, officials said they believe their reported estimates of cost- savings are lower than the actual cost-savings being realized.", "Further, DTMO\u2019s assessment did not assess other potential costs that  would be incurred as a result of the flat rate per diem policy. Specifically,  DTMO did not assess the costs that DOD would incur in administering or  in monitoring and enforcing the new policy, such as the cost to update the  Defense Travel System with the functionality to support long-term  travelers, which, according to DTMO officials, is estimated to cost more  than $650,000. DTMO also did not factor approvals for full lodging into  their cost-savings assessment. DTMO officials told us that they knew that  in some instances the full lodging would be necessary, but they did not  account for them in their cost-savings assessment. According to Army,  Navy, and Air Force depot officials, the travel office has authorized the full  lodging amount to depot workers who are scheduled for, as well as depot  workers who are on, long-term TDY. This factor could reduce DTMO\u2019s  estimate of cost-savings, but 7 of the 16 depots reported that they did not  track when a traveler was authorized full lodging.", "DOD Instruction 7041.03, Economic Analysis for Decision-making, which  applies to all DOD components, establishes their responsibility for  following OMB Circular A-94 guidelines concerning benefit-cost analysis  of federal programs. OMB Circular A-94 states that agencies should  follow the guidelines provided when preparing analyses in support of  federal activities, and that a comprehensive enumeration of the different  types of benefits and costs, monetized or not, can be helpful in identifying  the full range of program effects when conducting a benefit-cost analysis  of a policy. Such analyses should also include an evaluation of  alternatives and studies, among other things, to determine whether  anticipated benefits and costs have been realized.", "Other potential costs, such as potential effects on travelers\u2019 willingness to  volunteer and on work force morale, were also not assessed in DTMO\u2019s  cost-savings assessment. According to DTMO officials, they did not  anticipate, based on their previous experience with the flat rate per diem  policy for military personnel, that the policy would have a negative effect  on morale or that travelers would refuse to take long-term TDY  assignments. DTMO officials told us that they did not conduct any  analysis concerning the effects of the policy on civilian employees  because they assumed that the 55 percent per diem would work for  civilians as it had worked for military personnel. However, guidance in the  October 1, 2014, version of the JTR stated that a flat rate per diem rate of  55 percent may be authorized for military personnel in a TDY contingency  operation for more than 180 consecutive days at one location, and this  guidance did not apply to civilian employees. Further, a March 2011  report concerning long-term lodging options for DOD travelers\u2014the  results of a study conducted by a private contractor with whom DTMO  had contracted\u2014found that DOD travelers would be unable to secure  long-term travel at 55 percent of the total General Services Administration  per diem rate without a formal negotiated rate program in place. DTMO  does have a pilot program (the Integrated Lodging Pilot Program) for  providing lodging at a reduced rate, but the pilot program is eligible only  for TDY travel up to 30 days. According to DTMO officials, they plan to  include long-term TDYs in the pilot program, but they did not provide a  plan or firm timeframes for this effort.", "In assessing the potential effects that might ensue from the change in its  per diem policy, we found that DTMO considered only one alternative per  diem rate for each long-term travel period. DTMO assessed only the cost- savings that would result from changing the policy from one that allowed  travelers the full per diem rate to one that allowed them a fixed  percentage (75 or 55 percent, depending on the length of travel) of that  rate. DTMO did not analyze the potential benefits and costs that might  ensue from other alternatives for reducing travel expenditures, such as  the option of leveraging the General Services Administration\u2019s program to  negotiate minimum discounts with corporate apartment vendors for long- term TDYs, which was provided as an example in the March 2011 report  conducted by the contractor. OMB Circular A-94 guidelines for benefit- cost analysis state that agencies should consider alternative means of  achieving program objectives. Specifically, different alternatives may have  different benefits and costs, and agencies should identify the alternative  that is the most cost-beneficial.", "Further, the March 2011 report helped to inform DTMO\u2019s decision  regarding the flat rate per diem rates (75 and 55 percent). However, that  report has some limitations, including that it was based on a limited  number of site locations. Other locations may have actual costs that are  higher or lower than those assumed in the contractor\u2019s study upon which  DTMO\u2019s 75 and 55 percent rates were based. For example, the  contractor that did the study for DTMO focused its analysis on DOD\u2019s top  64 travel destinations in the United States by selecting locations that  covered 80 percent of DOD\u2019s long-term travel volume. According to  DTMO officials, the location data were obtained from the Defense Travel  System, which, as previously noted, contains only 70 percent of  department-wide travel data. Further, no overseas locations were  considered in the report, and the contractor was able to match its data on  extended stay locations to only 30 of DOD\u2019s top 64 locations in the United  States. Based on responses of depot officials to our questionnaire, we  found 10 out of 16 depots identified an overseas location as the location  to which depot workers traveled most frequently for 31 days or more from  August 2015 through July 2016. DTMO officials said that they chose the  75 percent rate instead of the 69 percent rate recommended by the  contractor because they wanted to be conservative and not harm the  traveler. However, DTMO officials acknowledged that they did not  conduct any analysis to assess whether this alternative rate would be  cost-beneficial. DTMO has stated, through its travel newsletter, that it  employs three guiding principles when considering new polices,  programs, and solutions: do no harm, fair compensation, and evidence- based decision making.", "DTMO\u2019s studies also did not assess all costs and benefits resulting from  the flat rate per diem policy. Specifically, DTMO officials provided us with  a copy of the draft Performance Measurement Plan, which officials  described as the first step toward formalizing and more clearly  documenting their cost-savings methodology, and is part of a larger effort  to track and report savings from the flat rate per diem policy. However,  our review of that draft plan, which according to DTMO officials was  drafted in July 2016, found that it does not include an approach to capture  other potential costs and benefits from the policy beyond the cost-savings  of the policy. According to OMB Circular A-94, retrospective studies to  determine whether anticipated benefits and costs have been realized are  potentially valuable. Such studies can be used to determine necessary  corrections in existing programs, and to improve future estimates of  benefits and costs in these programs or related ones. Specifically, the  draft plan does not include an approach for identifying potential effects  that may be difficult to quantify or monetize, such as the negative effect of  the policy on morale or travelers\u2019 willingness to go on long-term travel  assignments. Currently the draft plan includes only cost-savings (i.e.,  benefits) resulting from the policy and data from the Defense Travel  System. The draft plan states that data from other DOD travel systems  were possible future data sources. However, the draft Performance  Measurement Plan does not provide a timeframe or plan for when data  from these other sources would be included, and it does not include an  approach to capture the other potential benefits resulting from the policy  beyond the cost-savings. While DTMO officials indicated that other  metrics (to include cost-savings) might be included in the draft plan, the  plan does not include information about these other metrics. Further, we  found that DTMO\u2019s site visit to assess the adequacy of the flat rate per  diem policy for long-term TDYs did not include a full assessment of the  policy\u2019s per diem rates. According to DTMO officials, they conducted site  visits at two locations (Bremerton, Washington, and San Diego,  California) to assess the adequacy of the flat rate per diem at these  locations. However, the site visits (summarized in e-mail) assessed only  the adequacy of the 75 percent flat rate per diem for long-term travel  between 31 and 180 days; they did not assess the adequacy of the 55  percent flat rate per diem for long-term travel greater than 180 days.", "Lastly, DTMO officials told us that they anticipated only savings to result  from the flat rate per diem policy, not potential costs. According to DTMO  officials, they did not perform an assessment of the indirect costs to  implement the policy because implementation is a service and agency  responsibility. However, as previously noted, the military services did not  provide any cost data related to the implementation of the policy. Without  having conducted a comprehensive assessment that incorporated  principles from OMB Circular A-94 and without having a Performance  Measurement Plan that considers other potential costs and benefits  resulting from the flat rate per diem policy, the Committee and DTMO  may not be well positioned to understand whether the policy is cost- beneficial and is meeting set objectives to reduce travel costs without  negatively affecting the traveler and mission."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Depot officials have identified various benefits, such as cost savings, as  well as challenges, such as difficulties in finding lodging accommodations  that will accept the flat rate per diem, resulting from DOD\u2019s JTR flat rate  per diem policy. However, certain aspects of DOD\u2019s flat rate per diem  guidance remain unclear to depot officials. Without clear guidance in the  JTR related to the flat rate per diem policy concerning what is meant by  proof of lodging, and concerning at what point in the travel process the  M&IE for actual expenses should be requested and approved, the  Committee and DTMO may not have assurance that the policy is meeting  stated objectives, such as the simplification of the travel reimbursement  process for long-term TDYs. Further, the Committee did not ensure that  certain required processes were completed prior to the flat rate per diem  policy\u2019s approval, and as a result was not fully informed concerning  potential effects on civilian employees as well as certain costs when it  considered the 2014 flat rate per diem policy change. Without  establishing procedures to track which processes related to a major JTR  change have been completed, the Committee may lack the full range of  information and data necessary to understand how the policy may affect  diverse workforces, such as depots, prior to the change\u2019s approval.  Finally, although DTMO\u2014the office that serves as the Committee\u2019s staff  and assists in establishing and administering commercial travel policy  within DOD\u2014conducted a cost-savings assessment to estimate savings  that could result from the flat rate per diem policy, the assessment was  not comprehensive and did not consider other potential costs and benefits  that could result from the policy.

We selected  the depot maintenance industrial sites because they reflect diversity in  their mix of depots across the military services. We also selected these  sites because although DOD has other depots\u2014such as depot-level  software maintenance activities\u2014the 17 depot maintenance industrial  sites accounted for a majority of the department\u2019s depot-level workload in  fiscal year 2014, for example, according to an Office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness maintenance  overview. We sent a questionnaire to the 17 depots to obtain the  commanders\u2019 perspectives and documentation on the policy\u2019s benefits  and challenges on civilian employees and operations. We received  responses from all 17 depots, and we then analyzed the results. For  questions that elicited closed-ended and quantitative responses, we used  the software system SAS to produce summary output. For questions that  elicited open-ended and qualitative responses, we conducted a content  analysis in which two analysts independently categorized each depot\u2019s  responses. The pair of analysts discussed any discrepancies in their  categorizations until they reached a consensus. When we sent out our  questionnaire, the flat rate per diem policy was in effect at 13 of the 17  depots for bargaining unit employees and was in effect at all depots for  non-bargaining unit employees. Therefore, we believed that the depots  could provide knowledgeable perspectives on the benefits and challenges  of the policy. Subsequently, Marine Corps officials indicated that civilian  employees at the Production Plant in Barstow, California, never travel on  long-term TDY, and consequently we excluded their questionnaire  responses from our analysis related to the benefits and challenges of the  policy.", "As part of the questionnaire\u2019s development, a survey specialist and two  independent analysts with expertise in depot maintenance reviewed the  questionnaire. The expert review phase was intended to ensure that  content necessary to understand the questions was included and that  technical terminology included in the questionnaire was correct. To  minimize errors that might occur from respondents interpreting our  questions differently than we intended, we pre-tested our questionnaire  with staff from the budget, travel, and other relevant offices of five depots.  During the pre-tests, conducted in person or by phone, we asked the  officials to read the instructions and each question aloud and to tell us  how they interpreted the question. We then discussed the instructions  and questions with officials to determine whether (1) the instructions and  questions were clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms we used were  accurate, (3) the questionnaire was unbiased, and (4) the questionnaire  did not place an undue burden on the officials completing it, and (5) to  identify potential solutions to any problems identified. We noted any  potential problems and modified the questionnaire based on the feedback  received from the reviewers and pre-tests as appropriate. We sent email  notifications to each depot beginning on September 6, 2016. We sent the  Microsoft Word form questionnaire and a cover email and asked  recipients to fill out the questionnaire and email it back to us within 2  weeks. We closed the questionnaire on November 1, 2016. Overall we  received 17 completed questionnaires, for a response rate of 100  percent.", "Because we collected data from every depot we selected and we are not  generalizing results to other depots, there was no sampling error.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  errors, commonly referred to as non-sampling errors. For example,  differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of  information available to respondents, how the responses were processed  and analyzed, or the types of people who do not respond can influence  the accuracy of the survey results. We took steps in the development of  the questionnaire, the data collection, and the data analysis to minimize  these non-sampling errors and help ensure the accuracy of the answers  that were obtained. For example, a social science survey specialist  designed the questionnaire, in collaboration with analysts having subject  matter expertise. Then, as noted earlier, the draft questionnaire was pre- tested to ensure that questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to  comprehend. The questionnaire was also reviewed by internal subject  matter experts and an additional survey specialist, as mentioned above.", "Data were electronically extracted from the Word questionnaires into a  comma-delimited file that was then imported into a statistical program for  quantitative analysis and Excel for qualitative analysis. Only one variable  was manually entered (the name of the depot), and that data entry  accuracy was verified. We examined the questionnaire results and  performed computer analyses to identify inconsistencies and other  indications of error, and we addressed such issues as necessary.  Quantitative data analyses were conducted by a survey specialist using  statistical software. An independent data analyst checked the statistical  computer programs for accuracy. Content analyses of open-ended  responses were conducted by two analysts with subject matter expertise.  A standard coding scheme was developed, and the two analysts  independently coded each depot\u2019s response. The pair of analysts then  discussed any discrepancies in their coding until they reached  consensus.", "The verbatim wording of key questions from our questionnaire whose  results are discussed in this report is located in appendix III.", "To obtain the perspectives of civilian employees affected by the flat rate  per diem policy, we conducted four discussion groups at Puget Sound  Naval Shipyard\u2014two discussion groups with bargaining unit employees,  and two discussion groups with managers and supervisors of bargaining  unit employees. We selected Puget Sound Naval Shipyard because, of  the 17 depot maintenance industrial sites, it has the most civilian  employees, and because it had implemented the flat rate per diem policy  for non-bargaining and bargaining unit employees shortly after the policy  became effective. We also held interviews with officials from Anniston  Army Depot, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, and Puget Sound Naval  Shipyard regarding the benefits and challenges of the flat rate per diem  policy. These results were not generalizable but provided important  insights.", "To determine the extent to which DOD established clear guidance  regarding the policy, we reviewed and analyzed the flat rate per diem  policy in the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) and compared it with Federal  Standards for Internal Controls related to information and  communications to identify areas of the policy that could be clarified to  assist DOD in meeting set objectives to simplify travel. We also  interviewed relevant agency officials from the Defense Travel  Management Office (DTMO); the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation  Allowance Committee's (hereinafter the Committee) Chair (i.e., the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy); and  Department of the Navy, Office of Civilian Human Resources, regarding  the guidance related to the flat rate per diem policy. We also included  questions in the questionnaire sent to the 17 depots concerning the flat  rate per diem policy\u2019s guidance regarding proof of lodging costs and the  May 2016 meals and incidental expenses waiver, as well as contacted  depot officials from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps.", "To determine the extent to which DOD followed its processes for  considering the flat rate per diem policy change and included an  assessment of benefits and costs prior to making the change, we  analyzed and reviewed the Per Diem, Travel and Transportation  Allowance Committee Organization and Functions Manual and other  relevant documents related to the process, such as memorandums. We  compared the Committee\u2019s documents and actions with its manual and  relevant guidance included in the Committee\u2019s memorandums to identify  gaps, if any, in the process used. We also reviewed DOD Instruction  7041.03, Economic Analysis for Decision-making, which establishes  responsibilities for the DOD components in following Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94 guidelines for benefit-cost  analysis of federal programs. Further, we compared DTMO\u2019s cost savings  assessment to selected elements in OMB Circular A-94 guidelines for  benefit-cost analysis of federal programs to identify gaps, if any, in the  assessment. Specifically, we focused on key elements of OMB Circular  A-94 for conducting a benefit-cost analysis, such as whether DTMO  conducted a benefit-cost or cost-effectiveness analysis when considering  the flat rate per diem policy; a comprehensive enumeration of the different  types of benefits and costs, monetized or not; an evaluation of  alternatives; and retrospective studies, which are potentially valuable, to  determine whether anticipated benefits and costs have been realized.", "We focused on these key elements because the stated purpose of OMB  Circular A-94 is to promote efficient resource allocation through well- informed decision-making by the federal government.

We also reviewed a March 2011 report concerning long-term  lodging options for DOD travelers, which DTMO contracted with a private  contractor to conduct. We interviewed officials from DTMO and various  members of the Military and Civilian Advisory Panels from across the  military services to gain further information and clarification regarding the  Committee\u2019s processes, as well as perspectives regarding the costs and  benefits of the policy.
