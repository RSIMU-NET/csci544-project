DOD and the Army have taken steps to increase oversight of the program, but resolving these issues during technology development will remain a challenge. For example, the Army has already reduced some requirements and encouraged contractors to use mature technologies in their proposals, but the 7-year schedule remains ambitious, and delays would increase development costs. Independent cost estimates have suggested that 9 to 10 years is a more realistic schedule. Over the next 2 years during the technology development phase, the Army faces major challenges in deciding which capabilities to pursue and include in a GCV vehicle design and determine whether the best option is a new vehicle or modifications to a current vehicle. The Army's new information network strategy moves away from a single network development program to an incremental approach with which feasible technologies can be developed, tested, and fielded. The new strategy has noteworthy aspects, such as using periodic field evaluations to assess systems that may provide potential benefit and getting soldier feedback on the equipment being tested. However, the Army has not articulated requirements, incremental objectives, or cost and schedule projections for its new network. It is important that the Army proceed in defining requirements and expected capabilities for the network to avoid the risk of developing individual capabilities that may not work together as a network. With the cancellation last week of its ground mobile radio and continuing problems in developing technology to provide advanced networking capability, the Army will still need to find foundational pieces for its network. The Army is reworking earlier plans to develop and acquire the JLTV and is planning to recapitalize some of its High Mobility, Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMWWV). These efforts have just begun, however, and their results are not yet assured. To reduce risk in the JLTV program, the services relied on multiple vendors during technology development to increase their knowledge of the needed technologies, determine the technology maturity level, and determine which requirements were achievable. As a result, the services identified trades in requirements to drive down the cost of the vehicle. For example, the services found that JLTV could not achieve both protection level and transportability goals, so the services are accepting a heavier vehicle. A potential risk for the services in allowing industry to build vehicles for testing is that the prototypes may not be mature; the Army will need to keep its options open to changes that may result from these tests. Both the Army and the Marine Corps have articulated a significant future role for their Up-Armored HMMWV fleets, yet the fleets are experiencing reduced automotive performance, the need for better protection as threats have evolved, and other issues. The Army is planning to recapitalize a portion of its Up-Armored HMMWV fleet to increase automotive performance and improve blast protection.

In the wake of the June 2009  decision to cancel the Future Combat System, which included a new  class of manned ground vehicles anchored by an advanced information  network, the Army began developing plans for a new Ground Combat  Vehicle (GCV) and an incremental tactical network capability. At about  the same time, the Army began considering ways to improve its light  tactical vehicles and developed the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV)  program with the U.S. Marine Corps. My statement today, based largely  on work we have conducted over the last year in response to requests  from this subcommittee and results of other reviews of Army  modernization, will address potential issues that the Army faces as it  prepares to make significant decisions on its GCV, network, and light  tactical vehicle programs in this constrained budget environment.", "To assess the GCV program, we analyzed program documentation, such  as the Initial Capabilities Document and the Technology Development  Strategy; interviewed Army and Department of Defense (DOD) officials;  and interviewed independent experts and reviewed their analyses.

We also  observed demonstrations of current and emerging networking equipment,  analyzed evaluation results, obtained soldier feedback, and met with  Army and DOD officials who are involved in defining the tactical network.  To assess JLTV, we analyzed documentation, interviewed Army and  Marine Corps officials, and analyzed how the Mine Resistant Ambush  Protected (MRAP) vehicle program, including the MRAP-All Terrain  Vehicle (M-ATV), has influenced the JLTV program. We also obtained  and reviewed JLTV test results and interviewed test officials.

Tactical vehicles generally move on wheels, including the  HMMWV and the JLTV.", "Most major defense acquisitions follow a structured acquisition process,  which normally consists of three discrete phases: (1) technology  development; (2) engineering and manufacturing development; and (3)  production and deployment. Programs are expected to meet certain  criteria at milestone decision points for entry into each phase. For  anticipated major defense acquisition programs, like the GCV and the  JLTV, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics (USD/ATL) generally serves as the Milestone Decision  Authority. The Milestone Decision Authority is responsible for approving  the programs\u2019 entry into the defense acquisition system, approving entry  into subsequent phases, and documenting the various approvals through  acquisition decision memorandums.", "The Army\u2019s GCV program is intended to modernize the current ground  combat vehicle fleet, replacing a portion of the Bradley Infantry Fighting  Vehicles currently in inventory. In February 2010, the Army issued a  request for proposals for the technology development phase of the GCV  before completing the required analysis of alternatives (AOA), citing  schedule urgency. In May 2010, the Army convened a \u201cRed Team\u201d to  assess the risk of achieving the GCV schedule. The Red Team issued its  report in August 2010, citing major risk areas including schedule,  technical maturity, and affordability of the system. The Army rescinded  the original request for proposals and issued another in late 2010. The  milestone A decision was expected in April 2011, but did not occur until  August 2011 (see fig. 1). In August, the Army awarded technology  development contracts to two contractor teams. A third contractor team  submitted a proposal but did not receive a contract award and has filed a  bid protest with GAO that is still being considered.", "The Army has been defining a strategy to develop, demonstrate, and field  a common tactical information network across its forces. Generally, such  a network is expected to act as an information superhighway to collect,  process, and deliver vast amounts of information such as images and  communications while seamlessly linking people and systems. The  Army\u2019s current strategy is to better understand current Army networking  capabilities, determine capabilities needed, and chart an incremental path  forward. The Army plans regular demonstrations as the network grows  and its capability improves.", "The Army and Marine Corps generally define light tactical vehicles as  capable of being transported by a rotary wing aircraft and with a cargo  capacity of equal to or less than 5,100 pounds. Light tactical vehicles  represent about 50 percent of the Army\u2019s tactical wheeled vehicle fleet  and currently consist of the HMMWV family of vehicles. The Army\u2019s  HMMWV program also provides vehicles to satisfy Marine Corps, Air  Force, and other requirements. The JLTV is expected to be the next  generation of light tactical vehicles and is being designed to provide the  advances in protection, performance, and payload to fill the capability gap  remaining between the HMMWV and MRAP family of vehicles. JLTV is  being designed to protect its occupants from the effects of mines and  improvised explosive devices without sacrificing its payload capability or  its automotive performance, which has not been the case with the other  tactical wheeled vehicles.", "The Army\u2019s recent history with its acquisition programs was the subject of  a review by a panel chartered by the Secretary of the Army. In its January  2011 report, the panel noted that the Army has increasingly failed to take  new development programs into full-rate production. From 1990 to 2010,  the Army terminated 22 major defense acquisition programs before  completion. While noting many different causes that contribute to a  program\u2019s terminations, the panel found that many terminated programs  shared several of the same problems, including weak trade studies or  analyses of alternatives; unconstrained weapon system requirements;  underestimation of risk, particularly technology readiness levels;  affordability reprioritization; schedule delays; and requirements and  technology creep. The panel made a number of recommendations to help  make the Army\u2019s requirements, resourcing, and acquisition processes  more effective and efficient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Faces Major Challenges to Identify a Feasible, Cost- Effective, and Executable GCV Solution", "paragraphs": ["Over the next 2 years during the technology development phase, the  Army faces major challenges to identify a feasible, cost-effective, and  executable solution that meets the Army\u2019s needs. Among these are  making choices on which capabilities to pursue and include in a GCV  vehicle design and determining whether the best option is a new vehicle  or a modified current vehicle. In our March 2011 testimony, we identified  key questions about GCV pertaining to how urgently it is needed,  robustness of the analysis of alternatives, plausibility of its 7-year  schedule, cost and affordability, and whether mature technologies would  be used. Since that time, the Army has moved the CGV program into the  technology development phase. DOD and the Army have taken positive  steps to increase their oversight of the program; however, the timely  resolution of issues surrounding the areas previously identified will be a  major challenge.  \uf0b7  Urgency of need: The Army\u2019s recent combat vehicle capability  portfolio review confirmed the Army\u2019s need for GCV as a Bradley  Infantry Fighting Vehicle replacement and USD/ATL approved the  GCV acquisition program. USD/ATL agreed that the Army has a  priority need for a GCV but the number of caveats in the approval  decision (as discussed below) raises questions about the soundness  of the Army\u2019s acquisition plans and time lines.  \uf0b7  Analysis of alternatives: After initially bypassing completion of the  AOA process, the Army subsequently conducted an AOA but was  directed by USD/ATL to conduct more robust analyses, throughout  the technology development phase, to include design and capability  trades intended to reduce technical risks and GCV production costs.  We have reported that a robust AOA can be a key element in  ensuring a program has a sound, executable business case prior to  program initiation and that programs that conduct a limited AOA  tended to experience poorer outcomes\u2014including cost growth. The  Army is expected to include sensitivity analyses in the AOA to explore  trade-offs between specific capabilities and costs. These analyses will  be supported by assessments of existing combat vehicles to  determine whether they are adequate alternatives to a new vehicle, or  whether some of the designs or capabilities of existing vehicles should  be incorporated into a new GCV. Concurrently, the GCV contractor  teams will conduct design trades and demonstrate technologies, the  results of which will also be fed back into the AOA updates.  \uf0b7  Plausibility of 7-year schedule: The Army\u2019s plan to deliver the first  production vehicles in 7 years still has significant risk. Since GCV was  originally conceived in 2009, the Army has already reduced some  requirements and encouraged interested contractors to use mature  technologies in their proposals. However, the schedule remains  ambitious and USD/ATL has stipulated that the Army will need to  demonstrate that the schedule is both feasible and executable.  According to an independent Army program evaluator, the next 2  years of technology development will require many capability and  requirements trades in order to better define an acceptable solution at  the same time that technology risks for that solution are to be  identified and mitigated. Concurrent activities can lead to poor results,  calling into question whether the 7-year schedule is executable. The  independent cost estimate submitted for the milestone A review  featured higher GCV development costs with the assumption that the  Army would need 9 or 10 years to complete the program, instead of  the assumed 7 years.  \uf0b7  Cost and affordability: Cost continues to be a challenge, as an  independent cost estimate was at least 30 percent higher than the  Army\u2019s estimate for GCV procurement. USD/ATL has directed that  continued program approval depends on the Army\u2019s ability to meet the  $13 million procurement unit cost target. As for affordability, with the  expectation that less funding will be available in coming years, the  Army has made some trades within the combat vehicle portfolio.  According to Army officials, the Army plans to proceed with GCV as  currently planned, but several other combat vehicle programs\u2014such  as anticipated upgrades for the Bradley, Abrams, and Stryker  vehicles\u2014are being reshaped or delayed.  \uf0b7  Use of mature technologies: The Army encouraged interested  contractor teams to use mature technologies in their GCV proposals.  Due to the current bid protest, we do not have insight into what the  contractor teams proposed in terms of specific critical technologies or  their maturity. A DOD official stated, and we agree, that it will be  important that technologies be thoroughly evaluated at the preliminary  design review before the decision to proceed to the engineering and  manufacturing development phase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ambitious Army Information Network Strategy Has Noteworthy Aspects but Unresolved Issues Could Affect Long- Term Implementation", "paragraphs": ["The Army has taken a number of steps to put together a more realistic  strategy to develop and field an information network for its deployed  forces than the network envisioned for the Future Combat System  program. However, the Army is proceeding without defining requirements  for the network and articulating clearly defined capabilities. As a result,  the Army runs the risk of developing a number of stovepipe capabilities  that may not work together as a network, thus wasting resources. The  Army has moved away from its plan for a single network development  program under Future Combat System to an incremental approach with  which feasible technologies can be developed, tested, and fielded. This  planned approach reflects lessons learned and changes the way the  Army develops, acquires, and fields network capabilities. Under this new  approach, numerous programs will be developed separately and  coordinated centrally, and network increments will be integrated and  demonstrated in advance of fielding rather than the previous practice of  ad hoc development and integration in the field. A key aspect of the  implementation of the new approach will be aligning the schedules of the  separate programs with the Army\u2019s planned, semiannual field events,  called network integration evaluations, where emerging technologies are  put in soldiers\u2019 hands for demonstration and evaluation.", "Several key aspects of the Army\u2019s Network Strategy include:  In our March 2011 testimony, we pointed out that roles and  responsibilities for network development were not clear. Since then,  senior Army leadership issued a directive detailing the collective roles,  responsibilities, and functions of relevant Army organizations involved  with the network modernization effort.  \uf0b7  The Army is currently working to establish a comprehensive  integrated technical baseline for the network and addressing  prioritized capability gaps. With this baseline, the Army expects to  build on elements of the network already in place with an emphasis on  capturing emerging technologies that deliver capability incrementally  to multiple units at the same time. This represents a significant  departure from the previous practice of fielding systems individually  and often to only one element of the operational force at a time (for  instance, companies, battalions, or brigades).  \uf0b7  The network integration evaluations are a key enabler of the Army\u2019s  new network strategy and assess systems that may provide potential  benefits and value to the Army while identifying areas requiring  additional development. The evaluation process provides the Army an  opportunity to improve its knowledge of current and potential network  capability. Additionally, it provides soldier feedback on the equipment  being tested. For example, members of the Army\u2019s network test unit,  the Brigade Modernization Command, indicated that a number of  systems tested should be fielded and other systems that should  continue development.", "Several issues will need to be resolved as the Army implements its  network strategy. For example,  \uf0b7  The Army has not yet announced requirements nor has it established  cost and schedule projections for development and fielding of its  network. Since the Future Combat System termination, the Army does  not have a blueprint or framework to determine how the various  capabilities it already has will fit together with capabilities it is  acquiring to meet the needs of the soldier. Even with an incremental  approach, it is important for the Army to clearly articulate the  capabilities the system is attempting to deliver. Without this  knowledge, the Army runs the risk of acquiring technologies that may  work in a stand-alone mode but do not add utility to the broader  network strategy.  \uf0b7  The network integration evaluation provided an extensive amount of  data and knowledge on the current Army network and candidate  systems for the network. However, since the network integration  evaluation serves as an evaluation instrument, it is important to have  test protocols that capture objective measures and data on the  network\u2019s performance. Two independent Army test oversight  agencies, reflecting on the evaluation results, expressed concern over  not having proper instrumentation for the overall evaluations; in  particular, not having the necessary instrumentation to conduct  operational tests on large integrated networks and not having clear  network requirements.  \uf0b7  Army officials are developing a strategy to identify, demonstrate, and  field emerging technologies in an expedited fashion. To date, the  Army has developed an approach to solicit ideas from industry and  demonstrate the proposed technologies in the network integration  evaluation. However, the Army is still formulating its proposed  approach for funding and rapidly procuring the more promising  technologies.  \uf0b7  Development of the Joint Tactical Radio System ground mobile radio,  a software-defined radio that was expected to be a key component of  the network has recently been terminated. In a letter to a  congressional defense committee explaining the termination, the  acting USD/ATL stated that the termination was based on growth in  unit procurement costs. He added that it is unlikely that Joint Tactical  Radio System ground mobile radio would affordably meet  requirements and may not meet some requirements at all. The radio  performed poorly during the network integration evaluation and was  given a \u201cstop development and do not field\u201d assessment by the test  unit. Based on the assessment that a competitive market had  emerged with the potential to deliver alternate radios to meet the  capability at a reduced cost, the acting USD/ATL also established a  new program for an affordable; low-cost; reduced size, weight, and  power radio product. At this point, it is not yet clear when and how that  program will proceed or how these new radios will be able to fit within  the Army\u2019s network strategy.  \uf0b7  The Army plans for the future tactical network to feature the use of the  wideband networking and soldier radio waveforms and, in our March  2011 testimony, we reported that the Army has had trouble maturing  these waveforms for several years and they are still not at acceptable  levels of maturity. Although both waveforms experienced limited  successes during the recent network integration evaluation testing,  Army officials indicate that the wideband networking waveform  continues to be very complex, and not fully understood, and there  may be substantial risk maturing it to its full capability requirement.  With the termination of the ground mobile radio, it is unclear how  waveform maturation will continue.  \uf0b7  Although the network integration kit\u2014expected to be a fundamental  part of the Army\u2019s information network\u2014was found to have marginal  performance, poor reliability, and limited utility, the USD/ATL  approved procurement of one additional brigade set of network  integration kits. The decision made potential fielding of the kits\u2014 radios, waveforms, integrated computer system, and software\u2014 contingent on user testing that successfully demonstrates that it can  improve current force capabilities. The network integration kit again  performed poorly during the recent network integration evaluation and  received a \u201cstop development and do not field\u201d assessment. Army  network officials have indicated that a senior Army leadership  memorandum will be forthcoming that will cancel further network  integration kit development and fielding. Earlier, the Army concluded  that the network integration kit was not a long-term, viable, and  affordable solution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services to Rely on Industry to Provide Potential Solutions for Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Needs", "paragraphs": ["To reduce risk in the JLTV program, the Army and Marine Corps entered  a technology development phase with multiple vendors to help increase  their knowledge of the needed technologies, determine the technologies\u2019  maturity level, and determine which combination of requirements were  achievable. The contractors delivered prototype vehicles in May 2010 and  testing to evaluate the technical risks in meeting the proposed  requirements, among other things, was completed on the vehicles in June  2011. Because of the knowledge gained through the technology  development phase, the services have worked together to identify trades  in requirements to reduce weight and to drive down the cost of the  vehicle. A different outcome may have resulted if the services had  proceeded directly to the engineering and manufacturing development  phase, as had been considered earlier.", "Based on the technology development results, the services concluded  that the original JLTV requirements were not achievable and its cost  would be too high. For example, the services found that JLTV could not  achieve both protection levels and transportability, with weight being the  issue. As a result, the services have adjusted the JLTV transportability  requirement to a more achievable level and the Army and Marine Corps  have decided that they would rely on HMWWVs for other missions initially  intended for JLTV. In fact, the Army has chosen to proceed with even  higher protection levels than planned earlier for JLTV. The Army now  plans to have protection levels equal to the M-ATV, including underbody  protection, while the Marine Corps will continue with the original  protection level, similar to the MRAP family of vehicles except for the  underbody protection, but plans to conduct more off-road operations to  avoid mines and roadside bombs. As for armor protection, the services  have found that development of lightweight, yet robust armor has not  proceeded as rapidly as hoped and production costs for these new  technologies are significantly higher than for traditional armor.", "The services have established an average procurement cost target of  $350,000. A key component of the average procurement cost is the  average manufacturing unit cost which includes the cost of labor,  materials, and overhead to produce and assemble the product. Achieving  the average procurement cost target of $350,000 would require an  average manufacturing unit cost of $250,000 to $275,000. While one  recent technology development projection of a fully armored JLTV  average procurement cost exceeded $600,000, the program office now  estimates that, by implementing requirements trades and the cost savings  from those trades, industry can meet the average manufacturing unit cost  and average procurement cost targets. Nevertheless, meeting the JLTV  cost targets will be a challenge and will also likely depend on what type of  contract the services award. The services\u2019 current JTLV plan is to award  a multiyear procurement contract with sizable annual quantities, once a  stable design is achieved.", "Originally, the services planned to follow a traditional acquisition  approach for JLTV and enter the engineering and manufacturing  development phase in January 2012. According to the Army program  manager for light tactical vehicles, the services now plan to use a  modified MRAP acquisition model in which industry would be asked to  build a set of vehicles that would subsequently be extensively tested prior  to a production decision. The Army has stated that industry had  demonstrated several competitive prototypes whose performance and  cost has been verified and believes that industry can respond with  testable prototypes within about 1 year. Many details of the new strategy  have yet to be worked out but a milestone B review is anticipated in April  2012. While this approach is seen as saving time and money, it will forgo  the detailed design maturation and development testing process typically  done early in the engineering and manufacturing development phase.
