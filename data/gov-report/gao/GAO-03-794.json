The proposal is based on analyses of the leading sources of EIC errors, thus focusing attention and burden on the subset of taxpayers most likely to make those errors. Since August 2002, IRS has made key changes to the certification program, including concentrating on residency certification and postponing relationship certification, delaying program implementation until later this year, and reducing the test sample from 45,000 to 25,000. Despite the changes, the process for selecting taxpayers, what taxpayers will receive from IRS, what taxpayers are required to provide, and the program's goals remain fundamentally the same as originally planned. In addition, IRS has emphasized that program expansions, if any, will depend on the results of this year's test. The process would involve three key stages. These changes, including the most recent, help achieve a better balance between preventing unreasonable taxpayer burden and addressing the EIC's high overclaim rate and support IRS's plans to test the certification program. However, IRS's plan for evaluating the test is incomplete, presenting only some information on how IRS would evaluate whether certification would reduce the EIC overclaim rate, minimize burden, and maintain a relatively high participation rate.

Taxpayers can qualify for the credit in one of two ways:  with a \u201cqualifying child\u201d or by \u201cincome only,\u201d if they do not have a  qualifying child. For example, for tax year 2002, the amount of EIC that  could be claimed with a qualifying child or children ranged from $0 to  $4,140. EIC payments have a phase-in range in which higher incomes yield  higher EIC amounts, a plateau phase in which EIC amounts remain the  same even as income rises, and a phase-out range in which higher incomes  yield lower EIC payments or tax liability.", "EIC requirements for tax year 2002 include rules for everyone, additional  rules for taxpayers with qualifying children, and additional rules for  taxpayers without qualifying children, as shown in table 1.", "IRS has periodically measured EIC compliance for overclaims and  underclaims. The most current data available, for tax year 1999, show EIC  overclaim rates estimated to be between 27 and 32 percent of dollars  claimed or between $8.5 billion and $9.9 billion. IRS has limited data on  underclaims, which for tax year 1999 were estimated to be between   $710 million and $765 million. IRS has tried to reduce noncompliance  through various means, including education and outreach to taxpayers and  tax return preparers. In addition, Congress has enacted legislation aimed at  resolving some concerns with EIC rules. Because a new analysis of EIC  compliance using 2001 tax return information is not expected to be  complete until late in 2004, IRS does not know whether compliance has  significantly changed since 1999, but officials do not think it has improved substantially. Because of the persistently high rates of noncompliance, we  have identified the EIC program as a high-risk area for IRS since 1995.", "Currently, taxpayers claim the EIC by filing an individual income tax return  (e.g., a Form 1040 or 1040A) and including a Schedule EIC\u2014a procedure  similar for claiming other tax credits.  Unlike with other benefit programs  such as Supplemental Security Income, however, EIC taxpayers are not  required to be found qualified before claiming the credit or file any other  documents with their return to establish eligibility. Instead, IRS uses four  primary means to evaluate EIC eligibility and check for noncompliance  after the return is filed and checks some aspects of taxpayers\u2019 eligibility  before and after the credit is granted:  (1) the math error program, (2)  correspondence and face-to-face examinations (also called audits), (3) the  document matching program, and (4) criminal investigations. Some of  these means, such as the math error program, check all EIC returns, but  only for limited aspects of eligibility. Other means, such as examinations,  only check a small subset of EIC returns, but the review is more expansive.  In general, IRS subjects all returns to its math error program and takes  corrective action on errors found. Depending on the resources IRS has  available, IRS works only a small portion of cases identified as potentially  meriting follow-up under its examination, document matching, and  criminal investigations efforts.", "While processing all tax returns, IRS uses its automated math error  program to identify and correct the simpler errors found in claiming the  EIC. For example, the math error program can identify invalid Social  Security numbers and taxpayers who fail to follow recertification  requirements. As a result, some inappropriate EIC claims are stopped  before refunds are issued. During fiscal year 2001, IRS stopped more than  371,000 incorrect EIC claims using its math error authority. After  identifying errors, IRS corrects them so the tax return can be processed  and sends a computerized notice to the taxpayer identifying the error and  stating that IRS disallowed or reduced the EIC claim. The notice tells  taxpayers that if they can correct the error, the EIC claim will be allowed  and any refund related to the EIC claim will be issued.", "Two types of examinations\u2014-correspondence and face-to-face\u2014are used  when EIC noncompliance is suspected, in most cases before refunds are  issued. IRS uses various systematic means to \u201cscore\u201d the likelihood of  noncompliance on any return and uses experienced staff to manually  identify the specific items on returns for examination. Most EIC  examinations occur shortly after a return is filed, largely because of the  difficulty in recovering refunds. IRS stops refunds on these returns until  examinations are completed. This contrasts with IRS\u2019s normal examination  practice of performing examinations many months after tax returns have  been processed and any refunds paid. The EIC examinations usually rely  on correspondence with taxpayers rather than face-to-face contacts. IRS  completed about 368,000 EIC related correspondence exams during fiscal  year 2002. IRS tends to use face-to-face meetings with taxpayers to  examine tax returns with EIC claims on a very limited basis and primarily  when examinations are initiated for other reasons. As part of either type of  examination, however, IRS would describe the potential noncompliance in  a computerized notice to taxpayers claiming the EIC. IRS requests  documentation, such as a school record or birth certificate, to establish  EIC requirements. Depending on whether IRS officials accept or reject the  support, they may make changes to the return and refund related to the EIC  claim. If taxpayers disagree with IRS\u2019s decisions, they have the right to  appeal administratively and/or through the courts.", "IRS also uses its document matching programs to identify potentially  misreported income on tax returns claiming the EIC. By comparing the tax  return to wage and income statements provided by third parties such as  employers and financial institutions, the document-matching program  identifies whether a taxpayer appears to have misreported income. Given  the phase-in and phase-out ranges of the EIC, some taxpayers may claim  too much EIC by overreporting or underreporting their income. This  program notifies such taxpayers months after returns are filed and refunds  are issued. Similar to audits, a notice is issued telling a taxpayer that an  error appears to have been made, that he or she may disagree and provide  any support for income reported, and that he or she may appeal IRS\u2019s  decision about additional taxes owed. Unlike audits, the program is highly  automated and is designed to require less contact with taxpayers by IRS  staff.", "IRS also uses criminal investigations to stop the payment of false refunds,  identify refund scams/schemes, and prosecute perpetrators, including  those with fraudulent EIC claims. For EIC, IRS uses a specific computer  program that looks for questionable refund claims and for return preparers  known to have prepared questionable returns. IRS also has teams that scan  returns and receive referrals from other parts of IRS and informants. IRS  stops many returns as they are being processed so that criminal  investigators can review the claims before the refund is paid or after the  return has been processed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Task Force Considered Much Information Related to EIC Compliance before Recommending Qualifying Child Certification Program", "paragraphs": ["When IRS\u2019s study of EIC compliance rates for 1999 was released, the  Assistant  Secretary of the Treasury and IRS Commissioner convened a  task force in February 2002 to find ways of reducing EIC overclaims while  minimizing the burden to taxpayers and maintaining the EIC\u2019s relatively  high participation rate.

While some stakeholders view the 1999 study as having  some methodological weaknesses, it showed that of the approximately 20  million taxpayers that claimed the EIC in 1999, 46 to 50 percent of their tax  returns had errors that led to claiming too much of the credit (IRS often  refers to this as the error rate). IRS also estimated that the total dollars  overclaimed on those returns represented between 27 and 32 percent of  total EIC dollars claimed in 1999, or between $8.5 billion and $9.9 billion.", "IRS also has some data on underclaims\u2014instances where taxpayers  claimed less than they were entitled to receive.

According to IRS  officials, because different methodologies were used in the subsequent  studies, changes in estimated overclaims found in other studies do not  support conclusions about trends in the overclaim rate over time. However,  IRS officials also acknowledged the overclaim rate has not improved  significantly. Overclaim rates for tax years 1997 and 1999 are shown in table  2.

For example, in 2001 we reported that an estimated three of every four  eligible participants received the EIC in tax year 1999. For taxpayers with  one or two qualifying children, we estimated that participation rates  exceeded 90 percent.  Individuals with no children, who receive a much  smaller credit than taxpayers with qualifying children, had a much lower  participation rate that we estimated to be about 45 percent.

Of the  recent changes, the task force estimated that one change, to the Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) tiebreaker rule, would likely reduce noncompliance.   The task force judged that the other legislative changes, including those  proposed by Treasury, while potentially helping reduce noncompliance  from other sources, would not be enough to reduce noncompliance  without further IRS efforts.", "Three key pieces of legislation, which have been recently enacted or taken  effect, were at least partially aimed at improving EIC compliance, as shown  in table 3.

The task force was trying to determine for both  options whether sufficient information was already available from others,  or that little additional information would need to be collected by others, to  verify a taxpayer\u2019s qualifying children. However, the task force found that  there was little overlap between the EIC population and verification  criteria used to administer other federal or state programs. In addition,  although some databases existed, the task force found that they could not  be used to effectively verify EIC eligibility, largely for the same reason.  Consequently, the task force judged that these options were not likely to be  useful in addressing EIC compliance problems. Similarly, the task force  also found that if a federal database were created to facilitate EIC  verification, IRS would have to gather the bulk of the information itself,  thus imposing a burden on taxpayers, which would also be costly and time- consuming for IRS. The third option, which the task force selected,  required taxpayers to demonstrate EIC eligibility for certain criteria,  namely residency and relationship tests for qualifying children, prior to  receiving the credit.", "The relative cost of the options the task force considered did not drive the  decision to select the qualifying child program because the other two  alternatives were not considered viable. The task force did compare IRS\u2019s  EIC administrative costs to those of other federal benefit programs and  found them to be much smaller. IRS has had a special appropriation for EIC  compliance initiatives since 1998\u2014and has received about $875 million  total through fiscal year 2003. It requested a total of about $250 million in  fiscal year 2004, which included $100 million for the EIC compliance  initiatives, including the qualifying child program, and about $150 million  for the special appropriation. IRS estimated that this $250 million total  was about 0.8 percent of the total annual EIC benefits distributed, and  therefore much smaller than the 9 to 13 percent administrative costs the  task force had found for other benefit programs.

Three administrative proposals  resulted, involving (1) qualifying child certification, (2) improper filing  status, and (3) income misreporting. In 1999, another leading source of  EIC overclaims involved taxpayers with lower modified adjusted gross  income claiming a child when another person with a higher income should  have done so.

The task force proposed targeting the program to those taxpayers  with qualifying children for whom IRS could not establish residency or  relationship through other available means and it proposed that this  concept be tested on a sample of EIC taxpayers for the tax year 2003. The  task force envisioned that ultimately all EIC claimants whose eligibility  could not be verified through available means would be asked to provide  additional eligibility documentation prior to the filing season. Taxpayers  who successfully certified qualifying children\u2019s eligibility in advance of the  filing season would have their claims processed and paid expeditiously  during the filing season, absent any other problems with their tax return or  EIC claim.

For relationship, IRS developed a plan to match  taxpayers to several databases that show the parents of children. For  instance, one database IRS planned to use was the Social Security  Administration\u2019s database (which IRS refers to as KIDLINK) that ties  parent\u2019s and children\u2019s Social Security numbers for children born after 1998  in U.S. hospitals.

IRS officials considered the FCR to be the  most useful database for identifying those meeting the residency  requirements.  This database compiles court and other records that  indicate who is the custodian for a child (which could be a parent or  nonparent). IRS assumes that children live with the custodian of record.  According to IRS, the FCR database contains custodial information for  about 40 percent of the EIC population.  If a taxpayer matched as the  custodian of the child claimed for the EIC for 2002, the taxpayer would not be among those needing to certify.

Otherwise, all males  who were shown to be a child\u2019s father filing single or head of household  would be included in the group from which the certification sample would  be drawn because of the data showing a high level of noncompliance on the  residency criterion for these taxpayers. Finally, all nonparents who are not  shown in the FCR to be the custodian would go into the group from which  taxpayers would be selected for residency certification, also due to  information showing nonparents to be among the less compliant taxpayers  on the residency criterion.

Since both residency and  relationship requirements have to be met, if taxpayers fail certification on  residency there would be no need to test on relationship. Consequently,  officials gave a higher priority for testing residency certification.", "Second, IRS has changed the start date of the test twice.  Originally, IRS  planned to start the test in July 2003, but postponed implementation until  mid-August.  As we were finalizing this report, IRS announced in August  that it now plans to begin the test in December 2003, in conjunction with  the 2004 tax filing season. (Appendix IV shows key milestones from 2002  through 2005.) According to IRS officials and documents, implementation  was postponed from July to August to allow time to conduct focus group  testing, request and obtain public comments during a 30-day period, and  make changes to the program as a result of those efforts. Thereafter, IRS  postponed implementation a second time from August to December to  ensure (1) taxpayers have better access to tax practitioners since many  only operate during the filing season and (2) more time for outreach and  education.", "However, as a result of the delays, taxpayers will be providing proof of  residency documentation during the filing season and not \u201cprecertifying\u201d  before the filing season as originally envisioned. This change is important  and creates additional challenges for both IRS and taxpayers, as follows:   Taxpayers will no longer have the opportunity to provide proof of  qualifying child residency, correspond with IRS in advance of the filing  season, and resolve any potential issues before filing their tax returns.   Because all correspondence will take place during the filing season,  selected taxpayers could experience a delay in receiving the EIC portion  of any refund, if the EIC portion is frozen because of any problems until  certification is successfully completed.", "IRS will no longer be able to spread out its workload and processing  may be slower since certification will occur during the filing season--- IRS\u2019s busiest time of year.", "IRS will not have the opportunity to assess taxpayers\u2019 ease or difficulty  in obtaining required documentation in advance of the filing season and  whether taxpayers would do so.  This is important because taxpayers  may be given the opportunity to certify in advance of the filing season in  future years.", "Third, IRS reduced the number of taxpayers included in the test from  45,000 to 25,000, in part, in response to comments received during the 30- day public period.  According to IRS officials, despite reducing the number  of taxpayers included in the test, the sample size should still allow IRS to  make statistically valid measurements of results in addition to helping IRS  meet its desired goals of protecting revenue and testing the process for  conducting the certification program.  In addition, the smaller sample  should help mitigate the challenge related to processing the certification  forms during the filing season."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Process for Selecting Taxpayers, What They Will Receive, and What They Will Provide to IRS Remains Basically the Same", "paragraphs": ["Despite these changes, how IRS selected taxpayers for the test, what  taxpayers will receive from IRS, and what taxpayers will be asked to  provide as proof of residency for qualifying children will remain  fundamentally the same.  IRS\u2019s process for selecting the taxpayers for the  test is shown in figure 2.  Using this process, IRS selected 25,000  taxpayers in August.  The 25,000 represents about 0.16 percent of the  approximately 16 million EIC claimants with a qualifying child in tax year  2002 and about 0.13 percent of the approximately 20 million EIC recipients  overall.", "According to agency officials, IRS will now send the 25,000 taxpayers forms  and instructions about the program in December instead of this summer.

IRS officials  say that taxpayers who are able to establish eligibility when filing their tax  return should receive their refunds more expeditiously than those who do  not.  Taxpayers selected for certification but who are not able to provide  the necessary documentation will be treated essentially the same as  taxpayers undergoing a correspondence audit.

According to IRS officials, the smaller sample size  of 25,000 is designed to allow IRS to achieve the same goals as the original  sample size, albeit to a lesser extent.", "One factor considered by IRS for the certification test was to stop as large  an amount of EIC overclaims due to ineligible qualifying children as  possible during the 2003 tax year. To determine how many taxpayers to  include in the certification test to achieve this goal, officials said they  determined the maximum number of staff that could be assigned to and  adequately supported by the planned central unit in Kansas City that would  be responsible for the certification program. Based on the maximum  number of staff that could be assigned and assumptions about how many  cases staff could handle, IRS calculated that 45,000 taxpayers could be  included in the test. IRS estimated that $114.5 million in protected revenues  could be realized from including 45,000 taxpayers in the test.  Based on the  revised sample size of 25,000, IRS now estimates that $63.6 million in  protected revenues could be realized.", "A second factor considered was to have a large enough sample to support  analyses of whether the test succeeds. For instance, IRS is interested in  how many taxpayers provide the information needed for IRS to determine  qualifying child eligibility, whether taxpayers in the sample population who  are actually qualified to claim the EIC do not do so with their 2003 tax  return and why, and whether taxpayers found the certification process  burdensome. IRS\u2019s draft plan for evaluating the certification test notes that  the original 45,000 sample size was much larger than needed to obtain  statistically valid measures of test results.  The draft plan indicated that a  sample size of about 3,600 taxpayers, which would have provided an  estimate at 95 percent confidence levels plus or minus 5 percent, was the  number of taxpayers needed for IRS to determine qualifying child  eligibility.  According to the draft plan, the 45,000 sample size would allow  very precise estimates for the population as a whole and should provide  statistically valid information about sub-sets of claimants.  Despite the  reduction to 25,000, IRS officials still believe that this sample size will allow  for precise estimates for the universe as a whole and smaller subsets as  well.", "Finally, a third factor in selecting both the 45,000 and 25,000 sample sizes  was to have a large enough sample to test the processes and systems that  would be required if IRS were to expand certification in the coming year.  IRS had been preparing to work on approximately 25,000 certification  cases during the filing season under its original plan for 45,000 taxpayers.   It based the 25,000 on worst case assumptions about how many of the  45,000 would not opt to submit proof of eligibility in advance of the filing  season and, instead, would have submitted their documentation during the  filing season.  In addition, for this goal, the draft plan preceded IRS\u2019s  current thinking that the certification program likely will not be expanded  as rapidly next year, if expanded at all. However, according to IRS officials,  based on the number of cases IRS estimates can be worked on and what it  plans to achieve under this goal, the 25,000 sample size is appropriate to  help test the systems and processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future Expansion of Certification Program Depends on Test Results", "paragraphs": ["Although IRS has consistently referred to the certification effort as a test,  officials recently have stressed this point.

IRS officials told us that it is unlikely that the certification  program will be expanded to cover 2 million claimants in the summer of  2004, as originally anticipated.  Instead, IRS officials plan to assess the  program\u2019s overall effectiveness and make any necessary modifications  before expanding it to additional EIC claimants in the future. Thus,  particularly in light of IRS\u2019s most recent announcement and according to  IRS officials, the program may be expanded more slowly, if at all,  depending upon the evaluation results.

The purpose of these meetings was to discuss the EIC  certification proposal and share the drafts of the two new certification tax  forms\u2014Form 8836, \u201cQualifying Children Residency Statement,\u201d and Form  8856, \u201cQualifying Child Relationship Statement.\u201d Officials told us they  received comments from these groups of stakeholders and revised and  improved the forms based on the feedback received. For example, for the  residency form IRS added a list of community-based organizations and a  list of acceptable third parties from which IRS would accept affidavits.", "After incorporating the recommendations from these informal meetings,  officials said they felt comfortable with testing the Form 8836, its  instructions, and the accompanying letter in other ways, including focus  groups, one-on-one interviews, and a 30-day public comment period.", "In June 2003, a contractor conducted nine focus groups, five with taxpayers  who claimed EIC in tax year 2002, and four with tax preparers who had  prepared returns for taxpayers claiming EIC. In addition to the focus  groups, the contractor also conducted nine one-on-one interviews with a  cross section of the third parties listed on Part IV of the Form 8836 (the  participants were landlords, employers, and child care providers). The goal  of the testing was to determine whether individuals understood the  documents and thought they could obtain the requested supporting  documents and whether the suggested third parties would be willing to sign  the affidavit.", "The focus groups and interviews were held in Philadelphia, Chicago,  Dallas, and Los Angeles. These cities were selected because of their high  EIC population. The participants were selected using screening guidelines  developed by IRS in conjunction with the contractor. Taxpayers were  selected on the basis that they claimed the EIC for tax year 2002 with a  qualifying child. Similarly, preparers were selected on the basis that they  worked as a tax preparer on federal tax returns for 2002 and prepared tax  returns for clients claiming EIC with a qualifying child. Those selected for  one-on-one interviews represented a cross section of the types of  individuals IRS deemed credible to provide affidavit information about the  EIC claimant.

Specifically,  one form used for recertification was of questionable value to IRS and  another form was potentially confusing to taxpayers;  taxpayers were asked to submit information that was difficult for them  to obtain or inconsistent with what many IRS examiners considered  acceptable; and  IRS examiners\u2019 inconsistent assessment of documentation submitted by  taxpayers could result in different recertification decisions for  taxpayers in similar circumstances.", "IRS has taken steps to deal with all of these concerns in designing the  certification process. Regarding the problems with recertification forms,  the form that was of questionable value to IRS, which was essentially a  means for taxpayers to tell IRS that they wished to be considered for  recertification, is not applicable to the certification program. The other  recertification form told taxpayers what they had to submit to establish  their eligibility for the EIC. We found that this form could confuse  taxpayers into believing they had to show that a qualifying child was also  their dependent, a criterion not applicable to EIC eligibility. We also found  that the form provided insufficient guidance to taxpayers on what  information they needed to provide to prove that qualifying children met  the EIC eligibility requirements. We made several recommendations,  including that IRS should clarify taxpayers do not need to demonstrate that  qualifying children are also dependents, help taxpayers better understand  what documentation they need to provide to establish their relationship  with any qualifying children, eliminate a requirement that statements from  child care providers be notarized, and encourage taxpayers to submit more  than one type of documentation.", "Regarding our concerns about taxpayers who were recertifying being  asked to submit documentation that was difficult for them to obtain and  that tax examiners did not all accept, we found, for example, that EIC  taxpayers\u2019 living arrangements could make providing various documents  difficult. We also found taxpayers did not always understand that school  records were for a calendar year and therefore needed to cover the spring  and fall of separate school years. We also found situations in which IRS  examiners would not accept a document even though the recertification  form listed the document as being acceptable. This concern overlapped  with our finding that IRS examiners\u2019 were inconsistent in their assessment  of whether documentation provided by the taxpayers was sufficient to  establish their qualifications for the EIC.", "Regarding our concerns about inconsistent documentation, IRS again took  actions intended to deal with our concerns in developing the certification  program.

Although IRS did not, as we recommended, create a new form to be used by  taxpayers when seeking school records, it did follow our alternative  recommendation that IRS clearly remind taxpayers that they need records  for part of 2 school years. The information is included in the certification  form\u2019s instructions, which contain an example where a taxpayer must  provide records from 2 school years. Finally, by centralizing the EIC  certification processing in one location\u2014Kansas City\u2014and providing  training to those who will be involved, IRS is seeking to ensure a higher  level of consistency in how tax examiners judge whether taxpayers  adequately establish that qualifying children meet the residency criterion  for EIC.", "Whether the manner in which IRS took our recertification  recommendations into account when designing the certification program  will be successful will not be known until IRS evaluates the certification  test."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Qualifying Child Certification Program Developed to Improve Compliance While Considering Taxpayers\u2019 Burden, but Plan for Evaluating Test Is Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["The certification program appears to be adequately developed to  potentially improve EIC compliance with consideration for minimizing  taxpayer burden so that testing should proceed, particularly in light of IRS\u2019s  recent announcement further delaying the program\u2019s start and reducing the  sample size.

To deal with errors attributable to claiming  nonqualifying children, the task force proposed a program for certifying the  eligibility for qualifying children and envisioned targeting taxpayers most  likely to make those errors. In contrast, other benefit programs that we  reviewed generally require all applicants to provide documentation before  receiving assistance. For example, to receive Supplemental Security  Income, an individual must visit a Social Security office, meet with a  representative, and provide documentation including birth certificates and  payroll information.  The Social Security Administration then matches this  information to determine eligibility in advance of benefits being received.

IRS  sought feedback from focus groups and stakeholders on various aspects  of the certification test and the draft letter, form, and instruction  proposed for the residency test, such as whether taxpayers will be able  to obtain and provide documents within the time available, and made  some changes to the proposed form due to that feedback. As previously  described, IRS held focus groups with taxpayers, paid tax preparers, and  other parties to obtain feedback on certification. Officials also  interviewed a small number of third parties who would be called upon  to provide requested documents. IRS also held a 30-day open period to  receive comments from any interested party and expects to revise  certification materials due to comments received.

IRS officials  do not know whether or if they will test certification of relationships in  the future. Various external stakeholders had expressed concerns about  whether taxpayers would be able to provide the type of documents,  such as marriage and birth certificates, which IRS had planned to  request to document relationships to qualifying children on time. Also,  IRS officials said that the relationship portion of the program was  dropped for other reasons, including that (1) studies that have shown  relationship requirements to be less of a compliance issue than  residency and (2) taxpayers found to be noncompliant because of  relationship requirements often were also noncompliant due to  residency errors.

Officials recognize that the draft plan  needs to be further developed and the importance of doing so quickly.

The plan lists data that are to be gathered throughout the  certification program to answer this question.", "The threshold question is part of what must be included in determining  whether certification for residency helps lower EIC overclaims, but  additional information is needed. Although not tying methodologies or  planned data collection specifically to whether certification lowers the EIC  overclaim rate, the draft plan has a combination of approaches that should  contribute to answering this question. For example, the draft plan  identified data that IRS would gather throughout the test on how many  taxpayers in the test sample certify or fail to do so in advance of the filing  season as well as how many prove that children meet the EIC residency  test during the filing season.", "The extent to which certification may reduce overclaims due to qualifying  children not meeting the residency requirement, however, will depend  significantly on why some taxpayers will not attempt to certify and why  some will fail to claim the EIC, or as much EIC, for tax year 2003 as they  did for 2002. The draft plan takes into account that some taxpayers may  receive the certification materials, determine that a child does not meet the  residency test, and therefore not attempt to certify and not claim the EIC  with their 2003 tax return or claim EIC on another basis. IRS expects to use  available data to help assess whether the taxpayer had a filing requirement  and whether the taxpayer may have been eligible to claim the EIC (e.g., did  the taxpayer\u2019s income fall within the appropriate range?). In addition, the  draft plan proposes that IRS use a contractor or another third party to  gather information from taxpayers about why they did not claim the EIC. A  subsequent document cites ideas for the types of questions that could be  asked.", "Regarding the burden certification imposes on taxpayers who participate,  the plan is not organized to show how this will be evaluated, but it  recognizes that participants\u2019 burden should be evaluated. For example, the  data IRS plans to collect throughout the process will have some utility in  answering this question. IRS will keep track of the number of  communications back and forth between IRS and the taxpayer before a tax  examiner makes a final certification decision. IRS\u2019s plan also recognizes  that some information on burden will need to be collected directly from  taxpayers. The plan includes a general description of a potential opinion  survey that would gather burden-related information from certification  participants. Little or no detail is provided on how taxpayers would be  selected for such a survey, what types of questions would be asked, and  when the survey would be done; however, some of this information is  shown in a subsequent draft document. Because taxpayers will not have  completed their certification experience until sometime next filing season,  IRS has some time to decide whether to do such a survey and how to define  its parameters.", "Regarding the objective of maintaining the EIC\u2019s relatively high  participation rate, the draft plan proposes to obtain information from those  taxpayers who are asked to certify, do not, and then fail to claim the EIC.  The plan proposes to use a contractor or other third party to gather  information from these taxpayers about why they did not claim the EIC.  The plan does not amply describe how and when final decisions would be  made about selecting contractors or another third party to do this, when  the contractor would contact taxpayers, or what data they would attempt  to obtain from the taxpayers. Because the population IRS will need to  contact for these surveys will not be known until during and after the  spring of 2004, IRS has a number of months to further develop and  implement an approach.", "Recognizing that its plans need to be further developed, IRS officials have  continued to explore how the evaluation will be done.  For example,  officials have drafted ideas for the type of survey questions a contractor or  other party would ask of EIC taxpayers to help IRS assess why taxpayers  take, or do not take, various actions (such as why they may stop claiming  the EIC after being asked to certify eligibility) and to assess taxpayers\u2019  experiences under the certification program, including the burdens they  experience.  In addition, officials have begun identifying potential  contractors who would perform the surveys and considering contracting  options.  According to IRS officials and documents, some discussions have  been held with potential contractors to gain a better understanding of ways  to test the survey instruments, techniques available to ensure the best  possible response rate, and the number of taxpayers needing to be  contacted to have useful results.", "Finally, because IRS would like to undertake some version of the qualifying  child program next year, possibly including certification during the latter  part of 2004, the timely production of evaluative data for this year\u2019s test will  be critical for supporting decisions about what form future efforts will  take. IRS is aware of the tight schedule. Officials note that while they will  not have complete information on which to base some decisions about  whether and how to continue with implementation in 2004 before those  decisions must be made, they expect to have preliminary data in a timely  fashion. For example, IRS will not be able to completely answer whether,  and if so, why, taxpayers who are legitimately qualified to receive the EIC  do not claim it when they file their 2003 tax return until the end of the 2003  tax filing season, or later if taxpayers request a filing extension. IRS does  expect that its contractor will have contacted many, if not most, of the  taxpayers who file returns before the end of the filing season and do not  claim EIC. Thus, IRS expects to know during the fall of 2004 why many  taxpayers in the certification test stop claiming the EIC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Implementation Issues Not Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["We did not evaluate some implementation issues because they were  outside the scope of our review, still under development, or the Treasury  Inspector General for Tax Administration had audits planned in these  areas. Nonetheless, implementation issues could affect whether IRS is able  to fully implement the certification test and ultimately improve  compliance. We did not assess (1) whether IRS assigned an appropriate  number of staff to assist taxpayers with questions and process the forms  and documents relating to certification, (2) the adequacy of training  materials for staff or the procedures put in place to help examiners  consistently accept or decline taxpayers\u2019 supporting documentation,  (3) the design or reliability of the databases that will be used to capture and  evaluate program information, and (4) supporting tools, which examiners  will use to do their job.", "IRS has developed broad plans for processing the certification workload.  Officials identified about 30 different offices that will be affected by the  new certification program. As a key part of its processing strategy, IRS  plans to dedicate employees at its Kansas City campus to process cases,  answer a special toll-free number, and make updates to a certification  database based on responses from the test of the 25,000 taxpayers. The  Kansas City site will have about 180 staff, the bulk of whom will come on- board between September and December 2003.

In addition, with the recent  program changes announced in August, it appears that IRS is taking even  more steps to be mindful of these concerns.  Although certification during  the 2004 filing season gives IRS somewhat more time to modify the forms  and take other actions to potentially further reduce the burden on  taxpayers subject to the test, it also creates new challenges for IRS.  The  test will no longer be a direct test of the original concept of certifying  taxpayer eligibility in advance of the filing season.  Instead, testing will  occur during the filing season\u2014IRS\u2019s busiest time of year\u2014and gives IRS  only indirect evidence on how well certification may work before the filing  season as originally envisioned.  Further, because IRS currently plans for  taxpayers to have to successfully provide proof of eligibility when they file  their individual income tax return or have a refund frozen until they do, a  greater portion of the taxpayers chosen for the test may have their refunds  delayed than if certification had been done before the filing season.  Finally,  like virtually all aspects of the qualifying child certification program, IRS\u2019s  future plans have yet to be determined and are largely dependent of the  results and subsequent evaluations of this test.", "For various reasons, we did not review in detail some implementation  issues, such as staffing and procedures for handling taxpayer responses,  which could affect whether IRS is able to successfully implement the  certification test. Thus, our opinion on whether IRS is ready to proceed is  based only on whether it has adequately developed the test to prevent  unreasonable burden and to improve compliance.", "Although the balance IRS has struck supports proceeding with the test,  IRS\u2019s plan for evaluating the certification program test is incomplete.  IRS  recognizes the need to evaluate the test and is developing its plan to do so.  For some key test objectives, IRS has preliminarily identified some data  that it believes must be collected to determine whether certification\u2019s  objectives are achieved and has broadly identified when and how that  information will be collected.  Because the data are related to taxpayers\u2019  actions that will occur later this year or next spring, IRS appears to have  some time to finalize its evaluation plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["Given that the qualifying child certification program is a key part of IRS\u2019s  plans for reducing EIC overclaims and that certification is intended to help  reduce overclaims while minimizing the burden on taxpayers and  maintaining the EIC\u2019s participation rate, the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue should, to the extent possible, accelerate development of the  evaluation plan for the test. The plan should demonstrate how each of the  certification\u2019s objectives will be evaluated, including milestones for such  critical steps as defining the specific data that will be collected, who will  collect the data, and how the data will be analyzed in time to support  decisions about the future of the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["While not explicitly agreeing with our recommendation, in his September  22, 2003, letter, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue said that IRS would  be including the components we suggested in their evaluation plan and said  that IRS is working to incorporate these components well before the  certification test begins.

In the meantime, IRS is using its  Strategic Planning and Performance Management process to prioritize  compliance issues.", "The compliance data that IRS has available for some taxpayer groups and  tax items are largely based on the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement  Program (TCMP), which was last conducted in 1988. However, these data  cannot be compared to the EIC overclaim or error rates, in part because  these data are 15 or more years old and reliable inferences cannot be drawn  because much of the tax system and the economy have changed during that  time. In addition, the methods used to calculate compliance rates for TCMP  are different than those used to calculate EIC.", "In late 2002, IRS began implementing its new NRP, a detailed study of  individual taxpayers\u2019 compliance. As part of NRP, IRS has identified a  random sample of approximately 47,000 returns from tax year 2001 and is  in the process of verifying the information on the returns through reviews  of IRS and third-party data. Where necessary to confirm the accuracy of  taxpayer-reported information, IRS is conducting either correspondence or  face-to-face examinations. IRS intends to conduct additional NRP reviews  of additional types of taxpayers, such as small corporations, and use the  NRP periodically to measure compliance of individual taxpayers.", "The NRP sample of 47,000 returns includes about 7,300 EIC returns. These  EIC returns are subject to the same processes as the other returns in the  sample, and will include a review of the taxpayers\u2019 eligibility for the EIC. In  order to determine whether the NRP review of these returns will yield  results methodologically similar to those of the 1999 EIC compliance study,  IRS is also comparing the results of the 1999 compliance study with NRP by  putting a sample of returns from the 1999 study through NRP processes  (not including examinations). According to IRS officials, this should allow  them to see the impact of the methodological differences between the  compliance study and NRP review.  IRS expects the results of the  comparison study by September 2003. IRS plans to have preliminary NRP  results in May 2004 and final results in November 2004.", "Until better compliance measurement data are available, IRS\u2019s  organizational divisions use the Strategic Planning Budgeting and  Performance Management process to prioritize the compliance problems  IRS faces. Through this process, IRS says that it (1) identifies and explores  critical trends, issues, and problems, (2) develops operational priorities  and improvement projects to address existing or emerging problems,   (3) explores drivers of program resources in order to develop resource  allocation targets for carrying out the proposed strategies, and (4) enables  division commissioners and the senior leadership teams to prioritize the  strategies and projects and determine the resource requirements to apply  to each strategy, operational priority, and improvement project.", "Based on managers\u2019 judgments made during this process, the Small  Business/Self Employed (SB/SE) operating division, for example, identified  its top six compliance priorities for fiscal year 2003 and 2004:  high income nonfilers (income greater than $100,000),  abusive offshore financial transactions,  promoter investigations (those selling tax schemes to others),  abusive tax avoidance transactions,  high income taxpayers (income greater than $1 million), and  returns with a high probability of unreported income.", "SB/SE, which conducts few examinations of EIC claims, did not consider  EIC in this prioritization exercise since EIC has its own dedicated  appropriation. Because IRS used different means to identify and prioritize  these potentially noncompliant taxpayer groups, their identification as  SB/SE priorities does not mean their noncompliance rate is comparable to  noncompliance rates established for EIC or rates, which will be determined  through the current or future NRPs or other EIC compliance studies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Overclaim Rates, Administrative Costs, and Eligibility Verification Processes of Benefit Programs", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the data we complied on IRS\u2019s EIC and qualifying child  certification program, we also compiled overclaim rate and administrative  cost data, as well as information on the eligibility verification processes, for  nine other federal or state benefit programs.

To determine the current EIC error rates and whether any studies had been  done on the impact of recent statutory changes on error rates, we reviewed  IRS\u2019s most recent compliance study, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration reports and our previous reports, and interviewed IRS  officials. In addition, we reviewed the legislative history of recent statutory  changes\u2014effective since 1999\u2014that pertained to EIC. We analyzed these  data and IRS and Treasury reports to determine whether an analysis on the  impact of the legislative changes on EIC error or overclaim rates had been  conducted. To determine the range of alternatives considered by the task  force, we reviewed documents and interviewed members of the EIC task  force. To determine the correlation between overall EIC error rates, filing  status, and gender, we interviewed officials from Research, Analysis, and  Statistics and analyzed their data, and reviewed the EIC task force reports  and Treasury\u2019s past compliance studies.", "The second objective included, in order, our response to questions one,  five, two, and seven.

We reviewed plans for the certification  program, such as IRS\u2019s Concept of Operations and the 2004 Increment  Evaluation Plan, in conjunction with IRS\u2019s current process for evaluating  EIC eligibility. To calculate the percentage of EIC claimants subject to  certification in 2004, we divided the planned sample size by the number of  EIC claimants with qualifying children. To obtain information on IRS\u2019s  testing of letters, forms, and documents for understandability, we observed  the focus group testing that IRS conducted in Dallas, Tex., with EIC  taxpayers, tax preparers, and other parties to understand how IRS assured  itself that such persons understood the forms and thought they could  obtain the required documentation. For whether items of concern we  found within the recertification program could have similar concerns in the  new initiative, we analyzed our prior reports on IRS\u2019s recertification  program and IRS\u2019s progress in implementing our recommendations, then  we compared our analysis to the certification plans.", "The third objective includes, in order, our responses to questions eight and  three. To make our determination as to whether the program had been  adequately developed to improve compliance with minimal burden to  taxpayers, we asked IRS officials to describe and provide documentation to  support the steps they took to assure that the program was adequately  developed. This included interviews and a high-level review of key steps  and decisions found in various documents, such as the EIC task force  reports, the Concept of Operations, staffing plans, training materials, and  the evaluation plan. To determine the potential extent of the burden on  taxpayers, we reviewed reports from outside groups that analyze programs  and policies for low-income groups. We obtained the opinions of IRS  officials and discussed those of outside stakeholders, such as  representatives from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, low income taxpayer  clinics, and large tax preparation organizations, that IRS had met with  about any problems taxpayers might have in complying with the  documentation requirements to establish EIC eligibility.
