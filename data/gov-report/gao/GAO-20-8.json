These challenges included establishing procedures for risk-based screenings, using federal databases and collecting required information, and screening an increased volume of providers. Due in part to these challenges, officials from five of the seven selected states told GAO they had not implemented certain requirements. For example, one state plans to launch its new information technology system, which automates screenings, before it will enroll providers under contract with managed care organizations, as required under these laws.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the federal agency that oversees Medicaid\u2014supports states' implementation of new requirements with tailored optional consultations, such as CMS contractor site visits that examine the extent of states' implementation. Yet, because these are optional, states that need support might not participate, and CMS would not have information on those states. CMS uses other methods to oversee states' compliance, such as, the Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) process for estimating improper payments, and focused program integrity reviews.", "PERM. This process assesses states' compliance with provider screening and enrollment requirements, but does not assess compliance for all providers and all requirements, and occurs once every 3 years.", "Focused program integrity reviews.

That year, estimated improper  payments in Medicaid were $36.2 billion, or nearly 10 percent of federal Medicaid expenditures. At the federal level, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human  Services, is responsible for overseeing states\u2019 administration of Medicaid,  including their efforts to screen and enroll providers.

In  2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) included  provisions requiring CMS to establish procedures for screening and  enrolling providers according to their risk for fraud, waste, and abuse, as  well as activities that must or may be included in these procedures\u2014such  as verifying provider licensure, conducting checks in federal databases to  identify providers who have been excluded from participating in federal  programs, and conducting on-site visits to provider practices. PPACA  also included provisions expanding provider enrollment; for example, by  requiring states to enroll providers who only order and refer services for  beneficiaries. The year following enactment of these changes, CMS  issued regulations establishing the screening and enrollment  requirements that states must perform to enroll providers. In 2016, the  21st Century Cures Act included provisions that further expanded  provider enrollment requirements. Under these requirements, states  must screen and enroll all Medicaid managed care providers into their  programs by January 1, 2018.

CMS has a  role overseeing states\u2019 compliance with federal requirements. CMS\u2019s  oversight activities include measuring improper payments in the Medicaid  program, and conducting focused program integrity and desk reviews.  Other federal and state entities also have a role in oversight of the  Medicaid program. For example, state auditors\u2014state agencies that  typically conduct the annual single state audit of federal programs\u2014may  also conduct program integrity reviews and identify Medicaid improper  payments.

Providers also  include provider organizations\u2014such as hospitals, group practices, and  skilled nursing facilities\u2014and providers and suppliers of medical  equipment or goods.", "All providers must be screened when they (1) initially apply for and submit  an application, and (2) upon reenrollment in a state\u2019s Medicaid program.  Further, states must screen all providers at least once every 5 years to  revalidate their enrollment. States may rely on the results of providers\u2019  screenings performed by the Medicare program or another state\u2019s  Medicaid program. States may also choose to delegate screening  activities to vendors that screen providers on the states\u2019 behalf or MCOs.  If a state chooses to delegate screening activities, it must ensure that the  screenings are conducted in accordance with the Medicaid program  requirements.", "States must also collect certain information from providers to enroll them  into their Medicaid programs, such as their Social Security numbers,  dates of birth, and National Provider Identifiers, if applicable. States  must also collect disclosure information for owners, managing employees,  and others with controlling interests in provider organizations meeting  certain criteria. For example, states must collect disclosure information for  those with direct or indirect ownership totaling 5 percent or more, or who  are agents or managing employees of a provider organization. These  owners and others with controlling interests who are subject to disclosure  requirements must undergo certain required screening activities, such as  federal database checks, and states must perform these screening  activities to enroll the provider organization.", "Federal regulations require states to perform several screening activities  prior to enrolling providers. The provider\u2019s categorical risk level for fraud,  waste, and abuse determine the required screening activities. The  screening activities may include conducting checks in federal databases;  verifying licensure; and performing site visits and fingerprint-based  background checks.

To incorporate database checks, site visits,  fingerprint-based background checks, and other risk-based screening  activities into state screening procedures; state Medicaid officials said  they needed financial resources, leadership support, and time.  Specifically, officials from the selected states told us they used one of the  following three approaches to build capacity to implement the screening  and enrollment requirements.  1.  Developing new information technology systems. Officials from  two of the seven selected states told us they developed new state  information technology systems that automated screening and  enrollment activities. For example, officials from one state told us they  spent $5.9 million from 2015 through 2018 to develop a new provider  screening and enrollment system that included an online provider  application portal and automated screening activities, such as  conducting database checks and flagging high-risk providers for site  visits and fingerprint-based background checks. According to state  officials, this new system helped the state implement provider  screening and enrollment requirements, yielding efficiencies by  allowing staff to focus on analyzing provider screening results rather  than clarifying data entry errors and manually checking each  database. (See fig. 2.)  2.  Contracting with vendors. Officials from four other selected states  told us they initiated or modified existing contracts with vendors to  screen new provider applications and conduct revalidations on their  behalf. For example, officials from one state told us their contract with  a vendor resulted in screening and enrolling about 10,000 providers in  2018, more than five times the number the state had processed in the  previous year. Another state used a vendor to revalidate more than  9,000 providers in 2016; about 12 percent of the state\u2019s enrolled  provider population.  3.  Modifying existing procedures. Officials from our seventh selected  state told us that they modified their existing state information  technology system and procedures to manually screen and enroll  providers.

For example, one state told us that some providers  have been hesitant to disclose Social Security numbers and their date of  birth on applications, as well as other information that states are required  to collect for enrollment. In response, the state has offered provider  education on the requirements to facilitate collecting this information.  State Medicaid officials also noted that their agencies worked with CMS,  state legislatures, and state law enforcement agencies to implement  fingerprint-based background check requirements to, for example, collect  fingerprints and check them against Federal Bureau of Investigation  records.

CMS officials  acknowledged the three limitations reported by state officials:  1.  Time for receiving results. The results from the data compare  service were not timely enough to help states with screening newly  enrolling providers. Officials from one state explained that some  provider information may become outdated by the time the results are  received 6 to 8 weeks later, which makes the service less useful than  it could be.  2.  Different Medicare and Medicaid address entries. The data  compare service\u2019s addresses reflected Medicare practice or billing  locations that may be different from providers\u2019 Medicaid addresses.  Because these addresses do not match, they could not be relied upon  for updating the state\u2019s provider records or to help states conduct site  visits required for screening and enrolling moderate- and high-risk  providers.  3.  Additional burden for manual enrollment systems. Officials from  two selected states told us that manually extracting provider data from  their system\u2014including names, addresses, Social Security numbers,  and National Provider Identifiers\u2014and manually re-entering the  results from CMS for each provider into their system was burdensome  and resource-intensive, leading one of these states to stop using the  service.", "CMS offers guidance and other supports to states on a regular and  periodic basis, including monthly calls with states, and assigning states to  a CMS contact (see sidebar). These services also assist states with  implementing the Medicaid provider screening and enrollment  requirements. Officials from all of our selected states told us the guidance  and other supports were helpful. According to CMS officials, the extent to  which states participate in these other supports varies, because the level  of participation is optional. CMS officials also told us that they use these  other supports, including monthly calls and ad hoc emails, to discuss  progress and keep a record of information provided; however, the agency  does not revisit or require corrective actions unless the state initiates it.", "The PERM and other methods CMS uses to oversee states\u2019 efforts to  screen and enroll Medicaid providers do not provide CMS with  comprehensive and timely information on states\u2019 compliance with the  requirements. Some methods do not fully track whether states have  enrolled all types of providers and are in compliance with all the  requirements; other program integrity oversight methods have not been  conducted on all states. Further, these methods do not ensure timely  follow-up to address identified concerns.", "The PERM\u2019s components\u2014FFS, managed care, and beneficiary eligibility  determinations\u2014measure improper payments across all states; as  previously noted, the FFS component is the only component CMS uses to  assess states\u2019 compliance with provider screening and enrollment  requirements. However, using the PERM to oversee states\u2019 compliance  with the requirements has limitations, including the following:", "The PERM does not examine whether providers under contract with  MCOs are appropriately screened and enrolled. The PERM assesses  states\u2019 compliance with the provider screening and enrollment  requirements by reviewing provider information for claims paid under  FFS; it does not review such information for services financed under  managed care.", "Currently, the PERM does not examine ownership disclosure and  certain other provider screening and enrollment requirements. CMS  officials told us the agency plans to assess the feasibility of including  ownership disclosure requirements in the PERM over the next 3  years.", "The PERM does not ensure that CMS identifies areas of non- compliance in a timely manner. CMS conducts the PERM in each  state every 3 years, and states develop corrective action plans in  response to findings from the PERM; thus, it may be years before  CMS identifies\u2014and states resolve\u2014areas of non-compliance with  the provider screening and enrollment requirements. (See fig. 6.)", "Although CMS follows up annually with states regarding their corrective  action plans, it does not fully assess states\u2019 progress toward  implementing their plans until the next PERM cycle, which is 3 years later.  Further, while four of our selected states had implemented all their  corrective action plans regarding provider screening and enrollment  requirements within 1 year of PERM findings, the other three states had  not fully implemented their plans about 2 years after PERM findings. CMS  officials emphasized that developing and tracking corrective action plans  was a collaborative process and that states may change corrective action  plans in response to competing priorities.", "CMS uses other methods to oversee states\u2019 compliance with the provider  screening and enrollment requirements\u2014focused program integrity  reviews and desk reviews\u2014that are not optional and have resulted in  findings. However, these methods do not provide the agency with  comprehensive and timely information on states\u2019 compliance with the  requirements. Specifically, these methods have not been conducted in all  states, performed in a timely manner, or included a systematic review of  states\u2019 compliance with all the provider screening and enrollment  requirements. For example:", "Focused program integrity reviews. CMS has not conducted  focused program integrity reviews examining specific areas in  Medicaid for all states. Most of the reviews performed did not include  a comprehensive or timely examination of states\u2019 compliance with  provider screening and enrollment requirements. Overall, CMS has  conducted 42 focused program integrity reviews in fiscal years 2014  through 2018 in 39 states. Among these reviews, nine of the 42  focused program integrity reviews examined states\u2019 compliance with  provider screening and enrollment requirements, the last of which was  completed in fiscal year 2015. CMS also conducted focused program  integrity reviews on managed care for 34 of the 41 states with  managed care expenditures in fiscal year 2017. However, nearly all of  these reviews (33) were conducted prior to January 2018 when states  were required to screen and enroll all managed care providers, as  required by the 21st Century Cures Act. CMS also conducted seven  focused reviews examining personal care services in seven states\u2014 which include examining screening and enrollment requirements for  providers of these services.", "Desk reviews. Off-site desk reviews that examine specific aspects of  states\u2019 program integrity activities do not include a comprehensive or  timely examination of states\u2019 compliance with the provider screening  and enrollment requirements. CMS has conducted desk reviews  examining activities related to provider screening and enrollment,  such as corrective actions states have taken in response to PERM  findings. However, desk reviews on corrective action plans are limited  to examining findings on provider screening and enrollment identified  during the PERM and are not conducted until 3 years after the PERM  has occurred. For example, CMS told us that in 2018 the agency  conducted desk reviews on the 17 states that underwent the PERM in  fiscal year 2015. CMS also conducted 35 desk reviews on potential  payments to terminated providers since fiscal year 2014.", "The PERM and CMS\u2019s other oversight methods do not provide CMS with  sufficient or timely information about states\u2019 screening and enrollment  procedures for all Medicaid provider types, and most states with managed  care expenditures have not undergone a managed care-focused program  integrity review since the 21st Century Cures Act screening and  enrollment provisions went into effect. The lack of complete information  on whether states are screening and enrolling all providers according to  requirements is inconsistent with federal internal controls on assessing  risk, which note that management should consider the potential for fraud  when identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks. Without complete  information, CMS cannot ensure that only eligible providers are  participating in the Medicaid program, leaving the program vulnerable to  improper payments.", "Further, CMS does not obtain timely information on all states\u2019 actions to  address areas of non-compliance or track progress toward addressing  these areas. The length of the PERM cycle\u20143 years\u2014and time for  performing corrective actions to address PERM findings, limits CMS\u2019s  awareness of states\u2019 progress, or lack thereof, toward implementing  requirements. As a result, CMS lacks assurance that states are  addressing areas of non-compliance or if such actions are being taken in  a timely manner. This is inconsistent with federal internal controls on  monitoring, which note that management should remediate deficiencies in  the internal control system on a timely basis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CMS has a range of activities that provide the agency with some  knowledge of states\u2019 implementation of required provider screening and  enrollment under PPACA and the 21st Century Cures Act; however, the  agency\u2019s oversight activities are not designed to systematically examine  compliance with all the requirements for all providers in a timely manner.  Notably, the PERM does not examine managed care providers, and  CMS\u2019s assessment of compliance and monitoring of corrective actions  are not timely, because they are based on the 3-year PERM cycle. Also,  focused program integrity reviews\u2014which may examine states\u2019 oversight  of MCOs and their compliance with provider screening and enrollment  requirements for providers participating in managed care\u2014have not been  conducted on all states.", "The one activity that can provide CMS and states with a complete and  timely assessment of states\u2019 implementation with provider screening and  enrollment requirements is optional. While CMS does some tracking of  state-reported information on the status of states\u2019 implementation of the  requirements, this oversight does not include states that have not availed  themselves of the support CMS provides. Since states are not required to  participate in these optional consultations, the states that may face the  greatest challenges with implementing the provider screening and  enrollment requirements might not volunteer to participate in the  consultations.
