It significantly increased program funding and the number of Foreign Service officers in South Asia and the Near East. It also launched new initiatives targeting broader, younger audiences--particularly in predominantly Muslim countries--and plans to continue them in the future. After September 11, State acknowledged the lack of, and the need for, a comprehensive strategy that integrates all of its diverse public diplomacy activities. Such a strategy is still in the development stage. The absence of an integrated strategy could impede State's ability to direct its multifaceted efforts toward concrete and measurable progress. Furthermore, an interagency public diplomacy strategy has not been completed that would help State and other federal agencies convey consistent messages and achieve mutually reinforcing benefits overseas. State is not systematically and comprehensively measuring progress toward its public diplomacy goals. Its overseas performance measurement efforts focus on anecdotal evidence and program outputs, rather than indicate progress in changing foreign publics' understanding and opinions of the United States. State's efforts face significant challenges, including insufficient time and staff to conduct public diplomacy tasks. Public affairs officers responding to our survey said that burdensome administrative and budgetary processes divert their attention from public diplomacy programs. In addition, about 21 percent of Foreign Service officers in language-designated public diplomacy positions overseas lack sufficient foreign language skills.

Public  diplomacy is carried out through a wide range of programs that employ  person-to-person contacts; print, broadcast, and electronic media; and  other means. Traditionally, U.S. public diplomacy focused on foreign  elites\u2014current and future overseas opinion leaders, agenda-setters, and  decision makers.

Private sector officials from public relations  and opinion research firms and the Ad Council agreed. Common public  relations firm measurement techniques include surveys and polling to  develop baseline data, immediate follow-up research, and additional  tracking polls over a period of time to identify long-term changes. Reports  by the Council on Foreign Relations, Wilton Park,and the Defense  Science Board Task Force also emphasized the need for increased use of  foreign opinion research for public diplomacy efforts. The officials who  attended our roundtable noted that incorporating performance  measurement so pervasively into a campaign is costly. However, this cost is  considered essential to the campaign\u2019s success. The officials estimated  that, based on their experience with similar information campaigns, of  State\u2019s roughly $500 million to $600 million public diplomacy budget, $30  million to $50 million should be spent on opinion research and  performance measurement. State\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research  currently spends about $3.5 million annually on overseas opinion research.", "The director of the Office of Research in State\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and  Research said that, with additional funding, State could more regularly  monitor foreign opinion overseas. Although State conducts overseas  opinion research on foreign perceptions of the United States and its foreign  policy in all but a handful of countries, it does not have sufficient funds to  conduct more than one or two surveys in each country per year. The  director told us that, in certain high priority countries, he would like to  conduct monthly surveys to track fast-changing circumstances. Focus  group studies in high priority countries would also be helpful in providing  more in-depth analyses of attitudes. The official estimated that increased  polling and focus groups in high priority countries would require an  estimated $1.5 million in additional annual funding. State could also employ  advanced \u201cdata mining\u201d technology that would combine data collected in  State\u2019s research with that of other surveys to detect patterns that would  help researchers tie trends and shifts in opinion to specific events and  efforts. The official estimated that such technology would require a one- time investment of roughly $1 million and an ongoing annual cost of about  $75,000. State could also explore using the Internet to conduct overseas  surveys, as a complement to conventional polling efforts. The official said  that this project could be launched for as little as $200,000.", "Even the limited polling that State does conduct is not fully utilized by  public affairs officers overseas. About 46 percent of our survey  respondents reported that they rarely, if ever, receive such data. Thus, they  may not always be aware of changes in foreign audiences\u2019 attitudes toward  the United States. The Broadcasting Board of Governors also conducts  audience research efforts in a number of foreign countries that could be  useful to public affairs officers. However, in regions of the world where the  Board broadcasts its programs, more than 91 percent of our survey  respondents reported that they rarely, if ever, receive such data. State  officials told us that they provide both the State polling data and the  broadcasting audience research data to the public diplomacy office  directors in State\u2019s regional bureaus. However, it is up to each regional  bureau to review the data and ensure that it reaches the appropriate public  affairs officers overseas. State officials told us that some regional bureaus  are probably more diligent in doing so than others, and that some public  affairs officers may not even be aware that such data are available to them.  State plans to emphasize the availability of such data in new public training  courses it is developing at the Foreign Service Institute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other U.S. Government Agencies and the Private Sector Offer Strategies for Assessing Performance", "paragraphs": ["A recent GAO report on strategies for assessing U.S. government  information dissemination efforts recognized that establishing a causal link  between agency actions and the ultimate impact of such programs is  difficult. However, the report points out that by systematically identifying  the incremental outcomes expected at each step, U.S. government agencies  were able to construct a logical framework, or logic model, that  demonstrated how achieving short and intermediate outcome goals could  lead to a certain level of assurance that expected results would be realized.  For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention constructed a  logic model to gauge the reinforcing effects of media and community-based  campaigns to reduce tobacco use. Short and intermediate outcome goals  included changes in knowledge and attitudes about tobacco use, adherence  to and enforcement of no-smoking regulations, reduced smoking initiation  among young people, and increased smoking cessation among adults.  Long-term outcomes included decreased smoking, reduced exposure to  environmental tobacco smoke, and reduced tobacco-related mortality. In  State\u2019s case, short-term outcomes for public diplomacy programs could  include target audience knowledge and awareness of U.S. principles,  beliefs, and policies. Intermediate outcomes could include positive changes  in attitude toward specific U.S. policies. Long-term outcomes could include  implementation of U.S. foreign policy issues prompted by U.S. public  diplomacy programs such as educational and cultural exchanges.", "The private sector officials with whom we met agreed with our assessment  of the difficulty in establishing direct causal links between public  diplomacy programs and results. However, they noted that establishing  convincing correlations is a reasonable expectation. For example, to  measure the effectiveness of a campaign to promote the use of seat belts,  the Ad Council conducted precampaign attitudinal surveys to gauge  awareness and understanding of the importance of wearing seat belts and  then administered weekly surveys during the campaign to track the  progression of attitude shifts. It also counted the number of Web site hits  and 1-800 telephone calls that occurred in response to the campaign. Ad  Council officials told us that they ultimately established correlations  between these measures and Department of Transportation statistics on  seat belt deaths. Ad Council and other private sector officials said that, to  establish such correlations, effectiveness measures must be incorporated  into every aspect of a program from its outset. The officials emphasized  that before a program is even launched, evaluators should establish a  definition for success; identify priorities; and determine what should be  measured, how it should be measured, and how frequently.", "Although State\u2019s public diplomacy efforts extend beyond information  dissemination, many of the logic model concepts would still be applicable  to State\u2019s situation. Such an approach could be particularly useful in  evaluating the combined effect of State\u2019s wide-ranging public diplomacy  activities. Our report noted that for comprehensive initiatives that combine  various approaches to achieving a goal, a logic model can help articulate  how those approaches are intended to assist and supplement one another.  Evaluations of performance can then assess the effects of an integrated set  of efforts. The lack of an integrated system for measuring public diplomacy  performance hinders State\u2019s ability to correct its course of action or to  direct resources toward activities that offer a greater likelihood of success.

Some officers said they were too busy and there was  not enough staff to take such trips. More than 50 percent of those  responding to our survey reported that the number of Foreign Service  officers available to perform public diplomacy duties was inadequate.  Although State increased the actual number of Americans in public  diplomacy positions overseas from 414 in fiscal year 2000 to 448 in fiscal  year 2002, State still had a shortfall of public diplomacy staff in 2002, based  on the projected needs identified in State\u2019s latest overseas staffing model.  In 2002, State\u2019s overseas staffing model projected the need for 512 staff in  these positions; however, 64 of these positions, or 13 percent, were not  filled.", "We reported in 2002 that as part of its Diplomatic Readiness Initiative,  State has launched an aggressive recruiting program to rebuild the  department\u2019s total workforce. Under this initiative, State requested 1,158  new employees above attrition over the 3-year period for fiscal years 2002  through 2004. However, it does not have numerical targets for specific skill  requirements such as language proficiency or regional expertise.

They indicated that these processes had been a particular problem for  embassy public affairs sections since the former USIA merged with State in  1999. At that time, USIA\u2019s administrative personnel who were familiar with  the administrative requirements of public diplomacy activities became part  of State\u2019s administrative operations in Washington and at embassies  overseas and were no longer dedicated solely to public diplomacy  activities. Public affairs officers said that State\u2019s administrative processes  were often too slow and inflexible to handle the logistics and timing  required to set up media and cultural events and other program activities.  Because these activities are so different from those conducted in the  course of traditional government-to-government diplomacy, State  management officers are often unfamiliar with them.", "For example, embassy public affairs section officials in one country told us  that the planned filming of USAID projects was held up because embassy  procedures did not allow making advance cash payments to the television  crew. Instead, the embassy preferred either making electronic fund  transfers in dollars or issuing checks. The officials noted that, unlike in the  United States, businesses in the developing world usually demand cash  payments in advance because they do not have sufficient working capital to  provide services and then wait for payment. Also, the businesses often do  not have bank accounts that can accept electronic fund transfers in dollars.  In this case, getting the television crew paid and working required the head  of the public affairs section to become personally involved in persuading  the embassy administrative section to act.", "Public affairs officers told us that this example is typical and that having to  continually intervene in resolving routine administrative issues leaves them  less time to actually conduct public diplomacy efforts. State officials told  us they recognized the problem and had designated certain administrative  personnel at some embassies to work with public affairs sections to reduce  the time spent by those sections on administrative matters.

The  highest percentages not meeting the requirements were in the Near East,  where 30 percent of the officers did not meet the requirement. Although  State had no language-designated positions for South Asia, it had eight  language-preferred positions, none of which were filled by officers who  had reading or speaking capability in those languages. It is important to  note that most of the foreign languages required in these two regions are  considered difficult to master, such as Arabic and Urdu. In contrast, 85  percent of the officers filling French language-designated positions and 97  percent of those filling Spanish language-designated ones met the  requirements. Officers\u2019 opinions on the quality of the foreign language  training they received also varied greatly by region. For example, 67  percent of the officers in one region reported that the quality of language  training was either generally or very sufficient, while 67 percent in another  region reported that training quality was generally or very insufficient.", "Foreign Service officers posted at the overseas embassies we visited and  other State officials told us that having fluency in a host country\u2019s language  is important for effectively conducting public diplomacy. The foreign  government officials with whom we met in Egypt, Morocco, and the United  Kingdom agreed. They noted that, even in countries where English is  widely understood, speaking the host country\u2019s language demonstrates  respect for its people and its culture. In Morocco, officers in the public  affairs and other sections of the embassy told us that, because their ability  to speak Arabic was poor, they conducted most embassy business in  French. French is widely used in that country, especially in business and  government. However, embassy officers told us that speaking Arabic would  provide superior entr\u00e9e to the Moroccan public. The ability to speak  country-specific forms of Arabic and other more obscure dialects would  generate even more goodwill, especially outside the major cities.", "Some Foreign Affairs officers pointed to State\u2019s policy of limiting most  overseas tours to 2 or 3 years as a factor that contributes to insufficient  language skills. They also said this policy makes it more difficult to  cultivate personal relationships that in some countries take a long time to  develop. They noted that the diplomatic corps of some other countries with  major overseas diplomatic presences allow longer overseas tours and that  their diplomats demonstrate superior foreign language skills as a result.  Officers at the embassies we visited also noted that, because public  diplomacy efforts should and often do involve political and economic  officers and others outside the public affairs section, it is important that  they be proficient in host country languages as well. A number of officers in  these other sections told us that language proficiency was a problem for  them as well. State officials told us that they are aware of this concern but  that they rely on tools other than lengthened tours of duty to foster  language skills, such as offering pay incentives to officers who are  proficient in foreign languages used in certain countries. Also, they said  officers who have the required language proficiency have a competitive  advantage over those who do not in bidding for overseas positions.", "According to the department, the largest and most significant factor  limiting its ability to fill language-designated positions is its long-standing  staffing shortfall. As mentioned above, State\u2019s Diplomatic Readiness  Initiative is designed to replenish the ranks. Other planned actions include  bolstering efforts to recruit job candidates with target language skills,  sending language training supervisors to posts to determine ways to  improve training offerings, and developing a new \"language continuum\"  plan to guide efforts to meet the need for higher levels of competency in all  languages, especially those critical to national security concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Little Time for Training", "paragraphs": ["Time to attend public diplomacy training presents another challenge.
