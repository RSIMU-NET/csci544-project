Overall, minority- and women-owned suppliers accounted for 8 percent and 13 percent of procurement expenditures, respectively. Minority- and women-owned broker-dealers accounted for about 3 percent and less than 1 percent of the debt issuance amount, respectively. FHLBanks and the Office of Finance (which issues debts on behalf of the banks) have been taking steps to increase diversity in these business activities, such as conducting outreach to diverse entities.

For instance, HERA  required that each of the 11 regionally based FHLBanks create an Office  of Minority and Women Inclusion (OMWI) or designate an office to  perform duties and establish policies related to the bank\u2019s diversity and  inclusion efforts. HERA and its implementing regulation require  FHLBanks to promote diversity and ensure the inclusion of minorities and  women in employment and minority- and women-owned businesses in  their business and activities. HERA also created the Federal Housing  Finance Agency (FHFA) and designated it as the regulator of the  FHLBanks. FHFA issued a rule in 2010 to implement HERA  requirements.

This report uses a broader definition of  diversity (not only gender, race, and ethnicity) for describing the  challenges FHLBanks face and practices they use in maintaining and  increasing diversity. For example, the challenges and practices can be  relevant not only to minorities and women, but also to other individuals  such as those with a disability.", "To address all three objectives, we reviewed relevant law and regulations  related to FHLBank diversity and inclusion efforts, including FHFA  reporting requirements related to banks\u2019 diversity and inclusion efforts.", "To identify trends in FHLBanks\u2019 workforce diversity, we analyzed data on  the gender, race, and ethnicity of FHLBank employees from the 2011\u2013 2017 Employer Information Reports (EEO-1) of the Equal Employment  Opportunity Commission (EEOC). We focused on gender, race, and  ethnicity because EEO-1 reports only include data by gender and  race/ethnicity. The FHLBanks submit annual EEO-1 reports to EEOC on  their workforces. In addition, they use the gender and race/ethnicity  classifications in the EEO-1 report for the workforce diversity data they  submit to FHFA. For our report, we modified the EEO-1 categories and  used Hispanic, nonminority (white), African-American, Asian, and Other.  We included only non-Hispanic employees under nonminority (white),  African-American, Asian, and Other. We included Asian American, Native  Hawaiian or Pacific Islander under the Asian category, and we included  Native American or Alaskan Native, and Two or More Races under Other.", "We compared the diversity composition of the banks\u2019 workforce to that of  the financial services industry in 2017, based on EEOC data. More  specifically, we used EEO-1 data on companies in the finance and  insurance industry categorized under code 52 of the North American  Industry Classification System. We included workforces from all sites of  companies with multiple locations and federal contractors. Consequently,  our estimates for the financial services industry may not match the  analysis found on EEOC\u2019s website, which excludes sites of companies  with multiple locations with less than 50 employees. We assessed the  reliability of the EEO-1 data through electronic testing, documentation  review, and interviews with knowledgeable agency staff, and determined  them to be sufficiently reliable for examining the gender and race/ethnicity  composition of the FHLBank workforce and comparing it with that in the  financial services industry.", "We also compared the individual FHLBanks\u2019 workforce data with  demographic and education data from a Census Bureau survey.  Specifically, we calculated the estimated percentages of women and  minorities (18\u201364 years old) with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in the  metropolitan statistical areas around each FHLBank\u2019s headquarters.  Because the survey included a statistical sample of the population, we  presented each of our estimated percentages with a corresponding 95  percent confidence interval. We also analyzed the Census Bureau\u2019s 2017  vintage population estimation data to provide an overview of the  demographics of the populations in the states and U.S. territories  serviced by the individual FHLBanks. The estimates were derived from  the demographic balance equation, which involves adding births and  migrants to the Census baseline and subtracting deaths from the Census  baseline. The estimates do not contain confidence intervals because the  estimates are not from sampling. To assess the reliability of the Census  Bureau data, we reviewed documentation on how the Census estimates  were produced and compared our data set estimates with published  Census estimates.

We found that the data prior to 2018 were not  comparable across years or banks. However, in 2018, FHFA provided  instructions and templates to help ensure more consistent reporting. For  consistency with our workforce data analysis, we focused on the banks\u2019  use of minority- and women-owned suppliers and broker-dealers. In  addition, FHLBanks report to FHFA on their use of suppliers and broker- dealers owned by individuals with disabilities, such as disabled  veterans. To provide additional information on the Office of Finance\u2019s  use of diverse broker-dealers in debt issuance, we also analyzed data on  the number of diverse broker-dealers approved by the Office of Finance  from 2014 through May 2019. These data include minority- and women- owned, and other diverse broker-dealers such as those owned by  disabled veterans.", "To assess the reliability of the diversity data on suppliers and broker- dealers that the FHLBanks and the Office of Finance reported to FHFA,  we obtained and reviewed information from FHFA to understand the data  system the agency uses to collect the data, how the agency uses the  data, and any known data limitations.

According to  FHFA staff, annual expenditure paid to suppliers can vary from year to  year. More specifically, an increase in a bank\u2019s annual supplier  expenditure in any one year is usually related to long-term, large  investments made during that year, such as construction costs or  investment in technology products and services. FHFA staff noted that  these one-time increases in expenditures can provide opportunities to  increase the use of diverse suppliers.

For example, FHFA specifically found that six banks  needed to improve performance measurement of their supplier diversity  goals. In the 2018 examinations, FHFA recommended that seven banks  enhance their succession planning to ensure that potential successors  are assessed on how well they manage and implement diversity and  inclusion. As previously discussed, FHFA also asked FHLBanks and the  Office of Finance to develop a more systematic process to review and  determine potential changes to their debt and investment policies that  could expand participation by diverse broker-dealers.", "Based on our review of FHFA\u2019s examination documentation, FHFA  followed its processes to document, communicate, and resolve  examination findings related to diversity and inclusion in its 2017 and  2018 examinations. For example, FHFA examiners prepared  memorandums to document the assessment and findings of each  individual bank\u2019s diversity and inclusion efforts and communicated  findings to bank management and boards. Consistent with the  examination manual, FHFA followed up on 2017 examination findings and  banks\u2019 remediation actions during the 2018 examinations. As of March  2019, FHFA determined that 10 banks satisfactorily remediated findings  from the 2017 examination related to goals and reporting issues, among  other things. For the remaining bank, management has not completed all  remediation steps to address FHFA\u2019s examination findings, according to  FHFA staff. FHFA staff added that they will review the bank\u2019s actions  again in the 2019 examination and assess the banks\u2019 progress in  addressing the 2018 examination findings.", "According to FHFA staff, they plan to make some changes to the diversity  and inclusion examination module. For example, in the module FHFA  plans to more explicitly separate the information on the review of diversity  efforts related to use of diverse broker-dealers from use of diverse  suppliers (they are currently under one examination component).", "Developed instructions and templates to improve data quality. To  enhance the quality of the data and information submitted by FHLBanks  on their workforce diversity and use of diverse suppliers and broker- dealers, FHFA worked with FHLBanks and developed instructions and  templates to help FHLBanks submit more consistent data on a quarterly  basis. During 2018, FHFA requested that banks submit quarterly diversity  data on their workforce and the use of diverse suppliers and broker- dealers. FHFA also developed a data reporting manual that includes a  data dictionary, and templates for the quarterly and annual data and for  the annual report to help FHLBanks more consistently report diversity  data for their workforces and use of diverse suppliers and broker-dealers.", "FHFA staff told us that they reviewed the banks\u2019 2018 data to identify any  discrepancies, and they worked with the banks to clarify data definitions  and correct the discrepancies. For example, some banks had used an  incorrect definition to account for their diverse supplier expenditures.  Because 2018 was the first year in which the banks used the new  templates, FHFA staff said they had expected some discrepancies in the  data as the banks became familiar with the data definitions. Staff said  FHFA plans to continue to work with the banks to help them achieve a  common understanding of the data definitions.", "Incorporated bank data in oversight. According to FHFA staff, in 2018  they began to use the banks\u2019 quarterly data for ongoing monitoring of the  banks\u2019 diversity and inclusion efforts in workforce, procurement, and  capital markets. For example, the FHFA OMWI office assesses each  bank\u2019s diversity performance in these three areas using the quarterly  data, and has been considering developing benchmarks. FHFA staff said  the quarterly data provide more detailed information on the banks\u2019 use of  diverse businesses; for example, the types of goods or services for which  the banks contract with diverse businesses. FHFA staff noted that the  additional data not only inform FHFA\u2019s oversight but also can help the  banks\u2019 internal reporting on diversity and inclusion efforts.", "Additionally, FHFA plans to review the banks\u2019 data reporting systems as  part of its annual examinations to help ensure banks have the appropriate  controls for data reporting. FHFA staff said that the agency expects the  banks to establish the appropriate data system to ensure the quality of  data reported to FHFA and for internal reporting.", "Communicated with FHLBanks, including on data templates and  expectations. FHFA provided clarification on the roles and duties of the  banks\u2019 OMWI officers and the scope of diversity regulations. FHFA  collected the banks\u2019 feedback and responded to questions on the new  quarterly data reporting and the new data instructions and templates.  Subsequently, FHFA modified the data templates in 2019 to allow the  banks to more efficiently report their diversity data on a quarterly and  annual basis. For example, FHFA consolidated data fields common to  quarterly and annual reporting, among other things. Additionally, FHFA  provided responses to the banks on their questions on the data and  annual report templates when the templates were first introduced in 2018  and revised in 2019. FHFA staff said the annual report template helped  clarify FHFA\u2019s expectation on annual report content.", "In addition, FHFA staff noted that since 2015, FHFA\u2019s OMWI director has  met with the bank presidents and board of directors of most of the  FHLBanks, and began in 2018 to have at least one visit for each bank  every other year. The FHFA OMWI director also generally attends the  semi-annual conferences of the banks\u2019 OMWI officers, during which she  has the opportunity to meet with the banks\u2019 presidents individually. During  these meetings, the OMWI director or staff discussed diversity issues  such as strategic planning, results of the banks\u2019 annual reports, and  examinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FHFA, each of the 11 FHLBanks, and  the Office of Finance for review and comment.
