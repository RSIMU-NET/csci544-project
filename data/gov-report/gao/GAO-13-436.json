Some economic data for these communities are comparable to national averages, with some variation. For instance, GAO found that 52 percent (11 of 21) of communities had unemployment rates lower than the national average of 8.9 percent, although the rates ranged from a low of 6.1 percent to a high of 16.8 percent. Sixty-two percent (13 of 21) of the closure communities had real per capita income growth rates higher than the national average of 0.14 percent for the period from 2006 through 2011. Since 2005, 23 other installations have experienced population increases that have resulted in net growth of about 191,000 military and civilian personnel (a 36 percent increase), and their corresponding communities have used several strategies to accommodate this growth, including forming a regional working group composed of representatives from affected jurisdictions.", "Community representatives stated that DOD's Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) provides good support to communities facing base closure, but some representatives from communities surrounding closed Army installations stated that facilities were not maintained at a high enough level for reuse. An Army official told GAO that the Army makes an effort to maintain closed facilities in accordance with their planned usage and that local redevelopment authorities have unrealistic expectations of maintenance levels. DOD guidance states that the services have developed specific maintenance levels for facilities during the transition process. The Air Force and the Navy have published this specific guidance, but the Army has not and instead relies upon DOD's guidance, which does not describe specific levels of maintenance. Without clear guidance on the expected levels of maintenance for closed facilities, the communities may not have a clear understanding of what maintenance the Army will provide.", "Community representatives indicated that OEA provides good support to communities facing base growth, but that additional data and a civilian point of contact at the installation could improve their ability to respond to future growth. DOD has issued guidance that states communities should be provided maximum advance information to plan, and service guidance states that services will give communities information including military and personnel changes. However, community representatives told GAO that they would like additional aggregate information on where servicemembers live while stationed at the installation to facilitate planning for the impact of installation growth. Installations currently do not provide communities with this information because they do not have a system to track it, but officials noted that existing systems could potentially be modified to provide it. Installation officials and community representatives also stated that establishing a long-term civilian point of contact at the installation would help the community effectively plan for growth. Accurate and timely information on personnel residence areas and a civilian point of contact at the installation could better facilitate communities' efforts to accommodate installation growth."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DOD concurred with GAO's recommendation that the Army issue guidance on maintenance levels to be provided during the base closure process.

These types of  activities have had a significant impact on the local communities  surrounding major U.S. DOD installations experiencing either closure or  growth. We have previously reported that these DOD actions have led to  challenges for the local communities affected. For example, communities  surrounding closed installations have faced long-term challenges in the  economic recovery process arising out of base closures while  communities surrounding a growth installation face other challenges,  including a greater need for transportation, schools, and housing. We  have previously recommended that DOD provide communities  surrounding growth installations with better information early in the  process to allow them to more adequately plan for these changes, and in  response the services issued guidance for the timely, complete, and  consistent dissemination of planning information on changes in military  and civilian personnel and school-age children.", "The Secretary of Defense stated in August 2012 that, after a decade of  war, DOD will again be drawing down its forces over the next five years,  moving toward a smaller, leaner, and more agile force. As part of its fiscal  year 2013 budget request, DOD asked Congress to authorize two more  rounds of BRAC in 2013 and 2015.

We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In  addition, we held discussion groups with and interviewed selected  community representatives, and surveyed representatives of closure  communities. We received responses to 16 out of 22 questionnaires we  sent, for a response rate of 73 percent. To identify the installations that  have experienced significant population increases since 2005 and  describe the practices and strategies, if any, that the surrounding  communities have employed to accommodate this growth, we started with  the list of 20 installations that DOD\u2019s Office of Economic Adjustment  (OEA) had identified and we discussed in our 2008 report. We reviewed  this list with OEA and the military services, and, based on information  provided by OEA, added 3 additional installations that OEA had identified  since 2008 as being significantly affected by growth. To identify the  strategies and practices that communities used to deal with installation  growth, we held discussion groups with and interviewed selected  community representatives. We also interviewed installation officials and  selected four installations to visit. These results cannot be generalized to  all closure or growth communities, but common responses across groups  and similar findings through the survey provide converging validation. Our  site selection included one installation per service, a joint base, and  installations in geographically diverse locations. Further, we surveyed  community representatives from all 23 growth installations and received  21 responses, for a response rate of 91 percent.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has provided support to  communities to deal with base closure, we held discussion groups with  and interviewed community representatives from locations that had  installations close as a result of BRAC 2005 and we interviewed DOD and  service officials.

The 2005 BRAC round was the fifth  round of base closures and realignments undertaken by DOD since 1988, and it was the biggest, most complex, and costliest BRAC round ever.The 2005 BRAC process generally followed the legislative framework of  previous BRAC rounds, providing for an independent Defense Base  Closure and Realignment Commission to review the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s closure and realignment recommendations, which were  produced through the BRAC processes coordinated by the Deputy Under  Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment.Commission assessed the Secretary\u2019s recommendations, under its  authority to approve, modify, reject, or add closure or realignment  recommendations, before reporting its own recommendations to the  President. The President then approved the Commission\u2019s  recommendations and forwarded them to Congress, and the  recommendations became final in November 2005. Implementation of the  recommendations was required to be complete by September 15, 2011.  Figure 1 below is a timeline of the 2005 BRAC round.", "As specified in the BRAC statute, DOD has 6 years to complete all  installation closures and realignments, although certain actions, such as  the cleanup of environmentally contaminated property and the  subsequent transfer of unneeded property to other users, may extend  beyond the 6-year implementation period for each round. Once DOD  officially closes an installation, the property is typically considered excess  and offered to other federal agencies. As shown in figure 2, any property  that is not taken by other federal agencies is then considered surplus and  is disposed of through a variety of means to state and local governments,  local redevelopment authorities, or private parties.", "The various methods used to convey unneeded property to nonfederal  parties noted in figure 2 are targeted, in many cases, to a particular end  use of the property. For example, under a public benefit conveyance,  state and local governments and local redevelopment authorities acquire  surplus DOD property for little or no cost for purposes such as schools,  parks, and airports. Under an economic development conveyance,  property is transferred for uses that promote economic recovery and job  creation. Conservation conveyances provide for the transfer of property to  a state, a political subdivision of a state, or a qualified not-for-profit group  for natural resource and conservation purposes. Property can also be  conveyed to nonfederal parties through other methods shown in figure 2  without regard, in many cases, to a particular end use. For example,  property can be sold or special congressional legislation can dictate  transfer to a particular entity.", "In recent years, the growth of installations has occurred as a result of  both the 2005 BRAC round and other DOD initiatives. Under the 2005  BRAC round, DOD implemented 182 recommendations, many of which  resulted in significant personnel movement across installations and the  subsequent growth of some of those installations. In addition, DOD has  undertaken other actions outside of BRAC that have resulted in the  growth of installations. For example, the Army has undergone a major  force restructuring through its force modularity effort, which has been  referred to as the largest Army reorganization in 50 years. This effort  created Stryker brigades, primarily located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord,  Washington. Finally, DOD\u2019s Grow the Force initiative increased the end  strength of the Army and the Marine Corps, affecting bases across the  country. Although DOD has recently announced plans to downsize the  Army and the Marine Corps, installations that experienced significant  growth under these initiatives, and their surrounding communities, are still  dealing with the impact of additional personnel and their dependents.", "Within DOD, the Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA)\u2014a field activity  under the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions,  Technology, and Logistics\u2014assists communities by providing technical  and financial assistance in planning and carrying out adjustment  strategies in response to defense actions. OEA is the primary DOD office  responsible for providing assistance to communities, regions, and states  affected by significant defense actions including base closures and  realignments. Much of that assistance in the past was directed toward  communities that lost military and civilian personnel because of the  closure or major realignment of a base. However, because the 2005  BRAC round and other initiatives described above have created  significant growth at many bases, OEA has also assisted affected  communities with growth planning.", "We have reported on the impact of BRAC actions numerous times over  the last several years. In particular in our 2005 report on BRAC, we  reported that DOD had closed 97 major installations since the first BRAC  round in 1988. Specifically DOD closed 16 bases in BRAC 1988, 26  bases in BRAC 1991, 28 bases in BRAC 1993, and 27 bases in BRAC  1995. (See appendix II for a list of the 97 bases and the year of closure  for each.) In that report, we studied 62 affected communities and found  that most of the surrounding communities were able to replace the jobs  lost due to the installation closure with new jobs created by the reuse of  the installation and that these communities generally had economic  indicators that compared favorably with the U.S. national averages.  Specifically, as of July 31, 2004, almost 70 percent of the 62 affected  communities studied in that report (43 out of 62) had unemployment rates  at or below the national average. Our analyses in that report of annual  real per capita growth rates for the BRAC\u2013affected communities showed  mixed results. The latest available data at that time (1999-2001) showed  that only 48 percent of the BRAC-affected communities (30 of the 62) had  an estimated average real per capita income growth rate that was higher  than the national average. This was a decline from when we reported  these figures in our 2002 report, where we reported that 33 out of 62  communities (53 percent) matched or exceeded the national average for  real per capita income growth rate for 1996 to 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communities Have Used a Variety of Strategies to Deal with BRAC 2005 Closures and Select Local Economic Data Are Comparable to National Averages", "paragraphs": ["Communities surrounding the 23 major DOD installations closed in  BRAC 2005 have used a variety of strategies to deal with the closures,  and economic data on unemployment and real per capita income growth  show the rates for these communities are comparable to national  averages."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Communities Surrounding DOD Installations Closed in BRAC 2005 Have Used a Variety of Strategies to Adjust to the Closures", "paragraphs": ["During the BRAC 2005 round, DOD closed 23 major installations in the  United States, the majority of which were Army installations. Figures 3  and 4 show the number of major installations that were closed by military  service and the locations of these installations.", "Communities affected by these installation closures faced a number of  different challenges and developed strategies to deal with them. In  particular, community representatives we spoke with or surveyed said  that some of their greatest challenges in dealing with the installation  closures were developing a plan for the reuse of the property, dealing  with facilities that were in poor shape or not suitable for reuse, and  obtaining funding for infrastructure improvements. Other challenges  identified by community representatives included navigating the legal  intricacies of property transfer, dealing with environmental cleanup, and  replacing lost jobs. Based on our analysis, we found that community  representatives have used a variety of strategies to deal with these  challenges. For example, several representatives that responded to our  survey cited forming a local redevelopment authority as an effective  strategy for dealing with installation closure. One community  representative said his local redevelopment authority was comprised of  local and regional stakeholders to help build alliances and partnerships  across the entire community spectrum. Another said his local  redevelopment authority operates in a public forum where all meetings  are open to the public and community input is solicited at every meeting.  This was also reiterated by another community representative who said it  was important to use an open process involving public meetings and  outreach to accept input and gain community support in developing a plan  for the reuse of the property.", "Community representatives also cited working closely with DOD as an  effective strategy for dealing with installation closure. For example, one  community representative said the local redevelopment authority worked  with the Army to ensure there was an effective and acceptable plan for  dealing with environmental remediation prior to and after installation  closure. Another local representative worked with DOD to have many of  the facilities that were in poor condition demolished prior to finding new  tenants, thus saving the community maintenance and operation dollars. A  third representative said it would have been impossible without  assistance from DOD for the local redevelopment authority to make its  way through the maze of federal regulations and available information to  create redevelopment plans. In addition, another community  representative said that the Army was extremely helpful in transferring  knowledge from numerous years of operating the installation. He said this  historical knowledge allowed the local redevelopment authority to utilize  previously completed studies in lieu of committing taxpayer dollars to  repeat those investigations and reports. Further, he noted that data the  Army maintained on utility and infrastructure would be used to manage  repair and maintenance of the property in the future. Finally, another local  redevelopment authority worked with local and headquarters Air Force  staff to find follow-on jobs for DOD civilians that did not relocate or retire  when the installation closed.", "Some community representatives cited leveraging funds from state and  federal agencies as a successful strategy. For example, one community  representative said the local redevelopment authority was able to secure  state-issued bonds to make the facilities more business-ready. Another  local redevelopment authority secured federal funds to modify existing  structures, and a third local redevelopment authority took advantage of a  state tax benefit that allowed it to use state money to pay down  improvement bonds. In addition, community representatives cited  receiving grants from OEA as being helpful to their local redevelopment  authority\u2019s organizational, planning, and implementation efforts. For  example, one representative said the funding OEA provided was used to  hire personnel, maintain offices, and conduct planning. Another said OEA  provided funding through a grant that permitted the local redevelopment  authority to hire dedicated professional staff and contract with a  consultant to prepare the redevelopment plan and assist with the property  transfer application. Many other representatives told us that OEA  provided resources to develop reuse plans or supporting studies or to hire  specific consulting or legal services. Table 1 below displays the OEA  grants provided to closure communities during calendar years 2005  through 2012.", "In addition, community representatives who responded to our survey or  that spoke with us said taking early possession of the property and  leasing some of its assets was an effective strategy for dealing with  installation closure. For example, one respondent said that since funding  is limited for BRAC reuse projects, the local redevelopment authority  entered into a protection and maintenance contract with the Army and  was therefore able to lease out some of the assets on the installation,  allowing the local redevelopment authority to increase revenue. Another  community representative said the local redevelopment authority was  able to move from complete financial dependence on federal funding to  utilizing alternative revenue sources such as leases, tax revenue, and  fees for service. He noted that the local redevelopment authority was  awarded the Army caretaker contract for the former installation, and by  providing services for fees, it was able to generate revenue. Furthermore,  another local redevelopment authority representative told us that it is  taking over the closure property in a piecemeal fashion. For example, it  has already taken over all the historic homes at the installation and has  leased out many of them. According to the community representative, this  has provided the local redevelopment authority with some revenue to  operate and maintain the facilities. The local redevelopment authority is  also preparing to take over the rest of the property when the primary  caretaker leaves.", "Community representatives also said hiring experts was an effective  strategy for dealing with installation closure. For example, one community  representative said the local redevelopment authority had to hire  individuals who had experience with BRAC to get things done in a timely  and professional way. In particular, she said the local redevelopment  authority hired an attorney to draft documents associated with specific  lease amendments. Likewise, a community representative said the local  redevelopment authority hired an experienced BRAC attorney to advise  them on the process for land transfer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Economic Data for Communities Surrounding DOD Installations Closed in BRAC 2005 Are Comparable to National Averages", "paragraphs": ["Selected economic indicators for the 21 communities surrounding the 23  DOD installations closed in BRAC 2005 are comparable to national  averages. In our analysis, we used annual unemployment and real per  capita income growth rates compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics (BLS) and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) as  broad indicators of the economic health of those communities where  installation closures occurred. Our analyses of BLS annual  unemployment data for 2011, the most recent data available, showed that  11 (52 percent) of the 21 closure communities had unemployment rates  at or below the national average of 8.9 percent for the period from  January through December 2011. The other 10 communities had  unemployment rates that were higher than the national average (see  figure 5). Of the 21 closure communities, Portland, Maine (Naval Air  Station Brunswick) had the lowest unemployment rate at 6.1 percent and  Modesto, California (Riverbank Army Ammunition Plant) had the highest  rate at 16.8 percent.", "We also analyzed BEA real per capita income growth rates between 2006  and 2011 and found that 13 (62 percent) of the 21 closure communities  had real per capita income growth rates that were higher than the national  average of 0.14 (see figure 6). The other 8 communities had rates that  were below the national average. Of the 21 communities affected, Yukon- Koyukuk, Alaska (Galena Forward Operating Location) had the highest  growth rate at 4.31 percent and Atlanta, Georgia (Fort Gillem, Fort  McPherson, and Naval Air Station Atlanta) had the lowest rate at -1.58  percent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Growth Has Occurred at 23 Major Installations and Communities Have Used a Variety of Strategies to Accommodate this Growth", "paragraphs": ["Since 2005, DOD has implemented several major initiatives, including  BRAC realignment actions and Army Modularity, that have resulted in  growth in military and civilian personnel at 23 installations, and the  communities surrounding these installations, which also experienced  growth, have used a variety of practices and strategies to accommodate  this growth. As shown in table 2, these 23 installations had a combined  net growth of about 191,000 military and civilian personnel from fiscal  years 2006 through 2012, with their total population growing from about  526,000 to over 717,000, a 36.3 percent increase.", "While Fort Sill, Oklahoma actually incurred a net loss during this time  period, OEA treated it as a growth location because it was originally  projected to increase by more than 2,000 personnel which was  anticipated to impact the surrounding community in the areas of housing,  schools, and transportation. In addition, Fort Knox, Kentucky also  experienced a net loss in population, but changes to the mission and the  resulting changes to the demographics, including the increase of full-time  military personnel versus the temporary students that were previously  stationed at the installation, caused significant challenges to the  surrounding community. The growth of each of the 21 installations that  did grow during this time period ranged from about 12 percent to 117  percent. Of the 23 growth installations, 16 were Army, 3 were Navy and 4  were Air Force. The seven installations that grew the most all had growth  rates of more than 50 percent over fiscal years 2006 through 2012. These  were five Army installations (Fort Belvoir, Virginia; Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort  Carson, Colorado; Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington; and Fort Lee,  Virginia); one Navy installation (Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia);  and one Air Force installation (Joint Base San Antonio, Texas).", "Between 2006 and 2011 all of the surrounding communities also  experienced growth. Table 3 shows the change in population of the  communities surrounding the major growth installations from calendar  years 2006 through 2011. The growth rates for the individual communities  associated with the installations ranged from about 1 to 14 percent over  this period. As with the installations, the majority of the communities  experiencing the most growth surround Army installations. Specifically,  communities surrounding Fort Bliss, Texas; Fort Stewart, Georgia;  Redstone Arsenal, Alabama; and Fort Sill, Oklahoma experienced growth  rates of more than 12 percent from 2006 through 2011. Also, one Air  Force installation, Joint Base San Antonio, Texas experienced growth of  more than 13 percent. The community with the sixth largest population  gain was around the Marine Corps\u2019 Camp Lejeune and New River Air  Station, North Carolina with a growth rate of about 12 percent.", "Further, we found that population growth in the communities surrounding  the growth installations could differ based on factors other than  installation growth. While some of the community growth can be attributed  to additional servicemembers and their families living in the communities,  growth could also happen for other reasons. For example, at Joint Base  Lewis-McChord, Washington, the two counties surrounding the  installation experienced growth at the same time that the number of  servicemembers at the installation increased. Installation officials told us  that while the population of the installation increased primarily due to the  creation of the Army\u2019s Stryker Brigades, the surrounding communities  also experienced an increase due to the growth in local industry, including  the aerospace industry. We also found that in some cases, an installation  experienced a large growth in personnel, but the surrounding community  did not experience the same level of growth. For example, Fort Belvoir  had the largest percentage of installation growth but ranked tenth in  percentage of community growth. This occurred for a number of reasons.  According to DOD officials most personnel that transferred to this  installation already lived in the region and thus were commuting from  other local areas to Fort Belvoir rather than moving to the region.  Therefore, while Fort Belvoir incurred significant growth, population  growth in the local communities was not impacted as directly as it might  have been if transferred personnel were coming from other communities.  Furthermore, the actual community growth for this area was almost  370,000 people\u2014the largest overall increase of any community in our  review\u2014but because the metropolitan area was so large to start with the  increase did not change the percentage of growth as significantly as did  smaller changes to smaller communities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Installation Growth Raises Challenges for Communities, Which Have Used a Variety of Strategies to Accommodate This Growth", "paragraphs": ["Growth of an installation can cause a variety of challenges for a  community, and we found that communities have used a variety of  strategies to cope with these challenges, which include increased  demand for transportation, education, and other public services. For  example, based on our site visits, interviews with DOD officials, data we  collected from surveys, and discussion groups, transportation was a key  challenge facing communities around growth installations. During all our  site visits, DOD officials cited transportation as a major challenge, as did  several other installations we contacted. For instance, several installation  officials expressed concerns about the impact of traffic in the community  and on the installation when vehicles are entering or leaving the base. In  September 2009, OEA conducted a project needs assessment for  defense growth communities. This assessment was initiated to assess  projects identified by communities as needed to support DOD growth  actions. As a result of this assessment, communities identified  transportation improvements to mitigate growth impacts as the greatest  need. In addition, based on data we collected from our surveys and  interviews of growth community representatives, transportation was the  most frequently cited challenge. Another challenge for communities  discussed during our site visits as well as in interviews with DOD officials  and discussion groups and cited by survey respondents involved  overcrowding in local schools. DOD officials at installations we contacted  expressed concerns about the capacity of local area schools to handle  the growth. In addition, the 2009 OEA project needs assessment  identified education as the second greatest funding need for defense  communities. Other challenges noted by DOD officials and community  representatives included the need for additional medical care and  housing, lack of federal funding to deal with the growth, and inadequate  utility systems.", "Communities have used a variety of strategies and practices to deal with  these concerns. The most common successful strategy, cited by DOD  officials, community representatives we interviewed, survey respondents,  and discussion group participants, was to form a regional working group  composed of representatives from all of the jurisdictions affected by the  growth at the installation. Examples of some of the regional working  groups are cited below:  In response to growth at the North Carolina Eastern Region, which  includes Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station  Cherry Point and New River, the North Carolina\u2019s Eastern Region  Military Growth Task Force was established. The task force included  representatives from surrounding counties, and its mission was to  analyze community impacts from the sudden and unanticipated  growth of these installations and develop potential recommendations  to address those impacts.", "In response to mission growth at Fort Bragg, the Fort Bragg Regional  Alliance was formed to evaluate economic, employment,  infrastructure, and social impacts associated with this expansion and  to identify actions required to address future growth needs in the area.", "The community around Walter Reed National Military Center  established a stakeholders\u2019 advisory board that brought together local  business and community leaders and representatives from all levels  of government and the Navy, who worked together to identify growth  impacts and to propose solutions.", "In addition, DOD officials, community representatives, survey  respondents, and discussion group participants cited seeking grants as a  successful strategy to cope with the challenges posed by installation  growth. In some cases, communities were successful in obtaining funding  to address the associated growth in their area. OEA provided growth  communities with grants to cover administrative expenses, including  hiring consultants to conduct growth management studies. As seen in  table 4 below, from 2005 through 2012, OEA provided over $73 million in  grants to growth communities. In addition to OEA funding, state and local  governments also provided funding to address various issues. For  example, at Redstone Arsenal, state and local governments provided  funding to address the overcrowding of the local schools.", "Conducting studies to determine installation and community needs was  also cited as a key practice in working effectively through the challenges  that base growth creates. Studies provide the necessary data to guide the  individual bases and community representatives to take action to find  solutions to address challenges.

Further, installation officials identified a lack of affordable  housing as an issue and worked with community representatives to  develop a rental property program where landlords from the  community voluntarily sign up to give discounts to servicemembers in  exchange for receiving their rent as an allotment directly from the  Army. This helped the community by decreasing vacancy rates, and  helped the base by finding servicemembers affordable housing.", "At Fort Bragg, a study conducted for the Fort Bragg Regional Alliance,  a group formed to deal with the growth at Fort Bragg, revealed that  many people working in the Fort Bragg area were not prepared to  compete for high-wage and high-skill jobs both on base and in the  community. As a result the base and community worked together to  develop a career exploration platform and installed enhanced  technology classrooms into 33 schools and 8 community colleges  throughout the region, which provided training and resources to better  prepare the community for the workforce.", "At Camp Lejeune Marine Corps Base, a study conducted for the North  Carolina\u2019s Eastern Region Military Growth Task Force identified traffic  issues between the base and the surrounding neighborhoods. The  study group proposed the implementation of an Intelligent Traffic  System in the surrounding City of Jacksonville to offer instant relief by  monitoring and controlling key choke points on area roadways that  connect the base to the neighborhoods where employees live.

An official from the  Army BRAC office stated, however, that the Army makes every effort to  provide maintenance in accordance with the planned usage of the  facilities and that communities have unrealistic expectations of the  condition of the buildings. DOD guidance states that surplus facilities and  equipment at installations that have been closed can be important to the  eventual reuse of the installation and that each military department is  responsible for protecting and maintaining such assets in order to  preserve the value of the property. The guidance further states that the  services should consult with the local redevelopment authority to  determine the maintenance levels for the facilities. Finally, while the DOD  guidance states that the services have developed specific maintenance  levels, only the Navy and the Air Force have published service-specific  guidance to clearly describe their maintenance levels consistent with  factors outlined in DOD\u2019s guidance.", "The Navy has developed the most comprehensive guidance on the  maintenance of closure facilities. The Department of the Navy\u2019s Base  Realignment and Closure Implementation Guidance describes a process  for establishing initial maintenance levels in consultation with the local  redevelopment authority.intended reuse of the individual building. For example, a building that is  designated for immediate reuse, meaning that the local redevelopment  authority has already identified a tenant, will be given the highest level of  maintenance. A building that does not have a reuse identified is given the  lowest level of maintenance, where only conditions adversely affecting  public health, the environment and safety are to be corrected. This  guidance further states that the Navy\u2019s BRAC Program Management  Office is responsible for overseeing this process and for serving as the  Navy\u2019s liaison to the community. Navy officials stated that the local  redevelopment authorities often want all of the buildings maintained at a  high level or that they change their minds on the immediacy of reuse of  the buildings after the Navy has begun maintenance at a different  maintenance level, resulting in property that is not maintained to the level  that the community would like because degradation of the property may  have already occurred. Officials further stated that they are willing to work  with communities to determine the appropriate maintenance levels and  even to change the maintenance levels if possible, but the best way to  ensure maintenance levels are in place to meet the needs of the  community is for the local redevelopment authority to work closely with  the Navy early on in the closure process to determine the proper level of  maintenance for individual facilities.", "Building maintenance levels are based on the  Air Force guidance from 1991 states that as facilities are vacated, they  shall be placed into one of six maintenance levels that are dependent on  the planned reuse of the facilities. This guidance has not been updated  to reflect the current command structure of the Air Force, including the Air  Force Real Property Agency, which was formed in 2002 and would have  responsibility for overseeing the implementation of these actions in a  future BRAC round. However, officials stated that the current policy is still  in effect and being followed, even though the Air Force has reorganized  the components overseeing this process. The Army has not issued any  guidance in this area. An Army official stated that the Army had draft  guidance, but it was never finalized and that the Army therefore relies  solely on the DOD guidance. However, the DOD guidance does not  describe specific levels of maintenance.", "Community representatives surrounding some closed Army installations  who we spoke with in interviews and discussion groups stated that the  Army did not always maintain the facilities to their expectations, resulting  in facility deterioration. For example, at the former Kansas Army  Ammunition Plant, community representatives stated that a storm  damaged the roof of one building that was never repaired by the Army,  resulting in mold growing inside the building and requiring the building to  be demolished at the expense of the local redevelopment authority (see  figure 7).", "In interviews, discussion groups and survey responses, other  representatives from communities surrounding closed Army installations  provided examples of poorly maintained property. One representative  stated that the service did not provide any maintenance to a housing  facility, resulting in significant mold growth inside the facility and rendering  it unusable. The community had to demolish this facility at its own  expense. Another representative told us that the service did not properly  maintain the grass on the property, causing it to become overgrown and  attract wildlife. Because of this increase in wildlife in the area, the service  had to spend approximately three times the originally budgeted amount  for environmental restoration of the property. Another community  representative stated that her local redevelopment authority took over the  maintenance of an Army installation prior to transfer through a  maintenance contract with the Army. She stated that her organization did  this to fix issues of deferred maintenance and to ensure that buildings  were properly maintained so that they could be reused.", "An official with the Army BRAC office told us that the Army makes an  effort to maintain closed facilities in accordance with their planned usage.  For example, he stated that in fiscal year 2013 the Army provided $49  million in caretaker funds for installations closed during BRAC 2005. He  further stated that local redevelopment authorities would like the buildings  to be in new condition, but that is not a realistic expectation. As a result,  an expectations gap exists between the Army and communities regarding  the levels of maintenance to be provided to facilities during the transition  period.

DOD  guidance states that maximum advance information and support should  be provided to state and local governments to plan for military growth  actions. The services implemented DOD\u2019s guidance by issuing service- specific guidance specifying certain information that shall be provided to  communities including military and civilian personnel changes; school-age  children increases or decreases; and construction activity. However,  some community representatives noted that they would like more specific  information. For example, they told us that installations are unable to  provide communities with aggregate data on where servicemembers and  their families live while stationed at the local installation, because they do  not have a system that tracks this type of information. Service officials  confirmed that current personnel data systems contain the  servicemembers\u2019 home station of record rather than their current  residence and payroll systems may only include direct deposit information  and not a home address, and that therefore this information is not  currently available. In addition, although the housing office at the  installation may have information on the number of servicemembers living  off the installation, there is no requirement to maintain information on  where those servicemembers live. Installation and service officials did  note, however, that existing data systems could potentially be modified to  provide this information. Installation officials noted that communities  continually asked for this information so that they can plan for the impact  of installation growth on transportation routes, local school districts, and  the need for various social services. Installation and service officials  expressed some concerns about privacy and force protection issues  stemming from the release of this information, but acknowledged that it  would be beneficial for communities to have some type of aggregate  information on where servicemembers reside in the communities to help  with community planning and traffic management, including where traffic  will feed into the access control points on base. One community  representative noted that as installation growth often happens  incrementally over time, having updated information that captures where  the additional servicemembers move to during the ongoing growth period  would enhance the communities\u2019 ability to respond to this growth.", "In addition to the need for more data on where personnel live, community  representatives and installation officials we interviewed stated that  establishing a long-term civilian point of contact at the base installation  level is necessary to effectively plan for the long-term effects of growth on  the base and local community. Both the Navy and the Marine Corps have  a provision for a Community Planning and Liaison Officer at installations  whose role is to be the central information point with the community. Navy  guidance states that to ensure continuity, the inclusion of a civilian  planner in the community planning liaison team is strongly encouraged.  The guidance further states that not every installation can support a full- time Community Planning and Liaison Officer position, and that this  position can be a collateral duty. In the Marine Corps, the Community  Planning and Liaison Officer is usually a senior civilian who has the  responsibility to develop and maintain a network with state and local  officials. Air Force officials told us that the Air Force has a draft instruction  with information on this type of position, but it has not yet been approved  and an Army official confirmed that the Army does not currently have this  type of position. We have previously reported that career civilians  possess institutional memory, which is particularly important in DOD  because of the frequent rotation of military personnel. An official from  the Army BRAC office agreed that a long-term point of contact at an  installation is important to maintaining community relationships. In the  past, the Army specifically stationed an additional officer to large growth  installations to be the primary contact point for the installation during the  growth period. This official further stated that he believes that the liaison  function can be performed by an active duty person; however, many Army  installations have a civilian deputy garrison commander acting in this  capacity.", "According to leaders we spoke with, base commanders do an excellent  job with community outreach; however, because they are typically only in  their positions for 2 to 3 years and then transferred, community outreach  has to start all over again once a new commander is appointed. In the  Navy and the Marine Corps, the Community Planning and Liaison Officer  does not replace the installation commander in community outreach;  rather, the position provides an additional person to act as a day to day  point of contact to work directly with local governments, community  representatives, and non-governmental organizations. Officials at  installations that we visited felt that maintaining such a position at the  installation level would be beneficial in establishing long-term working  relationships with the community. Accurate and timely information on  such things as personnel residence areas and expected changes in  demand for public services could better facilitate communities\u2019 efforts to  accommodate installation growth.

The condition of the buildings that DOD no longer needs and plans to  either sell or transfer to the communities has a direct effect on the  development of a successful reuse plan or arrangement between the  parties; if properties deteriorate during the closure transition time, they will  have less value for the communities that acquire them. In the case of the  Army, both installation officials and communities would benefit if there  were clear Army guidance to govern the maintenance of facilities prior to  their transfer to the community.", "Installation growth can affect surrounding communities, creating new  demands for transportation, education, and other social services. To meet  these needs, community representatives stated that additional information  could be helpful to facilitate planning efforts.", "Finally, community leaders pointed out that having an established long- term point of contact with the military community on base to help see  growth projects through to completion would also be helpful. Community  representatives generally expressed satisfaction with the quality of DOD\u2019s  support and regular interaction with community planners. However, the  support and regular interaction that is so important to maintaining  productive and efficient working relationships between communities and  installations can be enhanced by taking steps to lessen the impact of  changes in personnel such as those that occur with changes of station for  military personnel.

We identified the major closure installations using  DOD\u2019s information provided for our previously issued report on BRAC.  We defined the \u201ccommunity\u201d surrounding each installation as the  economic area identified in DOD\u2019s Base Closure and Realignment  Report which linked a metropolitan statistical area, a metropolitan  division, or a micropolitan statistical area to each installation. Because  DOD\u2019s BRAC report did not identify the census area for the Galena  Forward Operating Location in Alaska or the Naval Weapons Station Seal  Beach Detachment in Concord, California, we identified the town of  Galena as within the \u201cYukon-Koyukuk Census Area\u201d and the city of  Concord in the Oakland-Fremont-Hayward, CA Metropolitan Division and  our analyses used the population and economic data for these areas. To  compare the economic indicator data of the communities surrounding the  23 major DOD installations closed in the BRAC 2005 round to U.S.  national averages, we collected and analyzed calendar year 2011  unemployment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and  calendar year 2006 through 2011 per capita income growth data, along  with data on inflation, from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA),  which we used to calculate real per capita income growth. The most  current calendar year for which local area data was available from these  databases was 2011. We assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing BLS and BEA documentation regarding the methods used by  each agency in producing their data and found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. We used unemployment and real per capita  income as key performance indicators because (1) DOD used these  measures in its community economic impact analysis during the BRAC  location selection process and (2) economists commonly use these  measures in assessing the economic health of an area over time.

We identified the major growth installations by using  DOD\u2019s information provided for our previously issued report on BRAC and  OEA grant data. We defined the \u201ccommunity\u201d surrounding each  installation as the community identified in DOD\u2019s Base Closure and  Realignment Report which linked a Metropolitan Statistical Area to each  installation, supplemented with U.S. Bureau Census data as needed. To  describe the populations of the 23 DOD growth installations and their  surrounding communities, we collected and analyzed population data  from the military services and the U.S. Census Bureau, respectively. In  order to present information regarding expected growth at each military  installation, we analyzed Army and Air Force headquarters-level data,  and Navy and Marine Corps installation-level population data.

Responses to open-ended questions  were analyzed through content analysis. In conducting the content  analysis, one GAO analyst reviewed each open-ended response from  each community representative to identify recurring themes. Using the  identified themes, the analyst then developed categories for coding the  responses. A second GAO analyst reviewed each response from each  community representative and reviewed the first analyst\u2019s themes and  categories to reach concurrence on the themes and categories. Each of  the two GAO analysts then independently reviewed the answers to each  open-ended question and placed them into one or more of the categories.  The analysts then compared their coding to identify any disagreements  and reached agreement on all items through discussion.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 to May 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
