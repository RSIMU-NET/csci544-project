The DI program was enacted in 1956 and provides monthly cash benefits to severely disabled workers. SSI was enacted in 1972 as an income assistance program for aged, blind, or disabled people. Disability is defined in the Social Security Act as an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a severe physical or mental impairment. Both programs use the same criteria and procedures for determining whether the severity of an applicant\u2019s impairment qualifies him or her for disability benefits.", "In 1995, 5.7 million disabled workers and their dependents received about $40.2 billion in DI benefits; 4.7 million disabled or blind SSI claimants received about $21.1 billion in SSI benefits. From the 6.8 million recipients in 1988, overall program enrollment has increased by more than 50 percent. In fiscal year 1995, SSA spent $3 billion on these two programs, more than half of the agency\u2019s total administrative expenses for the year. Nevertheless, the agency has acknowledged that it has had difficulty providing a satisfactory level of service to its disability claimants. The process is slow, labor-intensive, and paper-reliant.", "Despite efforts to manage this workload with shrinking resources, SSA has not been able to keep pace with program growth. Initial claim levels remain high, appealed case backlogs are growing, and decisions are not being made in a timely manner. In fiscal year 1995, about 2.5 million initial disability claims were forwarded to state offices for disability determinations, an increase of 43 percent over fiscal year 1990. During the same period, of the applicants requesting an administrative law judge (ALJ) to reconsider a decision denied at the initial claim level, the number escalated from about 311,000 to about 589,000, an increase of 89 percent. Furthermore, SSA is concerned with the amount of time required to process claims\u2014in many cases a claimant waits more than a year for a final disability decision. As of June 1996, processing an initial disability claim averaged 78 days for DI claims and 94 days for SSI claims; the processing time for an ALJ decision averaged 373 days."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Current Eligibility Determination and Appeals Process", "paragraphs": ["Under the current eligibility determination process, DI and SSI disability claims can pass through from one to five decision points, at which eligibility is determined. The initial claim, initial state Disability Determination Service (DDS) decision, reconsideration, ALJ hearing, Appeals Council, and federal court review all involve procedures for evidence collection, review, and decision-making. The decision points within the current disability claims process are shown in figure 1.1.", "To be considered eligible for either program, claimants must meet SSA\u2019s definition of disability. Claimants must also meet work requirements for DI claims and financial eligibility requirements for SSI claims. Under both programs, applications for disability benefits can be initiated at one of SSA\u2019s over 1,300 field offices or through SSA\u2019s toll-free telephone system.", "SSA field office personnel assist with completing the application; obtaining medical, financial, and work history information; and determining whether applicants meet the nonmedical criteria for eligibility. Field offices forward claimant information, along with supporting medical evidence, to a state DDS, of which there are 54. At the DDS, medical evidence is further developed and a final decision is made as to the existence of a medically determinable impairment that meets SSA\u2019s definition of disability. SSA funds the state DDS agencies, provides them with guidance for making disability decisions, and reviews the accuracy and consistency of their decisions. Claimants who are dissatisfied with an initial determination may request reconsideration by the DDS. A reconsideration is conducted by different staff from the original staff, but the criteria and process for determining disability are the same.", "Claimants who disagree with a reconsideration denial have the right to a hearing before 1 of SSA\u2019s 1,035 ALJs in the Office of Hearings and Appeals. At these hearings, claimants and medical or vocational experts may submit additional evidence; attorneys usually represent the claimants. If denied by the ALJ, the claimant may then request a review by SSA\u2019s Appeals Council. The Appeals Council may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the ALJ; the Council may also remand the case to the ALJ for further consideration or development. Finally, the claimant may appeal the Council\u2019s decision to federal court."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why SSA Is Redesigning Its Disability Claims Process", "paragraphs": ["SSA faces increasing responsibilities in the future and must manage its growing workload with fewer resources. SSA has estimated that if it conducts business as usual, it would need the equivalent of about 76,400 workers to handle its workload by the end of the century. Instead, SSA expects to handle this work with about 62,000 workers\u20142,000 fewer than it has today. To successfully manage its growing workload, SSA knows that it must (1) increasingly rely on technology and (2) build a workforce with the flexibility and skills to operate in a changing environment.", "Concerned about managing its workload while reducing administrative costs, saving time, and improving the quality of service, SSA\u2019s leadership decided it needed to redesign its disability claims process. To improve the process, SSA\u2019s leadership turned to business process reengineering. SSA concluded that redesigning its process for deciding disability claims was critical to its goal of providing world-class customer service with fewer resources. In April 1994, we testified that the redesign proposal for the disability process is SSA\u2019s first valid attempt to address major fundamental changes needed to realistically cope with the disability determination workload. We cautioned SSA, however, that many difficult implementation issues would need to be addressed. These include new staffing and training demands, development and installation of technology enhancements, and confrontation with the entrenched cultural barriers to change.", "Reengineering is risky by definition, but if done well it can net positive benefits for the organization. As envisioned, SSA expects the redesigned process will produce tangible savings. However, the bulk of these savings will come from more efficient use of federal and state employees to process disability claims. Greater efficiency will (1) allow the agency to use its current workforce to accomplish other pressing activities and (2) avoid hiring to replace all those who retire or otherwise leave the agency. In addition, SSA expects the redesign will result in intangibles, such as improved customer service, an empowered and better-trained workforce, and increased public confidence in SSA.", "When SSA proposed its redesign, it estimated that it would cost $148 million to administer, with the largest portion of these costs allocated to training activities. However, SSA estimated net savings of $704 million through fiscal year 2001\u2014the year for which full implementation is anticipated. SSA also estimated recurring annual savings of $305 million, once the redesign is fully implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Following Reengineering Best Practices Increases Likelihood for Successful Redesign", "paragraphs": ["While success cannot be guaranteed, leading private organizations have used business process reengineering to identify and quickly put in place dramatic improvements in their operations. The objective of reengineering is to fundamentally rethink and redesign a business process from start to finish, so that it becomes more efficient and, as a result, significantly improves service to customers. There is, however, no \u201cright\u201d way to reengineer and no step-by-step sequence of prescribed activities. Reengineering is highly situational and should be tailored to meet the needs of each organization, according to reengineering experts.", "Nevertheless, today\u2019s leaders in business process reengineering advocate certain critical success features, or best practices, to help organizations increase the likelihood of success. Case studies show that reengineering has failed to achieve the desired change, in part, because managers have not followed best practices. These practices include concentrating on a small number of initiatives at any given time for broad-scoped comprehensive projects; developing and implementing the initiatives quickly; identifying, securing, and maintaining stakeholder support; and having the organizational commitment to initiate and sustain the redesign.", "Concentrating on a small number of initiatives at any given time is essential. According to the experts, reengineering should remain focused to achieve rapid results. Without such focus, an organization risks becoming overwhelmed. Further, once started, the scope of the redesign should not be expanded. Trying to work on too much forces managers to choose among projects, which further dilutes the time and attention required to quickly move the redesign forward.", "Developing and implementing initiatives quickly is also essential. According to some reengineering experts, the time from concept formulation to realizing the first release of a reengineered process should take no more than 12 months. Other reengineering experts note that while the full value of a redesigned process may take 2 to 5 years, individual initiatives should be accomplished in a year or less.", "Identifying, securing, and maintaining stakeholder support is also an essential element of redesign. Stakeholders consist of individuals who are both internal and external to an organization, as well as groups that can influence the organization in some way. For SSA, internal stakeholders include the staff within the organization that will need to adapt to changes in business processes; external stakeholders include the Congress, state employees, labor unions, oversight bodies, key interest groups, customers, and others who oversee, fund, or are affected by SSA\u2019s activities. Managers of redesign should strive to secure and maintain support of all stakeholders. Without such support throughout redesign, the chances of success can be jeopardized.", "Finally, having the organizational commitment to initiate and sustain redesign is another essential element.

Although SSA has begun nearly all of the initiatives it planned to have under way during the first 2 years of its implementation plan, as of July 1996, SSA had (1) not completed any initiative and (2) not begun testing for 14 of the 19 initiatives that contain testing requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Vision for the Redesigned Claims Process", "paragraphs": ["In October 1993, SSA created a Disability Reengineering Project Team to fundamentally rethink and redesign the disability determination process, so as to make it more efficient and improve service to claimants.

The redesigned, user-friendly process emphasizes making correct decisions quickly and efficiently at the earliest possible point. This process is expected to reduce average processing time: for a decision on an initial DI claim, the time would be reduced from 78 days to almost 60 and for a decision on an initial SSI claim, from 94 days to about 60. Similarly, the processing time for appealed cases is expected to be reduced from 373 to 225 days. The steps in SSA\u2019s new process are shown in figure 2.1.", "The goal of the redesigned process is to guide all decisionmakers at all levels to (1) use standards from the same sources for decision-making and (2) make \u201ccorrect\u201d decisions in an easier, faster, and more cost-effective manner at the earliest possible point in the process. SSA states a correct disability decision is one that appropriately considers whether an individual meets the factors of entitlement for disability, as defined by SSA\u2019s statute, regulations, rulings, and policies. According to SSA, correct decisions in the new process depend on these factors: a simplified decision methodology that provides a common frame of reference for determining disability by all decisionmakers in processing claims; consistent direction and training to all decisionmakers; enhanced and targeted collection and development of medical evidence; an automated and integrated claims-processing system that will assist decisionmakers in gathering evidence; a single, comprehensive quality review process; and the creation of the disability claim manager (DCM) position to give claimants direct access to the decisionmaker throughout the process and the opportunity to discuss any claim before it is disallowed.", "Under the redesigned process, a DCM will be the focal point for claimant contacts throughout the process and will be responsible for processing and deciding the initial claim. In the current process, these responsibilities are shared by federal claims representatives and state disability examiners. In the redesigned process, the DCM will take the initial claim, gather and retain claim information, develop medical and nonmedical evidence, share information with medical consultants, analyze information, and make the decision as to whether to allow or deny the claim. If the evidence for the initial claim does not support an allowance before denying the claim, the DCM will issue a predecision notice, advising the claimant of what evidence has been considered and providing the claimant with the opportunity to submit additional evidence. If no evidence is provided or if the evidence provided does not support an allowance, the DCM will deny the claim.", "Claimants who disagree with a DCM decision can appeal the decision to the Office of Hearings and Appeals. When a claimant appeals a decision, an adjudication officer (AO) will interview the claimant and become the primary contact during the appeal. This position is not available under the current process and is being introduced by SSA to make allowance decisions in less time. The AO will review the file, identify the issues in dispute, and determine whether there is a need to obtain additional evidence. The AO will also have the authority to issue a favorable decision, if warranted, or forward the completed claim to an ALJ for consideration. If, after careful review, the ALJ denies the claim, the claimant may appeal the decision to a federal district court.", "Throughout its effort, SSA intends to assess all redesign activities against the Commissioner\u2019s five primary objectives for the redesign.

Such senior executives are a necessary prerequisite for successful reengineering. These executives are the cornerstone of any redesign effort and actively demonstrate the agency\u2019s commitment to initiate and sustain the change. Although SSA recognizes the importance of management stability and continuity to the redesign process, it has experienced turnover in three senior executive positions since implementation began. We did not develop evidence that such turnover has had a negative impact on SSA\u2019s redesign. But continued turnover could result in possible loss of momentum or change of scope or direction. Redesign initiatives that take many years to complete face increased risk\u2014the longer the project runs, the greater the chance that turnover of leadership will occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintaining Stakeholder Support Has Been Challenging", "paragraphs": ["Maintaining stakeholder support is critical to reengineering. Because stakeholders can jeopardize the chances for successful reengineering if they are not committed to it, managers of redesign must seek out and secure support from all stakeholders. Stakeholders have considerable knowledge of the business and organizational environment and can help rally support from other stakeholders.", "SSA identified and tried to involve stakeholders in the redesign, but has encountered problems obtaining and maintaining their support. In September 1993, SSA established an executive workgroup to identify the stakeholders that should be involved in the development and implementation of redesign. More than 140 stakeholders were identified from congressional, federal, state, public, and private groups.", "In its November 1994 redesign implementation plan, SSA called on its federal and state workforce to make the vision a reality. Since then, some actions taken by SSA have raised major concerns for some stakeholders\u2014especially salary issues. According to the president of the American Federation of Government Employees, Local 1923, the union would have opposed the DCM position if SSA attempted to implement it as a grade 11. Under a memorandum of understanding between the union and SSA, those assigned to DCM positions will receive temporary promotions to grade 12, one grade higher than the journeyman level for the claims representative position. However, this action raised concerns for the state DDS directors and their workforce, many of whom believe that the agreement with the union will (1) exacerbate the existing salary gap between state and federal employees and (2) give federal employees a workload that is currently states\u2019 responsibility.", "Another stakeholder disagreement arose following deliberations of a workgroup SSA created to determine how to accelerate testing of the DCM position. This workgroup was comprised of SSA and DDS management, claims representatives and disability examiners, and federal and state union representatives. The workgroup\u2019s final report endorsed SSA\u2019s proposal to test 1,500 DCMs over a 3-year period. Even though DDS representatives were workgroup participants, they did not support SSA\u2019s proposal to test such a large number of positions. At the conclusion of the DCM workgroup\u2019s activities, the NCDDD presented a position paper to the DPRT director. The paper stated that the directors would only agree to a pilot test involving 60 state and 60 federal DCMs.", "On September 11, 1996, the director, DPRT, stated that SSA plans to begin training DCMs in January 1997. Federal employees will receive about 30 weeks of training and state employees about 6. After formal training is complete, a period of coaching and mentoring will take place. The total time envisioned for the formal training and the coaching period is about 18 months. However, as further evidence that stakeholder support is eroding, the director also said that he was not sure there will be a DCM test. He explained that (1) of the 16 states that previously agreed to take part in the test, 3 have decided not to participate and (2) several of the remaining 13 states are now reconsidering their decision to participate.", "Further, SSA has not obtained strong support from a major stakeholder\u2014the NCDDD. The directors manage over 14,000 state employees nationwide, of whom about 6,000 are disability examiners. According to two recent NCDDD surveys, the DDS directors indicated that many states were not strongly supportive of a number of redesign initiatives. According to the first survey, conducted in September 1995, only 3 of the 42 respondents, or about 7 percent, strongly supported redesign. In addition, 17 states, or about 40 percent, either moderately or strongly did not support SSA\u2019s efforts to redesign the disability process. According to the second survey, conducted in January 1996, the DDS directors\u2019 opinions about redesign had worsened, in part due to DCM testing. In response to the question about how the states viewed the overall redesign, 28 of 51 respondents, or about 55 percent, either moderately or strongly did not support redesign. Further, according to the survey, only 1 of 50 DDS directors thought the DCM position could be implemented successfully without all the enablers in place. In addition, 24 of these directors thought the DCM position could never be successfully implemented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions, Recommendation, and Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Given the high cost and long processing time of SSA\u2019s current process, the agency\u2019s redesign, which undertakes a large number of initiatives at one time, is proving to be overly ambitious. Some initiatives are also getting more complex as SSA expands the work required to complete them. This approach is likely to limit the chances for success and has already led to delays in implementation: testing milestones have slipped and stakeholder support for the redesign has diminished.", "As of July 1996, activity is under way for most of SSA\u2019s near-term initiatives; however, none is complete and many are behind schedule. Only about one-fourth of the near-term initiatives that contain testing requirements have been started. Consequently, SSA has not made the progress it intended in order to know whether specific initiatives will achieve the desired results.", "Further, many of the initiatives are complex and have expanded in scope, thus increasing the time frames to complete them. A disadvantage to extending the time frames and delaying implementation is that they increase the likelihood that SSA will experience senior executive changes during the course of the redesign. Moreover, this delay also means that no concrete and measurable results are available to maintain stakeholder support.", "While any one of the problems discussed in this report could possibly be managed and handled successfully, SSA currently faces a multitude of problems that raises questions about the likelihood redesign will succeed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To increase the likelihood that its reengineering project will succeed, given the major delays that SSA has experienced and the risk of further decline in stakeholder support, we recommend that the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration concentrate on accomplishing rapid results through initiatives of smaller, more manageable scope. This effort should include selecting those initiatives most crucial to producing significant, measurable reductions in claims-processing time and administrative costs\u2014including those initiatives intended to achieve process unification, establishment of new decision-making positions, and enhancement of information systems support\u2014and combining those initiatives into an integrated process, testing that process at a few sites, and evaluating the results\u2014before proceeding with full-scale implementation.", "The valuable experience gained in these initial efforts can then be used both to improve the redesign and to build support among stakeholders and potential program beneficiaries. In addition, other initiatives could be undertaken at a later date, when progress is ensured for the initiatives described above and resources become available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In its comments, SSA generally agreed with the thrust of our report and its recommendation. SSA stated it is directing a larger portion of its redesign resources to crucial initiatives. Further, SSA plans to evaluate several key redesign features in early 1997\u2014the single decisionmaker and predecision interview process, elimination of the reconsideration stage, and the proposed adjudication officer (AO) position\u2014in an integrated test. This approach does not, however, include integrated testing of all the initiatives we and SSA now consider crucial. Among the initiatives excluded from this testing approach are process unification, quality assurance, and enhancement of information systems support.", "We continue to believe that SSA, before proceeding with full-scale implementation, should combine all crucial initiatives into an integrated process, test that process at a few sites, and evaluate test results. The approach we recommend is quite similar to one that was under consideration at SSA in 1995. Under that 1995 approach, sites were to serve as comprehensive test locations, with the principal function of integrating and combining all crucial initiatives, including automation and technology enablers.", "In its comments, SSA also expressed some reservations about how quickly it could complete redesign. SSA stated that while other organizations could achieve results quickly, such an expectation regarding SSA\u2019s redesign would be unrealistic, given the scope of the initiatives. But during the course of our work, we identified several instances of large, complex government and private organization redesigns in which significant test results were achieved in a relatively short time. Although testing a fully integrated process may require considerable effort, quick completion would both (1) provide valuable information that would assist SSA in selecting a redesign solution and (2) serve as a concrete demonstration of progress. These two factors should be helpful in building support among stakeholders and potential program beneficiaries.
