Eight of the 13 cabinet agencies surveyed had no formal RDA siting policy, and there was little evidence that agencies considered RDA's requirements when siting new federal facilities. Furthermore, GSA has not developed the cost-conscious, governmentwide location policy recommended by GAO in 1990. In GAO's survey, the sites that involved relocated operations still largely remained in urban areas, while the sites that involved newly established operations were more evenly spread over rural and urban areas. Federal agencies' mission requirements, such as the need to be near clients or other organizations, apparently have led them to select urban areas. GAO found that government functions, such as research and development, data processing, accounting and finance, and teleservice centers, can be located in rural areas. Although it is unclear from the information GAO collected whether any of the federal agencies that located sites in urban areas could have located them in rural areas, it is clear is that RDA has not had the influence on federal siting practices that Congress intended. Many agencies had no RDA policy, as required by the act, and many agency personnel in GAO's survey either did not consider RDA or did not know whether the act was used in making their site selection."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we develop information on the  types of federal functions that lend themselves to being performed at  locations other than Washington, D.C., and federal regional cities.  You  were concerned that federal agencies may not have been considering  locating facilities in rural areas, as required by the Rural Development Act  of 1972 (RDA), particularly in light of recent advances in  telecommunication technology.  You specifically asked that we report on  (1) What executive branch civilian non-Department of Defense functions  have recently selected urban locations other than Washington, D.C., and  the federal cities, compared to rural locations, and what factors, benefits,  and problems were associated with such site selections? (2) What federal laws and policies govern facility location and to what  extent have agencies implemented this guidance?  (3) What lessons can be learned from private sector site selections?  (4) What functions lend themselves to being located in rural areas?", "To answer the first question, we used a questionnaire and follow-up  interviews to survey agency officials regarding 115 sites acquired during  fiscal years 1998 though 2000 by the General Services Administration  (GSA) or other agencies that exercised their independent statutory  authority to acquire sites.  At your request, we excluded moves to  Washington, D.C., and the 10 federal cities.  We chose space of 25,000  square feet or larger in order to review decisions with more significant  economic importance.  To determine what federal laws and policies  govern facility location, we interviewed GSA and other agency officials and  reviewed relevant laws and policies.  We contracted with a consultant who  surveyed 52 private sector companies and reviewed real estate-related  literature discussing private sector site selections to determine what  lessons the public sector could learn from private sector site selections.  To  determine which functions lend themselves to locations in rural areas, we  used results from our questionnaire survey, interviews with real estate and  other officials at 13 cabinet agencies, and observations from the  consultant\u2019s survey.", "For this survey, we defined rural area as an area having a population of  25,000 and under.  We had to select a threshold because RDA is unclear as  to which population size to use for facility siting.  The prior threshold,  which was eliminated in 1996, used a population threshold of 50,000 and  included a population density requirement.  Population density data were  not readily available; therefore, it was not feasible for us to use this  definition.  We chose 25,000 or less because it was used to define rural  areas by several federal agencies for purposes other than federal siting  under RDA and private sector organizations that we identified.  The 25,000  population threshold resulted in the identification of 32 of the 115 sites in  our survey as rural sites.", "We did our work from August 2000 to May 2001 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

According to a GSA policy official, GSA is responsible for  managing the acquisition of about 40 percent of the federal government\u2019s  office space and 10 percent of all government space.  Other agencies, such  as DOD, have their own authority to acquire space.  To acquire real estate,  an agency must either go through GSA using GSA\u2019s statutory authority, use  its own statutory authority, or obtain delegated authority from GSA.  If it is  using GSA, the agency must provide GSA with a \"delineated area,\" the  geographic area where the agency wants to be located.  GSA\u2019s policy  requires its staff to review each delineated area to confirm its compliance  with all applicable laws and regulations. Once an agency has selected a  delineated area, GSA, under CICA, is to acquire the site within the selected  area through the use of full and open competitive procedures.  If an agency  acquires property independently of GSA using its own statutory authority, it  is responsible for compliance with all relevant laws and regulations but is  not subject to GSA regulations.", "In 1990, we were asked by Senator Kent Conrad to look at policies that  guide civilian agencies in selecting facility locations and determine whether  any changes in federal location policies were warranted.  We reported that  GSA needed to develop a more consistent and cost-conscious  governmentwide location policy that required agencies, in meeting their  needs, to maximize competition and select sites that offer the best overall  value, considering such factors as real estate and labor costs.  Since 1990,  at least two matters raised in that report have remained unchanged.  First,  GSA has not developed for congressional consideration the cost-conscious  and consistent governmentwide location policy that we recommended.   The second item that remains unchanged is that rents in the CBAs of  federal regional cities and Washington, D.C., are generally higher than the  rents in non-CBA sections of those same cities\u2014an average of $4.03 per  square foot higher within calendar year 1999, as shown in table 1.", "According to an April 2001 GSA congressional testimony, high rents for  class A commercial space in San Francisco, CA, caused three federal  agencies to move from leased space in San Francisco to leased space in  Oakland, CA, where rates were 25 percent to 30 percent lower.", "One change that occurred since our 1990 report that affected the  workplace is the surge in telecommunications services, including  widespread access to the Internet.

Customs also  reported that its cybersmuggling center needed to be located within the  concentration of private computer-based industries in Fairfax, VA.  U.S. Attorney offices reported that their policy is to be within four  blocks of federal courthouses because, as the principal litigators for the  U.S. government, U.S. Attorneys need to be available for courtroom  activities on a regular basis.

For  example, GSA\u2019s Federal Technology Service reported that it did not  consider a rural area for its site because the function needed to remain in  the Washington, D.C., area to have access to its major customers and  telecommunications providers.", "Other reasons for not selecting rural areas included the need to be near  public transportation and rural areas\u2019 lack of the necessary labor pool and  sufficient space.  Some respondents also said that rural areas can have high  costs, such as for transportation to airports.  The Bureau of Reclamation  stated that a water resources management operation was not located in a  rural area because of the unavailability of a building to meet space needs.", "The IRS said it did not place a telephone\u2212based customer service site in a  rural area because of the need for a large number of recruitment candidates  who were available only in a more heavily populated area.

Agencies  reported that for about 22 percent of the sites in our survey, lower real  estate cost was a factor in the decision.

When asked to rate the  importance of an area\u2019s business climate, 54 percent of respondents in our  consultant\u2019s survey gave it the highest rating.  Business climate factors  include the general business potential and receptivity of a community to  the corporate purpose.  This includes the community\u2019s economic health, its  organization and preparedness for growth, and the capacity of the  community to support future growth of the locating company.   For  example, zoning issues are critical.  Similarly, business incentives, such as  tax abatements, free land, or infrastructure improvements offered by a  community, are indicative of the business climate and are highly important  location decision factors.  According to our consultant, while incentives do  not replace the need for a company\u2019s location to make good business sense,  incentives become a means of distinguishing among otherwise acceptable  alternatives.", "Business incentives were mentioned by only 2 agencies in our survey of 115  sites.  USDA said it chose a site at a local university for wildlife research  because Colorado State University made land available at no cost.  In  return, USDA agreed to work in cooperation with university students on  wildlife research.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said when  the lease expired for its regional office in Kansas City, KS, it relocated to  another location within the city because the city provided free land.  EPA  reported that this was a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation for both the agency and the city  because the agency saved on its real estate costs, and the office benefited  the economically depressed area where it is located.", "The limited use of local incentives by agencies in our survey contrasts with  the emphasis the private sector places on incentives to save costs.  For  example, functions that need not be in proximity to the public or other  facilities\u2014such as training, data processing, document distribution, or  telephone-based servicing\u2014have the potential to take advantage of local  incentives.  While federal agencies cannot take advantage of all local  incentives, such as tax relief, they might make use of other local incentives.   For example, our 1990 report, referred to earlier, noted that the Bureau of  Engraving and Printing chose a site in Ft. Worth, TX, in the late 1980s in  part because of incentives offered by the locality.  The incentives included  the donation of 100 acres of land and construction of a building, a total  package valued at between $12.5 million and $15 million.", "Public policy may have an impact on the extent to which federal agencies  may seek incentives provided by local communities.

We recommended that GSA develop for congressional  consideration a more consistent and cost-conscious govermentwide  location policy that considers such factors as maximizing competition and  taking advantage of lower real estate and labor costs in order for the  government to lower its acquisition and operating costs.  In 1991, GSA  issued a temporary regulation requiring agencies to consider the  availability of local labor pools, pay differentials for employees, local  incentives offered, and real estate costs for prospectus-level projects  whose missions did not dictate a geographic area.

The survey also asked respondents to  pick 1 or more of 12 named reasons why they had chosen their locations.   Survey responses regarding research and development and  storage/inventory facilities that were in rural areas pointed to two factors:  low real estate costs and unique space needs.  For instance, officials  representing four of the eight research and development sites cited their  unique space needs as a reason for their sites\u2019 selection.  Of these sites,  three were in rural areas.  Officials representing five of the eight  storage/inventory facilities also gave this reason, and four were in rural  areas.

Officials from 11 of the 13 cabinet  agencies said they had decentralized 1 or more of the 5 functions by placing  it in regional or even local operating units, including those in rural areas.

For instance, of the seven agencies that said they had  centralized payroll, five said they located that function in cities, including  New Orleans.  The remaining two agencies placed the function in suburbs.   The five agencies that centralized printing said they were doing it at an  urban location\u2014Washington, D.C.  One agency that centralized its training  and benefits administration said it had achieved economies of scale that it  feared would be lost if any part of that centralized operation was relocated  to a rural area.", "At least six agencies represented in these interviews identified one or more  problems with rural areas.  One official cited difficulty in recruiting  minority employees because some rural areas tend to lack minorities.  Such  areas, this official said, also may pose sufficient cultural adjustments for  minorities and minority employees may not wish to relocate to these areas.   Other officials cited cost concerns.  Officials for five agencies, for instance,  said rural areas can involve personnel-related costs, such as the cost of  relocating employees or of recruiting and training replacement workers.   Officials from three agencies also expressed concern over the relatively  higher cost of travel to rural areas, with one asserting that this made such  areas poor choices for training sites.  Three agencies also raised concerns  about facility costs, stating that the lack of available office space in rural  areas would force them to build new facilities and lose agency  infrastructure investments at current locations.  Three agency officials also  told us that their urban operations were in those areas because of factors  intrinsic to urban areas, such as the availability of public transportation  and proximity to the operations of other agencies or private sector  organizations.", "The full impact of telecommunications advancements in office location  decisions is still uncertain.

However, of the 11 cabinet agencies that discussed the benefits and  drawbacks of rural telecommunications, only 2 agencies said  telecommunications advances had made rural locations more viable.  The  other nine agencies expressed concern about telecommunications service  in rural areas, with five saying that sophisticated telecommunications  services are not always available or can be costly when they are available.   Three agencies also said telecommunications is of less importance to siting  decisions than other factors, and one of these expressed concern that rural  telecommunications networks are inherently less secure than urban ones.   On a positive note, five agencies saw telecommunications benefiting  employees by, for instance, allowing benefits data and training to be  offered on-line or by allowing employees to work from home or from the  sites where they are conducting inspections.", "The private sector offered similar views.

Eight of the 13 cabinet agencies  surveyed had no formal RDA siting policy, and there was little evidence  that agencies considered RDA\u2019s requirements when siting new federal  facilities.  Further, GSA has not developed for congressional consideration  a cost-conscious, governmentwide location policy, as we recommended in  1990.", "In our survey, the sites that involved relocated operations still largely  remained in urban areas, while the sites that involved newly established  operations were more evenly spread over rural and urban areas.  Federal  agencies\u2019 mission requirements, such as the need to be near clients or other  organizations, apparently have led them to select urban areas.  Other  factors that led them to select urban areas are the availability of public  transportation and particular space needs.  A major factor that influences  private sector site selection for urban areas was the availability and cost of  skilled labor.  Other private sector factors included real estate cost, access  to transportation, and business incentives.  In choosing the geographic area  for a facility, the private sector more often cites cost considerations and  incentives offered by states and local areas than did the federal agencies in  our survey.", "Several government functions, such as research and development, data  processing, accounting and finance, and teleservice centers, can be located  in rural areas.  Although it is not clear from the information we collected  whether any of the federal agencies that located sites in urban areas could  have located them in rural areas, one matter that is clear is that RDA has  not had the influence on federal siting practices that the Congress appears  to have intended when RDA was enacted.  Many agencies had no RDA  policy, as required by the act, and many agency personnel in our survey  either did not consider RDA or did not know whether the act was used in  making their site selection decisions.  If agencies had RDA policies and  agency personnel were aware of and considered them, certain constraints  would still exist that impede efforts to locate in rural areas, such as  inadequate infrastructure for high-speed telecommunications, limited  public transportation, and a limited labor force.", "In the future, some of these constraints may be mitigated for a number of  rural areas, but for the federal government to cost effectively consider rural  as well as urban areas, we believe the following must occur:  The government needs to have a cohesive, governmentwide site location  policy that considers costs to the government as well as the goal of  enhancing the socioeconomic status of urban areas and rural areas.  We  do not believe that the public policy objectives of assisting either urban  or rural areas in a way that will allow agencies to fully and effectively  achieve their missions preclude agencies from considering other factors  such as the availability and cost of labor, real estate costs, operational  costs, and certain local incentives.  In fact, a more cost-conscious  federal siting policy may even increase agencies\u2019 consideration of rural  areas, since rural areas may have lower overall costs. However, we also  recognize that in making siting decisions, the agency\u2019s ability to achieve  its mission can be a more important consideration than costs.", "Federal agencies need to have clearly stated and documented policies  on site location that conform to governmentwide policy, including RDA;  and GSA and other agencies need to document their consideration of  RDA to ensure consistent policy application.

The Administrator stated that  references in our report to GSA as the government\u2019s central real property  management agency were somewhat misleading, since GSA administers  only about 10 percent of the total federal real property inventory and,  therefore, GSA has no authority to establish governmentwide policy.   However, we note that GSA\u2019s mission statement identifies it as one of three  central management agencies in the federal government.  According to  GSA, its inventory includes 40 percent of all federal office space, which is  occupied by 1 million civilian federal employees, approximately half of the  total federal civilian workforce. Thus, GSA\u2019s policies would affect almost  half of the federal government\u2019s civilian office space, the type of space that  was included in our survey.", "We agreed with the Administrator\u2019s statement in his comments that  agencies acquiring property independently of GSA are not subject to GSA  regulations, and we have revised this report accordingly.", "The Administrator also said that our 1990 report, which we referred to in  our draft report, called for GSA to develop a governmentwide location  policy, and he added that GSA could not have done so since it lacked the  authority.  Our 1990 report did not call on GSA to develop this policy under  its authority, but instead recommended that GSA propose a policy to  Congress as a matter for consideration.  The Administrator also said GSA  had no mechanism for implementing a governmentwide leadership role in  1990, while that might be possible now through its Office of  Governmentwide Policy.  As previously mentioned, we recommended in  1990 that GSA develop such a policy for congressional consideration.", "The Administrator also said our draft report implied that GSA selected the  geographic area for agencies\u2019 site acquisitions.  We did not intend that  implication, and we have revised this report to clarify that issue.", "In addition, the Administrator pointed to GSA\u2019s efforts to make its customer  agencies aware of RDA requirements.  In our report, we noted GSA\u2019s  regulations require RDA compliance by customer agencies.  Nonetheless,  RDA was not often used in the site acquisitions we surveyed, and some  agencies said they were not aware of RDA requirements.", "The Administrator also responded to our recommendation that GSA  require written statements from each customer agency demonstrating that  the agency had given first priority to locating in a rural area and, if a rural  area was not selected, the agency also include a justification for the  decision to GSA.  He agreed to require a written statement from customer  agencies regarding use of RDA in site acquisitions.  However, he did not  agree to asking for a justification because he said this would put GSA into  the position of second-guessing the agencies because he believes that the  agencies have authority to decide where to locate their facilities.  While we  agree with GSA on the latter point, we remain convinced that a justification  is needed to help document that agencies gave first priority to rural areas  when they did not choose a rural area.   We are not recommending that GSA  be required to evaluate these justifications.", "The Administrator also responded to our recommendation that GSA define  \u201crural area\u201d to provide agencies with a single definition for the purpose of  federal siting under RDA until the Congress amends RDA to define the  term.  He said GSA will develop a definition for use by its customer  agencies, but it has no authority to establish a definition for all federal  agencies.  We clarified our report to reflect GSA\u2019s authority to develop a  definition only for its customers. GSA did agree, however, to issue a  bulletin to make other agencies aware of this definition.  We believe that  GSA\u2019s definition should be useful to other agencies until Congress amends  RDA to set forth a statutory definition.", "We also received written comments from the Department of the Interior\u2019s  Acting Assistant Secretary of Policy, Management and Budget dated July 3,  2001, which are reprinted in appendix VIII.  The Acting Assistant Secretary  responded that the agency generally agreed with the findings and agreed in  part with the matters for congressional consideration and the  recommendations for executive action.  Our report suggested that  Congress consider enacting legislation to require agencies to consider  certain costs along with agency mission when deciding whether to locate a  site in a rural or urban area.  He responded that our suggestion should be  limited to the establishment of new offices because agencies have different  considerations, for example, relocation costs, when expanding operations  at an existing location, as compared to establishing a new office.  We did  not intend our recommendation to apply to situations in which an agency  expands an operation at an existing site that does not involve a relocation  or establishment of a new site.  We clarified our recommendation in this  regard.", "The Acting Assistant Secretary also commented that our recommendation  that GSA require customer agencies to provide a written statement to GSA  demonstrating that the agency had given first priority to a rural area should  (1) be required only if the agency does not select a rural area, (2) be limited  to a minimum dollar threshold that would exempt certain locations from  the documentation requirement, and (3) exempt operations that are being  expanded in the same local area.  Our recommendation, as noted in the  draft report, states that all site decisions should include a written statement  to GSA and a justification only should be provided if a rural area was not  selected. Although we agree that the establishment of a minimum dollar  threshold may be reasonable conceptually, we note that RDA does not  include a dollar threshold for application of the act\u2019s requirements. We also  believe that expansions of existing operations should be subject to this  requirement if they might involve a relocation.", "The two Department of the Treasury components in our survey also  provided written comments. We received comments from IRS\u2019 Director of  the Office of Real Estate and Facilities Management dated June 26, 2001.   IRS\u2019s comments on this report covered four areas: (1) the use of RDA, (2)  compliance with RDA requirements, (3) agencies\u2019 ability to consider costs  when selecting new sites, and (4) technical considerations.", "With respect to the first point\u2014use of RDA, IRS said that   the RDA\u2019s encouragement of locating in rural areas needs to be balanced  against other legal requirements that sometimes contradict RDA  requirements, such as those of CICA, and OMB and congressional  budget requirements and limitations, and short-term and long-term cost  considerations;  a \u201crural area\u201d should be defined in a way that achieves the intent of the  RDA and be based on terms other than population alone; and  if Congress supports a location policy that is economically rather than  socially based, then Congress should repeal RDA and replace it with  legislation that would require  agencies to meet specific threshold terms  specified in the legislation.", "We agree that agencies need to consider a variety of legal requirements  when selecting a new site for their facilities as well as costs. However, the  statutory requirement imposed by RDA must be given priority. We also  believe that if Congress defines \u201crural area\u201d for purposes of RDA, it may  want to consider factors in addition to population.  By stating in our report  that cost factors should be considered in the location process, we are not  suggesting that Congress enact a location policy based solely on  economics.  Rather we are saying that cost should be one of the factors  considered in the decisionmaking process.", "With respect to its second point, on compliance, IRS said that agencies  selecting their own sites without GSA assistance are to be held directly  accountable for compliance with RDA and, therefore, GSA should not be  required to evaluate or enforce compliance with the RDA.  Additionally, IRS  said that if an agency is using GSA to acquire a site, a simple statement that  the agency considered the RDA should be sufficient.  We recommended  that GSA require a written statement only for federal agencies subject to its  authority.  We are not recommending that GSA enforce compliance with  RDA for agencies that have and use their own authority to acquire space.   In those cases where GSA acquires space for other agencies, we believe  that providing GSA with a justification for a site selection that includes the  reasons for not choosing a rural area under the RDA will help document  that the agency gave consideration to RDA.", "Regarding IRS\u2019s third point, IRS said that, in considering costs, most  agencies have no means to assess project costs, such as real estate or labor  costs, across geographic areas. The agency added that market data on rural  areas are not readily available or readily accessible to compare them with  alternative geographic areas.  We believe that GSA and OPM can provide  much of the information needed to do cost analyses.  Furthermore, private  sector companies are able to make such analyses and gain access to them.   Finally, several agencies in our survey said their site selection process  included cost analyses of alternative geographic areas as well as cost  analysis of sites within a geographic area.", "Regarding IRS\u2019s fourth point, its technical comments, IRS thought we  should make distinctions between leased occupancies and new federal  construction because of the greater time commitment for continued  occupancy in new construction.  We do not agree with IRS on this point.   RDA does not distinguish between leased and owned space, and in our  view, it is as important to consider costs and other factors regardless of  whether space is leased or owned, particularly considering that many  leases are for long time periods.", "On July 3, 2001, we received written comments from the U.S. Customs\u2019  Director, Office of Planning, which are reprinted in appendix IX.  The  Director responded that Customs concurred with the report\u2019s  recommendation to GSA to revise its guidance on federal facilities and  stated that information in the report about Customs\u2019 facility acquisition  process and factors used by Customs to select the sites in our survey was  correct.  He also stated that when Customs acquires property under its  existing statutory authority, it utilizes the same process as GSA; and,  although not mentioned in our draft report, Customs applies GSA\u2019s basic  policy to house agencies in existing federally owned and leased space  before acquiring additional space.  The Director of Planning also stated that  many of Customs\u2019 facilities are unique because the operation requires  proximity to the border, an airport, or a seaport, and difficulties sometimes  arise in complying with RDA and the pertinent executive orders because  many of the land border crossings, airports, and seaports are not located in  the central business area of either a rural area or an urban area.

We chose to look at sites acquired independently of GSA to  determine whether agencies, when acting independently, engaged in  practices that were different from those of agencies that used GSA for their  acquisitions.  We looked at those sites that were acquired from fiscal years  1998 to 2000.  In establishing an appropriate site size to study, we wanted to  choose sites that were large enough to have some economic impact on the  community in which they were located, that were sufficient in number to  provide useful information, and for which sufficient information was  available.", "Accordingly, we decided to consider only those sites with space of 25,000  square feet or more.  Regarding manageability, GSA advised us that spaces  of this size were small enough that they would be found on GSA\u2019s inventory  in all of its 11 regions.  Concerning economic impact, GSA advised us that  spaces of 25,000 square feet or more would tend to be associated with a  relatively larger number of employees than spaces of less than 25,000  square feet and would consequently have a greater economic impact.   Finally, in considering the availability of information, we discovered that if  a space has 25,000 or more square feet, the agency requesting that site can  officially appeal any GSA revision of the delineated area in which that  agency wishes to search for a site.  As a result, we thought the appeals  process would make information on such sites more readily available.", "We selected fiscal years 1998 through 2000 to obtain the most recent  complete data available.  As agreed with your office, we excluded  Washington, D.C., and the 10 agency regional cities because of your request  to see site acquisitions made outside of those cities.", "We focused exclusively on new sites, rather than locations where leases  had been renewed.  In addition, we excluded spaces acquired by the  judicial and legislative branches of the federal government because these  branches are not subject to the Rural Development Act (RDA), which is  applicable to executive departments and agencies.

We  excluded the sites acquired by the United States Postal Service (USPS)  because USPS advised us that it had little or no discretion in deciding  where to locate most of its facilities, in that they needed to be in specific  locations to serve customers or near airports.  In addition, the Postal  Reorganization Act of 1970 exempts USPS from federal laws relating to  contracts and property.

We subsequently contacted the 33  agencies, asking each whether it had, independently of GSA, used its  statutory authority to acquire, during fiscal years 1998 through 2000, sites  that met our criteria.  All 33 agencies responded, and 12 agencies identified  37 sites meeting these criteria.  Of the 12 agencies, 5 were not among the  29 agencies represented by the 81 sites GSA helped agencies to acquire.   Therefore, our total universe was 118 sites (81+37) represented by 34  agencies (29+5).  Using a 28-question, mail-out survey form,  we surveyed  agency officials at the 118 sites.

For example, differences in  how a particular question is interpreted by the survey respondents could  introduce unwanted variability in the survey's results.  We took steps in the  development of the questionnaire, the data collection, and the data editing  and analysis to minimize nonsampling errors.

However, RDA\u2019s definition for rural  was unclear, and we found application of it would be impractical.  For the  purpose of locating federal facilities, RDA states that rural areas shall be  defined as those areas identified by the private business enterprise  exception in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1926(a)(7).  Prior to 1996, the private business  enterprise exception in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1926(a)(7) defined rural areas as  including all territory of a state that is not within the outer boundary of any  city having a population of 50,000 or more and its immediately adjacent  urbanized and urbanizing areas with a population density of more than 100  persons per square mile, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture,  according to the latest decennial census of the United States.  In 1996,  7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1926(a)(7) was amended and no longer includes the private  business enterprise exception.  Therefore, the appropriate definition of  rural area under RDA is unclear. Furthermore, we identified two problems  with the pre-1996 definition.  First, determining the population density for  communities adjacent to these federal sites was not feasible within the  scope of this job.  Second, the term \u201couter boundary\u201d in this definition lacks  specificity.", "The current definition of rural in 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 1926(a)(7) is for purposes of  water and waste disposal grants and loans and defines rural as a city, town,  or unincorporated area that has a population of no more than 10,000  inhabitants.  We are not certain that this is the appropriate definition since  it refers to water and sewer grants and not the private business enterprise  exception.  The prior threshold, which was eliminated in 1996, used a  population threshold of 50,000 and included a population density  requirement.  Population density data were not readily available; therefore,  it was not feasible for us to use this definition.", "For this survey, we chose a threshold of 25,000 or less because it was used  to define rural areas by several other federal agencies and private sector  organizations that we identified.  When we applied this population  threshold of 25,000 to the sites on the list of 81 GSA-acquired federal sites,  we determined that 23 were located in rural communities; and of the 37  sites that agencies acquired independently of GSA, 9 were located in rural  communities.  Thus, our survey included a total of 32 rural sites.
