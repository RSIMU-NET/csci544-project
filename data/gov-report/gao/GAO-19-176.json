GAO assessed (1) how IRS defines its workforce needs and develops strategies for shaping its workforce; (2) the extent to which IRS identified the critical skills and competencies it will require to meet its goals, and its strategy to address skills gaps in its workforce; and (3) the extent to which IRS's Human Capital Office has the capacity to hire employees in hard to fill positions.", "GAO analyzed trends in staffing across IRS and in selected mission critical occupations; compared IRS strategic workforce management processes, practices, and activities with federal regulations and leading practices; analyzed IRS documents and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has scaled back strategic workforce planning activities in recent years. IRS officials told GAO that resource constraints and fewer staff with strategic workforce planning skills due to attrition required IRS to largely abandon strategic workforce planning activities.", "However, a number of indicators, such as increasing rates of retirement eligible employees and declining employee satisfaction, led IRS to determine that continuing to make short-term, largely nonstrategic human capital decisions was unsustainable. One way IRS sought to address these issues was to develop a strategic workforce plan and associated workforce planning initiative. Initiative implementation, however, is behind schedule and on hold. IRS attributed the delay to a combination of: 1) personnel resources redirected to implement Public Law 115-97\u2014commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 2) lack of workforce planning skills within its Human Capital Office, and 3) delayed deployment at the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) related to a new workforce planning system. As a result, IRS lacks information about what mission critical skills it has on board, where skills gaps exist, and what skills will be needed in the future.", "IRS staffing has declined each year since 2011, and declines have been uneven across different mission areas. GAO found the reductions have been most significant among those who performed enforcement activities, where staffing declined by around 27 percent (fiscal years 2011 through 2017). IRS attributed staffing declines primarily to a policy decision to strictly limit hiring. Agency officials told GAO that declining staffing was a key contributor in decisions to scale back activities in a number of program and operational areas, particularly in enforcement, where the number of individual returns audited from fiscal years 2011 through 2017 declined by nearly 40 percent.", "IRS has skills gaps in mission critical occupations, and the agency's efforts to address these skills gaps do not target the occupations in greatest need, such as tax examiners and revenue officers. However, the results of an interagency working group effort that began in 2011, and was intended to address skill gaps among IRS revenue agents and other occupations with skills gaps across the government, may hold important lessons for addressing skills gaps in other mission critical occupations at IRS.", "IRS's Human Capital Office has limited staffing capacity to hire employees in hard to fill positions, which holds risks for the agency's ability to implement the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. IRS is undertaking a variety of activities to improve its hiring capacity, but has not determined how each activity will be evaluated and will contribute to increased hiring capacity or associated outcomes. In addition, changes in the agency's hiring processes have been confusing to managers and contributed to hiring delays. Clear guidance on hiring request requirements would better position IRS to avoid the risk of hiring delays for mission critical occupations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations to IRS that include implementing its delayed workforce planning initiative, evaluate actions to improve the agency's hiring capacity, and address changes in its processes that have contributed to hiring delays.

In our past work, we  have noted how an organization\u2019s workforce defines its character, affects  its capacity to perform, and represents its knowledge base. An agency\u2019s  workforce, including its human capital office, can play a central role in  transforming an agency into a high-performing organization. Cultivating a  well-equipped, diverse, flexible, and engaged workforce requires strategic  workforce planning. Strategic workforce planning addresses two critical  needs: (1) aligning an organization\u2019s human capital program with its  current and emerging mission and programmatic goals; and (2)  developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining  staff to achieve those programmatic goals.", "You asked us to review IRS\u2019s enterprise-wide strategic workforce  planning efforts.

We  analyzed documents that explain IRS\u2019s programs, policies, and practices  designed to help the agency recruit, develop, and retain the critical staff  needed to achieve program goals, and interviewed IRS officials. We met  with Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and Taxpayer Advocate  Service officials to understand their role and responsibilities for  coordinating with and providing oversight of IRS activities. We compared  IRS\u2019s practices for monitoring and evaluating progress toward human  capital goals, including bi-monthly reporting, with requirements articulated  in Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regulations and leading  practices we have previously identified for monitoring and measuring  program performance. We analyzed results from the 2011 through 2017  Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) and compared them with  IRS activities to determine how well those activities meet staff needs. We  analyzed OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI) data to  determine retirement eligibility of senior and nonsenior IRS staff and staff  across the federal government.", "To address objective 2, in addition to activities we performed to address  objective 1, we analyzed Office of Management and Budget data to  determine trends in the number of full-time equivalents (FTE). We  interviewed IRS business division officials and reviewed documents  related to IRS tax examiners and revenue officers. We selected these two  mission critical occupations from a nongeneralizable sample based on a  number of factors, including the results of a Treasury risk assessment, to  illustrate how IRS has implemented strategies, policies, and processes for  identifying and addressing skills gaps, among other purposes. We  interviewed Treasury, OPM, and IRS officials to determine how they  identified and addressed skills gaps among another mission-critical  occupation, IRS revenue agents. To determine staffing trends within  these occupations, we analyzed data from EHRI. We interviewed IRS  officials to understand how its Human Capital Office (HCO) conducts  skills and competency assessments. We analyzed IRS\u2019s audit rate of  individual and corporate returns for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 based  on data reported by IRS in its annual Data Book.", "To address objective 3, we reviewed documentation related to IRS  human resources (HR) hiring requirements, including the Internal  Revenue Manual (IRM) and policies explaining the exception hiring  process. We interviewed officials from each of IRS\u2019s major business  divisions\u2014Wage and Investment, Large Business and International, Tax  Exempt and Government Entities, and Small Business/Self-Employed\u2014to  further understand their hiring experience and impressions of time-to-hire  and candidate quality results. We reviewed the results of skills and  competency assessments previously conducted of IRS\u2019s HR workforce.  We interviewed senior officials responsible for IRS\u2019s hiring function. We  also reviewed the purpose of systems used to process and onboard new  hires. To examine how staffing changed for hiring human resource  managers from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, we analyzed EHRI data.  To assess data reliability, we reviewed our past data reliability  assessments of systems we used and conducted electronic testing to  evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the data used in our  analyses. For EHRI and FEVS, we also conducted interviews with  knowledgeable agency officials. We determined the data from these  systems were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to March 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In February 2011, we narrowed the focus of this high-risk  issue to the need for agencies to close skills gaps in mission-critical  occupations. Agencies can have skills gaps for different reasons: they  may have an insufficient number of employees or their employees may  not have the appropriate skills or abilities to accomplish mission-critical  work. Moreover, current budget and long-term fiscal pressures, the  changing nature of federal work, and a potential wave of employee  retirements that could produce gaps in leadership and institutional  knowledge threaten to aggravate the problems created by existing skills  gaps.

IRS requested  an additional $397 million to cover implementation expenses for Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act over the next 2 years and received $320 million for  implementation pending submission of a spending plan, which IRS  provided in June 2018. We previously reported IRS would direct the  majority of the money toward technological updates.", "The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made a number of significant changes to the  tax law affecting both individuals and corporations. For example, for  individual taxpayers, for tax years 2018 through 2025, tax rates were  lowered for nearly all income levels, personal exemptions were eliminated  while the standard deduction was increased, and certain credits, such as  the child tax credit, were expanded. To implement the changes, IRS  must (1) interpret the law; (2) create or revise hundreds of tax forms,  publications, and instructions; (3) publish guidance and additional  materials; (4) reprogram return processing systems; and (5) hire  additional staff and train its workforce to help taxpayers understand the  law. IRS\u2019s HCO estimated that the agency would need to hire and train  new staff to fill approximately 1,100 positions requiring a variety of  competencies, and provide additional training on tax law changes for  current employees.

Prior to 2011, IRS staff within its HCO or other dedicated program  office conducted and coordinated agency-wide strategic workforce  planning efforts. IRS officials told us that resource constraints and fewer  staff with strategic workforce planning skills due to attrition since 2011  required HCO to largely abandon strategic workforce planning activities.  Instead, HCO generally focused its efforts on completing HR transactions,  such as retirements and benefits processing, meeting legal compliance  activities, and facilitating hiring of seasonal employees.", "Since 2011, key human capital activities\u2014such as developing an  inventory of skills, identifying skills gaps, and attrition forecasting\u2014 became increasingly fragmented and shifted to the individual business  divisions and program offices. IRS officials cited management familiarity  of programmatic needs, challenges, processes, and culture as a benefit  of workforce planning autonomy at business divisions and program  offices. However, the officials told us these activities were often  performed only to the extent those divisions had the time, resources, and  top management interest. As a result, the quality of key human capital  activities was uneven across the agency, if performed at all. In addition,  HCO officials told us the lack of an agency-wide strategy and HCO  authority to manage and coordinate strategic workforce planning efforts  put the agency at greater risk for unnecessary duplication of effort in HR activities; development of redundant and generally noninteroperable systems  used to maintain human capital information; and  failure to effectively identify and retain personnel with critical skills and  experience across the agency.", "IRS\u2019s Information Technology (IT) is an example of an individual program  office that has taken steps to address skills needs. IT developed a skills  and competency inventory of its workforce. IRS officials told us  maintaining and updating the inventory has been particularly helpful to  informing IT hiring and training decisions, given the rapid nature of  change in the technology industry and competition for top talent from the  private sector. In June 2018, we found IRS had not fully implemented any  of the key IT workforce planning practices we have previously identified.  We recommended IRS should fully implement IT workforce planning  practices, including (1) setting the strategic direction for workforce  planning; (2) analyzing the workforce to identify skills gaps; (3) developing  strategies and implementing activities to address skills gaps; and (4)  monitoring and reporting on progress in addressing skills gaps. IRS  agreed with our recommendation, but stated its efforts to address these  issues were limited solely due to diversion of IT resources to  implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We concluded that until the  agency fully implemented these practices, it would continue to face  challenges in assessing and addressing the gaps in knowledge and skills  that are critical to the success of its key IT investments.", "A number of indicators led IRS to determine that continuing to make  short-term, largely nonstrategic human capital decisions was  unsustainable, according to IRS officials. For example, IRS has relatively  high rates of employees eligible to retire. Nearly half of IRS\u2019s Senior  Executive Service (SES) is eligible to retire (see figure 2). Retirement  eligibility rates among both SES and non-SES employees is not only  greater than the rate at other federal agencies, but are also trending  higher according to our analysis of OPM data.", "We have previously reported that the high rate of federal employees  eligible for retirement creates both an opportunity and a challenge for  agencies. If accompanied with appropriate strategic and workforce  planning, it may create an opportunity for agencies to align their  workforce with needed skills and leadership levels to meet their existing  and evolving mission requirements. However, it means agencies will need  succession planning efforts as well as effective sources and methods for  recruiting and retaining candidates to avoid the loss of technical expertise  in mission-critical skills. IRS is trying to mitigate the loss of institutional  memory and meet its current obligations by re-employing recently retired  employees (also known as re-employed annuitants). However, according  to HCO officials, as of October 2018, the agency is struggling to bring  recently retired employees back in part because many had taken other  employment. HCO is focusing on other activities, such as contract staffing  services, to meet workload demands. As we discuss later in this report,  IRS is taking a number of actions to address staffing shortages, but the  effectiveness of those efforts are not yet known.", "IRS\u2019s FEVS results also indicate the agency is at risk of losing employees  with critical skills. For example, IRS\u2019s results for the Global Satisfaction  Index\u2014a measure generated by OPM that combines employees\u2019  responses about satisfaction with their job, pay, the organization, and  their willingness to recommend their organization as a good place to  work\u2014fell below the government-wide average in 2013. Relatedly, our  analysis of fiscal year 2016 IRS exit survey results found 32 percent of  separating employees indicated poor office morale strongly influenced  their decision to leave. Though improving since 2015, IRS continued to  lag behind the government-wide average as of 2017, the most recent  year of data available at the time of this study (see figure 3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Initiative Delay Has Hampered IRS\u2019s Ability to Fully Address Its Workforce Needs", "paragraphs": ["In 2016, IRS determined the agency needed to develop a strategic  workforce plan and conduct related workforce planning activities to help  mitigate the risks associated with fragmented human capital activities as  discussed above, according to HCO officials. IRS provided authority to  HCO to be the central coordinating body to lead that effort, hereafter  referred to as the workforce planning initiative. In March 2018, IRS issued  an update to its Internal Revenue Manual stating HCO\u2019s responsibilities.  For example, IRS provided HCO authority to:  conduct strategic workforce planning annually that is aligned with  Treasury\u2019s mission, goals, and objectives; perform data analysis of the current and future workforce, identify  gaps, and submit solutions that will enable the organization to meet its  mission, goals, and objectives; ensure the existence and integration of human capital planning  functions into the workforce planning process, including skills  assessments, competency models, recruitment planning, training and  development, and retention and succession planning; provide guidance and direction for IRS-wide workforce planning ensure the implementation of an agency-wide skills assessment and  competency model framework; and  communicate commitment for a consistent, repeatable, and  systematic workforce planning process to enable improved and  integrated management of human capital initiatives.", "The IRM also describes IRS\u2019s workforce planning process, which includes  a five-phase strategic workforce planning model that is intended to align  with OPM\u2019s workforce planning model (see figure 4).", "Implementing the strategic workforce planning model and conducting  related initiative activities could help the agency ensure its human capital  programs align with its mission, goals, and objectives through analysis,  planning, investment, and measurement, as required in federal  regulation. Furthermore, we determined elements of the initiative  addressed key principles we have previously identified for effective  workforce planning. For example, the model includes steps to analyze  the workforce to determine the critical skills and competencies the agency  needs to achieve current and future programmatic results, and to monitor  and evaluate the agency\u2019s progress toward its human capital goals. As a  result, the initiative could position IRS to systematically identify the  workforce needed for the future, develop strategies for identifying and  closing skills gaps, and shape its workforce.", "However, IRS\u2019s implementation of its workforce planning initiative has  been delayed. Phase 1 (Enterprise Strategy and Planning) of the  workforce planning initiative was underway as of the first quarter of fiscal  year 2018, and IRS was scheduled to complete this phase by the second  quarter of fiscal year 2018. IRS reports show the agency originally  anticipated completing all five phases by June 2018. According to IRS  officials, however, IRS now anticipates Phase 1 activities to resume after  the opening of the 2020 tax filing season and, as of November 2018,  could not estimate a completion date for any of the five phases.", "The workforce planning initiative has been delayed for three primary  reasons, according to IRS documents and officials:  1.  Redirection of resources to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  implementation. IRS granted extensions at the request of business  divisions and commissioner-level organizations that needed to  redirect resources to support the implementation of Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. To implement the 119 provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act, we reported that IRS would need to (1) interpret the law; (2)  create or revise nearly 500 tax forms, publications, and instructions;  (3) publish guidance and additional materials; (4) reprogram 140  interrelated return processing systems; (5) hire additional staff and  train its workforce to help taxpayers understand the law and how it  applies to them; and (6) conduct extensive taxpayer outreach. In  addition to redirecting staff, IRS has used overtime and compensatory  hours to complete necessary activities in time for the 2019 filing  season.  2.  Lack of workforce planning skills. As part of a Treasury pilot, IRS  conducted a self-assessment of key competencies within HCO as well  as within business division-based HR offices. The assessment found  competency around workforce planning was among the lowest ranked  skills within HCO. According to HCO officials, IRS lacks training and  resources available to help its human capital staff develop  competency in workforce planning. HCO officials told us they plan to  leverage IRS\u2019s Workforce Planning Council to develop strategic  workforce planning skills. HCO officials told us the council has  training designed to help the HR staff understand how to gather data,  use technology, and perform other activities that contribute to IRS\u2019s  strategic workforce planning efforts. In addition to a lack of strategic  workforce planning skills, a number of key HCO personnel with  strategic workforce planning expertise have recently separated from  IRS, according to HCO officials.  3.  Information system deployment delay. Treasury is developing the  Integrated Talent Management system (ITM). Treasury intends ITM to  provide the agency with greater visibility of its total workforce, and  help its bureaus, including IRS, with workforce planning activities such  as succession planning and competency management. Treasury  officials told us as of November 2018, ITM is still in development and  its deployment has been delayed for a number of reasons, including  the need for Treasury to complete system implementation plans and  user guides, and address system administration issues at the  bureaus.", "IRS HCO officials told us they opted to wait on ITM rather than  moving forward with a number of Phase 2 (Workforce Analysis)  activities. IRS HCO officials said they needed this, or a similar  software tool, to ensure reliable data capture, make analysis more  efficient, and help managers conduct routine updates of workforce  planning efforts rather than static, one-time data calls. HCO also  opted to wait for ITM to avoid potentially redundant reprogramming of  existing systems. However, HCO officials noted that even when ITM is  eventually deployed, IRS would need to train business divisions on its  use, further lengthening the time needed before conducting Phase 2  activities. Treasury officials told us that ITM would complement rather  than replace existing systems and processes.", "Our analysis of Treasury documents and interviews with Treasury and  IRS HCO officials found it was unclear when an ITM module related to  talent management and strategic workforce planning will be deployed  and available for IRS\u2019s use, the functions it will include, and how IRS\u2019s  existing systems and processes would be affected. As a result, IRS  lacks the information needed to make staffing and technology  decisions related to the workforce planning initiative, putting the  initiative at risk of further delay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Could Improve Reporting on the Status of its Workforce Planning Initiative", "paragraphs": ["Treasury is required to conduct data-driven reviews via HRstat. HRStat  is a strategic human capital performance evaluation process that  identifies, measures, and analyzes human capital data to inform the  impact of an agency\u2019s human capital management on organizational  results with the intent to improve human capital outcomes. HRstat is also  a proven leadership strategy that can help agency officials monitor their  progress towards addressing important human capital efforts, such as  closing skills gaps.", "Treasury uses HRstat to monitor the progress of its bureaus in meeting  their human capital goals, including IRS\u2019s implementation of the  workforce planning initiative. In preparation for the data-driven reviews,  each bureau, including IRS, submits HRStat information to Treasury.  Treasury and bureau officials discuss the results and make related  strategic decisions during bi-monthly Human Capital Advisory Council  meetings. Our review of IRS HRstat reports, however, found additional  information is needed to more fully reflect the status of the workforce  planning initiative and related challenges. For example:  in the January, March, May and July 2018 HRstat submissions, IRS 1)  reported a status of green (on schedule) for \u201cIncreased efforts for  development of long-term IRS workforce staffing plan\u201d, and 2)  indicated under Key Issues/Challenges that completing the initiative  was dependent on ITM deployment;  in the July 2018 HRstat submission, IRS moved several milestones to  future fiscal years, and identified ITM delays as a significant risk to the  workforce planning initiative schedule;  in the September 2018 HRstat submission, IRS reported the status of  the workforce planning initiative was no longer on schedule. The  report identified ITM delays as the cause, but did not include other  reasons for the delay, specifically the redirection of resources to Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act implementation and a lack of strategic workforce  planning skills within HCO.", "Federal strategic human capital standards state agencies are to  communicate in an open and transparent manner to facilitate cross- agency collaboration to achieve mission objectives. In addition, agency  leaders should hold managers accountable for knowing the progress  being made in achieving goals and, if progress is insufficient, understand  why and having a plan for improvement.

One way IRS sought to control costs was  its decision to implement the Exception Hiring Process beginning in fiscal  year 2011.

We asked  each business division for information about related MCOs, including: hiring data and retirement eligibility rates for MCOs;  skills, competency, or staffing gaps identified among its MCOs; and any resource tradeoff decisions made as a result of skills gaps.", "To supplement the information we gathered from responses to our written  question responses, we also reviewed IRS and Treasury documents for  addressing skills gaps for revenue agents that were conducted after we  identified mission critical skills gaps as a government-wide high-risk issue  in 2011.", "For objective 3, to assess the extent IRS\u2019s Human Capital Office has the  capacity to hire employees in hard to fill positions, we reviewed  documentation related to IRS hiring requirements, including the Internal  Revenue Manual and policy explaining the Exception Hiring Process. We  interviewed division directors from each of IRS\u2019s major business divisions  (W&I, LB&I, TE/GE, and SBSE) to understand their hiring experience and  impressions of time-to-hire and candidate quality results related to the  exception hiring process. We interviewed senior officials responsible for  IRS\u2019s hiring function. We reviewed documentation related to systems  used to process and onboard new hires.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to March 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact:", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments:", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Tom Gilbert (Assistant Director),  Shea Bader (Analyst-in-Charge), Crystal Bernard, Jacqueline Chapin,  James Andrew Howard, Meredith Moles, Steven Putansu, and Robert  Robinson made major contributions to this report.
