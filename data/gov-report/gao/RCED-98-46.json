With the lessening of tensions between the United States and Russia, efforts began to reduce the inventory of both countries\u2019 excess plutonium. In early 1994, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin endorsed the goal of nuclear arms reduction and directed experts to begin studying options for the long-term disposition of plutonium and other nuclear materials.", "In 1995, the United States declared that 38.2 metric tons of weapons-grade plutonium was no longer needed for national security and was, therefore, excess. DOE also designated 14.3 metric tons of non-weapons-grade plutonium as excess. Because a portion of the plutonium declared excess is scrap or residue with low contents of plutonium, it is unsuitable for fabrication into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel and is better suited for immobilization instead. According to DOE, plutonium scheduled for disposition will come primarily from (1) metal that may have been in a retired nuclear weapon, (2) oxides, (3) unirradiated fuel, and (4) irradiated fuel. Securing plutonium derived from these sources will require conversion into forms that meet the \u201cspent fuel standard.\u201d This standard, which was introduced by the National Academy of Sciences and endorsed by DOE, requires that plutonium be made roughly as unattractive and difficult to retrieve and use in nuclear weapons as the plutonium that exists in spent fuel from commercial nuclear power reactors. DOE plans to convert about 50 metric tons of excess plutonium into forms suitable for eventual disposal. Of the total, DOE plans to immobilize about 17 tons and could process the remainder as MOX fuel, although a final decision on whether to burn or immobilize this plutonium has not been made.", "As figure 1 shows, it is estimated that Russia has about twice as much weapons-usable plutonium (consisting of weapons-grade and other grades) as the United States.", "At the April 1996 Summit on Nuclear Safety and Security held in Moscow, the leaders of the G-7 countries plus Russia called for further study of ways to manage excess nuclear materials, including plutonium. In October 1996, representatives from many countries, including the United States and Russia\u2014as well as representatives from private industry\u2014met in Paris and concluded that (1) the safe and effective management of excess nuclear materials is technically feasible; (2) no solution is rapid, simple, and inexpensive; and (3) two existing technologies\u2014burning the plutonium as a fuel in nuclear reactors and immobilizing the plutonium in glass or ceramics\u2014are viable, complementary disposition options.", "An interagency group has been established in the United States under the joint chairmanship of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Security Council to oversee plutonium disposition. DOE, as the agency with primary responsibility for managing the disposition of plutonium, established the Office of Fissile Materials Disposition, which is responsible for implementing nuclear materials storage and disposition.

However, achieving these reductions is a formidable challenge because DOE\u2019s immobilization and MOX technologies have not been demonstrated on an industrial scale in the United States, and licensing, regulatory, environmental, economic, and transparency (assurance that plutonium to be dispositioned comes from weapons) issues need to be addressed for both disposition options. Furthermore, Russia may not have the financial resources to implement its program in a time frame that would be comparable to the U.S. disposition schedule.", "In January 1997, DOE formally announced that it would pursue two technologies to convert excess plutonium to safer, more proliferant-resistant forms. For planning and analysis purposes, DOE anticipates converting about 50 metric tons of excess plutonium over the next 25 years. The total U.S. plutonium inventory is approximately 99.5 metric tons. On the basis of preconceptual design data and preliminary plans, DOE estimates that implementing its plutonium disposition program\u2014excluding long-term storage\u2014will cost approximately $2.2 billion. This amount includes DOE\u2019s costs to immobilize plutonium as well as to burn MOX fuel. By using a disposition strategy that uses both technologies, DOE hopes to maximize the likelihood of the U.S. program\u2019s being successfully completed. DOE also hopes that the U.S. plan for MOX fuel will provide additional encouragement for Russia to undertake a reciprocal disposition program.", "According to U.S. government officials, ultimately it is important that both countries agree to reduce their remaining plutonium stockpiles to equivalent levels. The Deputy Minister of Russia\u2019s Ministry of Atomic Energy (MINATOM) told us that Russia\u2019s only acceptable disposition option for the bulk of its excess plutonium is burning it in nuclear power reactors because Russia considers the plutonium a valuable source of energy. The Deputy Minister also noted that Russia favors burning MOX fuel because this process\u2014unlike immobilization\u2014changes the content of the plutonium, thereby making it difficult to use in a nuclear weapon.However, according to State Department officials, MINATOM\u2019s Minister has also stated that immobilization may be acceptable for scrap and low-grade residues.", "According to DOE officials, the United States will not fully implement its plutonium disposition program unless Russia implements a comparable plutonium disposition program. DOE\u2019s Acting Director of the Office of Fissile Materials Disposition told us that it would be unacceptable for DOE to request full funding to convert approximately 50 metric tons of U.S. plutonium into more proliferant-resistant forms without Russia taking corresponding actions. DOE officials told us that, in their opinion, a U.S.-only plutonium disposition program would not be supported by the Congress because it could put the United States at a strategic disadvantage. Furthermore, by acting unilaterally, the United States would lose leverage in future negotiations with Russia on plutonium disposition. A Department of State official told us that other nations would be concerned that a program involving only the United States would have a marginal impact on reducing the worldwide risks of nuclear proliferation. Officials from the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) noted that there are risks and costs if the United States does not pursue plutonium disposition even if Russia does not implement a similar program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disposition Technologies Have Not Been Demonstrated on a Large Scale in the United States", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s plutonium disposition program is expected to be completed in about 25 years but faces technological uncertainties that could increase program costs and time frames because neither disposition technology has been demonstrated on an industrial scale in the United States. Although immobilization has been used for other purposes, it has never been used on a large scale for plutonium disposition. Unresolved questions include how the plutonium will react in the immobilization processing, how stable and durable the immobilized material will be, and how difficult it will be to recover the plutonium from the immobilized forms and use it in nuclear weapons.", "MOX fuel derived from reactor-grade plutonium has been used extensively in nuclear power reactors throughout Europe, and the technology is well established. Although the technology is well known, the United States has no nuclear power reactors licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to burn MOX fuel. Furthermore, MOX fuel derived from weapons-grade plutonium has not been burned in commercial nuclear power reactors except on a test basis in Russia. The United States has no facilities to make MOX fuel and DOE has not determined the number or locations of the commercial nuclear power reactors that will be needed to burn MOX fuel. Resolving these issues will depend not only on the development of the disposition technologies but also on contract negotiations with nuclear reactor owners, licensing requirements, and environmental reviews. However, according to DOE, the overall technical risk of either disposition option is relatively low.", "Uncertainties also exist with the underground repository where DOE plans to permanently dispose of excess plutonium. While DOE assumes that a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, will be ready to accept the plutonium in 2010 (12 years later than originally planned), it can not be certain that the repository will open.

Russia produces about 1.5 metric tons of plutonium each year at nuclear reactors at Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk. The plutonium is produced by Russian reactors that also provide heat and electricity to nearby cities. In 1994, Russia agreed to shut down those reactors by 2000. However, in 1997, the United States and Russia signed an agreement to modify the reactors rather than permanently shut them down, as a means of stopping the production of weapons-grade plutonium. The United States has been providing assistance to complete the modifications, although progress in implementing the agreement has been slow.", "U.S. officials believe, however, that Russia is making some progress toward establishing a framework for a plutonium disposition program. For example, in July 1997, Russia\u2019s President Yeltsin established a committee under his Defense Council to oversee Russia\u2019s plutonium disposition, including developing a plan. Furthermore, in September 1997, President Yeltsin declared that Russia would remove up to 50 tons of plutonium from its stockpile over time\u2014roughly the same amount that the United States declared excess. According to DOE, the costs for the disposition of about 50 metric tons of plutonium in Russia could range from $1 billion to $2 billion.", "In developing a plutonium disposition program, Russia faces the same technological issues as the United States. Furthermore, Russia\u2019s ability to undertake a successful program depends upon international financial assistance. According to the Deputy Minister of MINATOM, the pace of Russia\u2019s program will depend on the financial support it receives from the international community, including the United States. France and Germany are considering financing\u2014with some Russian support\u2014a pilot facility in Russia to convert plutonium into MOX fuel. French government officials told us, however, that although the donor governments can be expected to provide some of the financing, most of it will have to come from European investors. They noted that private investment is uncertain because potential investors may not be willing to accept the financial risk without some assurances that the MOX fuel fabrication enterprise in Russia will be commercially viable.", "Officials from DOE, the State Department, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, as well as representatives from some nations with a commercial and/or security interest in supporting Russia\u2019s disposition efforts (e.g., France, Germany, Canada, and Belgium), told us that insufficient funding is a major obstacle to implementing a disposition program in Russia. As is the case in the United States, major capital expenditures are needed in Russia to build a plutonium conversion plant, construct a MOX fuel fabrication facility, and modify and license nuclear power reactors to burn the MOX fuel.", "Russia\u2019s limited number of nuclear power reactors that are capable of burning MOX fuel could affect its ability to disposition its excess plutonium in a time frame comparable to that of the United States. Although Russia has seven operational VVER-1000 pressurized water reactors, which are capable of burning MOX fuel, DOE officials and other experts said that it is possible that Russia could use up to six of these reactors. In addition, another type of reactor, a BN-600 at Beloyarsk, could be used. According to Canadian officials, if Russia\u2019s four VVER-1000 reactors and the BN-600 reactor were used to burn the MOX fuel, it would take at least 40 years to burn about 50 metric tons of Russia\u2019s plutonium. According to DOE, if Russia also used the two other VVER-1000 reactors, the plutonium could be burned in 28 years.", "A 1996 State Department analysis noted that if Russia\u2019s VVER-1000 reactors were used, their planned 30-year operating lives would have to be extended. This extended usage could have an impact on the overall cost of the Russian program because modifications to the reactors may be required. Figure 2 shows the location of Russia\u2019s VVER-1000 reactors, a BN-600 reactor, and the sites where weapons-grade plutonium has been or continues to be produced.", "Note : The numbers within the symbols show the number of reactors at each site.", "DOE officials said that 11 additional VVER-1000 reactors operating in Ukraine could be used to burn plutonium, thereby accelerating the rate of disposition. According to DOE, an additional VVER-1000 reactor, if completed, could also be used. Russia\u2019s Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy told us that there have been some preliminary discussions with Ukraine\u2019s government officials about using their reactors to burn MOX fuel and that they did not have serious concerns about using their reactors.", "Although concerns exist about the number of VVER-1000 reactors that Russia may use to burn MOX fuel, experts believe these reactors can burn the fuel derived from weapons-grade plutonium safely. Officials from DOE, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as representatives from France, Belgium, and Germany, told us that it is technically feasible for MOX fuel derived from weapons-grade plutonium to be used in these reactors. While some of these officials recognize that additional testing and analysis is required, they told us that there are no major technical impediments to burning MOX fuel safely.", "According to a September 1996 U.S.-Russian plutonium disposition study,preliminary analyses indicate that the VVER-1000s could safely burn MOX fuel, though some modifications to the reactors might be necessary. The study (1) estimated that the cost to modify the seven VVER-1000 reactors totaled $77 million and (2) noted that Russia could complete construction of three partially built VVER-1000 reactors, which could help increase the consumption of MOX fuel.

As we reported in September 1996, the United States and Russia were unable to conclude an agreement specifying exactly how prior Russian assurances of access would be implemented at an interim storage facility at Mayak.This facility, which is partially being constructed with U.S. funds, is expected to store 50,000 containers of material from dismantled nuclear weapons in Russia. The lack of progress in agreeing on inspection rights at Mayak is due largely to a U.S.-Russian impasse on completing a broader agreement on reciprocal access measures.", "Currently, there are no formal negotiations between the United States and Russia on implementing a plutonium disposition program. U.S. government officials told us, however, that such an agreement should be signed within the next 2 to 3 years or else the future of the U.S. disposition program could be jeopardized. In their view, an agreement should be in place\u2014and Russia needs to begin a parallel program\u2014before the United States begins to spend significant funds to construct U.S. facilities, such as the immobilization facility and associated processing facilities and the MOX fuel fabrication plant.

Most of this funding is designated to construct a pilot-scale facility in Russia to convert the plutonium metal removed from nuclear warheads into plutonium oxide, a fine powdery substance of plutonium combined with oxygen. Once in this form, the plutonium would be subject to international inspection and could either be immobilized in glass or ceramics or be used in MOX fuel. According to DOE officials, the pilot facility should begin operations in 2005.

Furthermore, there is a concern that Western assistance would help create a MOX fuel industry in Russia that does not now exist and would increase the risk of the diversion or the theft of nuclear material.", "DOE\u2019s decision to burn plutonium in the form of MOX fuel in commercial nuclear reactors has focused attention on plutonium\u2019s value as an energy source but also has raised concerns about nuclear proliferation. The United States does not encourage the civilian use of plutonium and does not engage in plutonium reprocessing to generate nuclear power.However, many countries, including France, Belgium, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Japan, believe that plutonium is a valuable fuel and have programs to reprocess and recycle it.", "DOE officials and representatives from the U.S. nuclear industry told us that the disposition program does not conflict with or reverse established U.S. policy\u2014as some critics contend\u2014because it does not include reprocessing and recycling and is limited to plutonium that has been separated from nuclear weapons. They have maintained that by burning MOX fuel without reprocessing, the United States is focusing on ultimately eliminating plutonium, not creating more. According to DOE, controls will be placed on the program for fabricating MOX fuel. For example, the U.S. government would own and control the MOX fuel fabrication facility, which would be located at a DOE site. Furthermore, the facility would only be used for the disposition program, and no spent fuel would be reprocessed or recycled. DOE and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy officials stated that DOE\u2019s MOX fuel program will not provide the United States any plutonium reprocessing capability that is not now readily available on the commercial market.", "In contrast, other government officials, a member of Congress and representatives from nongovernmental organizations, such as the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, have indicated that DOE\u2019s decision to pursue the MOX fuel option may pave the way for the future civilian use of plutonium in the United States. For example, they believe that the disposition program will provide experience in making and using MOX fuel that the United States does not now have. Others maintain that burning MOX fuel will establish a precedent that would serve to justify the future commercial use of plutonium. They also contend that the activities of the civilian nuclear industry have been kept separate from military activities to reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation and to encourage the rest of the world to maintain a similar standard.", "A November 1996 memorandum from the Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) highlighted many of these proliferation concerns. According to the Director, (1) using MOX fuel would establish an infrastructure, at least in part, for the domestic civil use of plutonium; (2) employing both disposition technologies would undermine U.S. efforts to discourage the reprocessing of plutonium in other countries, such as South Korea and Russia; and (3) placing the two options on equal footing would be contrary to U.S. nonproliferation policy.", "Subsequently, ACDA\u2019s Director acknowledged that reserving the right to use both the MOX fuel and immobilization options was consistent with U.S. policy. ACDA officials told us that their agency\u2019s concerns had been significantly tempered because DOE\u2019s final disposition plan, announced in January 1997, did not favor one disposition strategy over another.

The other 28.7 metric tons in DOE\u2019s analysis came from such other plutonium-bearing sources as components, metals, and oxides that were by-products from the production of nuclear weapons.", "Retirements of warheads have occurred for several reasons including treaties and weapons modernization efforts that supplant the need for some older or less reliable warheads. For example, a 1991 report of the Committee on Armed Services, U.S. House of Representatives, identified concerns about the W69, a warhead for air-launched missiles on bomber aircraft. The warhead did not have such modern design features as fire-resistant plutonium. The concern was that an accident involving the warhead could scatter plutonium over a wide area or, in the very worst and far less likely case, result in a nuclear explosion.", "Table 1.1 lists the fully retired classes of warheads that are sources of plutonium scheduled for disposition.", "In addition, a small portion of the 21.3 metric tons of excess plutonium comes from individual retired warheads among the current classes of warheads. Current warhead classes are listed in table 1.2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Energy-Russian Demonstration Projects for Plutonium Disposition Technology", "paragraphs": ["This appendix discusses six U.S-Russian plutonium disposition demonstration projects.

The United States and Russia are studying the possibility of using these reactors for this purpose, but a substantial amount of analysis is required. These reactors, which use uranium fuel, may provide a technically attractive option because their design allows them to handle MOX fuel with fewer changes than would be expected with light water reactors. Studies have indicated that CANDU reactors could burn MOX fuel at a greater rate than U.S. reactors. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is coordinating the effort to test MOX fuel from the United States and Russia in a Canadian test reactor\u2014the National Research Universal Reactor.", "The scope of the project involves fabrication, irradiation, and post-irradiation examination of a small number of MOX fuel rods over 18 months.

As part of that effort, DOE would pay for manufacturing the Russian fuel, transporting it to a Russian port, and for licensing oversight in Russia. The contract, however, was not signed then because of disagreements about the amount of money that would be provided to the Bochvar Institute to fabricate the MOX fuel, the intellectual ownership of the fabrication rights, the legal implications of transporting plutonium outside of Russia, and the possible imposition of Russian taxes on U.S.-funded assistance.", "The U.S. fuel has not been delivered to Canada because the United States was awaiting resolution of the disagreements concerning the Russian contract.
