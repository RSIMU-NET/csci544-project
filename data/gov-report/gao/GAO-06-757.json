While these incidents were false alarms, DOD and other federal and local agencies responded. The Postal Service suspended operations at two of its facilities and over a thousand DOD and Postal Service employees were given antibiotics as a precaution against their possible exposure to anthrax.

By the time the contractor notified DOD 3 days later, suspect mail had already been released and distributed throughout the Pentagon. DOD evacuated its mail-screening and remote delivery facilities, notified federal and local agencies, and dispensed antibiotics to hundreds of employees. The Skyline Complex incident began the same day when Fairfax County, Virginia, emergency personnel responded to a 911 call placed by a Skyline employee that an alarm had sounded on a biosafety cabinet used to screen mail. Local responders closed the complex and decontaminated potentially exposed employees, and DOD dispensed antibiotics to the employees. Similarly, the Postal Service suspended operations at two facilities and dispensed antibiotics to its employees. Laboratory testing later indicated that the incidents were false alarms. Analysis of these incidents reveals numerous problems related to the detection and response to anthrax in the mail. At the Pentagon, DOD's mail-screening contractor did not follow key requirements, such as immediately notifying DOD after receiving evidence of contamination. At the Skyline Complex, DOD did not ensure that the complex had a mail security plan or that it had been reviewed, as required. The lack of a plan hampered the response. DOD also did not fully follow the federal framework--including the National Response Plan, which was developed to ensure effective, participatory decision making. Instead of coordinating with other agencies that have the lead in bioterrorism incidents, DOD unilaterally dispensed antibiotics to its employees. DOD has taken numerous actions that address problems related to the two incidents. At the Pentagon, DOD's actions included selecting a new mail-screening contractor and defining the roles and responsibilities of senior leadership, including those involved in making medical decisions. Related to Skyline, DOD prohibited its mail facilities in leased space within the Washington, D.C., area from using biosafety cabinets to screen mail unless the equipment is being operated within the context of a comprehensive mail-screening program. While DOD has made significant progress in addressing the problems that occurred, its actions do not fully resolve the issues. One remaining concern is whether DOD will adhere to the interagency coordination protocols specified in the national plan for future bioterrorism incidents involving the Pentagon. This concern arises because, more than 1 year after the incident, DOD reiterated that it has the authority to make medical decisions without collaborating or consulting with other agencies. DOD also has not ensured, among other things, that its mail facilities (1) have the required mail security plans and (2) are appropriately using biosafety cabinets for screening mail."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the fall of 2001, when five persons, including two U.S. Postal Service  Since the fall of 2001, when five persons, including two U.S. Postal Service  employees, died from exposure to anthrax-contaminated mail delivered  employees, died from exposure to anthrax-contaminated mail delivered  through the U.S. mail system, the nation has been acutely aware of the  through the U.S. mail system, the nation has been acutely aware of the  danger of bioterrorism using anthrax and other potentially fatal bacteria.  danger of bioterrorism using anthrax and other potentially fatal bacteria.

The anthrax bacterium is commonly found  in the soil and forms spores (like seeds) that can remain dormant in the  environment for many years. Human anthrax infections are rare in the  United States and are usually the result of occupational exposure to  infected animals or contaminated animal products, such as wool, hides, or  hair. Although infection in humans is rare, a person can die if airborne  anthrax spores are inhaled into the lungs. Once airborne, there is greater  possibility that the spores will be inhaled. Medical experts believe that  symptoms of inhalation anthrax (sore throat, muscle aches, and mild  fever) typically appear within 4 to 6 days of exposure, depending on how  the disease is contracted. While anthrax is potentially fatal, individuals  who are exposed to anthrax spores will not necessarily develop the  disease. Inhalation anthrax can be treated with antibacterial drugs, but  medical treatment does not necessarily ensure recovery. Anthrax is not  contagious.", "Anthrax is a potential terrorist weapon because, if refined and introduced  into letters and packages, anthrax spores can be released into the air as  letters are processed or opened. The use of the mail as a vehicle for  transmitting anthrax threatens the nation\u2019s mail stream and places the  American public and federal employees at risk. This is what occurred in  2001, when letters containing anthrax contaminated at least 23 Postal  Service facilities and killed five of 22 individuals diagnosed with anthrax,  including two Postal Service employees.

LRN laboratories   (1) perform standard testing methods specified by CDC to either rule out  or confirm the presence of anthrax and (2) provide public health  organizations and others with rapid test results for use in making public  health decisions. Generating a final test result involves both a presumptive  and confirmatory test. Presumptive tests can be obtained within 2 hours  and are considered \u201cactionable\u201d from a public health perspective.

NIMS applies to all levels of government, and for the  federal government, including DOD, it is prescriptive. A key component of  NIMS is the incident command system, which is designed to integrate the  communications, personnel, and procedures of different agencies and  levels of government within a common organizational structure during an  emergency.

After screening the mail in a facility at the Pentagon  remote delivery facility, Vistronix employees routinely collected swab  samples from four filters and sent them to CBI for analysis. According to  Vistronix\u2019s account of events associated with the incident, about 4:00 p.m.  on Friday afternoon, March 11, a representative from CBI informed the  Vistronix Director that one of four swab samples collected and tested from  Thursday\u2019s mail was positive for anthrax. The Director requested the  laboratory to conduct additional testing over the weekend but did not  notify Defense Post Office officials of the initial positive test results. On  Monday morning, March 14, at about 6:00 a.m., the Vistronix Director  informed a member of his staff (the site supervisor) that while additional  laboratory results for Thursday\u2019s mail had not yet been received, test  results for Wednesday\u2019s mail were negative, and, therefore, Wednesday\u2019s  mail was cleared for release. The site supervisor misunderstood the  conversation, incorrectly concluding that mail from both days could be  released from quarantine, and, consequently, he called his staff to release  the mail. At about 6:30 a.m., Thursday\u2019s mail was released, and, shortly  thereafter, employees of the Defense Post Office began processing the  mail for distribution. According to Vistronix, at about 9:10 a.m., the  laboratory notified Vistronix that additional testing of Thursday\u2019s swab  sample was also positive. By the time Vistronix notified a Defense Post  Office official of the second test result at about 9:25 a.m., an unspecified  amount of the mail suspected of containing anthrax had already been  picked up and distributed throughout the Pentagon.", "These developments initiated a wide-ranging response. At about   10:15 a.m., a Defense Post Office official notified the Pentagon Force  Protection Agency (PFPA)\u2014the law enforcement agency responsible for  protecting people, facilities, and infrastructure on the Pentagon  Reservation.

First, only one of the four  swab samples collected and tested from the filters on Thursday was  positive for anthrax. If an actual incident had occurred, FBI officials said,  it would have been reasonable to expect that all four samples would have  been contaminated because, based on experience gained during the fall of  2001 anthrax attacks, once airborne, anthrax spores disperse over a wide  area. In addition, tests conducted on Friday\u2019s mail were negative. FBI  officials said that if anthrax had contaminated Thursday\u2019s mail, it would  likely have contaminated the entire mail-screening facility, leaving residual  spores that also would have been detected in the samples taken from  Friday\u2019s mail.

DOD health officials estimate that, in total,  they dispensed an initial 3-day course of antibiotics to about 889  potentially affected employees. According to the officials involved, their  decision to immediately dispense antibiotics as a precautionary measure  was based on the laboratory\u2019s positive test results and their experiences  gained in the fall of 2001. DOD\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs told  us that at about 1:00 p.m., he conferred with the CDC Director about  DOD\u2019s medical decision, and that she agreed with the decision.

The first of these calls was  convened by HHS officials at about 5:00 p.m. Officials from HHS said the  purpose of the conference call was to obtain a basic understanding of  what had occurred at the Pentagon (and at the Skyline Complex, where  the second incident had already begun), so that decisions could be made  on how to respond appropriately. According to HHS and DHS officials,  decision makers needed answers to such questions as what analysis had  been done, what procedures had been used by the contract laboratory, and  how the Pentagon samples had been collected. Obtaining such information  was critical to determining whether people had been exposed to anthrax,  whether the two incidents were linked, and what the appropriate response  should be.

Both the contract and the approved mail  inspection procedures provided specific notification requirements for  informing DOD of potential biohazardous situations involving the  Pentagon\u2019s mail. The contract required Vistronix to notify PFPA  \u201cimmediately\u201d if there were any evidence of risk or possible contamination  of the mail.

Specifically, while the Vistronix Director was aware of an initial positive  test result on Friday, he did not ensure that the mail remained quarantined  until receipt of negative test results from the laboratory. Instead,  miscommunication among Vistronix staff led to the mail\u2019s release several  hours before the laboratory informed Vistronix that its weekend test  results were also positive for anthrax.

The officials explained that even if they had  known which guidelines DOD expected to be followed, they did not have  the technical expertise to determine whether the contract\u2019s testing  provision was being followed. Defense Post Office officials further  explained that the contract was awarded quickly in 2001 after the  nationwide anthrax attacks. Their office was tasked with overseeing the  contract, they said, because at that time the office was the \u201cexecutive  agent for mail in the Pentagon\u201d\u2014not because it had any expertise or  training on these matters. According to Defense Post Office officials, the  lack of technical expertise regarding anthrax at that time contributed to  the lack of clarity in the contract\u2019s testing provision. Their lack of  expertise also caused them to conclude that CBI met all CDC and federal  guidelines, in part, because Vistronix had informed DOD that CBI was a  certified CDC laboratory that adhered to CDC guidelines. An independent  review of CBI, the subcontract laboratory, sponsored by DOD and  conducted in April 2005 found that CBI analyzed the Pentagon\u2019s samples  using testing methods that differed from CDC\u2019s guidance and protocols.  The review also found that Vistronix\u2019s contract with CBI did not require  the laboratory to verify its testing methods. By March 2005, DOD and  Vistronix had had 3-\u00bd years to specify its testing requirements for the  contract. An unclear contracting provision, combined with the lack of  oversight by both DOD and Vistronix, resulted in the use of a laboratory  whose testing methods were unknown and whose results were not  actionable. The effect of these events was evident when DOD officials  could not adequately explain to other agency officials what (1) tests CBI  had conducted, (2) methods CBI had used, and (3) the results meant.  DOD\u2019s inability to provide adequate answers to these and other crucial  questions exacerbated the incident at the Pentagon and slowed the  response since officials from other agencies were skeptical of the  laboratory\u2019s results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "At the Skyline Complex, Basic Response Procedures Were Inadequate or Absent Altogether", "paragraphs": ["At the Skyline Complex, basic procedures for responding to a  biohazardous incident were inadequate or absent for the TMA mail facility  in the Skyline Complex. The following three key elements were either  inadequate or absent.", "First, TMA did not ensure that mail room procedures addressed  what to do, or whom to notify, when the equipment alarm sounded  or that employees were properly trained on the equipment. TMA is  responsible for ensuring that adequate procedures are in place and  effective training occurs, so that employees can perform their duties  competently. Although some procedures were in place at the Skyline  Complex, they did not address the capabilities of the biosafety cabinet or  what to do if the alarm on the equipment sounded. At the time of the  incident, the mail room\u2019s procedures provided, among other things, (1)  basic instructions for using the biosafety cabinet, including how to turn  the machine on and off and how to open the mail, and (2) information  about whom to notify when a suspicious package was discovered. The  procedures did not address what the biosafety cabinet did, how it worked,  or how to respond to its built-in alarm. The TMA mail manager noted that  training on the biosafety cabinet had occurred when the machine was  purchased in 2001, but no subsequent training had been conducted. In the  meantime, he said, staff turnover and the absence of additional training  had led to a lack of understanding about the equipment\u2019s capabilities. In  addition, while the procedures specified whom to call if suspicious mail is  discovered, the procedures did not address whom to contact when the  equipment\u2019s alarm sounded. If procedures were adequate and periodic  training had occurred, employees would likely have known that, although  the equipment had a negative airflow system with filters for capturing and  holding any particles that fell from envelopes or packages being opened  within the equipment, it did not detect biohazards and its alarm sounded  only to indicate an airflow obstruction. Instead, in conjunction with the  phone call indicating an unspecified problem with the Pentagon\u2019s mail,  mail room employees assumed the alarm was signaling the presence of  biohazards in the mail. Because TMA employees lacked adequate  information and training on the equipment, they unnecessarily contacted  first responders.", "Second, neither TMA nor DOD ensured that the required mail  security plan was in place. Both TMA and DOD have responsibilities for  ensuring that an adequate mail security plan exists for the mail room in the  Skyline Complex. GSA\u2019s federal mail management regulation and DOD\u2019s  mail manual both require mail security plans for agency mail rooms.", "According to GSA\u2019s regulation, security plans must include (1)  procedures for safe and secure mail room operations, (2) plans for training  mail room personnel, and (3) plans for annually reviewing agency and  facility-level mail security plans. In addition, DOD\u2019s mail manual requires  DOD\u2019s mail room officials to ensure that their mail security plans are  coordinated with local security officials. TMA did not develop the required  security plan. If TMA had developed a plan and coordinated it with local  officials, Fairfax County emergency personnel\u2014the local first  responders\u2014may have learned about the biosafety cabinet\u2019s limitations,  including the meaning of the equipment\u2019s audible alarm. Furthermore,  DOD did not ensure that TMA had developed a plan, or attempt to review  it for adequacy, as required. GSA\u2019s federal mail management regulation  requires that facility level mail security plans be annually reviewed.  Moreover, as specified in the regulation, DOD must annually report to GSA  that its mail security plans have been reviewed by a competent authority  within the past year. GSA officials noted that DOD\u2019s Official Mail Manager  submits a certification form to GSA annually; however, the form does not  indicate that DOD\u2019s (1) plans exist and that (2) the plans have been  reviewed by a competent authority in the past year. Instead, the form  submitted to GSA simply certifies that DOD has the requisite requirements  in place. According to DOD\u2019s Official Mail Manager, he cannot certify that  all DOD mail rooms have mail security plans or that they have been  reviewed by a competent authority because DOD does not have a process  in place to ensure that the required reviews take place. He further  explained that he lacks the time and resources to review the plans. If TMA  and DOD had followed the applicable requirements, the problem that  occurred at the Skyline Complex may have been avoided.", "Third, the Defense Information Systems Agency had not developed  an Occupant Emergency Plan. GSA requires agencies of GSA-controlled  buildings to have an occupant emergency plan for protecting life and  property during an emergency. Critical elements of the plan include (1)  evacuation and sheltering-in-place information; (2) contact information  and emergency phone numbers; and (3) specific information about the  building\u2019s construction, including its floor plans. The highest ranking  official of the largest agency in each GSA-controlled building is  responsible for developing and maintaining the occupant emergency  plan. In March 2005, the Defense Information Systems Agency (Defense  Agency) was the largest agency in the Skyline Complex. According to  officials from the Defense Agency, they were aware of the agency\u2019s  responsibility for developing the occupant emergency plan as early as  June 2002. Defense Agency officials had drafted a plan by the time of the  incident, but had neither distributed it to other federal occupants of the  complex nor coordinated it with first responders. Moreover, employees  had not been trained on the plan and affected federal agencies had not  agreed to or signed the plan. Officials of the Defense Agency commented  that developing an occupant emergency plan takes a great deal of  coordination among participating agencies, which prolongs the plan\u2019s  completion. The lack of a required occupancy emergency plan contributed  to the difficulties that employees and first responders experienced during  the incident. For example, first responders had difficulty getting critical  information to employees because contact information was not readily  available for federal employees in the complex. In addition, since  information about the complex was not readily available, some employees  were able to exit the complex because Fairfax County police, who had  attempted to secure the Skyline Complex, were unaware of all the existing  exits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Did Not Fully Follow the Federal Framework for Coordinating Responses at the Pentagon", "paragraphs": ["DOD did not fully follow the federal framework for coordinating a  response to the potential anthrax incident at the Pentagon; instead, it  chose to make decisions on its own. The federal framework is set forth in  the NRP and NIMS, which specifies a structured and coordinated  approach for involving federal, state, and local agencies in decision  making. The unifying element of this framework is the ability to harness  the resources of various agencies whose expertise and knowledge help  ensure informed decisions about how to proceed in any given situation.  While DOD initially followed NIMS when it established its incident  command at the Pentagon, as the incident evolved, key aspects of the  federal framework were not followed. Here are three examples:    First, DOD did not fully follow NRP\u2019s notification structure. NRP\u2019s  Biological Incident Annex requires every federal agency to first notify the  FBI if it becomes aware of an overt threat involving biological agents.", "While DOD officials did notify the FBI, it was not until almost 3 hours after  they first became aware of the Pentagon\u2019s positive test results. Earlier  notification would have likely helped with the evaluation of test results  and allowed federal agencies to collectively coordinate a proper course of  action, particularly because, as discussed earlier, FBI officials began  questioning the incident\u2019s credibility after arriving on scene. The  Biological Incident Annex also designates HHS as the federal agency  responsible for coordinating a public health response involving  bioterrorism threats. DOD officials never notified HHS but, instead, called  the Director of CDC to disclose their intention to administer antibiotics to  DOD employees. The Director of CDC, not DOD, alerted the CDC  operations center, which, in turn, notified HHS\u2019s operations center at  about 4:00 p.m. on Monday. As specified in the Biological Incident Annex,  once HHS officials were notified of a credible threat, they convened an  interagency conference call approximately 1 hour later to coordinate a  possible medical emergency response. However, by then, DOD had already  begun to administer antibiotics to its employees. As a result, any advice  any guidance on (1) medical treatment options or (2) the validity of the  laboratory\u2019s test results that other agency officials may have offered were  essentially moot.", "Second, DOD failed to follow NIMS protocols regarding joint  decision making. Under NIMS, the incident commander is responsible for  the entire response to an incident. To assist with various aspects of a  multijurisdictional response, the incident commander is expected to  assemble federal, state, and local agencies to serve in a unified command.  The unified command includes representatives from all agencies and  organizations that have responsibility for, or can provide support to, an  incident. Collectively, the unified command is expected to consider and  help make decisions on all objectives and strategies related to an incident.  At the Pentagon in March 2005, PFPA included federal and local agencies  in the response; however, the response structure never matured into a  unified command, especially when some decisions\u2014especially those  related to medical treatment\u2014were made outside the command structure.  DOD essentially had two separate incident responses: PFPA acted as the  incident commander for the evacuation and containment of Pentagon  employees, while DOD\u2019s Health Affairs made unilateral decisions  regarding the employees\u2019 medical treatment. According to local public  health officials, DOD did not consult them on the proper course of action  regarding whether, or how, to intervene medically. Had information and  decisions flowed through a unified command structure, local public health  officials could have raised the concerns they had about providing  antibiotics without a confirmed LRN test result. Additionally, if medical  treatment decisions had been made collaboratively, DOD and local public  health officials could have (1) agreed on a strategy for treating potentially  affected individuals, including access to additional medication and follow- up treatment; and (2) discussed the potential ramifications of initially  providing ciprofloxacin to DOD employees. According to local public  health officials, DOD\u2019s initial provision of ciprofloxacin to DOD employees  set a precedent that essentially eliminated other antibiotic treatment  options, given the health officials\u2019 desire to ensure that potentially affected  individuals would be treated consistently. Had medical decisions been  made within the context of a unified command, a different decision may  have been reached and hundreds of DOD employees\u2014with no, or limited,  exposure to potential contamination\u2014may not have received unnecessary  medication.", "Third, DOD did not coordinate the initial public response to the  incidents. An important outcome envisioned in the federal framework is  effective management of information available to the public. The NIMS  structure calls for a joint information center to provide a location for  organizations participating in the management of the incident to work  together to ensure that timely, accurate, easy-to-understand, and  consistent information is disseminated to the public. The joint information  center is supposed to have representatives from each organization  involved in the management of an incident. DOD did not establish a joint  information center at the start of the incidents, and it did not have clear  written procedures for doing so. As a result, the public received unclear  and inconsistent messages about, among other matters, the source of the  anthrax. For example, media accounts reported that mail through the  Postal Service caused the incidents when, in fact, the source of possible  contamination was unknown. According to the Postal Service, this  resulted in unnecessary anxiety among Postal Service workers, their  families, and recipients of Postal Service mail.", "According to DOD health officials responsible for making medical  decisions at the Pentagon, they based their medical treatment decision on  the experiences they gained from the fall 2001 anthrax incidents. The  officials explained that they were very sensitive to what they perceived to  be untimely medical decisions reached in the fall of 2001. Consequently,  they said they decided to err on the side of caution and quickly distribute  antibiotics to employees at the Pentagon and Skyline Complex.  Additionally, since the incident occurred on the Pentagon Reservation,  DOD officials did not believe that the NRP applied because, in their view,  they had the medical authority, expertise, and resources to handle the  incident internally. However, other federal officials\u2014including those in  DHS and HHS\u2014told us that the NRP was applicable and that DOD should  have followed the framework. In addition, CDC guidance emphasizes the  need to make risk-based decisions, including those involving dispensing of  antibiotics during suspected anthrax incidents. According to the CDC, a  risk-based, participatory approach is necessary, in part to limit the number  of people who may receive antibiotics before confirmation by the LRN.  Since the mail had been quarantined over the weekend, the Pentagon  employees most at risk would have been the technicians who had  screened the mail the previous week. These persons received antibiotics,  but so did hundreds of others who, in our view, would not likely have been  exposed until Monday morning, when the Pentagon\u2019s mail was released  from quarantine.", "DOD health officials\u2019 concern about protecting DOD employees from the  risk of exposure is clearly understandable. However, DOD\u2019s actions were  not consistent with the NRP. Once HHS was contacted by CDC, it began  using the notification and response protocols specified in the NRP. In  particular, HHS convened the first interagency conference call in which  federal participants were able to discuss the laboratory\u2019s test results and  raise concerns about the quality of the results. Additionally, CDC was able  to address the Postal Service\u2019s concerns about the possible health effects  on its employees who may have processed contaminated mail to the  Pentagon the previous week. CDC recommended antibiotics for  employees of the V Street Operation because (1) of the confluence of the  two incidents, which, at the time, were viewed as involving the presence of  anthrax; (2) DOD had already started its employees on antibiotics; and   (3) the employees could have been exposed to anthrax several days earlier  because they process mail to the Pentagon."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Took Numerous Actions That Address Problems Related to the Incidents", "paragraphs": ["DOD took numerous actions that address problems related to the  Pentagon and Skyline Complex incidents.

Other actions, including  selecting a new mail-screening contractor and improving procedures for  releasing quarantined mail, were a direct response to what occurred. At  the Skyline Complex, DOD\u2019s actions included prohibiting the use of  equipment for screening mail unless the equipment is being operated  within the context of a comprehensive mail-screening program.

According to a PFPA  official, planning for the transfer of mail-screening oversight began around  January 2005. A gradual transition had been planned, he said, but the  Pentagon incident significantly accelerated efforts to implement the  transfer of mail-screening oversight responsibilities.", "DOD modernized the mail-screening facility, refurbished the mail  quarantine room, and installed new mail-screening equipment.  According to a DOD official, initial planning for these improvements also  began around January 2005. PFPA officials stated that the new mail- screening facility and the refurbished quarantine room have improved  capabilities that are designed to protect employees and prevent the spread  of anthrax. Finally, a DOD official said that the decision to replace the  previous mail-screening table with new equipment was based on a 2003  National Academy of Sciences report, which, among other things, raised  questions about the table\u2019s ability to detect anthrax in small amounts.  PFPA is awaiting the results of a study, which it expects to conclude in  May 2006, to evaluate the effectiveness of the changes.", "DOD changed its testing laboratory. Daily testing of samples from the  Pentagon\u2019s mail-screening equipment is now performed by a non-LRN  chemical-biological laboratory located on the premises, instead of a  contract laboratory. The laboratory is part of PFPA and, according to a  PFPA official, was established in January 2005 to help protect the  Pentagon from biological threats. The official stated that the original plan  was to transfer testing from CBI to the Pentagon\u2019s chemical-biological  laboratory in October 2005, after the Vistronix contract expired. However,  the transfer was accelerated, occurring instead in March 2005, a few days  after the incident at the Pentagon.", "DOD entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on  biological monitoring with other federal agencies. In April 2005, DOD  signed an MOU for Coordinated Monitoring of Biological Threat Agents,  which was developed prior to the Pentagon incident. DHS, HHS, the  Department of Justice (which includes the FBI), and the Postal Service are  also parties to the MOU. DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate is  responsible for coordinating the implementation of the MOU. The  following provisions in the MOU help address the notification, laboratory  testing, and medical response problems that arose at the Pentagon:   The MOU establishes prompt notification requirements. Specifically,  the MOU requires participants to notify the FBI, HHS, and DHS within   1 to 2 hours of positive test results that indicate, with a high degree of  confidence, the presence of anthrax or other biological agents.  However, according to a DHS Science and Technology Directorate  official, such test results only trigger notification and, until confirmed  by the LRN, are not considered actionable by HHS, DHS, and others.", "The MOU requires participating agencies to develop and employ  mutually accepted and validated testing methods to confirm  biological threats. According to a Science and Technology official, test  results produced from these methods will be considered actionable for  public health and other response measures, including the  administration of medical treatment. He stated, however, that this MOU  provision will take time to implement. According to the official, an  independent organization is currently performing the extensive testing  and analysis needed to evaluate and establish equivalency between the  wide array of testing methods employed across agencies. DOD  officials stated that the Pentagon\u2019s chemical-biological laboratory\u2014 which is not part of the LRN\u2014plans to adopt the testing methods that  emerge from the MOU. As a result, if the MOU\u2019s equivalency testing  provision is fully implemented, they said, confirmatory positive results  from the Pentagon laboratory will be considered equivalent to LRN  results and deemed actionable by DHS, HHS, and others for decisions  related to the administration of medical treatment.", "In addition to carrying out actions already in process, DOD also initiated  numerous actions in direct response to the problems that occurred at the  Pentagon. Several of these actions address the mail-screening contractor\u2019s  failure to follow established requirements. Other actions were carried out  in response to the RAND review and are intended to better align DOD\u2019s  procedures with those in the federal framework for coordinating  responses to potential biological threats. The actions are as follows:    DOD changed mail-screening contractors, strengthened the new  contract, and drafted improved procedures. PFPA selected a new  contractor for screening mail at the Pentagon in September 2005. PFPA  also developed new contract provisions and drafted new mail inspection  procedures to address the previous contractor\u2019s failure to follow  established contractual and procedural requirements. Table 2 highlights  key changes in the Pentagon\u2019s mail-screening contract provisions and draft  procedures.", "PFPA strengthened the mail-screening contract by requiring the contractor  to, among other things, periodically train employees on emergency  response procedures and develop an effective quality control program to  ensure adherence to contract provisions. In addition, PFPA\u2019s contracting  officer representative is required to evaluate the contractor\u2019s performance  to ensure that it meets contract requirements. PFPA has also drafted new  mail-screening procedures to help ensure the contractor performs in  accordance with requirements. The draft procedures require PFPA to,  among other things, perform unannounced inspections to ensure that the  contractor is properly executing required procedures. As of April 30, 2006,  it was unclear when the draft procedures would be finalized; however,  according to a PFPA official, the new monitoring measures are already  being performed. Effective monitoring of contractor activities and  performance is key to maintaining effective agency internal controls.", "DOD strengthened controls over the release of quarantined mail.", "The Pentagon\u2019s draft mail inspection procedures require verification of  negative test results by representatives from three separate  organizations\u2014PFPA, the Defense Post Office, and the contractor\u2014before  the mail is released. Table 3 identifies the key steps for releasing  quarantined mail, as specified in the draft procedures.", "Although the mail inspection procedures are still in draft form, these steps  are currently being used for releasing the Pentagon\u2019s quarantined mail.  The segregation of key duties and responsibilities at this critical juncture  in the mail release process reduces the risk of error and, as such, is  designed to strengthen the internal controls that were lacking in March  2005. During the incident, inadequate internal controls allowed a single  point of failure\u2014in this case, a misunderstanding between two contract  employees\u2014to result in the premature release and distribution of  quarantined mail that may have been contaminated. This triggered a broad  response at the Pentagon and elsewhere. The implementation of rigorous  internal controls for releasing the Pentagon\u2019s mail appears likely to  prevent similar incidents in the future.", "DOD commissioned the RAND Corporation to conduct an  independent review examining its response to the March 2005  incidents. The review primarily focused on evaluating DOD\u2019s policies and  procedures for responding to such incidents and making  recommendations for improvement.

Many of these problems were also raised in the RAND report. DOD\u2019s  actions, several of which also affect other DOD-leased facilities, included  the following:    DOD developed operating conditions for equipment used to screen  mail in the national capital region. In January 2006, DOD\u2019s Director of  Administration and Management issued a directive prohibiting DOD mail  facilities in leased space within the national capital region\u2014including the  Skyline Complex\u2014from operating equipment used to screen mail,  including biosafety cabinets, unless the facilities meet five specific  operating conditions. These conditions include having trained mail  screeners to sample equipment for biological agents and an approved  laboratory for analyzing the samples. The directive partially addresses a  recommendation in the RAND report calling for DOD to develop, evaluate,  and ensure that appropriate site-specific screening practices are in place  departmentwide. According to the Director, the directive is intended to  relay key lessons learned in March 2005\u2014specifically, that equipment for  screening mail is ineffective and potentially risky to personnel and  facilities when used outside of a comprehensive mail-screening program.  The TMA facility at the Skyline Complex did not meet these conditions.  Although the agency purchased a new biosafety cabinet for the Skyline  Complex, which is similar to the device in place in March 2005, a TMA  official stated that the agency is no longer operating the device and is  taking steps for its disposal in response to the directive.", "DOD initiated two efforts to gather information on screening  operations in its mail facilities. First, DOD\u2019s Joint Program Executive  Office for Chemical-Biological Defense, as part of a plan required by the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, gathered some  information on equipment used for mail screening in DOD mail facilities  nationwide. However, according to a joint program office official, the data  is not comprehensive because information was not sought from all  applicable facilities. Second, in response to the RAND review, Washington  Headquarters Services attempted to identify DOD-leased facilities in the  national capital region that screen mail for threats. However, as discussed  later, this data collection effort had numerous limitations.", "DOD developed an occupant emergency plan for the Skyline  Complex. In July 2005, the Defense Agency, in conjunction with TMA,  issued an occupant emergency plan for the Skyline Complex. The plan was  reviewed and deemed adequate by a building management specialist in  DOD\u2019s Washington Headquarters Services. The plan includes emergency  contact information and information about the complex, such as floor  plans, that were not readily available during the March 2005 incidents. In  addition, according to a Defense Agency official, the plan has been fully  coordinated with Fairfax County first responders, who (1) met with  Defense Agency officials to discuss the roles and responsibilities of  applicable parties, (2) reviewed the plan, and (3) participated in the  emergency training exercises at the Skyline Complex. He also stated that if  a similar incident were to occur, the plan would facilitate communications  between first responders and Skyline Complex employees. The  development of an occupant emergency plan addresses findings in this  report as well as recommendations from the RAND review.", "DOD issued supplemental requirements for developing mail  security plans. DOD\u2019s December 2001 mail manual required agency mail  rooms to develop security plans, but at the time of the incidents, did not  clearly specify what the plans should include or require that they be  reviewed. A supplement to the manual, issued in September 2005, requires  mail room officials to ensure that their plan (1) details the reporting  procedures and responsibilities for handling suspicious mail, (2) has been  coordinated with local emergency responders, (3) is disseminated to all  mail center staff, and (4) is reviewed for potential revisions at least  quarterly.

In October 2005, senior DOD health officials told us  that they would handle the medical response at the Pentagon in a similar  manner if an incident occurred in the future, in part, because they have the  authority to do so. In April 2006\u2014more than 1 year after the incident\u2014 another senior health official reiterated that DOD has the authority to  make final decisions on medical treatment at the Pentagon without  collaboration or consultation with other agencies, including HHS.

First, DOD has not ensured that DOD mail facilities  in the national capital region are not operating biosafety cabinets outside  of a comprehensive mail-screening program. As pointed out in the Director  of Administration and Management\u2019s January 2006 directive, using mail- screening equipment in isolation of such a program is ineffective and  potentially risky. Second, at the conclusion of our review, DOD still had  not identified the number of biosafety cabinets in use in the region. For  example, although DOD\u2019s Washington Headquarters Services collected  information about facilities in the national capital region that screen mail  for threats, its winter 2005 data collection effort was not comprehensive.  For example, the office did not attempt to (1) identify whether other  biosafety cabinets were being used, (2) determine the conditions under  which the equipment is being operated, and (3) collect information on the  type and capabilities of other mail-screening equipment being used.  Moreover, it appears that numerous DOD mail facilities in the national  capital region did not respond to the data request. According to an official  from Washington Headquarters Services in April 2006, a follow-up effort  was being conducted to gather additional data on mail-screening  operations in the region; however, we were unable to obtain specific  information regarding the purpose, scope, and status of the effort.

While commenting that  \u201ccoordination in such events is highly desirable,\u201d DOD reiterated that it  has the \u201cmedical authority to act in a timely manner to provide the best  possible medical protection for its personnel at potential risk in an  incident of this nature.\u201d DOD further commented that the NRP does not  alter or impede its ability to carry out its medical authorities and  responsibilities.", "We agree that the NRP does not repeal DOD\u2019s medical powers, authorities,  or responsibilities. However, in signing the NRP Letter of Agreement, DOD  agreed, among other things, to (1) support NRP concepts, processes, and  structures; (2) modify its existing plans to comply with the NRP; and   (3) ensure that its operations support the NRP. Thus, in our view, DOD\u2019s  medical authorities must be exercised in conjunction with DOD\u2019s  responsibilities under the NRP. Had DOD followed such an approach in  March 2005, concerns such as the validity of the test results could have  been discussed among informed agency officials and the provision of  unnecessary medicine to DOD employees at lower risk for exposure may  have been avoided.", "DOD also commented that the NRP was not in effect during these  incidents because none of the criteria for an incident of \u201cnational  significance\u201d had been met. We agree that the December 2004 NRP plan  was somewhat ambiguous about when an incident is subject to NRP\u2019s  concepts, processes, and structures. However, revisions made in May 2006  clarified that the NRP is \u201calways in effect\u201d and that the plan applies to  incidents of lesser severity that may, nevertheless, require some federal  involvement. In our view, this revision makes it even more clear that,  going forward, coordination is necessary and appropriate with regard to  potential bioterrorism incidents and decisions about medical treatment. In  addition, despite the plan\u2019s prior ambiguity, it is important to note that  other federal officials\u2014including those in DHS and HHS\u2014told us that the  NRP was applicable because of the nearly simultaneous occurrence of two  incidents involving the Pentagon, a building of national military  significance.
