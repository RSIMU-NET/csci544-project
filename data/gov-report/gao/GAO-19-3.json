Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 included a provision for GAO to review VA's and states' oversight of schools receiving VA education benefits. This report examines (1) how, if at all, the available level of funding to state agencies has affected states' and VA's ability to carry out their oversight responsibilities, (2) to what extent VA and state agencies use risk-based approaches to oversee schools, and (3) to what extent VA coordinates and shares information with the states to support their oversight activities. GAO reviewed VA documents; assessed VA funding data for fiscal years 2003-2018; interviewed VA and selected state agency officials; and reviewed correspondence between these officials. GAO interviewed officials from eight state agencies who were past or present officials at the association representing state agencies, and officials from three other states, including one that did not renew its contract with VA in fiscal year 2018."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for overseeing schools nationwide that provide VA education benefits to veterans. To help provide this oversight, VA contracts with state agencies to oversee schools in their states and provide outreach and training to school officials and allocates them funding to cover the cost of oversight, outreach, and training activities. However, since fiscal year 2006, funding for oversight, outreach, and training has remained at about $19 million, and only recently increased in fiscal year 2018 to $21 million. State agency officials told GAO that the limited level of funding they have received from VA has been a long-standing problem that has strained their ability to (1) adequately cover staff costs, (2) pay for travel for school visits, and (3) provide needed technical assistance and training to the schools about VA education benefit requirements. As a result, a few states, such as New Mexico, have chosen to withdraw from their school oversight roles. When this happens, VA must take over the state agencies' oversight responsibilities. GAO found that assuming additional oversight responsibilities is likely to stretch VA's staff resources, especially in large states, where schools are geographically dispersed and school visits are time consuming and costly. VA has begun but has not completed an assessment of the risks that potential future state agency withdrawals could have on its ability to provide school oversight. Moreover, VA has not developed a contingency plan for how it will oversee more schools if additional states do not renew their oversight contracts. Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should identify and assess risks related to achieving objectives, and define contingency plans for assigning responsibilities if key roles are vacated. Until VA takes these steps, the agency runs the risk of being unprepared to conduct effective oversight in the event that more state agencies withdraw from their contracts in the future.", "VA and state agencies use certain risk factors to select schools for oversight. VA officials said that they prioritize schools for annual reviews of compliance with program requirements based on findings from prior reviews as well as other risk factors, such as schools with a history of VA benefit payment errors. GAO found that VA and state agencies have recently begun a joint effort to explore a new strategy that they expect will strengthen the school review selection and prioritization process. According to VA officials, as of mid-October 2018, VA used this strategy to select five schools to undergo risk-based reviews. VA officials said they expect these five reviews to be completed by late December 2018.", "VA and state agencies coordinate and share information about their oversight activities in a variety of ways. For example, VA has shared information with the state agencies on how to conduct annual reviews of schools in their states. However, according to officials at the association representing state agencies, VA has not provided specific direction on conducting targeted reviews in response to complaints. VA officials acknowledged that the procedures they currently have in place are outdated and said that they are being revised to provide state agencies with more details. As of late October 2018, VA officials said these procedures were undergoing internal review. Once implemented, VA's new procedures have the potential to enhance VA's and state agencies' efforts to conduct reviews at those schools for which they have received complaints."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA complete the identification and assessment of oversight risks, and prepare a contingency plan for overseeing schools if additional states do not renew their oversight contracts.

This report answers the following  questions:  1.  How, if at all, has the available level of funding to state agencies  affected states\u2019 and VA\u2019s ability to carry out their responsibilities in  overseeing schools receiving VA education benefits?  2.

In addition, we interviewed VA officials and eight  officials from the National Association of State Approving Agencies  (NASAA), the organization that represents the interests of state agencies  overseeing schools receiving VA education benefits. These selected  NASAA officials have held a variety of leadership positions within the  organization, including on the NASAA Executive Board as well as on  select NASAA committees. During these interviews, we obtained NASAA  officials\u2019 perspectives about state agencies in general, and about their  specific experiences as directors or members of their own state agencies.  NASAA officials we interviewed represented the views of state agencies  across all four NASAA regions (East, South, Central, and West), and  were from states that received both recent increases and decreases in  VA funding, and with a varied number of schools and beneficiaries that  received VA education benefits. We also interviewed officials from three  additional states selected to provide more in-depth information at the  state level. These included a state with a recent decrease in VA funding  (New Hampshire), a state with a recent increase in funding (California),  and a state that did not renew its contract with VA in fiscal year 2018  (New Mexico). We chose these states to obtain different perspectives on  how the level of funding affected their ability to carry out school oversight.  For all three questions, we also reviewed VA documents and written  correspondence between VA, NASAA, and the state agencies in fiscal  years 2014 to 2018 related to VA education benefits. In addition, we  reviewed a 2016 report from VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (Inspector  General) and a 2017 study conducted by an external contractor hired by  VA that discuss VA\u2019s use of risk factors in selecting schools for its annual  reviews.", "We obtained VA data on the amount of funding allocated by the agency to  the state agencies in fiscal years 2003 to 2018.

VA has the  discretion to approve an agency\u2019s request based on its justification of  need and the amount of VA funding available for supplemental requests.  NASAA officials said that supplemental funding is helpful, but that it is not  a reliable funding source because there is no guarantee that VA will be  able to provide states with the requested amount. According to NASAA  officials, some state agencies also receive additional funding from their  state governments if they request these funds, but many states do not  provide this additional funding. NASAA officials also noted that in some  cases, states do not want to provide their own funds to state agencies  because their view is that the agencies already receive VA funding  through their federal contracts.", "VA recently changed its method of allocating funding to state agencies.  VA hired an external contractor to develop a new funding allocation  method. Before fiscal year 2017, VA funded state agencies primarily  based on the number of schools in the state with at least one veteran  student receiving VA education benefits in the previous year. In fiscal  year 2017, VA implemented a new funding allocation method. VA  officials told us this new method was a significant improvement over the  previous method they used, which was very limited. For example, VA  officials said the prior funding method did not estimate how long it took  state agencies to perform certain oversight activities. The officials said  this limitation was a key reason they decided to develop a new funding  method. VA\u2019s new method to fund states more equitably is based on their  work requirements, i.e., their school oversight activities and the amount of  time needed to complete them. The new funding method factors in,  among other things:  the number of staff needed to complete a state\u2019s workload in  overseeing schools; national salary averages ($80,000 for professional and $50,000 for  support staff), including benefits; a national travel allowance based on the number of professional staff  required to complete work requirements;  the number of schools receiving VA education benefits in the state;  and  the estimated time needed to review different school types, the type of  review (such as approvals vs. compliance surveys), and the number  of student veterans enrolled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Agencies Identified Impacts of Limited Funding on Their Ability to Fulfill Oversight Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["VA, NASAA, and selected state agency officials we spoke with said that  limited funding before and after the recent changes to the funding method  has impacted state agencies\u2019 ability to fulfill their oversight responsibilities  in three areas: (1) ability to pay and train oversight staff, (2) ability to visit  geographically dispersed schools due to travel costs, and (3) ability to  provide technical assistance and training to schools. Under their contracts  with VA, state agencies have been meeting their core school oversight  functions, according to NASAA officials. VA and NASAA officials we  interviewed, however, said state agencies have been underfunded for  many years. They said states\u2019 funding concerns and challenges existed  prior to the new method to allocate funds to state agencies and remain  despite a total funding increase to state agencies from about $19 million  to $21 million in fiscal year 2018.", "NASAA officials we interviewed said some state agencies have difficulty  paying for the number of staff they need because there is a mismatch  between VA\u2019s average salary and benefits used to calculate states\u2019  funding and the actual salaries and benefits some state agencies are  required to pay under state laws. VA officials acknowledged that some  states have required salary and benefit levels that exceed the average  levels used in VA\u2019s new funding allocation method. VA\u2019s new funding  method uses an average salary of $80,000 (including benefits) for  professional staff. VA officials noted that some states have annual  salaries for professional staff of over $100,000 excluding benefits. A state  agency official we spoke with said the salary and benefit costs for  professional staff in her state average $130,000, with some salary and  benefits costing up to about $150,000. The official said this can make it  difficult for the state agency to be able to pay a sufficient number of staff,  which hinders its ability to fulfill its VA-contracted oversight. In another  case, a NASAA official said his state agency did not have enough funds  to pay for a second full-time employee because the state\u2019s required salary  and benefits were higher than VA\u2019s $80,000 allotment for professional  staff.", "Limited funding for state agency oversight staff has led to state requests  for additional funds, as well as higher turnover and less training of the  staff. VA officials said that the primary reason that some state agencies  requested supplemental funding from VA in fiscal years 2016 and 2017  was that their initial allocation was not sufficient to cover salary, benefits,  and travel expenses. Some state governments have had to cover those  costs, hoping that VA would reimburse the state at the end of the fiscal  year, according to VA officials. In addition, some state agencies have had  significant turnover due, in part, to the uncertainty about the amount of  annual VA funding, according to NASAA officials. NASAA officials also  said that funding amounts limit the professional development provided to  state agency staff, including travel to conferences. VA officials said that  they support professional development and routinely provide funding for  travel to conferences. However, according to VA officials, VA has denied  requests from state agencies for travel to additional, repetitious  conferences during the same year.", "NASAA officials said limited VA funding also makes it difficult for state  agencies in geographically large states to pay travel expenses to visit  schools as part of their oversight responsibilities. For example, NASAA  officials said state agencies in Alaska, Montana, and Washington find it  difficult to afford mileage and hotel costs for school visits that require  travelling long distances\u2014sometimes over mountain ranges\u2014and  overnight stays. NASAA officials also said VA\u2019s new funding method does  not allocate sufficient funding for travel.", "Officials we interviewed at selected state agencies have had mixed  experiences with travel costs. One state agency official told us her  agency selected schools to visit that were physically near her office  because of insufficient travel funds. In contrast, a state agency official in a  geographically small state said the agency has sufficient funding to travel  throughout the state to visit schools, mainly because overnight stays are  unnecessary. VA and NASAA officials said some state agencies have  been able to address travel costs by stationing agency staff in different  parts of the state. VA officials, however, acknowledged that this is not  possible in all states because some states require agency staff to be  located in a central office.", "VA\u2019s new funding allocation method calculates a national travel allowance  for all states based on the total number of professional staff it estimates  would be required to complete work requirements in all states. VA officials  explained that this travel allowance does not account for individual  differences in geographic size among states. VA officials said that in  developing the new funding method, the contractor reviewed the historical  travel costs of states and determined that a distinction by the geographic  size of a state did not need to be factored into the funding method. The  contractor based this decision on several factors, including that some  state agencies: (1) paid their travel costs using state funds, not VA funds;  (2) have located their staff in offices across the state and, as a result,  their travel costs were lower than in other states; and (3) planned their  travel so they visited schools within a short timeframe, which reduced  travel costs.", "When faced with funding difficulties, many state agencies reduce their  technical assistance to schools and outreach activities because they need  to use available funds on salaries, benefits, and travel related to  compliance survey and approval workloads, according to NASAA officials.  For example, one state agency official told us her agency has significantly  reduced its technical assistance to schools because it does not have the  funds to travel across the large, rural state to provide it. A NASAA official  said available funding has reduced his state agency\u2019s ability to conduct  outreach, such as connecting veterans with education and benefit  resources, or holding in-person meetings to educate employers on  providing apprenticeships to veterans using VA education benefits.", "NASAA officials also said that many state agencies have reduced the  number of visits to train school employees on VA education benefits  requirements. They noted that this training is important because it helps  reduce over- and under-payments and the misuse of VA education  benefits. A 2016 report from VA\u2019s Inspector General estimated that VA  makes $247.6 million in improper payments of VA education benefits  annually, mostly over-payments. The Inspector General found that many  of the improper payments occurred because school employees provided  VA incorrect or incomplete information on student enrollment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Plans to Revise the New Funding Method to Address Ongoing Concerns by States", "paragraphs": ["NASAA officials told us that they continue to have concerns that the new  funding method\u2019s time estimates for completing certain oversight activities  are inaccurate and, as a result, this method does not allocate sufficient  funds. For example, NASAA officials said the funding method does not  properly estimate the time it takes state officials to travel to schools and  carry out oversight functions, including conducting certain school  approvals, and providing schools with technical assistance and training.  NASAA officials said the time estimates used to fund approvals are  inaccurate and need to be revised because different types of schools and  education programs\u2014including flight schools, degree programs, and non- degree programs\u2014take different amounts of time to review and approve.  For example, NASAA officials said that state agencies need less time to  conduct an approval for an on-the-job training program than for a large  public university.", "VA officials said they are aware of the concerns that NASAA and state  agencies have raised that the time estimates for oversight in the new  funding method are inaccurate\u2014with some being too high and others too  low. They are also aware that NASAA and state agencies believe that the  analysis to develop these estimates should have more accurately  factored in the time needed to approve and review different types of  schools and education programs.", "To address the concerns states have raised about its new funding  allocation method, VA provided documentation to us of its plans to hire a  contractor in fiscal year 2018 to improve and update its funding method.  In September 2018, VA hired a contractor to carry out a contract with a 6- month period of performance. VA reported that the contractor would  review the new funding allocation method to determine if any specific  changes are needed to more equitably distribute funding across state  agencies. Specifically, VA officials said the contractor would review the  accuracy of the funding method\u2019s allowances for state agencies\u2019 salary,  benefits, and travel costs, and its time estimates for states to conduct  oversight activities to determine if changes are needed. VA officials  reiterated that allowances for salaries and travel, and the time estimates  are critical factors in the funding method. VA officials noted, however, that  regardless of how VA divides the funding up among the state agencies,  the total amount of program funding to these agencies will remain the  same within any one fiscal year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two State Agencies Have Discontinued Their Oversight Contracts, but VA Has Not Assessed These Impacts or How It Will Address Future Withdrawals", "paragraphs": ["States have the option of not renewing their school oversight contracts  with VA, and two have exercised this option in recent years, citing  insufficient funding levels from VA to fulfill their responsibilities. When this  happens and the state withdraws from its school oversight role, VA must  perform all oversight responsibilities for VA education benefits in that  state. New Mexico\u2014which currently has 4,754 veteran students and 107  schools receiving VA education benefits\u2014did not renew its contract with  VA in fiscal year 2018 because funding was not sufficient to cover its  costs for salaries, travel, and technical assistance to schools, according  to VA officials (see text box).", "New Mexico Did Not Renew Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Contract Due to  Lack of Funding  New Mexico\u2019s state agency began to face significant funding difficulties starting in fiscal  year 2015, according to a state official, and it did not renew its VA contract to oversee  schools receiving VA education benefits in fiscal year 2018. Although the state agency  was able to conduct the oversight activities required by its VA contract in fiscal year  2017, the official said the agency had to reduce its staff, and the one remaining  employee was frequently required to work long hours and weekends to meet contract  requirements. Further, New Mexico did not receive adequate funding for travel costs to  visit schools in its geographically large, rural state, the state official noted. As a result,  the official said the state agency opted not to renew its VA contract in fiscal year 2018.  VA and New Mexico officials have differing views on how well VA staff will be able to  provide effective oversight of schools receiving veterans\u2019 education benefits in the  state. In January 2018, New Mexico state officials stated that although VA regional staff  have assumed the former state agency\u2019s oversight responsibilities, they are unlikely to  be able to provide the same level of oversight the state agency did because the VA  staff are also responsible for overseeing schools in three other states in addition to New  Mexico. As a result, state agency officials said schools in New Mexico would likely  receive fewer oversight visits. VA officials, on the other hand, believe that their regional  staff are handling oversight of schools in New Mexico effectively, although they  acknowledged the staff may be conducting fewer compliance surveys and providing  schools less technical assistance.", "Other states have also expressed concerns about their ability to conduct  oversight given available funding levels. For example, Alaska\u2014which  currently has 4,011 veteran students and 53 schools receiving VA  education benefits\u2014also chose not to contract with VA for about 5\u00bd  years (fiscal year 2012 through January 2017), according to VA officials  and the director of Alaska\u2019s veterans affairs office. Alaska\u2019s director also  said that a major reason that Alaska did not renew its contract was limited  VA funding. During this time, regional VA staff based in Oklahoma  handled Alaska\u2019s oversight, which VA officials said often had to be  conducted remotely given that schools are spread throughout the state,  and travel to those areas can be expensive as well as challenging given  weather conditions. VA officials said that VA\u2019s presence was not as  strong in Alaska as in other states because VA staff overseeing Alaska  are located in another state and in a different time zone. Further,  according to VA data for fiscal years 2014 and 2015, VA staff were  unable to complete all the compliance surveys they were assigned in  Alaska. In addition, California officials told us they almost did not renew  their oversight contract in fiscal year 2018 due in part to funding  concerns. California has the largest number of veteran students (86,926)  and schools receiving VA education benefits (1,091) of any state, yet  state agency officials told us that they lacked sufficient funding to pay  salaries for staff to conduct necessary oversight of these schools,  including approvals and technical assistance visits. VA officials noted,  however, that California receives the most funding of any state and has  received the greatest increases of any state in the last two years.", "Although VA stepped in to provide oversight of schools in New Mexico  and Alaska, the agency does not have a plan for how it will oversee  additional schools if other states choose not to renew their oversight  contracts. VA officials told us their current approach is to assign the state  agency\u2019s workload to regional VA staff who already have their own school  oversight responsibilities. However, providing oversight in states without a  contract in addition to VA staffs\u2019 existing workload is likely to stretch  agency resources. For example, existing VA regional staff may not be  able to oversee all schools in states with a large number of schools. In  addition, VA staff may be strained in providing oversight in geographically  large states where schools are widely dispersed because school visits  would be time consuming and costly.", "VA has begun some initial steps to identify and assess how it would  handle additional oversight. In August 2017, VA began working with its  Office of General Counsel regarding what options the agency has when a  state agency chooses not to contract with VA, and the Office issued a  legal opinion in September 2017. In April 2018, VA formed a workgroup,  which also met a few times in May and once in July, to prepare a draft  paper of possible scenarios and response options based on this legal  opinion. In August 2018, the workgroup followed up with the field  supervisor responsible for approval, compliance, and liaison and  produced a new draft paper of scenarios and options. As of September  2018, VA\u2019s Education Service Director is holding discussions with VA  leadership regarding assessing the options and developing a formal plan.  However, VA has not completed an assessment to ensure the agency  can handle additional school oversight responsibilities in states that do  not renew their contracts and has yet to prepare a contingency plan.", "Federal standards for internal control state that agencies should identify,  assess, and respond to risks related to achieving objectives. After  identifying risks, the agency should assess the significance\u2014or effect on  achieving the objective\u2014of these risks, which provides a basis for  responding to the risks. Then, in responding to these risks, the standards  state that agencies should define contingency plans for assigning  responsibilities if key roles are vacated to help the entity continue to  achieve its objectives. Specifically, if the agency relies on a separate  organization to fulfill key roles, then the agency should assess whether  this organization can continue in these key roles, identify others to fill  these roles as needed, and implement knowledge sharing with  replacement personnel. Without fully identifying and assessing the risks  of additional state withdrawals, and without a contingency plan to address  how VA can oversee additional schools, the agency runs the risk that if  more states withdraw from their oversight responsibilities, then VA will be  unprepared to oversee the schools in these states."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA and State Agencies Use Certain Risk Factors to Select Schools for Review, and Have Taken Steps toward a New Oversight Approach", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA and State Agencies Use Payment Errors and Other Risk Factors to Select Schools for Compliance Surveys", "paragraphs": ["Each year, VA uses findings from prior compliance surveys and other  information to develop a strategy for prioritizing a sample of schools to  receive annual reviews, according to VA officials. VA is generally required  by statute to conduct an annual compliance survey of schools with 20 or  more enrolled veterans at least once every 2 years. VA officials said  with the help of state agencies, VA uses these surveys to determine if  schools are meeting legal requirements and are using VA education  benefits funds appropriately, including whether they are making over- or  under-payments on students\u2019 education expenses. According to a VA  document, in conducting the surveys, VA and state agencies review  various statutory and regulatory requirements, such as the accuracy of a  school\u2019s student enrollment records, tuition payments, and whether a  school has corrected deficiencies identified in previous compliance  surveys.", "According to VA officials, the agency has taken steps to incorporate risk  factors into its compliance survey strategy in response to  recommendations from our prior work and recent VA studies.

As part of the agency\u2019s official  response to this recommendation, VA reported to us that in fiscal year  2012 the agency began prioritizing compliance surveys at for-profit  schools.

Specifically, the report recommended that VA prioritize  schools at risk of payment errors including (1) making errors resulting  in over- or under-payments of VA education benefits, and (2)  neglecting to recover unspent VA education benefit funds, such as  when students receive funds but then reduce their course loads or  repeat classes. In response, VA officials stated that the agency began  using data on these payment errors to prioritize schools with high  error rates. For example, VA officials said that when data revealed  that flight schools were particularly prone to such errors\u2014along with  charging high tuition and fees and failing to meet some VA education  benefits criteria, among other issues\u2014VA decided to prioritize these  schools for compliance surveys in its fiscal year 2018 strategy (see  text box).", "VA\u2019s Compliance Survey Strategy for Schools Receiving VA Education Benefits for  Fiscal Year 2018  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is generally required by statute to conduct an  annual compliance survey of schools receiving VA education benefits and that have 20 or  more enrolled veterans at least once every 2 years. For its fiscal year 2018 compliance  survey strategy, VA prioritized the following types of schools for review:  100 percent of schools with flight programs;  100 percent of schools with fewer than 20 veterans, with priority to those  that had not received surveys for the longest time period;  100 percent of federal on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs;  schools with serious deficiencies identified in previous compliance surveys;  schools newly approved for the program with enrolled VA beneficiaries;  schools that have never received a compliance survey (for example, VA officials said  some schools have not received a compliance survey due to a shortage of VA  oversight staff or due to the fact that in prior years, the statute did not require VA to  conduct compliance surveys at schools with fewer than 300 veterans); and  a sample of foreign schools receiving VA education benefits for students from the  United States (conducted by VA via remote survey).", "An August 2017 study, conducted by an external contractor hired by  VA, reviewed ways to strengthen VA\u2019s compliance survey process  and outcomes. The report found that VA has not placed enough  emphasis on improving school compliance over time. For example,  VA has historically prioritized completing a certain number of surveys  each year rather than ensuring that schools are actually  demonstrating compliance. Among other recommendations, the report  identified the need for VA to more effectively use data to measure  schools\u2019 compliance over time and to establish priorities to select  schools for compliance surveys based on their risk level.

According to VA\u2019s policies and procedures,  the focus of targeted reviews varies based on the nature of the complaint,  and VA assigns a higher priority to complaints that are higher risk, i.e.,  those that allege fraud, waste, or abuse (see table 1).

Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance  Act of 2017  The Colmery Act explicitly authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and state  agencies to use risk-based surveys (reviews) in oversight of schools receiving VA  education benefits. The Colmery Act identifies specific risk factors that can be used for  school oversight, but does not require VA or state agencies to use these risk factors in  their oversight of these schools:  rapid increases in veteran enrollment,  increases in the amount of VA education benefits a school receives per veteran  student,    volume of student complaints,  rates of federal student loan defaults of veterans,  veteran completion rates,   deficiencies identified by accreditors and other state agencies, and   deficiencies in VA program administration compliance.", "VA officials told us that they have not yet used the risk factors cited in the  Colmery Act in conducting their compliance surveys.

For example, one state agency official  said that he tracks all of the risk factors cited in the Colmery Act except  the rates of veterans\u2019 student loan defaults. On the other hand, a NASAA  official said that her state agency tracks the volume of student complaints  and deficiencies identified by accreditors and other state agencies. States  generally have limited opportunities to select specific schools for  compliance surveys, because VA develops the annual priorities for  compliance surveys, according to NASAA officials. In some cases,  NASAA officials told us, state agency staff work with regional VA staff to  select schools for visits based on VA\u2019s priorities.", "VA has recently taken steps to explore a new risk-based approach to  oversee schools receiving VA education benefits that would be in addition  to compliance surveys, according to VA officials. Specifically, VA officials  told us that VA has participated in a joint working group with NASAA  officials focused on developing a new type of school review in which VA  would select schools based on specific risk factors, including those  identified in the Colmery Act. NASAA officials told us they were  supportive of VA\u2019s efforts in this area. As of February 2018, NASAA  officials had drafted a possible approach to state agencies\u2019 oversight to  monitor one risk factor\u2014rapid increases in veteran enrollment for VA\u2019s  consideration. VA officials told us the working group plans to build on this  effort in reviewing other risk factors. In May 2018, VA prepared a draft  charter for the working group, which, among other things, outlines the  potential scope and implementation of new risk-based surveys, and  provided it to NASAA for review. Documentation we reviewed from a VA  and NASAA working group meeting held in May 2018 stated that in its  upcoming meetings, the working group plans to continue developing the  charter, including agreeing to roles and responsibilities, establishing the  risk factors to be used, and identifying data sources related to these risk  factors. VA officials said that at an August 2018 joint working group  meeting, the charter was deemed to have served its purpose and the  decision was made to establish a risk-based review policy and  procedures moving forward.
