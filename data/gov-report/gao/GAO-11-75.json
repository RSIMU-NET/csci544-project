DOD cybersecurity roles and responsibilities are vast and include developing joint policy and guidance and operational functions to protect and defend its computer networks. DOD is taking proactive measures to better address cybersecurity threats, such as developing new organizational structures, led by the establishment of the U.S. Cyber Command, to facilitate the integration of cyberspace operations. However, it is too early to tell if these changes will help DOD better address cybersecurity threats. Several joint doctrine publications address aspects of cyberspace operations, but DOD officials acknowledge that the discussions are insufficient; and no single joint publication completely addresses cyberspace operations. While at least 16 DOD joint publications discuss cyberspace-related topics and 8 mention \"cyberspace operations,\" none contained a sufficient discussion of cyberspace operations. DOD recognizes the need to develop and update cyber-related joint doctrine and is currently debating the merits of developing a single cyberspace operations joint doctrine publication in addition to updating all existing doctrine. However, there is no timetable for completing the decision-making process or for updates to existing doctrine. DOD has assigned authorities and responsibilities for implementing cyberspace operations among combatant commands, military services, and defense agencies; however, the supporting relationships necessary to achieve command and control of cyberspace operations remain unclear. In response to a major computer infection, U.S. Strategic Command identified confusion regarding command and control authorities and chains of command because the exploited network fell under the purview of both its own command and a geographic combatant command. Without complete and clearly articulated guidance on command and control responsibilities that is well communicated and practiced with key stakeholders, DOD will have difficulty in achieving command and control of its cyber forces globally and in building unity of effort for carrying out cyberspace operations. DOD has identified some cyberspace capability gaps, but it has not completed a comprehensive, departmentwide assessment of needed resources, capability gaps, and an implementation plan to address any gaps. For example, U.S. Strategic Command has identified that DOD's cyber workforce is undersized and unprepared to meet the current threat, which is projected to increase significantly over time. While the department's review of some cyberspace capability gaps on cyberspace operations is a step in the right direction, it remains unclear whether these gaps will be addressed since DOD has not conducted a more comprehensive departmentwide assessment of cyber-related capability gaps or established an implementation plan or funding strategy to resolve any gaps that may be identified."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) establish a timeframe for deciding on whether to complete a separate joint cyberspace publication and for updating the existing body of joint publications, (2) clarify command and control relationships regarding cyberspace operations and establish a timeframe for issuing the clarified guidance, and (3) more fully assess cyber-specific capability gaps, and (4) develop a plan and funding strategy to address them. DOD agreed with the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The wealth and strength of the United States make it a target in  cyberspace. The U.S. economy and government are the most dependent  in the world on the Internet and therefore the most vulnerable to cyber  attacks.  Information technology powers the U.S. economy and enables  almost everything the military does, including command and control of  forces, intelligence gathering, and logistical support of troops.  According  to the President of the United States, the cyber threat is thus one of the  most serious national security challenges that the nation faces. The  United States confronts a growing array of cyber threats from foreign  intelligence services and other actors, including terrorists, criminal  groups, and individual hackers, that could compromise our personal and  national security.  Protecting our digital infrastructure, while safeguarding  privacy and civil liberties, is therefore a national security priority,  according to U.S. Cyber Command.", "In June 2009, the Deputy Secretary of Defense cautioned that the cyber  threat is not an emerging or future threat, but one that is already here  today.  The Department of Defense (DOD) alone depends on 7 million  computer devices, linked on over 10,000 networks with satellite gateways  and commercial circuits that are composed of innumerable devices and  components.  The threat to DOD computer networks is thus substantial,  and the potential for sabotage and destruction is present.  While criminal  organizations are a source of concern, foreign governments have more  resources and more worrisome motivations.  Cyber warfare is attractive to  adversaries because it poses a significant threat at a low cost.  An  adversary does not need an expensive weapons program to conduct  damaging attacks; a handful of programmers could cripple an entire  information system.  Moreover, it is also an attractive weapon to our  adversaries because it is difficult to trace the origin of the attack and even  more difficult to deter one.  According to DOD, a large number of  intelligence agencies and foreign militaries are actively trying to penetrate  our military networks.  These networks are scanned millions of times a  day and probed thousands of times a day.  Over the past several years,  DOD has experienced damaging penetration to these networks.  For  example, blueprints of weapons systems have already been  compromised. Ensuring the security of these networks is therefore critical  so DOD can operate securely and confidently not only in the new cyber  domain but in the traditional military domains of land, sea, air, and space.", "In addition, the recent Quadrennial Defense Review recognized the need  for DOD to operate effectively in cyberspace and improve its policy,  doctrine, and capabilities to counter threats in cyberspace. It also  cautioned that failure to adapt to cyber threats would pose a fundamental  risk to DOD\u2019s ability to accomplish its missions today.", "In prior reports, agency inspector general offices and we have made  hundreds of recommendations to agencies for actions necessary to  resolve prior significant control deficiencies and information security  program shortfalls. In the past, we have also reviewed DOD\u2019s information  security weaknesses in various reports. For example, as early as 1991,  we reported on foreign hackers penetrating DOD computer systems  between April 1990 and May 1991, as a result of inadequate attention to  computer security, such as password management and the lack of  technical expertise on the part of some system administrators. To see  further information on past reports on DOD networks, see appendix IV.", "DOD\u2019s cyberspace operations encompass both defensive and offensive  activities, for which the primary purpose is to achieve military objectives  or effects in or through cyberspace. Defensive cyber operations are  categorized as computer network defense, which consists of actions  taken to protect, monitor, analyze, detect, and respond to unauthorized  activity within DOD information systems and computer networks. In  appendix III we provide further information on DOD tools and programs  used to defend its networks. Offensive cyber operations are comprised of  two functions: information gathering (or computer network exploitation)  and computer network attack. Computer network exploitation is the  method by which DOD and the intelligence community gather information  on adversaries in and through cyberspace. Computer network attack  consists of operations through the use of computer networks to disrupt,  deny, degrade, or destroy information residing in computers and  computer networks or the computers and networks themselves.", "In light of worldwide cybersecurity incidents in 2008, you requested that  we perform a review focused on DOD\u2019s organization and planning of  cyberspace operations, including its defensive and offensive efforts to  address cyber threats. In prior work, we have examined information  security weaknesses in federal government networks, including DOD\u2019s  networks. Our objectives for this report were to determine (1) how DOD  is organized to address cybersecurity threats; and to assess the extent to  which DOD has (2) developed joint doctrine that addresses cyberspace  operations across DOD; (3) assigned command and control  responsibilities that clearly establish roles between combatant commands  and military services; and (4) identified and taken actions to mitigate any  key capability gaps involving cyberspace operations.  In May 2010, we  reported to you on the results of our work in a classified report.  This  report is an unclassified version of that report. To remove information  DOD determined to be classified, this report omits details on DOD cyber- related planning, operations, capabilities, and capability gaps.", "To answer the objectives, we reviewed documentation and conducted  interviews with DOD officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the  Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the Air Force; U.S. Strategic  Command; U.S. Central Command; U.S. Pacific Command; U.S.  European Command; U.S. Northern Command; U.S. Africa Command;  U.S. Joint Forces Command; U.S. Special Operations Command; Joint  Staff; the National Security Agency; and other cognizant organizations.  To evaluate DOD\u2019s organization to address cybersecurity threats, we  conducted interviews and analyzed various policies, guidance, and  directives relating to organizations involved with the department\u2019s  computer network operations. We also reviewed documents involving the  reorganization and development of new organizations within the Office of  the Secretary of Defense, U.S. Strategic Command, the Air Force, and  the Navy to address cyber threats. To determine the extent to which DOD  has developed an overarching joint doctrine that addresses cyberspace  operations across DOD, we reviewed and analyzed current joint doctrine  publications involving computer network operations and U.S. Joint Forces  Command analysis of cyber-related joint doctrine. To assess the extent to  which DOD has assigned command and control responsibilities, we  compared the 2008 Unified Command Plan to DOD plans, policies, and  guidance to determine authorities for functional and combatant  commands, military services, and defense agencies. Additionally, we  reviewed and identified common lessons learned from combatant  commands following DOD\u2019s response to malware infections in 2008. To  determine any capability gaps involving computer network operations we  analyzed the fiscal year 2010 and 2011-2015 Integrated Priority Lists to  identify cyberspace capability gaps for the functional and geographic  combatant commands. Finally, we analyzed the National Intelligence  Estimate, The Global Cyber Threat to the U.S. Information Infrastructure,  the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s Cyber Threat Intelligence Highlights,  and prior GAO reports on cybersecurity to determine the depth of cyber  threats facing the nation and DOD.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2008 to April 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards  and worked with DOD from November 2010 to July 2011 to prepare an  unclassified version of this report for public release. Government auditing  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

National cyber policy was  updated in 2003 with The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.  Presidential Decision Directive 63 was superseded later that year by  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, which assigned the Secretary  of Homeland Security responsibility for coordinating the nation\u2019s overall  critical infrastructure protection efforts, including protection of the cyber  infrastructure, across all sectors (federal, state, local, and private) working  in cooperation with designated sector-specific agencies within the  executive branch. Both of these policies focused on defensive  strategies, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 did not  emphasize protection of federal government information systems.   Subsequent classified presidential directives and strategic planning  documents have continued to reflect evolving federal policy in response  to cyber threats.", "Recognizing the need for common solutions to improve cybersecurity, the  White House, Office of Management and Budget, and various federal  agencies have launched or continued several governmentwide initiatives  that are intended to enhance information security at federal agencies.  According to Director of National Intelligence implementing guidance, in  2008 the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative was begun in  order to develop an approach to address current threats, anticipate future  threats and technologies, and foster innovative public-private  partnerships. It was created to bridge cyber-related missions for federal  agencies, by asking them to undertake a set of 12 initiatives and 7  strategic enabling activities. According to DOD officials, these initiatives  include defensive, offensive, research and development, and  counterintelligence efforts. Programs focus primarily on the security of  executive-branch networks, which represent only a fraction of the global  information and communications infrastructure on which the United States  depends.", "In May 2009, the National Security Council and Homeland Security  Council completed a 60-day interagency review intended to assess U.S.  policies and structures for cybersecurity and outline initial areas for  action.

In 2008, U.S. Strategic Command developed the Operational Concept for  Cyberspace, which identifies near-term concepts to improve operations in  and through cyberspace and gain superiority over potential adversaries in  support of national objectives. The 2009 Quadrennial Roles and  Missions Review Report discussed efforts by the Cyber Issue Team,  jointly led by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and  U.S. Strategic Command, which addressed cyberspace issues related to  developing, structuring, and employing the cyberspace force. Also in  2009, U.S. Strategic Command developed an Operations Order titled  Operation Gladiator Phoenix to provide DOD with a strategic framework  to operate, secure, and defend the global information grid. As early as  2006, the Quadrennial Defense Review highlighted the department\u2019s  need to be capable of shaping and defending cyberspace.

Cyber threats to federal information  systems continue to evolve and grow. These threats can be unintentional  or intentional, targeted or nontargeted, and can come from a variety of  sources. Unintentional threats can be caused by inattentive or untrained  employees, software upgrades, maintenance procedures, and equipment  failures that inadvertently disrupt systems or corrupt data. Intentional  threats include both targeted and nontargeted attacks. An attack is  considered to be targeted when a group or individual attacks a specific  system or cyber-based critical infrastructure. A nontargeted attack occurs  when the intended target of the attack is uncertain, such as when a virus,  worm, or other malicious software is released on the Internet with no  specific target.", "Government officials are concerned about cyber attacks from individuals  and groups with malicious intent, such as criminals, terrorists, and  adversarial foreign nations. Threats to DOD computer networks posed by  the intelligence branches of foreign countries and hackers alike represent  an unprecedented national security challenge. For example, in February  2009, the Director of National Intelligence testified that foreign nations  and criminals have targeted government and private-sector networks to  gain a competitive advantage and potentially disrupt or destroy them, and  that terrorist groups have expressed a desire to use cyber attacks as a  means to target the United States.

Joint doctrine consists of   fundamental principles to guide the employment of U.S. military forces in  coordinated action toward a common objective and should include key  terms, tactics, techniques, and procedures. In order to be effective,  combatant commands and military services need to understand the joint  functions within the domain and the manner in which those joint functions  are integrated globally as well as operationally. The cyberspace domain is  inherently joint; it cuts across all combatant commands, military services,  and agency boundaries and supports engagement operations for all  geographic combatant commands. Therefore, DOD expects that a joint  publication focusing on all aspects of cyberspace operation will not only  enhance the operational effectiveness and performance of joint U.S  forces but also provide a doctrinal basis for collaborative planning and  interagency coordination.", "DOD determined that it has addressed cyberspace-related topics in at  least 16 DOD joint doctrine publications and mentions \u201ccyberspace  operations\u201d in at least 8 joint publications.

U.S. Joint  Forces Command\u2019s assessment of the existing state of joint doctrine for  cyber issues concluded that while the term \u201ccyberspace operations\u201d was  addressed or mentioned in 8 approved and draft publications, none  contained a significant discussion of cyberspace operations.", "U.S. Joint Forces Command\u2019s assessment of DOD joint publications  showed that the majority of references to cyberspace operations come  from Joint Publication 3-13, Information Operations\u2014the current  publication with the most relevance to cyber issues. While this  publication may have been sufficient for its intentioned purposes at the  time it was written in 2006, U.S. Strategic Command reported that  Information Operations should be revised to use updated cyberspace  terminology and content. U.S. Strategic Command reported that the  publication is not currently sufficient and does not provide a basis for   cyberspace joint doctrine for 3 key reasons. First, its definition of  cyberspace does not reflect the scope of the current definition of  cyberspace that was approved by the Deputy Secretary of Defense in  May 2008. The definition in the publication restricts cyberspace to  \u201cdigital information communicated over computer networks,\u201d while the  current approved definition recognizes cyberspace as a global domain  within the information environment that includes the Internet,  telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded  processors and controllers. Second, the publication discusses computer  network operations as a component of information operations by grouping  it with military deception, operation security, psychological operations,  and electronic warfare; but it does not recognize the scope of computer  network operations as a warfighting domain. Third, Joint Publication 3-13  omits integral elements in the discussion of computer network operations  that are important to provide a complete view and scope of cyberspace  operations. For example, the publication discusses computer network  attack and computer network defense but does not thoroughly address  key elements such as computer network defense response actions,  computer network attack\u2013operational preparation of the environment, or  network operations. Our analysis of the current usage of cyber-related  terms confirms that these are considered important elements of both  computer network operations and cyberspace operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks a Common Definition of Cyber Personnel", "paragraphs": ["Another example of the shortfall in existing doctrine is the lack of a  common definition for what constitutes cyber personnel in DOD.  According to a U.S. Joint Forces Command report, the cyberspace  operations community lacks a common dictionary of terms, and the terms  defined in current doctrine are not used uniformly. This can cause  confusion in planning for adequate types and numbers of personnel.  Because career paths and skill sets are scattered across various career  identifiers, the military services and commands vary in their scope and  definitions of what constitutes cyber personnel. As a result, there are  cases in which the same cyber-related term may mean something  different among the services. In another report, the U.S. Joint Forces  Command found that 18 different cyber position titles across combatant  commands are used to identify cyberspace forces. Some of these titles  may be inconsistent from command to command and are likely to be  duplicates. According to the report, U.S. Pacific Command had the largest  number of cyber personnel positions and position titles compared to other  combatant commands, while some commands reported no cyber  personnel. This may be due in part to duplicative and differing definitions  among the combatant commands of what constitutes cyber personnel.  Examples of cyberspace-related position titles from combatant  commands include  \uf0b7  Computer Network Attack Intelligence Officer,  \uf0b7  Computer Network Attack Ops Officer,  \uf0b7  Computer Network Attack Ops Planner,  \uf0b7  Computer Network Attack Planner,  \uf0b7  Computer Network Attack Weapons Risk Assessor,  \uf0b7  Computer Network Defense Planner,  \uf0b7  Computer Network Operations Exercises Officer,  \uf0b7  Computer Network Operations Planner,  \uf0b7  Computer Network Operations Technician,  \uf0b7  \uf0b7  \uf0b7  \uf0b7  \uf0b7  Network Attack Planner,  \uf0b7  Network Defender,  \uf0b7  Network Defense Planner,  \uf0b7  Network Warfare Planner, and  Information Assurance Support Person,  Intelligence Support to Computer Network Attack,  Intelligence Support to Computer Network Defense,  Intelligence Systems Officer / Computer Network Defense,  The lack of clear guidance on cyber personnel in joint doctrine is also  reflected in the military services. The military services do not currently  have specific job identifiers for cyberspace operations, and cyberspace- related jobs are generally identified under the umbrella of intelligence,  communication, or command and control. While the military services bring  unique capabilities based upon their individual core competencies,  cyberspace forces must meet joint standards. U.S. Joint Forces  Command, whose mission is to synchronize global forces, reported that it  is unable to quickly and easily identify personnel who are certified for  cyber operations, as there is no identifier in the personnel records that  indicate if the individual is a \u201ccyber warrior.\u201d Additionally, U.S. Strategic  Command reviewed current military service cyber force identifiers and  reported that the Air Force identifies computer-related careers under  \u201cgeneral\u201d for enlisted personnel and under \u201cnon-technical\u201d skills for  officers; the Navy identifies computer network operation careers under  \u201cinformation warfare\u201d for officers and \u201cinformation systems technicians\u201d or  \u201cintelligence and communications\u201d for enlisted personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Recognizes the Need to Update and Improve Cyber-Related Joint Doctrine but Lacks a Timetable for Completion", "paragraphs": ["DOD recognizes the need to update and improve cyber-related joint  doctrine.

DOD\u2019s well-established joint doctrine development processes  provides a sound structure to assess all aspects of cyber operations,  propose doctrinal change or creation, and establish clear time frames for  completing interim and final efforts.

The strategy also states that cyberspace provides the  foundation for command and control of military operations in other  domains and that, due to the nature of cyberspace, command and control  requires extremely short decision-making cycles.

The Unified Command Plan also states  that, unless otherwise directed, combatant commanders will exercise  command authority over all commands and forces assigned to them, in  accordance with section 164 of title 10 of the U.S. Code.

Furthermore, DOD said that this  process will also include related cyber lexicon and definitions. While our  report was in final processing, DOD began to publish some of the  doctrinal updates they had agreed needed to be made. Since the National  Military Strategy for Cyberspace Operations was published in 2006, we  believe the new joint doctrine assessment represents progress that  should help DOD address some of the existing gaps in joint doctrine with  a time frame for completing the effort.

However, DOD stated it had already  satisfied this recommendation by means of the June 23, 2009,  memorandum establishing U.S. Cyber Command and the 2008 Unified  Command Plan. According to DOD, both documents have promulgated  clear guidance for command and control relationships. The Secretary of  Defense memorandum establishing the U.S. Cyber Command does  allude to the U.S. Cyber Command implementation plan, which does  contain some information on command and control relationships, but  does not provide the kind of clear guidance we describe as lacking in our  report. The implementation plan further alludes to a U.S. Cyber  Command Concept of Operations that will be published at a later date,  which may provide further information on command and control guidance.  While the 2008 Unified Command Plan discusses missions and  responsibilities for U.S. Strategic Command in cyberspace operations, we  believe this information is outdated, considering the memo directing the  establishment of U.S. Cyber Command was issued in June 2009.  Although it is early in the establishment process for the new U.S. Cyber  Command, we continue to believe that DOD should take advantage of  opportunities to develop and articulate clear command and control  guidance that will provide a timely and cohesive approach to combating  cyber threats throughout the chain of functional and geographic  combatant commands, the services, and other DOD components in  anticipation of the U.S. Cyber Command reaching full operating capability  in October 2010.

For example, in 1991,  we reported on foreign hackers penetrating DOD computer systems  between April 1990 and May 1991, as a result of inadequate attention to  computer security, such as password management and the lack of  technical expertise on the part of some system administrators. In May  1996, we reported that unknown and unauthorized individuals were  increasingly attacking and gaining access to highly sensitive unclassified  information on DOD\u2019s computer systems. We reported that external  attacks on DOD computer systems were a serious and growing threat.  According to DOD officials, attackers had stolen, modified, and destroyed  both data and software. They had installed \u201cback doors\u201d that  circumvented normal system protection and allowed attackers  unauthorized future access. They had shut down and crashed entire  systems and networks. In September 1996, we issued a report, based on  detailed analyses and testing of general computer controls, that identified  pervasive vulnerabilities in DOD information systems. We had found that  authorized users could also exploit the same vulnerabilities that made  external attacks possible to commit fraud or other improper or malicious  acts. In fact, knowledgeable insiders with malicious intentions could pose  a more serious threat than outsiders, since they could be more aware of  system weaknesses and how to disguise inappropriate actions. Our  report highlighted the lack of a comprehensive information security  program and made numerous recommendations for corrective actions. In  August 1999, we reported that DOD had made limited progress in  correcting the general control weaknesses we reported in 1996. We also  found that serious weaknesses in DOD information security continued to  provide both hackers and hundreds of thousands of authorized users  opportunities to modify, steal, inappropriately disclose, and destroy  sensitive DOD data. As a result, numerous defense functions, including  weapons and supercomputer research, logistics, finance, procurement,  personnel management, military health, and payroll, have already been  adversely affected by system attacks or fraud. In 2003, we reported that  DOD faced many risks in its use of globally networked computer systems  to perform operational missions\u2014such as identifying and tracking enemy  targets\u2014and daily management functions, such as paying soldiers and  managing supplies.
