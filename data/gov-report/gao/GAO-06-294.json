This list included job creation, infrastructure development, and other activities that are generally acknowledged to directly affect overall economic growth. Using this list, GAO identified 86 federal programs in 10 federal agencies and 3 regional commissions and authorities that provide economic development funding. Because federal agencies use different criteria as to what constitutes rural, determining how much funding has targeted rural areas required determining which method of defining rural was the best for tracking funding. Classification systems that can track funding data at the census tract level or below can better differentiate between rural and urban areas because they better reflect the economic and social diversity than do county-based systems that are based on political boundaries. Because limitations in the data did not allow tracking all the funding data to local levels, GAO used a system that used population and commuting relationships to classify census tracts and then classify each county as rural or urban based on the county's dominant commuting pattern. The 86 programs in 2002-2004 provided approximately $200 billion in total economic development funding, about $150 billion of which could be tracked to the county level or below. However, the amount of funding provided to rural areas varied widely by program, agency, state, and region. These calculations were complicated by significant problems with the data from the programs that federal agencies were reporting to Census. Although all federal agencies are required to submit obligations data for their programs quarterly, 44 of the programs GAO analyzed did not report any data or reported incomplete or inaccurate data for all or part of fiscal years 2002, 2003, or 2004. As a result, the reported obligations were off by more than $11 billon. Further, some 19 programs provided no information on obligations of about $4.5 billion, and another 25 programs reported amounts that varied significantly from actual obligations. The FAADS reporting requirement has been in place since 1982. But a lack of knowledge among program officials about the requirement and poor oversight has affected compliance with it."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to a congressional request, we issued a report in 1989 that  sought to determine the portion of overall federal economic development  funding that was being directed to rural areas to ensure that rural America  is not left behind. Our 1989 report sought to determine how much of $29  billion in economic development funding from 88 programs in 1987 had  gone to rural counties.  In that report, we defined rural counties as those  counties with urban populations of less than 20,000 (based on the 1980  Census)\u2014a definition that was widely accepted at the time. We found that  while about 16 percent of the population lived in rural counties, those  counties received about 17 percent of the funding for the programs for  which we were able to report data.", "Since our report was issued, researchers have developed more exact  methods of differentiating flows of federal funds between rural and urban  areas. The new systems generally rely on census tracts, which are far more  numerous than counties, and use software programs to \u201cgeocode,\u201d or track,  federal funding to that level. Because of these developments and ongoing  concerns about the amounts rural areas have been receiving compared  with their urban counterparts, you asked us to update our 1989 report and  examine the share of economic development funds that support rural areas  today.", "Examining this question requires defining and identifying what constitutes  an economic development program, defining what constitutes a rural area,  and obtaining and analyzing data on federal funding provided to these  programs. As we reported in 1989 and again in 2000, there is a lack of  agreement on the definition of \u201ceconomic development.\u201d As a result, we  agreed to (1) develop a way to identify federal economic development  programs, (2) determine which system of classifying geographical areas as  rural or urban best suits the purposes of this report, (3) use the economic  development framework and classification system to identify rural areas  and report the amount and share of economic development funding these  areas have received, and (4) examine issues related to reporting  requirements for federal agencies that disburse economic development  funds.", "We identified economic development programs using the same list of  economic development activities that we used for our 2000 report,  supplemented by activities we identified through other research studies  and information provided by federal program officials and external rural  development groups. Using this list as our criteria, we identified about 135  programs from the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) that  appeared to fit our framework. We discussed these programs and our  reasons for choosing them with the administering federal agencies,  regional commissions, and regional authorities. Based on those discussions  and a more detailed review of the programs, we modified our framework  somewhat and reduced the number of programs to 86. We then attempted  to obtain obligation data for each of the programs from the Federal  Assistance Award Data System (FAADS), which is maintained by the U.S.  Census Bureau (Census) for the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  and used to prepare the annual Consolidated Federal Funds Report  (CFFR). If we found that agencies were reporting inaccurate or  incomplete data to FAADS, in most cases we obtained the corrected data  directly from the federal agencies and regional commissions and  authorities. Following a recommendation we made in 2004 on defining  rural areas, we used a classification system that is based on characteristics  at the census tract level and geocoded the data to differentiate between  rural and urban areas. We compared our findings using both this new  system and the system that we used in our 1989 report.

Economic development programs implemented during the 1930s  characteristically involved direct federal action, bypassing state and local  governments. During the 1940s and 1950s, these programs were intended to  improve housing and commercial districts in central cities. In the 1960s, the  federal government created programs to provide economic development  assistance to economically distressed areas. These programs were  expanded in the 1980s and 1990s to utilize new technologies to create new  transit systems, clean up hazardous waste sites, and carry out other  economic development activities in urban and rural areas. Most recently,  economic development initiatives have included the revitalization of  disaster areas, including lower Manhattan after the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks and the Gulf Coast after the 2005 hurricane season.", "A variety of federal programs and federally funded regional commissions  and authorities have helped advance economic development in  communities throughout the United States, including many communities  that are considered rural. Most of the nationwide programs do not have  specific rural economic development objectives, but the regional  commissions and authorities target economic rural areas specifically. For  this reason, a narrow definition of economic development programs that  only included those focusing exclusively on rural areas would include few  programs and limited dollars.", "The nationwide programs also do not have a standard definition of  economic development. Department of Commerce officials, for example,  consider economic development programs as those that save or create  jobs. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials consider economic  development broadly as activities that increase economic opportunities  and improve residents\u2019 quality of life. Officials at other federal agencies,  including the Department of Defense (DOD), the Department of  Transportation (DOT), and the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), said that they did not have definitions of economic  development.", "Like the concept of economic development, the notion of what constitutes  rural and urban areas has evolved over several decades, partly in response  to changes in residential and commuting patterns. As the cities and suburbs  have expanded and more remote areas have become accessible,  distinctions between rural and urban areas have blurred. Federal agencies  use different criteria as to what constitutes a rural area. Depending on the  agency and the program, the criterion most often used to define rural areas  is population, especially at USDA, which uses varying thresholds ranging  from 2,500 or less to 50,000. Some agencies and programs that fund  economic development activities do not focus on serving rural or urban  areas but instead provide competitive or formula-based grants to eligible  applicants from any location.", "FAADS is a centralized reporting system that OMB established in April 1980  to gather and disseminate information on the domestic financial assistance  provided by federal agencies. Authorized by the Consolidated Federal  Funds Report Act of 1982, FAADS is a quarterly report of financial  assistance awards made by each federal agency. OMB has designated  Census as its executive agent to manage and operate the system, which the  Congress and public officials use for policy and trend analyses, revenue  forecasting, oversight, and legislative initiatives.

We also held discussions with the  administering federal agencies, regional commissions, and regional  authorities to reach consensus on the activities and programs we selected.", "Our framework includes nine economic development activities:   planning and developing strategies for job creation and retention;  constructing and renovating commercial buildings;  establishing business incubators (facilities to help small businesses get   developing infrastructure by constructing and repairing roads, water  and sewer systems, and airports;  promoting the development of new markets for existing products;   developing telecommunications and broadband infrastructure and  enabling technology transfer; and  developing and improving areas for tourism.", "The first five activities listed above, with the exception of developing  airports, are from our 2000 report. That list was developed based on a  general consensus of officials from (1) the Department of Commerce\u2019s  Economic Development Administration, whose mission is to help  economically distressed areas, (2) other federal agencies involved with  economic development, and (3) several national associations familiar with  economic development. For this report, we confirmed the 2000 list with  officials from the same federal agencies and organizations and also reached  a general consensus on the four additional items. In general, we focused on  activities that directly affected the overall development of an area, such as  job creation, rather than on activities that improved individuals\u2019 quality of  life, such as housing and education. However, we did include job training  that had a direct impact on economic development by, for example,  preparing employees for work in a specific industry or business in a  particular area.", "We identified 86 federal programs at 10 federal agencies and 3 regional  commissions that included one or more of the activities in our economic  development framework. Many of these programs were not labeled as  economic development programs, but some of their activities suggested  that they supported this goal. For example:  The goal of USDA\u2019s Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community  program for rural areas is to stimulate the creation of new jobs,  particularly for the disadvantaged and long-term unemployed, and to  revitalize economically distressed rural areas.", "The Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior) Bureau of Indian Affairs  Facilities Operations and Maintenance program provides funding for  basic services at noneducational facilities located on reservations.", "The Department of Commerce\u2019s Trade Adjustment Assistance program  provides assistance to firms and industries adversely affected by  increased imports.", "The Appalachian Regional Commission, which oversees the  Appalachian Development Highway System, aims to open up areas with  development potential where commerce and communication have been  inhibited by lack of adequate access.", "The number of programs each agency and commission administered that  met one or more of the components of our economic development  framework varied from one at the Denali Commission\u2014established in 1998  to address the needs of rural Alaska\u2014to 29 at USDA. We included only  economic development programs that received funding during our review  period (fiscal years 2002 to 2004).

These classification systems provide a more precise way  of differentiating between rural and urban areas than county-based  systems. Further, computer software programs can now geocode federal  funding data below the county level. Due to data limitations that only  allowed us to identify subcounty level recipients for about half of the  funding, we chose to use a system developed in 2001 which relies on both  population and commuting patterns of census tracts to classify each county  as rural or urban based on the counties dominant commuting patterns.  Although this approach does not fully resolve all the classification  problems inherent in county-based systems that are based on political  boundaries rather than demographic characteristics, it allowed us to  geocode most of the data and was most comparable to census population  data.", "We considered a number of county-based and subcounty systems for  analyzing the data (table 1).", "We found shortcomings with most of these systems. For example:  Many studies that have evaluated the rural share of federal programs,  including our 1989 report, have used the rural-urban continuum codes  devised by the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the USDA. These  codes distinguish counties by their degree of urbanization and proximity  to a metropolitan area or areas. While using rural-urban continuum  codes allows geocoding at the county level, the results are often  skewed, particularly in the western states, where counties often are very  large. For example, using this approach, more than 50 percent of the  nation\u2019s rural population would live in counties that would be  considered urban (based on the 2000 Census).", "Urban influence codes, which were developed by ERS in 1993 as a way  to measure rurality by quantifying the influence of urban areas on rural  areas, use only county-level data and are based solely on urban factors.  As a result, the classifications are heavily skewed toward urban.", "Beginning in the 1990s, ERS and other organizations have developed  subcounty classification systems that attempt to better capture differences  between rural and urban areas. These subcounty classification systems  include elements such as commuting zones and labor market areas that are  more precise than the county level systems in order to capture the  economic and social diversity of rural areas. Some use census tracts  (about 62,000) or other geographic areas smaller than counties (about  3,000) that can better reflect rural-urban differences.", "Census\u2019s urbanized areas and urban cluster system defines rural areas by  exclusion\u2014that is, it views as rural all areas that it has not already  identified as urban. Census defines urbanized areas as continuously built  up areas with a population of at least 50,000 and compromising one or  more places and adjacent densely settled areas. Urban clusters are densely  settled territories with at least 2,500 but fewer than 50,000 people.  Collectively, urbanized areas and urban clusters are referred to as urban  areas and essentially depict densely settled territory as it may appear from  the air (see fig. 1).", "On the basis of these definitions, data from the 2000 Census suggest that 59  million Americans (20 percent of the population) reside in rural areas. As  we reported in our 2004 report, using urbanized areas and urban clusters is  an effective way to make consistent eligibility determinations for individual  rural economic development programs when data is available at the census  tract level. However, we found that our ability to track funds to the local  level varied significantly across agencies. For example, while rural housing  and most other USDA program data could be geocoded to the local level,  most DOT spending could be tracked only to the counties. Thus, while  geocoding data using urbanized areas and urban clusters would effectively  show rural and urban differences, limitations with the data would only  allow us to geocode about half of the data under this classification system.", "Ultimately, we chose the dominant RUCA system, developed by the  Washington State Office of Community and Rural Health in 2001, because it  uses both census tracts and county codes to determine which areas are  rural. Using this system we were able to code 99 percent of the economic  development funding. The dominant RUCA system is based on the 10- tiered subcounty RUCA system developed by ERS in conjunction with the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the late 1990s. RUCA  reflects both where people live and work by using both population and  commuting relationships to classify census tracts. The dominant RUCA  system classifies each county as rural or urban based on the dominant  commuting patterns.", "Figure 2 shows a map of the rural and urban areas as defined by both the  census tracts on which the RUCA codes are based and by the dominant  RUCA system that we used due to the data limitations.", "Although the census tract RUCA code map better reflects where people live  and work, using the dominant RUCA system we determined that 19 percent  of the U.S. population resided in rural areas. This figure is comparable to  the 20 percent figure cited in the 2000 Census.", "The rural-urban continuum classification system does not explicitly define  rural. However, the rural-urban continuum codes can be combined to  create rural and urban designations. (See fig. 3.)", "For example, in our 1989 report we defined as rural any county whose  urban population was less than 20,000 people.

We were able to use geocoding to track  about $150 billion of those dollars to the county level or below. We could  not track beyond the state level another $50 billion that was passed through  state capitals to county and local jurisdictions because we could not  identify final recipients. If we had geocoded the funding for pass-through  programs at the state capitals, the share of spending associated with urban  areas\u2014where state capitals are typically located\u2014would have been  overstated. For the approximately $150 billion that we could geocode to  the county level or below, our analysis showed that during fiscal years 2002  through 2004, rural areas received more economic development program  assistance dollars per capita than their urban counterparts. The overall  shares of funding varied by the administering program and agency, and by  the state and region receiving the money, with rural areas receiving a  greater share of the funding in some cases and urban areas in others.", "When we analyzed economic development funding by program, we found  wide variations in the percentage of funding that went to rural areas. The  funding ranged from a high of 100 percent for the Interior\u2019s Improvement  and Repair of Indian Detention Facilities Program down to about 1 percent  for DOT\u2019s Transit Planning and Research Program and HUD\u2019s Brownfields  Economic Development Initiative. The programs with the highest  percentage of rural funding tended to be from USDA, whose funding  decisions are primarily based on specific definitions of rural, and from  Interior and the commissions and authorities whose programs serve rural  areas. In contrast, HUD, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and  DOL were among the agencies with the lowest percentage of funding  reaching rural areas who also had significant pass-through dollar amounts.", "Most program funding by these agencies to eligible applicants is done using  a formula or on a competitive basis without differentiating between rural  and urban areas.", "USDA had the most programs providing economic development funding for  rural areas, but DOT provided the largest amount of economic  development funding overall (fig.4). DOT also accounted for the largest  overall amount of pass-through dollars ($37.9 billion), but higher  percentages of funds from EPA, DOL, and HUD were sent to state capitals.  We were unable to track 88 percent of EPA\u2019s funding, 79 percent of DOL\u2019s,  or 75 percent of HUD\u2019s below the state level, and excluded those dollars  from our analysis.

Under both models, the amount of federal agency, regional  commission, or authority funding to rural areas varied widely. For example,  using the dominant RUCA model we found that the amounts provided to  rural areas ranged from 7 percent or less for the portion of DOL and EPA  funding we could track to about 58 percent for USDA and 77 percent for  the Delta Regional Authority.", "The share of economic development funding that rural areas received also  varied by state. Under the dominant RUCA model, the shares varied from  85 percent of the total funding in Wyoming to 3 percent in Massachusetts.

The programs we  reviewed accounted for less than 10 percent of the federal programs that  should be providing obligation information to FAADS. Since the FAADS  reporting requirements are the same for all federal agencies and  commissions that administer financial assistance programs\u2014not just those  involved in economic development\u2014the amount of unreported and  misreported funding is likely far greater than the $11 billion we identified  during our review.", "Even though the FAADS reporting requirement has been in place since  1982, for the agencies we reviewed, several factors affected the extent of  compliance with the FAADS requirements.

During the course of our review, we talked  with Census officials about the significant lack of compliance with FAADS  reporting requirements, and officials from Census and OMB held several  discussions about the problem. The culmination of these discussions was a  meeting held in April 2005 between OMB, Census, and most of the agencies  responsible for reporting information to FAADS. The purpose of the  meeting was to allow OMB and Census to explain to the agencies the  importance of submitting their obligation information on all programs on a  quarterly basis as required.

Also, the Appalachian Regional Commission told us that it  has instituted internal controls to prevent duplicate submissions to  FAADS and to prevent the reporting of all investments under one CFDA  number.", "Interior had not updated its \u201ccross-walk\u201d of internal data codes that is  intended to keep current with changes in the CFDA. As a result, Interior  had underreported its FAADS data by nearly $56 million for fiscal years  2002 and 2003. The staff member in charge of reporting to FAADS told  us that he had learned that some of his data codes were out of date only  after we questioned some inaccuracies in the data. Interior has since  rerun its data with the new codes and planned to resubmit corrected  information to Census for fiscal year 2004.", "Also, Interior\u2019s Outdoor Recreation, Acquisition, Development and  Planning program reported to FAADS obligations amounting to about  $64 million. Data we subsequently obtained from the agency showed  obligations totaling more than $290 million. An agency official explained  that until recently, there had been no monitoring of the information  submitted to FAADS.", "HUD has consistently submitted to FAADS expenditure rather than  obligation data. When questioned about this practice, a HUD official  told us that the agency\u2019s systems were set up to capture expenditure  data. We found significant differences between expenditures and  obligations in the funding information for two of the six HUD programs  we evaluated. HUD met with Census and OMB in June 2005 about the  issue and was considering ways to change its system to supply the  required obligations data. Subsequently, another HUD official told us  that a new system that would collect and report program obligation data  rather than expenditure data to Census would be operational some time  during 2006.", "We questioned a FAADS submission by HHS for the department\u2019s Native  American programs for fiscal year 2002 because the more than $82  million in obligations reported for that year totaled more than three  times the $26.2 million budget for this program. For fiscal year 2003, the  $37 million reported to FAADS was about $16 million more than the  $20.8 million actual obligation amount provided to us by HHS. For fiscal  year 2004, the $37 million reported to FAADS was about $13 million  more than the $23.9 million reported to us by HHS. An HHS official said  that she could not explain the discrepancies.", "For HHS\u2019s Health Care and Other Facilities program, the FAADS  submission for Fiscal Year 2002 totaled $620 million\u2014more than $300  million more than what HHS\u2019s internal system showed. An HHS official  agreed that the appropriate figure for the year was about $314 million  and said that HHS planned to review its data system to correct the  discrepancy.", "We also questioned the figure of $1.3 billion that HHS reported for its  Community Services Block Grant Discretionary Awards program for  fiscal year 2002, because the department\u2019s internal grant-tracking  system showed a figure of about $55 million. After looking into the  discrepancy, an HHS official indicated that the department had for  several years mistakenly combined the Community Services Block  Grant program and the Discretionary Awards program under the  Discretionary Awards CFDA program number. However, the $1.3 billion  total reported to FAADS also appeared to be incorrect, as the total  obligations for the two programs combined in fiscal year 2002 was about  $700 million\u2014about $600 million less than what was reported to Census.  HHS has agreed to correct the discrepancy, beginning with its fiscal year  2006 submission.", "The Small Business Administration (SBA) did not include in its FAADS  submission the funding for a special loan program under its Small  Business Loan program that was set up to assist the World Trade Center  area after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. As a result, the  agency\u2019s obligations were underreported by about $828 million for fiscal  year 2003 and about $3.1 billion for fiscal year 2004. According to an  SBA official, the agency will review the data that it provides to FAADS  more closely in order to avoid such discrepancies in the future.", "According to the Census official who oversees the FAADS program, most  of the agency staffs who submitted the data to Census had very little  involvement with program operations, adding that the individual program  managers who were most knowledgeable about the data\u2019s accuracy and  completeness generally did not get involved. OMB has required since fiscal  year 1982 that agency officials review and sign off on a compliance form  when submitting quarterly data. The form contains a series of statements,  including one that reads, \u201cAll agency financial assistance award programs  are covered in agency\u2019s FAADS sources.\u201d However, the official we spoke  with who oversaw the program and had been involved with it since 1996  said that he had never seen a compliance form accompanying a quarterly  report. It appeared that neither Census nor OMB was enforcing the  requirement. Both Census and OMB staff told us that OMB had previously  considered amending its guidance (Circular A-89) on reporting financial  assistance data to specifically require that each agency appoint an official  responsible for certifying that the FAADS data were accurately reported to  Census. However, at the time of our review, the guidance had not been  amended.", "Officials in a number of agencies commented about the lack of controls for  submissions of data to FAADS and told us that requiring data certification  would likely improve data quality. For example, one FAADS coordinator  noted that the agency had no internal control checks in place to determine  which programs should report cost information in any particular quarter or  whether program personnel were submitting the required cost information.  Other agency officials indicated that their agencies had no controls over  FAADS data, including having individuals responsible for certifying that the  data submitted was correct. Finally, one USDA official noted that USDA  had been recording some FAADS information manually rather than through  an electronic system but added that the agency is expected to automate the  data collection system in 2006."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government funds a wide variety of programs that provide rural  areas with economic development money. These programs provide  assistance that directly supports communities\u2019 economic well-being  through such activities as creating and helping to retain jobs; constructing  and repairing roads, airports, and water systems; establishing business  incubators; and developing and improving tourist areas. Exactly how much  assistance rural areas receive from the various economic development  programs depends on how \u201crural\u201d is defined, a definition which is  constantly changing as advances in transportation, computer technology,  and telecommunications\u2014along with the spread of suburbia\u2014continue to  blur many of the distinctions between rural and urban life. We found that  the amount of economic development funding provided to rural areas  varied widely by program, agency, state, and region.", "However, both the Congress and the public are at a disadvantage in trying  to assess the exact levels of funds rural areas receive because agencies  have not provided accurate funding data for economic development  programs. Our review showed that the data were often inaccurate or had  not been reported at all. As a result, the information published by Census in  reports issued to the Congress and the general public for the programs we  examined was off by billions of dollars. We reviewed fewer than 10 percent  of the programs that are required by OMB to provide obligation information  to Census. Because the reporting requirements do not differ for the  remaining 90 percent or more of the programs that are required to report to  FAADS, the accuracy of the remaining program data are likely  questionable. OMB has recently begun to meet with agency officials to  improve agency reporting, and several agencies have agreed to implement  changes that should ensure more accurate and complete compliance. Such  efforts should improve the data submitted to FAADS. But the types of  errors we identified will persist unless OMB emphasizes the importance of  establishing improved controls at the agencies and at Census, including  requirements that agencies certify their FAADS submissions and that  Census notify agencies when significant errors occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that Census receives accurate funding information from  federal agencies, OMB should consider improving its oversight of  compliance with FAADS reporting requirements.

The Deputy Secretary of Commerce provided written comments  that are provided in appendix III. OMB provided oral comments, stating  that it agreed that improvements are needed in the FAADS reporting  process. OMB officials said that they would continue to regularly reach out  to individual agencies on FAADS reporting requirements, and when  requested by Census, will provide support in notifying agencies that do not  report or significantly misreport their FAADS data. They also said that they  would discuss the need for having higher-level agency officials certify  FAADS data submitted to Census at their next agencywide outreach  meeting in April 2006.", "The Deputy Secretary of Commerce wrote that the Census generally agrees  with the report\u2019s conclusions and recommendations and that the  difficulties GAO encountered with FAADS provide insights into the breadth  and depth of the complexities involved for its staff in collecting, analyzing,  and tabulating this large governmentwide data set. He wrote that the  department will work with OMB and the individual reporting agencies to  identify additional resources and streamlined methodologies to make  future data more complete and accurate.", "The Census official who oversees FAADS provided us with oral comments  that expanded on the Deputy Secretary\u2019s comments, stating that he agreed  with the need for OMB to regularly outreach to individual agencies and to  require agency officials to certify the accuracy and completeness of data  reported to FAADS. He also agreed that there is a need to identify and  notify agencies that do not report or significantly misreport their FAADS  obligation data, and noted that his office has been routinely reporting  problems to agencies. However, he said that his office needs more support  from OMB to succeed in this area. For example, he said that Census  contacted 12 federal agencies in mid-September 2005 informing them about  significant data problems with their fiscal year 2004 FAADS data  submissions, including many of the items we reported as missing in this  report. However, he said that 7 of the 12 agencies did not respond in any  way as to how they planned to correct the types of discrepancies in the  future. In light of this new information, we revised our recommendation to  acknowledge that OMB should provide additional support to Census in  notifying agencies that do not report or significantly misreport their FAADS  obligation data.", "In addition to the comments we obtained from OMB and Commerce, we  also obtained technical comments from most of the other agencies and  commissions included in our review. We incorporated the comments in the  report as appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from its  issuance date. At that time we will send copies of the report to interested  members of Congress and congressional committees.

We interviewed  officials from the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Commerce  (Commerce), Defense (DOD), Housing and Urban Development (HUD),  Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), Interior (Interior), and  Transportation (DOT). We also interviewed officials from the Small  Business Administration (SBA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  Appalachian Regional Commission, Denali Commission, and Delta  Regional Authority.", "Because there is no commonly accepted definition of what constitutes  federal economic development, we developed a framework for discussing  economic development using our prior reports and research studies by the  National Council for Urban Economic Development, the Progressive Policy  Institute, the Cornell Community and Rural Development Institute, and the  Northeast-Midwest Institute\u2018s Center for Regional Policy. We also used  information provided by federal program officials and external rural  development groups, including the Aspen Institute Community Strategies  Group, the Sonoran Institute, the Southern Rural Development Initiative,  and the Progressive Policy Institute. We then used the framework to define  activities that were generally accepted as being related to economic  development and reviewed program descriptions from the Catalog of  Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) to assess which programs fostered or  assisted with economic development. We originally identified about 135  programs and held discussions with the administering agencies, regional  commissions, and authorities on our framework and the programs  selected. Based on those discussions we modified our framework and  eliminated programs that did not meet the modified framework. In some  cases we obtained more detailed information on programs beyond that in  the CFDA program descriptions. We settled on 86 programs to include in  our analysis.", "In finalizing the framework, we focused on economic development  activities that directly affect the overall development of an area\u2014 particularly saving or creating jobs\u2014rather than on activities that improve  individuals\u2019 quality of life, such as housing or general education. For  example, we did include job training that had a direct impact on economic  development in an area by, for example, preparing employees for a specific  industry or business located in a particular area. However, we did not  include general educational programs, housing loan programs, research  and development programs, or other programs that do not directly impact  the economic development of an area.", "To examine federal agencies\u2019 reporting of economic development funds, we  reviewed the extent to which agencies reported information to the Federal  Assistance Award Data System (FAADS) for the 86 programs we selected  for review during fiscal years 2002 through 2004. FAADS produces a  quarterly file of standardized records on financial assistance awards made  by federal agencies. Each transaction record identifies, by CFDA program  code number, the type and amount of financial assistance, the type and  location of the recipient, and the geographic place of performance. We  assessed the reliability of the FAADS data by (1) performing electronic  testing of the required data elements for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness, (2) comparing program totals by fiscal year to similar data  from the Consolidated Federal Funds Report (CFFR) database, (3)  reviewing related documentation, and (4) interviewing the Census Bureau  official knowledgeable about the data.", "For those programs for which information had been submitted to FAADS,  we checked the amounts against agency obligation data provided by the  agency or the CFDA record. When there were significant discrepancies, we  contacted the agencies to determine the reasons for the discrepancies. If  the FAADS data were deemed incorrect, in most cases we obtained the  corrected information from the agencies and replaced the FAADS  information for our analysis. In cases where the discrepancy could not be  resolved, we used the agency obligations data provided to us by the agency.  Because HUD had submitted expenditure data instead of obligation  information as required by FAADS, we obtained obligation information  from HUD on each of the programs included in our analysis. In addition to  the more than 20 programs for which we identified discrepancies, we also  identified another 20 programs for which the agencies had not submitted  any information to FAADS for one or more of fiscal years 2002 through  2004. For each of these programs, we contacted agency staff to determine  why no information had been submitted to FAADS and what the obligation  information amounts were for each of the fiscal years. Also, because the  FAADS data provides detailed information on program recipients, such as  zip codes, we requested that each agency provide us with similar  information on program recipients so that we could geocode the  information.", "Once we created the final database of spending for the 86 programs, we  used the information in the file to identify the locality that received the  funds. However, for approximately 50 percent of the funding, we could not  identify a recipient below the county level. Based on this finding and  consultations with USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service, we decided to  analyze the dollars flowing to rural areas using the dominant Rural-Urban  Commuting Area (RUCA) approach. RUCA data is based on census tracts,  but the State of Washington\u2019s Office of Community and Rural Health has  developed a system to classify counties based on their dominant RUCA  code if census tract data is not available. In order to produce county-level  RUCA estimates, we applied this approach to the entire country by  assigning dominant RUCA categories to every county. These analyses  allowed us to classify every county as urban or rural. Using the county-level  RUCA file, we were able to assign a dominant RUCA code to over 99  percent of the program dollars. We also classified every county as urban or  rural using ERS\u2019s rural-urban continuum system, including those counties  considered completely rural or that contained urban populations of less  than 20,000 as rural counties, and other counties as urban counties.", "Another data issue involved pass-through programs, or programs for which  the data showed the recipient to be the state government. For most of these  programs, state governments subsequently passed these funds through to  counties or local governments. However, we could not identify the  subsequent recipients. Using the CFDA program descriptions, we  determined that 12 of 86 programs appeared to meet this criterion, along  with the portion of the highway spending program that went to state  governments. For example, both DOT\u2019s Formula Grants Program for Other  than Urbanized Areas and HUD\u2019s Community Development Block Grant/  State\u2019s program showed no funding going to rural areas. Both these  programs pass through funding to rural areas, but the data only coded the  funding to the state capitals. If we had geocoded funding for such pass- through programs, the share of spending associated with urban areas,  where state capitals are typically located, would have been overstated.  Excluding the pass-through funding reduced the total spending we  analyzed from about $200 billion to about $150 billion.", "Significant noncompliance by a number of agencies that had failed to  submit obligation information for one or more programs, restricted our  ability to use the CFFR database to identify how all economic development  program funds were dispersed. While the reliability of the databases used  by Census to prepare the CFFR has been tested, we did not know the  extent to which agency data we obtained and analyzed directly from the  agencies were reliable. As a result, we contacted agency officials to  determine the controls used to ensure that the data they provided to us  were reliable and accurate. Specifically, we requested information  concerning the accuracy and completeness of the data, the use of the data  in developing financial statements about the programs, and any reviews or  audits of the quality of the data. The respondents indicated that the data  were correct and told us why they believed the information was accurate.  In addition, we questioned whether agency staff was aware of the FAADS  reporting requirements and in some cases requested data directly from  agencies. While the data we received directly from agencies were generally  not as comprehensive as the CFFR requires, we found that the information  was sufficient for our purposes.", "We conducted our review from January 2005 through December 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Data for Selected Federal Programs That Fund Economic Development Activities", "paragraphs": ["The following table lists each agency program by CFDA number and  program objective, the source we used to obtain fiscal year 2002-2004  funding data, and whether or not missing or corrected data was obtained  from the agency.", "To bring private non-industrial forest land  under intensified management; to  increase timber production; to assure  adequate supplies of timber; and to  enhance other forest resources through a  combination of public and private  investments on the most productive sites  on eligible individual or consolidated  ownership of efficient size and operation.", "To stimulate technological innovation in  the private sector, strengthen the role of  small businesses in meeting Federal  research and development needs,  increase private sector commercialization  of innovations derived from USDA  supported research and development  efforts, and foster and encourage  participation, by women-owned and  socially disadvantaged small business  firms in technological innovation.", "To improve the quality of life in rural  America by supporting and maintaining a  network of State Rural Development  Councils  that create and facilitate cross- program collaborations.", "To assist public or private nonprofit  organizations interested in providing sites  for housing; to acquire and develop land  in rural areas to be subdivided as  adequate building sites and sold on a  cost-development basis to families eligible  for low- and very-low-income loans,  cooperatives, and broadly based nonprofit  rural rental housing applicants.", "To develop the capacity and ability of  private, nonprofit community-based  housing and community development  organizations, and low income rural  communities to improve housing,  community facilities, community and  economic development projects in rural  areas.", "A foreign market access program that  provides funding for generic technical  assistance activities which take place  abroad.
