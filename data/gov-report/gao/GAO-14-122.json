It has focused on reducing the number of serious deficiencies at the time of delivery, and GAO's analysis shows that the number of deficiencies--particularly \"starred\" deficiencies designated as the most serious for operational or safety reasons--has generally dropped. Nonetheless, the Navy continues to accept ships with large numbers of open deficiencies. Accepting ships with large numbers of uncorrected deficiencies is a standard practice and GAO found that there are varying interpretations of Navy policy with regard to when the defects should be resolved. In 2009, the Navy organization that oversees ship construction launched the Back to Basics initiative to improve Navy oversight of ship construction. However, a key output of the initiative promoting consistent and adequate quality requirements in Navy contracts has yet to be implemented.", "Although the environment in which leading commercial ship buyers and builders operate differs in many ways from the Navy's, some commercial practices aimed at helping to ensure that ships are delivered with a minimum number of deficiencies may be informative for the Navy. Throughout the course of commercial shipbuilding projects, significant numbers of quality defects and instances of non-conforming work are identified. However, leading commercial ship buyers and shipbuilders make great efforts to ensure that these issues are resolved prior to delivery. Further, commercial ship buyers establish clear lines of accountability and hold their personnel responsible for ensuring the shipbuilder delivers a quality vessel. While commercial ship buyers focus on regularly witnessing in-process work through roaming patrols and impromptu inspections, Navy processes at the shipyards place less emphasis on in-process work. Moreover, leading commercial shipbuilders have strong quality management processes that track quality problems to the worker or supervisor level. Navy shipbuilding contractors have historically experienced difficulties in holding production workers and supervisors accountable for their work, but some of the shipyards reported they are making progress on increasing worker accountability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve the construction quality of ships delivered to the Navy, GAO is recommending, among other things, that the Navy clarify policy on when deficiencies should be addressed, provide guidance on contract quality requirements, and assess applicability of certain commercial practices to Navy shipbuilding.

Given the difficult operating  environments and extended deployments for Navy ships, it is essential  that they operate as expected. Yet several cases of poor quality in Navy  shipbuilding programs have focused attention on quality issues for newly  constructed ships. Many of the problems were attributed to issues with  basic elements of shipbuilding, such as welding, installation of key  systems (like propulsion and anchoring systems), and electrical work. The  impact of poor quality can directly affect operational missions; for  example, the first ship built in the USS San Antonio class (LPD 17) had to  undergo emergency repairs during its first deployment that were primarily  attributed to poor workmanship and a lack of quality control during the  ship\u2019s construction. Recognizing that quality problems in shipbuilding  needed to be addressed, the Navy established the \u201cBack to Basics\u201d  initiative in 2009 to ensure the efficiency and quality of ship construction.  The initiative focused on the Navy\u2019s Supervisor of Shipbuilding,  Conversion and Repair (SUPSHIP)\u2014the organization responsible for  overseeing ship construction processes\u2014and involved senior Naval Sea  Systems Command leadership and the Navy Program Executive Offices  responsible for managing the development and procurement of ships.", "Also in 2009, we identified best practices from the commercial  shipbuilding industry and made several recommendations to the  Department of Defense to improve management of shipbuilding programs involving, among other things, knowledge needed at key decision points.Building on that review, House Report No. 112-110, accompanying the  Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, 2012 (H.R. 2219), mandated  that we review the Navy\u2019s quality assurance processes for new ship  construction. This report assesses (1) the extent to which newly  constructed ships delivered to the Navy from 2006 through May 2013 had  quality problems and the actions the Navy has taken to improve quality;  (2) key practices employed by leading commercial ship buyers and  shipbuilders to ensure satisfactory quality and the extent to which Navy  shipbuilding programs employ these practices; and (3) the role of  classification societies (e.g., the American Bureau of Shipping) in Navy  and commercial shipbuilding.", "To identify the extent to which newly constructed Navy ships had quality  problems and the actions the Navy has taken to improve quality, we  reviewed Navy inspection reports, internal Navy reviews with regards to  ship quality, ship delivery reports, shipbuilding contracts, and other  documents discussing the quality of ships delivered to the Navy from  2006 through May 2013. We reviewed data on all ships delivered during  this period but only compared trends in quality from those ship classes  where multiple ships were delivered during this time period. To determine  the number and type of deficiencies for each vessel, we obtained and  analyzed data from the Navy\u2019s Board of Inspection and Survey\u2019s  (INSURV) Material Inspection data warehouse and the Navy\u2019s Technical  Support Management (TSM) system. TSM is the primary database  SUPSHIP uses for tracking the status of new construction deficiencies.  We reviewed these data for completeness, and when we identified  obvious discrepancies we brought them to the attention of Navy officials  and worked with them to understand, correct, or omit the discrepancies.  We determined that the deficiency data we obtained were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report with two exceptions. These  exceptions relate to data for T-AKE class ships. TSM data did not cover  T-AKE 1 through T-AKE 6. In addition, data for T-AKE 12 had numerous  data errors and is therefore not reported on. For other T-AKE ships, we  reviewed deficiency documentation (trial cards) to resolve discrepancies  between TSM and T-AKE program office data.", "We visited eight U.S. private shipyards that build Navy ships and spoke  with shipyard representatives.

We catalogued several hull, mechanical, and  electrical quality problems with each ship class delivered since 2006. To  create this list of illustrative examples, we asked Navy officials and  shipbuilding contractor representatives to identify quality problems on  these vessels. Further, this list focused only on quality issues that pertain  to the construction of the hull, mechanical, and electrical systems; we did  not include quality issues with weapons systems or other warfighting  systems. We also reviewed the Navy\u2019s Back to Basics initiative and  outcomes, as well as other recent efforts to improve the quality of  shipbuilding.", "To learn about practices used by leading commercial ship buyers and  shipbuilders to ensure quality in new construction vessels, we spoke with  leading buyers and shipbuilders in the cruise, oil and gas, and  commercial shipping industries and reviewed our previous shipbuilding  best practices work. Where possible, we collected documentation and/or  witnessed quality assurance practices. For the purposes of this review,  the leading commercial ship buyers we spoke with are companies that we  identified as leaders in their industry in terms of being top operators of  cruise ships, oil and gas vessels or containerships, and that agreed to  participate in our review. We reviewed such indicators as annual sales,  number of vessels owned or procured, and total market share.

We  requested deficiency data from the commercial ship buyers for one or  more new construction ships they acquired. With the exception of one  floating production storage and offloading vessel, all of these ships were  delivered to the buyers in 2012 or 2013. We assessed the reliability of  these data by obtaining information on the systems that stored the data  and interviewing ship buyer representatives knowledgeable about the  data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. We also identified common processes and tools  used by these ship buyers and shipbuilders to ensure the expected level  of quality. To determine the extent to which Navy quality assurance  processes used commercial best practices, we reviewed data and  information obtained from the Navy and its shipbuilding contractors as  well as from the leading commercial ship buyers and shipbuilders. We  also held meetings with SUPSHIP, program, and contracting officials  about the Navy\u2019s quality practices and during our site visits to the U.S.  shipyards.

In such instances,  SUPSHIP inspectors will issue a request for the builder to correct the  deficient work. Depending on the severity and extent of the problems,  SUPSHIP\u2019s quality officials may send a request for corrective action to  the builder to determine the cause of the problems, correct the affected  work, and improve its work processes so that the problems will not  reoccur. Once the shipbuilder takes the appropriate actions, SUPSHIP  closes out the corrective action request.

Construction can take up to three years at a cost ranging from about $600  million for a drill ship to well over $1 billion for a cruise ship or FPSO. In  many cases, these ships incorporate technological advances that are vital  to improving business operations.

This environment provides commercial buyers with  additional leverage to expect quality at delivery, as they can go elsewhere  if they are not satisfied with the end product. One oil and gas company  reported that there are as many as a dozen shipbuilders from which they  can solicit proposals at any one time. As a result, commercial shipbuilders  put a premium on reputation. They do not want to risk their credibility with  buyers if the ship is not delivered by the contracted delivery date with the  buyer\u2019s expected level of quality. These factors create additional pressure  on the shipbuilder to ensure that outstanding deficiencies are resolved in  a timely manner. In contrast, the Navy has fewer choices of shipbuilders  and has an interest in sustaining these shipbuilders despite shortfalls in  performance.", "In addition, commercial buyers and builders operate in an environment  where both parties seek to maximize profits. A delay in delivery has  significant profit impacts to both the buyer and shipbuilder. For example, it  is common for a drill ship to be leased to an oil and gas company early  during the ship\u2019s construction process, and both the ship buyer and the  company leasing the vessel rely on the ship to be at its drill site by the  contracted date to begin operations. Any delay in meeting this schedule  can not only cause the ship buyer to lose revenue\u2014which for some drill  ships can amount to over $600,000 per day\u2014but also may require the  buyer to pay predetermined sums to the company leasing the drill ship for  lost work days. Also, newly constructed cruise ships are expected to start  generating revenue weeks if not days after being delivered. For example,  Royal Caribbean officials told us that they had a full cruise 3 days after  taking delivery of the Celebrity Solstice in October 2008. The monetary  risks faced by the ship buyer for late delivery or acquiring a ship that does  not meet key performance requirements\u2014such as fuel consumption\u2014are  also passed along to the shipbuilder in the form of liquidated damages  that can potentially cost the shipbuilder tens of millions of dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leading Commercial Ship Buyers Focus on Taking Delivery of Ships Meeting Quality Expectations", "paragraphs": ["Throughout the construction process, the ship buyer\u2019s oversight team, the  shipbuilders\u2019 quality personnel, and classification society personnel  routinely identify deficiencies such as design errors, supplier and vendor  quality issues, and problems with workmanship. Commercial ship buyers  we met with expect that identified problems will be corrected prior to  delivery of the ship. We found this to be the case for all types of ships  included in our assessment of commercial practices, whether a lead ship  (i.e., the first ship built according to a new design) or a ship built from a  proven design. Unresolved issues that affect the safety, seaworthiness, or  operability of the ship would be reason for the ship buyer to not accept  delivery until such items are corrected. For the generally minor  deficiencies that have not been corrected by the ship\u2019s delivery date, the  buyer and shipbuilder may enter into a formal agreement outlining  specific actions that the builder will take to ensure correction of the  outstanding issues in the prescribed time.", "There is a fair amount of subjectivity as to what constitutes a major or  minor deficiency that largely depends on the ship\u2019s intended use. While  each ship-buying company may take a slightly different view of what  constitutes a major or minor deficiency, minor deficiencies are generally  those items that do not have an effect on the mission, operability, or  safety of the vessel and are not indicative of problems with the builder\u2019s  production processes. Major deficiencies can be viewed as problems with  the shipbuilder\u2019s production processes that limit the builder\u2019s ability to  meet ship specifications, or those deficiencies that could have an adverse  effect on the mission, operability, or safety of the vessel if not resolved.  We found that commercial ship buyer definitions for major and minor  deficiencies do not necessarily align with the definitions used by the  Navy. For example, in the cruise industry, where aesthetics and the  customer experience are critical factors, a major deficiency may be an  issue such as higher than anticipated engine vibration or elevated noise  levels. Typical minor deficiencies include cosmetic defects such as  scratches on windows, paint, and furniture. For oil and gas ships that are  expected to endure harsh environments, common major outstanding  deficiencies at the time of delivery could involve equipment that has not  yet been installed or equipment that requires additional calibration.  Typical minor deficiencies might include missing signage or technical  manuals.", "A drill ship for Noble Corporation, the Noble Don Taylor, illustrates the  process for correcting deficiencies leading up to delivery of commercial  ships. In this case, the shipbuilder reduced the number of corrective  items, totaling over 15,000 throughout construction, to around 3,800 by  the time sea trials were scheduled to occur. At the time of ship delivery,  the number of unresolved corrective actions was down to just over 59  items, which the shipbuilder agreed to correct no later than three months  following the date of delivery. One day following ship delivery, this  number dropped to 37 items. These items included minor deficiencies  such as incorrect labels and missing manufacturer documentation for  equipment, and in some instances, more significant corrective actions  including replacement of equipment which measures the weight and  torque of the drill that did not have the correct calibration.", "Additional examples depicting the extent to which quality problems  identified by the ship buyer are resolved prior to key delivery milestones  are provided in table 1.", "The commercial ships reviewed were delivered with considerably fewer  defects than is common with Navy ships, even with the recent  improvements realized by the Navy. With the exception of the Celebrity  cruise ship where there were a large number of minor (often cosmetic)  uncorrected deficiencies at the time of delivery, the number of total  deficiencies ranged from 4 to 59 for the commercial ships reviewed.

However, the commercial buyers we spoke with structure their  contracts to ensure that the shipbuilder absorbs the cost risks associated  with quality problems. For example, they require delivery of a ship at an  expected quality level for a firm-fixed-price and delay a majority of  payment until the expectation is met. The Navy shares more of the cost  risk associated with delivery of a quality product with its shipbuilders  through cost-reimbursement and fixed-price-incentive contracts. The  Navy also makes regular progress payments throughout construction so  that the bulk of payment has already been made by delivery.", "Firm fixed-price contracts used in commercial shipbuilding\u2014even for lead  ships\u2014put more of the cost risks associated with quality on the  shipbuilder than cost-reimbursement and fixed-price-incentive contracts  which are commonly used by the Navy. Under a firm-fixed-price contract,  the shipbuilder takes on the full cost of any quality problems that result in  rework. As many quality problems require rework to existing blocks or  compartments and can thus erode the shipbuilder\u2019s profit that is included  in the firm-fixed-price, there is a greater incentive to minimize production  deficiencies throughout construction.", "Similar to commercial ship buyers, the Navy has made some limited use  of firm-fixed-price contracts to purchase ships included in our review, and  in those cases the contractor has taken on more cost risk associated with  any quality problems. Of the 11 shipbuilding programs we reviewed, three  (DDG 51, T-AKE, and T-AGM 25) used firm-fixed-price contracts. For  example, starting with the 10th ship in the T-AKE ship class, the Navy  successfully moved to a firm fixed-price contract for the remaining 5  ships. Whereas some of the earlier T-AKE ships exceeded the contracted  target price, the ships constructed under firm-fixed-price contracts  continued to maintain good quality. T-AGM 25 was purchased using a  firm-fixed-price contracting arrangement from the outset, but in this case  the project experienced quality problems and delays. Although the  shipbuilding project did not perform as expected, the Navy\u2019s exposure to  cost overruns resulting from quality problems was mitigated.", "Under a cost-reimbursement contract, the cost risks associated with poor  quality remain with the Navy because the government pays for all  allowable costs of construction, including any rework, although lower  costs may be incentivized by the use of award or incentive fees. The  Navy has used cost-reimbursable contracts on lead ships due to  concerns that the level of uncertainty and risk common on Navy programs  make fixed-price contracts too costly. For example, one NAVSEA  directorate stated that some Navy shipbuilding programs would likely be  deemed unaffordable under a fixed-price contract due to the shipbuilders\u2019  need to include in the price the risk of uncertainty associated with new  construction methods, new technologies, and new designs. However, the  Navy generally moves more mature ship programs to fixed-price-incentive  contracts, and Navy officials have stated that the cost sharing provisions  in this type of contract incentivize quality. Under a fixed-price-incentive  type contract, the contract is awarded for a target cost. The Navy and the  shipbuilder share both cost savings and cost overruns below or above the  target cost (referred to as the \u201cshare line\u201d), pursuant to a formula, until the  ceiling price is reached. Navy officials have stated that they see this type  of contract as an incentive to quality because the shipbuilders will receive  more profit if they construct the ship efficiently and deliver it below the  target cost. Appendix IX further illustrates how cost risks pertaining to  quality are allocated under the different contract types.", "In the commercial world, ship buyers use payment terms as leverage to  ensure that the shipbuilder delivers a ship to the expected level of quality.  Payments are generally made at milestones negotiated with the  shipbuilder, such as contract signing, steel cutting, and keel laying. The  bulk of the payment, sometimes 60 to 80 percent, is made only on  delivery of a ship that meets expected quality and performance levels.  The buyers we met with alter payment terms based on the quality of the  shipbuilder and also use the payment terms to incentivize the builder to  fix any outstanding deficiencies prior to making the last payment. For  example, one construction manager stated that his company normally  makes equal payments to shipbuilders at five different milestones, so that  20 percent of the ship cost remains to be paid at delivery, but the  company would likely increase the percentage of the overall payment  outstanding at delivery with a lesser quality shipbuilder. Another ship  buyer said that his company normally pays 60 to 70 percent of contract  price at delivery, but would not make final payment if the ship had major  outstanding quality issues. Two other ship buyers told us they make  milestone payments during construction, but generally retain 5 to 10  percent of the payment as a means to ensure that the builder addresses  deficiencies before delivery. Those buyers also said they can retain these  funds at delivery to ensure prompt resolution of any unresolved  deficiencies. These practices create a strong financial incentive for the  builder to quickly complete work and clear any outstanding quality  defects. One project manager indicated that on two recent shipbuilding  projects, it was not necessary to withhold any of the payment after taking  delivery of the vessels because of the small number of deficiencies.", "Of the 11 fixed-price contracts we reviewed (with the exception of TAGM- 25), the Navy makes periodic payments to its shipbuilders according to  the progress made in construction.shipbuilder to submit payment invoices every two weeks that are based  on the progress made in construction as long as the billed amount is over  $5,000. While commercial ship buyers may pay the bulk of payment at  delivery, this system also requires shipbuilders to finance construction  and related finance costs, which are ultimately passed on to the ship  buyer in the contract cost.", "For example, one contract allows the  According to Navy contracting officials, they consider potential impacts on  pricing in developing payment provisions. In the fixed-priced shipbuilding  contracts we reviewed, we found that the Navy generally retains a  percentage from each progress payment\u2014anywhere up to 10 percent\u2014 that decreases as the ship is being built. Navy contracting officials told us  that they will only reduce the retention to the lower percentage once  outstanding problems have been cleared. The following example from a  recent shipbuilding contract illustrates this process:", "Up to 25 percent of the ship\u2019s physical completion\u20145 percent is  retained from each progress payment;", "25 to 50 percent of the ship\u2019s physical completion\u20143 percent is  retained from each progress payment;", "50 to 75 percent of the ship\u2019s physical completion\u20141.5 percent is  retained from each progress payment; and", "Once 75 percent of the ship\u2019s physical completion has been  reached\u20141 percent is retained from each remaining progress  payment.", "At delivery, the Navy retains a minimum amount of the shipbuilder\u2019s  payment as a performance reserve that ranges from 0.75 to 1.5 percent  of the ship\u2019s contract value, and will withhold additional funds from the  shipbuilder\u2019s last invoice or the amount retained during construction if  there are uncorrected deficiencies or incomplete work. However, the  Navy may be constrained in terms of how it can incentivize contractors  since the bulk of payments are made during the course of construction  rather than at delivery. As it is common for Navy ships to have many  more deficiencies and incomplete work items at delivery than the  commercial ships in our review, the amount retained may not sufficiently  motivate the shipbuilder to correct all deficiencies. Further, there is not  specific NAVSEA guidance that addresses the extent to which retentions  should be used as a means to incentivize the shipbuilder to promptly  resolve outstanding deficiencies and incomplete work items at ship  delivery. However, standards for internal control in the federal  government identify the need for documenting policies and procedures to  ensure appropriate measures are taken to address risk. Program  officials stated that for uncorrected deficiencies that are large in scope  they will typically develop an estimated cost to complete each item. For  the remaining deficiencies, the officials stated they develop an average  cost that is based on the estimated cost to complete a selected sample of  the deficiencies and apply that cost universally across the remaining  deficiencies. In the case of LHD 8, which was delivered to the Navy in  April 2009 with over 12,000 outstanding shipbuilder-responsible  deficiencies, the Navy retained about 2.5 percent of the final estimated  cost. Navy officials told us that some of these outstanding items are still  being completed during maintenance periods.", "More recently, Navy and SUPSHIP officials stated that in at least three  instances they have temporarily increased the amount of the retained  payments in an effort to prompt the shipbuilder to correct persistent  deficiencies. SUPSHIP officials told us this approach was successful for  problems they encountered with the LHA 6, DDG 51, and LPD 17 ship  classes. In the case of LPD 17 class ships, the Navy withheld over $15  million in progress payments on four ships that were under construction  until the shipbuilder resolved persistent problems with pipe cleanliness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercial and Navy Shipbuilding Utilize Differing Approaches to Foster Accountability and Ensure Quality", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Commercial Ship Buyer Oversight Structure Creates Clear Lines of Accountability While Navy Oversight Is More Diffused", "paragraphs": ["Another mechanism commercial ship buyers use to ensure quality  assurance is having dedicated, trained inspection teams on site to  monitor and oversee all aspects of construction. All of the commercial  ship buyers we met with create clear lines of responsibility for functional  areas to ensure accountability within their on-site teams, which are  primarily responsible for quality during construction. Within the on-site  teams of the commercial buyers we met with, responsibility for a  functional area such as paint or hull and structure is consolidated under  one functional area lead who reports to the buyer\u2019s overall project or  construction manager on-site. The on-site project manager has overall  responsibility within the buyer\u2019s company to ensure that the shipbuilder  delivers the ship on time and at the expected level of quality. Quality  inspectors are integrated within each functional area team. Commercial  ship buyers told us that their on-site quality inspectors are expected to  independently identify critical inspection areas during the course of their  day-to-day inspections. We found that commercial quality inspectors use  design drawings and ship specifications during their work to ensure that  the items are built in accordance with the detailed design. Furthermore,  these inspectors are also responsible for tracking and closing all  corrective actions they identify during the course of construction and  ensuring that the corrected work or work processes resolved the identified  problems.

SUPSHIP quality assurance teams identify and report defects  found during their inspections, and can close out the deficiencies once  the defects are rectified. However, deficiencies that are technical in  nature, or with which the builder disagrees, are adjudicated by SUPSHIP  engineering and the ship\u2019s program office and not the quality assurance  department. For example, SUPSHIP\u2019s engineering department reviews  and adjudicates technical issues related to design and system  engineering that quality assurance teams identify during inspections. If  the engineering group finds that a defect is technically acceptable, a  waiver may be provided indicating that the shipbuilder does not need to  correct the defect. The ship\u2019s program office is primarily responsible for  successful delivery of the ship, including responsibility for cost, schedule  and performance requirements. Program office officials also review  certain defects identified by the SUPSHIP quality assurance teams and  make the determination as to whether or not they will be corrected by the  shipbuilder, provided the defect is technically acceptable.", "As shown in figure 13 below, there are major departments within  SUPSHIP, such as contracting, engineering, and program management  that have delegated responsibilities from the respective NAVSEA level  directorates or the PEOs and are able to elevate technical risks or  concerns about the structure of the shipbuilding contract to those that  have decision-making authority. SUPSHIP quality officials receive policy  guidance from the NAVSEA Logistics, Maintenance and Industrial  Operations Directorate (NAVSEA 04), but there is not a quality assurance  team at the NAVSEA level to which they can raise quality related issues.", "Officials within NAVSEA 04 told us the Navy is formulating plans to  reorganize the structure of the directorate, and plans include establishing  a centralized quality team. Although the roles, responsibilities, and  authorities of the quality team are not yet defined, the officials expect that  the team would provide support to SUPSHIP quality assurance  departments in helping to ensure that matters related to quality are given  sufficient attention at the NAVSEA level. Increasing the emphasis on  quality may help contribute to the goal of delivering ships that are defect- free, or nearly defect-free, as called for in Navy policy and demonstrated  in commercial shipbuilding.", "Prior to construction, the commercial ship buyers and shipbuilders we met  with negotiate to one common understanding of quality inspections  through an agreed-upon quality inspection plan. The plan identifies (1)  all formal inspection points during the construction process; (2) who  attends and approves the inspections; and (3) criteria on how the  inspections will be carried out. One ship buyer noted that establishing the  quality inspection plan in conjunction with the shipbuilder and ensuring  that all parties agree to, and are aware of, the key drivers that affect  quality is of the utmost importance in ensuring the ship is built and  delivered at the expected level of quality. According to company officials,  the shipbuilder is contractually required to notify the buyer of any formal  inspection points to provide the buyer an opportunity to inspect a product  or process at a designated point of production.", "Buyer representatives, including on-site teams and headquarter-level  officials, review the builder\u2019s quality inspection plan and may ask for  additional inspections and hold points based on ship design, criticality of  the system, and previous experiences of the buyer. For example, one  ship buyer reported experiencing significant failure rates during pressure  testing of piping systems on a drill rig, and decided to incorporate  additional inspection points at the joints where pipes are welded together  on future drill ship projects. In another instance, a ship buyer  representative told us his company solicits input on the quality inspection  plan from company personnel that operate similar types of vessels, which  he noted provides valuable information on the types of quality issues  observed from an operator\u2019s perspective. The quality inspection plan is a  key tool in ensuring quality as it enables consistency in inspections by  focusing the ship buyer and builder on the same inspection items using  the same criteria. Figure 14 further describes actions taken by one  commercial firm, Chevron\u2019s Project Resources Company, to improve  quality.", "Inspectors for commercial ship buyers enforce quality requirements, in  part, by attending all formal inspections, according to almost all of the  commercial ship buyers in our review (seven of nine companies). For  example, one ship buyer we met with reported having up to 80  inspections in a day for the team of about 14 inspectors. These inspectors  use design drawings and review the ship specification to ensure that the  compartment or block is built in accordance with requirements.", "Along with the formal inspections, commercial ship buyers consistently  cited \u201croaming patrols\u201d as central to their oversight process. Inspectors  regularly patrol the shipyard, where they observe the shipyard\u2019s in- process work. All of the buyers emphasized the importance of these  patrols as providing assurance that shipbuilders are adhering to their  work processes even when a formal inspection is not scheduled. These  patrols facilitate the early recognition of quality problems, which are  typically less expensive and time consuming to correct than later in the  construction process. Some officials told us that these impromptu patrols  can be particularly effective in yards with more quality issues. The  percentage of inspectors\u2019 time allocated to these roaming patrols can vary  depending on the stage of construction\u2014but can exceed 50 percent over  the course of a ship\u2019s construction\u2014with a greater proportion of time  allocated during the earlier stages of construction when there are not as  many formal inspections.", "In contrast to commercial shipbuilding, where buyer and builder  inspection activities are aligned through one common inspection plan,  Navy shipbuilding involves layers of oversight and quality inspections that  are resource intensive and not necessarily aligned with shipbuilders\u2019  inspections. In Navy shipbuilding, NAVSEA officials told us formal  inspection points that relate to quality are identified in multiple ways  including Navy technical documents, inspection proposals from the  shipbuilder, or the ship\u2019s technical specifications. NAVSEA\u2019s engineering  directorate reviews and approves the shipbuilder\u2019s quality-related test and  inspection documents. Other formal test and inspection points, such as  those for equipment and system installations, are contained in separate  test plans that the shipbuilder develops and SUPSHIP engineering  reviews. In addition to attending formal inspections, SUPSHIP\u2019s quality  assurance department independently develops its own surveillance plans,  and these surveillance plans are revised several times a year.", "Unlike inspectors for commercial ship buyers, SUPSHIP inspectors do not  attend all formal inspections identified in the shipbuilding contract.  SUPSHIP quality managers determine which inspections their inspectors  attend\u2014generally based on priority or potential problem areas\u2014but it is  understood that inspectors will not attend all call-outs, in part due to  staffing levels at the SUPSHIP locations. NAVSEA and SUPSHIP officials  noted that the unpredictability of which inspections will be attended by  SUPSHIP helps ensure the shipbuilder maintains focus on all aspects of  production.", "SUPSHIP officials described their oversight approach in very different  terms than commercial ship buyers. SUPSHIP surveillance plans set forth  goals that focus on collecting numbers of observations. SUPSHIP quality  assurance teams in the locations we visited stated that they generally  focus most of their inspection efforts, in terms of observations conducted,  on performing planned inspections identified in shipbuilding contracts and  SUPSHIP surveillance plans, and less effort conducting random  inspections of in-process work (similar to the roaming patrols used by  commercial buyers\u2019 inspectors). The main inspection activity carried out  by SUPSHIP quality inspectors, as measured by the number of  observations, are product verification inspections. These are inspections  of end products such as fabricated blocks, installed equipment, and  completed compartments to ensure that the work conforms to the contract  specifications. SUPSHIP\u2019s Gulf Coast and Bath locations reported  spending 64 percent and 60 percent, respectively, of their inspection  efforts on product verification inspections, while Groton and Newport  News spent less time\u201439 percent and 35 percent, respectively.", "As part of SUPSHIPs\u2019 surveillance plan for a shipyard, quality inspectors  also observe work being performed by production workers\u2014work that is  in process\u2014for compliance with the builders\u2019 procedures and technical  specifications. Similar to commercial ship buyers, SUPSHIP officials  stated it is important to identify, and remedy, any potential quality issues  early in the construction process. Most SUPSHIP locations reported  spending about 30 percent of their inspection efforts on in-process  evaluations. These evaluations are planned in advance and may last a  few hours to several days. SUPSHIP officials have reported that they are  putting more effort into in-process inspection activities rather than just  inspecting end products For example, one SUPSHIP location has  established a goal of having 70 percent of their inspectors\u2019 observations  related to in-process work. SUPSHIP officials also told us that their  inspectors conduct some general surveillance or random inspections, but  it is unclear how much of their effort is spent on these activities as they  are not recorded as such.", "Also in contrast to commercial shipbuilding practice, not all SUPSHIP  locations use design drawings while conducting inspections. Instead,  inspectors use pre-developed checklists and ship technical specifications  to perform inspections. The use of design drawings during inspections  helps to ensure that work is being produced in accordance with the  approved design and that the builder\u2019s workers are using the correct  version of the design. For example, ABS officials told us that during  construction of the Littoral Combat Ship, ABS found in a number of  instances that the production drawings used to build the ship were  different from the approved design. In some cases the production  drawings identified different sizes of pipes and flanges, or depicted piping  arrangements that were not included in the approved design, but such  issues generally went unnoticed by the SUPSHIP inspectors because  they did not compare the design drawings to the work performed. Quality  officials at two SUPSHIP locations stated that their inspectors have been  trained and use the design drawings during inspections, and officials from  both locations view this as an important tool for ensuring quality.  Officials at one of these SUPSHIP locations said they have long realized  the benefits of using design drawings during the course of their quality  inspectors\u2019 work and ensure the inspectors are trained to be able to read  design drawings. At the other location, officials stated they just recently  started having their quality inspectors use the design drawings when  conducting quality inspections, which they attribute as being a good  practice they observed from ABS.", "Commercial shipbuilders create an environment of accountability for  quality by implementing systems to track quality problems down to the  supervisor and individual worker level. Systems used by shipbuilders  included complex enterprise resource management systems that track  workers assigned to specific work packages or assignments, as well as  simple systems such as requiring production workers to sign their work  (on the compartment itself or related paperwork) with a unique identifier.  For example, one shipbuilder we visited conducts non-destructive tests  on welds as dictated in the quality inspection plan developed with the ship  buyer. Each test record includes information on the welder who  performed the work and the outcome of the testing. This allows the  shipbuilder to identify welders producing defective work. Furthermore, the  shipbuilder uses the test data to rate welder performance across the yard  as part of its regular performance appraisal system. This same system  allows the shipbuilder to track performance of supervisors and individual  workers in terms of producing quality products and minimizing rework.", "Most Navy shipbuilding contractors we met with (five of eight shipyards)  reported that they have historically had difficulties identifying when and  where in the production process specific quality problems occurred, as  work was not always tracked at the supervisor or individual worker level.  This has been a major challenge that they have been trying to address in  recent years. The shipbuilders agree that quality problems are generally  the result of a breakdown with the execution of their quality management  plans rather than problems with the plans themselves.contractor shipyards we visited reported having made progress on this  front, and shipbuilder quality representatives told us they have been able  to improve the detection of quality problems earlier in the production  process and hold front-line supervisors accountable for the quality of the  work they oversee. For example, quality officials at one shipbuilder told us  that their quality personnel are now focusing more on conducting in- process inspections to identify process-related problems occurring within  a specific trade or work crew, as opposed to inspecting completed work  products and then trying to locate the specific source of the problem  within the broader production process. In another example, a shipbuilder  has created quality advocates within the various tradecrafts that augment  the builder\u2019s quality assurance department by assisting with day-to-day  quality activities, such as conducting inspections and providing training,  as well as representing production workers in yard-wide quality  improvement efforts. Further, there are signs that builders are starting to  hold their workforce accountable for quality issues. For example, a quality  official at one shipyard we visited told us that his inspectors now routinely  collect quality and defect data at the production supervisor level and  develop a report of where each supervisor ranks as compared to the peer  group. These reports are posted throughout the production facilities and  are visible to all employees. In some rare instances, the quality official  reported that his company instituted disciplinary actions for supervisors  that repeatedly allowed poor quality work products to proceed to the next  stage of production.", "In addition, Navy shipbuilding contractors reported that quality at some of  the shipyards has been affected by high attrition rates, making it difficult  to maintain a qualified workforce. One shipbuilder representative told us  that his company is recruiting new technical graduates from other parts of  the country to fulfill their production staff needs. Another shipbuilder  representative told us that his company has had quality problems related  to inexperienced labor. The need to put new staff in place to meet work  demands puts pressure on the builders to expedite hiring and training.  According to one shipbuilder, without a rigorous hiring and training  program, under-qualified workers could be performing the work, leading  to higher incidences of quality issues. Although the four international  commercial shipbuilders we visited did not report having similar labor  problems, we were told high turnover of the labor force is a problem at  other commercial yards."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Classification Societies Play a Role in Commercial and Navy Shipbuilding", "paragraphs": ["In commercial shipbuilding, classification societies are an integral part of  design and construction processes.

Further, commercial ship buyers realize that adhering to  the rules and regulations of a classification society will ensure that a new  construction ship only meets the quality and safety requirements  stipulated in the applicable rules.", "During the contracting phase, the designated classification society\u2019s  applicable rules and regulations, as well as statutory requirements (such  as those pertaining to safety of life issues or marine environmental  protection), are generally incorporated into the shipbuilding contract. The  classification society also plays a role during the design of commercial  ships, as its engineers review and approve key structural design drawings  to ensure the design complies with classification society rules. These  engineers also review and approve key design drawings to verify  compliance with any applicable statutory requirements, if so authorized by  the country where the vessel will be registered. The buyers we met with  had high confidence in the classification society\u2019s engineering review of  the ship design and viewed this expertise as a core competency. In some  instances, commercial ship buyers noted that they contract with the  classification societies for engineering services when developing and  testing new technologies. For example, officials from Royal Caribbean  told us they sought technical assistance from the classification society  Det Norske Veritas during the development and implementation of a pilot  program that tested advanced engine exhaust cleaning technologies in  two of its ships. Figure 15 below provides additional detail on how one  commercial shipbuilding project sought technical assistance from  classification societies to reduce potential risks to quality.", "Classification society surveyors also have a role in monitoring ship  construction; however, none of the leading buyers we met with use their  designated class society as a substitute for their own construction  oversight and quality assurance processes. Specifically, while  classification society surveyors assess whether the ship is constructed in  accordance with prescribed rules and regulations, these rules may not  take into account the ship buyer\u2019s own technical specification  requirements. For example, the rules do not address the quality of every  structure or piece of equipment installed on the ship, such as the ship  buyer\u2019s mission-related equipment, but rather only what is determined to  be critical to safe operation of the ship. In addition, class societies  conduct technical assessments of key parts and equipment. For a wide  range of materials, parts, and equipment used in the construction of a  ship, such as main engines, generators, and pumps, it is generally a class  society requirement that the surveyors attend inspections and witness  testing conducted at the manufacturing facility prior to the equipment  being shipped to the builder\u2019s shipyard to certify that the items comply  with the applicable rule requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ABS No Longer Provides Classification Services on Navy Surface Combatants but Continues to Play a Role in Navy Shipbuilding", "paragraphs": ["After almost 10 years of ABS participation in the development and  implementation of the Naval Vessel Rules for the DDG 1000 and LCS  shipbuilding programs, the Navy, in late 2011, made a decision that as a  cost savings measure it would no longer seek to obtain ABS class  certification for surface combatants.

According to ABS officials, the classification process  involved a level of discipline that the Navy found difficult to integrate into  the design and construction of surface combatants, and in some  instances the Navy chose to accept design drawings or approve  completed production work prior to ABS completing its own review and  approval process. For example, the Naval Vessel Rules require that  during the design engineering phase of the shipbuilding project computer  analyses determining the structural integrity of the ship are to be reviewed  and approved by ABS. However, the Navy allowed the shipbuilder to  commence construction and deliver the lead ship (LCS 1) and begin  construction on the second ship (LCS 3) before the ship designers were  able to submit a structural analysis that met the ABS requirements. The  analysis identified several areas on the ship\u2019s superstructure that were  under high stress and could be prone to failure. Program officials  indicated they operated the ship with knowledge of the high-stress areas  as a means to field test the strength of the ship. During the initial  operating period of LCS 1, cracks emerged in a number of the predicted  locations, requiring repair and additional strengthening of LCS 1 and  structural modifications during construction of LCS 3.", "NAVSEA engineering and SUPSHIP officials indicated that the Navy\u2019s  decision to cease its arrangement with ABS was also attributed to the  view that the class society\u2019s role largely duplicated the work being  performed by SUPSHIP and Navy engineers. These officials were  confident that SUPSHIP was appropriately positioned in terms of the  needed skills and resources, as their inspectors were already tasked with  overseeing the builders\u2019 work to ensure compliance with the  specifications. In addition, the officials informed us that NAVSEA\u2019s  engineering directorate is in the process of revising the Naval Vessel  Rules to take into consideration the departure of ABS from the surface  combatant shipbuilding programs. SUPSHIP officials told us that a key  difference between SUPSHIP\u2019s and ABS\u2019s inspection processes is the  level of discretion the inspectors and surveyors have in determining  whether or not work is in accordance with the prescribed rules.  Specifically, it is common in commercial shipbuilding for the classification  rule set to stipulate that certain work be performed to the satisfaction of  the attending surveyor, which gives the classification society surveyors  the flexibility to use their professional judgment as to whether or not  completed work meets the intent of the rules and is fit for its purpose.  According to SUPSHIP officials, the Navy\u2019s revised rules will remove such  language so that work performed either meets, or does not meet, the  applicable technical specifications.", "The Navy plans to continue work with ABS in several areas:", "NAVSEA engineering officials informed us that they will continue to  contract with ABS on an as-needed basis for design and technical  assistance services on new construction surface combatants as a way  to augment the Navy\u2019s skill sets in specialized areas such as  structural drawing reviews.", "ABS will continue to provide classification services and issue class  certifications to new construction Navy ships operated by the Military  Sealift Command.", "Beginning in 2008, Naval Sea Systems Command\u2019s Surface Warfare  directorate contracted with ABS to perform baseline structural  assessments of the condition of the surface combatant fleet when  ships are dry-docked for scheduled maintenance after several years  of operations. Under this arrangement, scheduled to continue  through fiscal year 2016, ABS is conducting marine inspections on  148 surface ships. Using the information obtained during these  inspections, ABS is developing models which identify areas of ships  where there is an increased risk of failure or corrosion, which allows  the Navy the ability to selectively target its maintenance activities.", "More recently, in January 2013, the Navy issued a request for information  and is seeking input from industry to look into the feasibility of applying  commercial shipbuilding design and construction practices on its future  amphibious ships. Specifically, the Navy is seeking input from industry  regarding the feasibility of building an amphibious ship to ABS\u2019s  commercial standards while still retaining warship capabilities. One  approach identified in the request notification is to use commercial  shipbuilding practices for as much of the ship as possible and apply  military standards only where necessary."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Navy pays hundreds of millions and in many cases billions of dollars  for ships that warfighters rely on to perform as expected under stressing  conditions. Yet it routinely accepts ships with numerous uncorrected  deficiencies. Addressing these deficiencies after delivery can be costly,  time consuming, and disruptive.", "In recent years, Navy leadership has increased its focus on reducing what  it considers to be the most serious deficiencies (\u201cstarred\u201d deficiencies\u201d) at  the time of ship delivery with some notable successes. However, the  continued practice of accepting ships with a substantial number of  deficiencies differs from the commercial practices we observed and can  be attributed to differing interpretations of what Navy policy requires.   Navy policy officials focus on provisions addressing delivery of the ship to  the Navy, while program officials focus on the provisions addressing the  much later point at which full financial responsibility for the ship is  transferred to the operating fleet. This suggests that clarification and  consistency in practice is needed. While it is understandable that there  may be instances where the Navy would accept delivery of a ship with  some level of uncorrected deficiencies, such actions should be the  exception rather than the practice. Further, waiting until after delivery to  correct known deficiencies can interfere with the activities that should be  taking place during this time\u2014ship outfitting, crew training, additional  testing, and planned maintenance, as well as other class-wide upgrades.  This approach is a sharp contrast to that of commercial ship buyers, who  consider quality to be the focus and expect a ship that is defect-free (or  nearly so) at delivery.", "Navy shipbuilding entails building some of the world\u2019s most  technologically advanced ships in a limited competitive environment with  an industrial base that is generally reliant on the Navy to remain in  business\u2014a landscape that is much different than commercial  shipbuilding. As such, any quality improvement effort must focus not only  on the realities of operating in such an environment, but also on ways to  incentivize the shipbuilder to produce a quality product. The Navy\u2019s Back  to Basics quality improvement effort was directed at SUPSHIP and  resulted\u2014albeit in conjunction with other factors\u2014in several positive  actions that had an influence on improving quality. While the recent  deliveries of the first Joint High Speed Vessel and Mobile Landing  Platform represent marked improvements over previous lead ships,  continued emphasis on quality and maintaining the momentum created by  the Back to Basics initiative is warranted, given that other recently  delivered ships had numerous deficiencies.", "While the Navy and leading commercial buyers agree that quality is the  responsibility of the shipbuilder, a key difference is that the Navy makes  use of cost-reimbursement and fixed-price-incentive type contracts, which  assign less cost risk to the shipbuilder for quality problems. Leading  commercial ship buyers have made a business decision that the risks to  quality belong with the shipbuilder, and that the premium paid to transfer  this risk is worth the cost of a firm-fixed-price contract. They also make  greater use of how payments are structured in the shipbuilding contract to  incentivize the builders to ensure timely correction of deficiencies. Even  under fixed-price-incentive type contracts, when appropriate, the Navy  could choose to structure certain payment provisions to incentivize  shipbuilder performance and to enhance contract requirements for  managing quality. For example, a standardized quality performance  standard, proposed by SUPSHIP, has not been incorporated in any  shipbuilding contract.", "Commercial shipbuilders also attach considerable importance to having a  robust oversight process. A few SUPSHIP locations have begun to make  use of some oversight practices emphasized by commercial ship buyers,  such as using design drawings, and these practices may be applicable to  other locations as well. Further, although SUPSHIP quality inspectors  conduct some level of random inspections, the Navy has not defined the  role these inspections should play; and we found significant variation in  their use among SUPSHIP locations.", "Commercial ship buyers also place responsibility for delivering a quality  ship on the site team. Responsibility for quality is more diffused in the  Navy. Program offices, NAVSEA, SUPSHIP, INSURV, and others all  have roles, and concerns about schedule, costs, or other strategic needs  may supersede the focus on quality. While SUPSHIP\u2019s quality assurance  department is closest to the work being performed, the organization has  limited authority to make or exert influence on the shipbuilder and on  decisions made early in the contracting process that could have a direct  impact on quality. The Navy is formulating plans to establish a quality  team within the NAVSEA Logistics, Maintenance and Industrial  Operations Directorate that would promote, in some capacity, attention to  quality assurance, but the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of the  team are not yet defined. If the team is given sufficient authorities and  tasked with elevating SUPSHIP quality assurance concerns throughout  the acquisition process, this could present an opportunity to address  some of the issues we identified in our report and emphasize the  importance of quality when trade-off decisions affecting cost, schedule,  and quality are at hand."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the construction quality of ships delivered to the Navy, we  recommend that the Secretary of the Defense direct the Secretary of the  Navy to take the following five actions:  1.  Ensure that, when established, the NAVSEA-level quality team  provides support and a direct link to directors of SUPSHIP quality  assurance departments and is tasked with raising concerns within  NAVSEA about issues affecting or potentially affecting quality  throughout the acquisition process.  2.  Clarify Navy policy (Navy Instruction 4700.8J) by clearly identifying at  what point(s) during the acquisition process contractor-responsible  deficiencies are to be fully corrected and ensure the policy is followed.  3.  Provide additional guidance on the quality requirements in  shipbuilding contracts, including the extent to which the SUPSHIP  Management Group\u2019s Quality Performance Standard for Construction  of Naval Vessels should be incorporated.  4.  Provide additional guidance on use of payment withholds and  retentions as a means to incentivize the shipbuilding contractor to  promptly correct significant or persistent deficiencies and to deliver a  defect-free, or nearly defect free ship, to the Navy.  5.  Assess the benefits and determine whether the following practices, in  effect at some SUPSHIP locations, would be useful in detecting  quality problems across all locations: use of design drawings during SUPSHIP quality inspections, and increased focus on random and in-process inspections compared  to use of resources for other types of inspections and  observations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment.

This  team is envisioned to provide a direct link to SUPSHIP quality assurance  departments at the shipyards to enhance communication within NAVSEA  on quality related issues. The quality team would also serve as a  resource for identifying appropriate quality requirements in shipbuilding  contracts.", "DOD partially concurred with our second recommendation, to clarify Navy  policy regarding acceptance of ships with quality defects. DOD said that it  will continue to strive to reduce the number of open deficiencies to zero at  the time the ship is delivered to the Navy. The Navy will monitor whether  the trend of fewer deficiencies continues to determine if future revisions to  the Navy policy instruction are needed. However, we believe the policy  needs to be clarified, given the lack of consensus about whether  contractor-responsible deficiencies are to be corrected before ships are  delivered to the Navy. As we note in the report, addressing deficiencies  post-delivery undermines the goal of constructing a defect-free or nearly  defect-free ship and can also interfere with testing and crew training.  Further, although trends have improved over time, recently delivered  ships still had a significant number of deficiencies.", "DOD partially concurred with our third recommendation, to provide  guidance on quality requirements in contracts. The response cited  existing FAR requirements and NAVSEA\u2019s Contract Administration  Quality Assurance Program. It also stated the planned quality team within  NAVSEA 04 will be a resource for consultation on appropriate contract  quality assurance provisions and that this, along with the progress in  reducing deficiencies, is sufficient. We believe that greater attention to  contractual quality provisions is needed. SUPSHIP quality assurance staff  stated that a primary reason for the development of the Quality  Performance Standard for Construction of Naval Vessels was to limit  inconsistencies found in shipbuilding contract quality requirements that  affected SUPSHIP\u2019s ability to conduct effective quality oversight. As  discussed in the report, we observed considerable variance in the  specificity of contract quality provisions for different ship classes, and  SUPSHIP\u2019s suggested quality performance standard has not been fully  incorporated in any shipbuilding contract. Therefore we continue to  believe that additional guidance on quality, including the extent to which  the quality performance standard should be incorporated, would be  beneficial for the Navy.", "DOD concurred with our fourth recommendation, noting that, as part of its  ongoing Better Buying Power initiative, it plans to better align contractor  profitability with DOD goals through the use of contract incentives; actions  that will assist in improving quality in shipbuilding. DOD explained that as  part of this effort, the Office of the Secretary of Defense will revise and  reissue guidance on the use of incentives in defense acquisition  strategies. Its response noted that new tools, along with existing tools,  provide sufficient opportunity for program managers and contracting  officers to ensure the construction of quality ships for the Navy.", "DOD also partially concurred with our fifth recommendation, to determine  whether using design drawings in SUPSHIP quality inspections and  increasing the focus on random and in-process inspections would be  beneficial. DOD stated that use of design drawings is essential and is  being used, but not necessarily by the same personnel that use checklists  and other tools for inspections. It also said that random and in-process  inspections are all necessary, but that the correct balance should be left  to individual ship programs. We found that SUPSHIP quality assurance  teams that have trained their staff to use design drawings\u2014a commercial  best practice\u2014report benefits from this approach. Also, our work on  commercial buyers\u2019 quality assurance practices consistently identified  random, in-process oversight as a key tool in assuring that shipyards are  following their own construction quality processes.

W. Bush (CVN 77) aircraft  carrier, USNS Howard O. Lorenzen (T-AGM 25) missile range  instrumentation ship, Lewis and Clark-class (T-AKE) dry cargo and  ammunition ships, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS)\u2014both the Independence  and Freedom variants, USS Makin Island (LHD 8) Wasp-class  amphibious assault ship, USNS Montford Point Mobile Landing Platform,  San Antonio-class (LPD 17) amphibious transport dock ships, USNS  Spearhead Joint High Speed Vessel, and Virginia-class submarines (SSN  774). Even though the lead LPD and SSN ships were built outside of the  last 8 years, we included these two vessels in our sample because the  rest of the class was built within the last 8 years. We also drew from our  prior work on these programs, Navy documents created to address  quality issues, and various other Navy reports, such as those from the  Navy\u2019s Judge Advocate General.", "To determine the number and type of deficiencies for each vessel, we  obtained data from the Navy\u2019s Board of Inspection and Survey\u2019s  (INSURV) Material Inspection data warehouse and the Navy\u2019s Technical  Support Management (TSM) system. TSM is the primary database the  Navy\u2019s Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair uses to track  the status of new ship construction deficiencies. We analyzed these data  to determine the total number of open deficiencies (1) when the ship was  delivered to the Navy; (2) 120 days following ship delivery\u2014the  approximate time when final outfitting is completed prior to the ship  leaving the shipyard; and (3) 1 year following ship delivery. Total  deficiencies include those identified during construction, builder\u2019s trials,  and acceptance trials that were not closed by the milestones listed above.  Because TSM deficiency data is compiled on paper forms and manually  entered into the system, we considered as being closed at delivery those  deficiencies that were closed through 7 days following the date the ship  was delivered to the Navy (with the exception of the T-AKE ship class), as  stated on the Navy\u2019s Naval Vessel Register. To the extent feasible, we  reviewed these data for completeness and for obvious inconsistency  errors and compared them with paper documents that also catalogue  these deficiencies. When we found obvious discrepancies while  conducting our analyses, we brought them to the attention of the Navy  Sea Systems Command and INSURV and worked with them to  understand, correct, or omit the discrepancies. The data we collected  represents the deficiencies at a particular moment in time. Further,  deficiencies may be subdivided into multiple deficiencies or consolidated  into a smaller number when the Navy and its shipbuilding contractors  determine whether the government or the shipbuilder is responsible for  correcting the respective deficiencies. For ships we reviewed, we  determined that TSM deficiency data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report with a few exceptions. These exceptions relate to  data for T-AKE class ships. TSM data did not cover T-AKE 1 through T- AKE 6. Data for T-AKE 12 had numerous data errors and is therefore not  reported on. For other T-AKE ships, we reviewed deficiency  documentation (trial cards) to resolve discrepancies between TSM and T- AKE program office data.", "We catalogued several hull, mechanical, and electrical issues with each  ship class delivered in the last 8 years, in addition to the individual hulls  that were also delivered during this period. To create this list of illustrative  examples, we asked Navy officials familiar with each ship class to identify  problems that occurred during the construction of the vessels. We also  asked officials from INSURV to identify significant issues that affected  multiple hulls within each major class. We then identified several of the  issues to highlight that were illustrative of hull, mechanical, and electrical  problems. Given the uniqueness of the ships\u2019 capabilities, we elected not  to catalog quality issues with weapon systems or other warfighting  systems. To supplement this analysis, we held discussions with or  requested information from a number of Navy officials involved in Navy  shipbuilding. These included the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion  and Repair (SUPSHIP), Bath, Maine; Groton, Connecticut; Gulf Coast,  Pascagoula, Mississippi; Newport News, Virginia; Bath Detachment, San  Diego, California; Bath Detachment, Marinette, Wisconsin; and Gulf  Coast Detachment, Mobile, Alabama.

Moller-Maersk A/S; Noble Corporation; Norwegian Cruise Lines; Royal  Caribbean Cruises, Ltd.; and Seadrill, Ltd. We identified leading  companies by analyzing such indicators as annual sales, number of  vessels owned and procured, and total market share. Our methodology  drew from our previous shipbuilding best practices work that identified the  commercial shipbuilding industries that support cruise, oil and gas, and  commercial shipping sectors as being most similar to Navy shipbuilding.  Cruise ships are more costly and complex than other types of commercial  ships, densely packed, and require significant outfitting, making them  somewhat similar to military ships. Additionally, cruise ship buyers often  include innovations or design changes in their ships and start new  classes of ships regularly in order to maximize passenger satisfaction;  approaches that allowed us to examine quality oversight practices on  recent lead ship programs and the outcomes of specific commercial  practices. The cruise line companies we met with are leaders in their  industry as identified in our previous work and based on operating  revenue or fleet size. We met with ship buyers from the oil and gas  industry because drill ships, floating production storage and offloading  (FPSO) vessels and offshore oil platforms are complex, dense structures.  Furthermore, FPSOs, essentially floating refineries, are often one of a  kind, costing well over $1 billion. The oil and gas companies we met with  are leaders in their industry as identified in our previous work as well as  our assessment of top operators of drilling vessels. Similarly, we met with  Maersk Line Limited and Maersk Drilling, two business units within A.P.  Moller-Maersk A/S, because the company was identified as an industry  leader in our prior work and remains one of the largest shipping  companies in the world. For example, Maersk Line Limited acquires many  ships: in 2012 the company took delivery of 19 new ships. For each  commercial ship buyer, we requested deficiency data on one or more new  construction ships they had acquired. With the exception of one FPSO, all  of these ships were delivered to the buyer in 2012 or 2013. We assessed  the reliability of this data by obtaining information on the systems that  stored the data and interviewing ship buyer and shipbuilder  representatives knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We also  identified common processes and tools used by these ship buyers and  shipbuilders to ensure the expected level of quality.", "To determine the extent to which Navy quality assurance processes use  common commercial practices, we reviewed data and information  obtained from the Navy and its shipbuilding contractors, as well as from  the leading commercial ship buyers and shipbuilders.

During our meetings with SUPSHIP and program,  engineering, and contracting officials from the Naval Sea Systems  Command directorates, we inquired about the Navy\u2019s quality assurance  practices. During site visits to eight U.S. private shipyards that build Navy  ships, we discussed with shipyard representatives their quality assurance  processes and the steps taken to ensure their ships meet the Navy\u2019s  quality expectations.

We identified these shipbuilders as producers of high- quality vessels through a combination of our previous work and  recommendations from shipbuilding experts and the ship buyers that  participated in our review. At the shipyards, we met with ship buyers\u2019  representatives who were responsible for overseeing the construction of  the ships and monitoring the construction schedule. Where possible, we  observed quality assurance activities at commercial shipbuilders or  viewed systems related to ensuring quality, such as quality database  systems. We collected documentation of quality assurance activities,  such as quality policies and inspection plans, where available. We met  with representatives from three classification societies, including the  American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), Det Norske Veritas, and Lloyd\u2019s  Register regarding their roles in commercial ship construction.

Our analysis found that both designs of the LCS class were  delivered with a large number of open deficiencies at delivery. The  majority of these deficiencies were the responsibility of the contractor.
