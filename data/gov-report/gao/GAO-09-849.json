GAO was asked to assess the extent to which NORTHCOM is (1) consistent with Department of Defense (DOD) training and exercise requirements, (2) involving interagency partners and states in its exercises, (3) using lessons learned and corrective actions to improve preparedness, and (4) integrating its exercises with the National Exercise Program (NEP). To do this, GAO reviewed NORTHCOM and NEP guidance and postexercise documentation, assessed NORTHCOM compliance, and compared DOD and NEP exercise requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NORTHCOM's exercise program is generally consistent with the requirements of DOD's Joint Training System, but its exercise reporting is inconsistent. Since the command was established in 2002, NORTHCOM has conducted 13 large-scale exercises and generally completed exercise summary reports within the required time frame. However, those reports did not consistently include certain information, such as areas needing improvement, because NORTHCOM lacks guidance that specifies exercise reports' content and format, potentially impacting its ability to meet internal standards for planning and execution of joint exercises, and to compare and share exercise results over time with interagency partners and states. Nineteen federal agencies and organizations and 17 states and the District of Columbia have participated in one or more of the seven large-scale exercises that NORTHCOM has conducted since September 2005. However, NORTHCOM faces challenges in involving states in the planning, conduct, and assessment of its exercises, such as adapting its exercise system and practices to involve other federal, state, local, and tribal agencies that do not have the same practices or level of planning resources. Inconsistencies with how NORTHCOM involves states in exercises are occurring in part because NORTHCOM officials lack experience dealing with states and do not have a consistent process for including states in exercises. Without such a process, NORTHCOM increases the risk that its exercises will not provide benefits for all participants, impact the seamless exercise of all levels of government, and potentially affect NORTHCOM's ability to provide civil support capabilities. NORTHCOM has a systematic lessons learned and corrective action program to improve preparedness, but gaps remain with collecting and sharing lessons with agency and state partners and managing corrective actions. Access to the system NORTHCOM uses for managing exercise observations is limited for non-DOD participants, and DOD believes that the Department of Homeland Security's system is not adequately protected from unauthorized users. NORTHCOM's mitigation steps have not resolved the issues. In addition, about 20 percent of the corrective actions tracked by NORTHCOM were being closed prematurely due to gaps in oversight. Closing issues prematurely increases the risk that issues will reoccur and limits the knowledge gained and value of the exercise. NORTHCOM has taken steps to integrate its exercises with the NEP, but guidance is not consistently applied. NORTHCOM has participated in several NEP exercises and is leading its first major NEP exercise in the fall of 2009. However, NORTHCOM has used DOD's Joint Training System planning and documentation requirements rather than DHS's requirements, because NEP guidance is not clear on what exercise planning standard should be used and DOD guidance does not address the issue. The states we visited use NEP guidance. Differences between NEP and DOD guidance could affect the ability of all participants to develop effective working relationships."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. homeland continues to face complex and dynamic threats and  vulnerabilities from terrorism and other catastrophic incidents, including  natural disasters, industrial accidents, infrastructure failures, and  infectious diseases. These incidents can produce devastating  consequences as observed during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks  and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, which required an effective and  coordinated national effort, with shared goals and responsibilities for  protecting and defending the homeland. The complexity of national-level  coordination makes preparing for an incident all the more crucial.   According the Quadrennial Defense Review, unified interagency efforts  among the Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), and other federal, state, and local agencies are required to  address threats to the homeland. Exercises play an instrumental role in  preparing these agencies to respond to an incident by providing  opportunities to test plans, improve proficiency, assess capabilities and  readiness, and clarify roles and responsibilities. Short of performance in  actual operations, exercises provide the best means to assess the  effectiveness of organizations in achieving mission preparedness.  Exercises also provide an ideal opportunity to enhance preparedness by  collecting, developing, implementing, and disseminating lessons learned  and verifying corrective action taken to resolve previously identified  issues.", "Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, DOD realized the need for a  more integrated civilian and military response capability for any future  attack on the homeland. In response, DOD established the U.S. Northern  Command (NORTHCOM) to provide and manage homeland defense and  civil support. These two activities are among DOD\u2019s contribution to  homeland security. DHS is the lead federal agency for homeland security,  which is a national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United  States, reduce America\u2019s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the  damage and recover from attacks that do occur. DOD is the lead federal  agency for homeland defense\u2014defined as the protection of U.S.  sovereignty, territory, domestic population, and critical defense  infrastructure against external threats and aggression against the United  States. Civil support is defense support of civil authorities\u2014such as DHS  or another federal agency or state\u2014for domestic emergencies and for  designated law enforcement and other activities.  NORTHCOM differs  from other combatant commands in that, in addition to Canada and  Mexico, its area of responsibility includes the 48 contiguous states, Alaska,  the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "Numerous local, state, tribal, and federal agencies and organizations\u2014 including DOD, DHS, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA)\u2014have jurisdiction over or can coordinate resources within the  homeland and, therefore, may be involved in the response to an incident.  According to the National Defense Strategy, a whole-of-government  approach is only possible when every government department and agency  understands the core competencies, roles, missions, and capabilities of its  partners and works together to achieve common goals. Ensuring an  effective response to an incident will require that federal departments and  agencies, states, and local governments conduct integrated disaster  response planning and test these plans by exercising together.  To  achieve its goal of being ready to execute joint operations and ensure a  seamless operating environment, NORTHCOM\u2019s training goals include  maximizing exercise participation with federal, state, and local agencies  and National Guard units. NORTHCOM uses long-established DOD  practices for training and exercises to test and enhance the preparedness  of its personnel and forces to perform its homeland defense and civil  support missions. As a result, DOD has more experience than other federal  agencies in terms of the scope and range of its exercises and the  robustness of the process for conducting them. DOD\u2019s goal is to improve  the homeland defense and consequence management capabilities of its  interagency partners by leveraging this comparative advantage through  shared training and exercises.", "The National Exercise Program (NEP) was established in April 2007 under  the leadership of the Secretary of Homeland Security to prioritize and  coordinate the various federal, regional, and state exercise activities and  serves as the principal mechanism for examining the preparation and  efficiency of the federal government to respond to an incident. The NEP  includes a series of national exercises projected on a 5-year exercise  schedule and has established a four-tier system to determine the relative  priority of interagency participation in each exercise. DOD and other  federal agencies, states, and local organizations participate in these  national-level exercises. FEMA administers the NEP and has developed  Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program guidance to provide  standardized policy, methodology, and terminology for exercise design,  development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning.", "In our previous work following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, we identified  a need to improve, among other things, the nation\u2019s disaster response  capabilities. Overall, capabilities are built upon the appropriate  combination of people, skills, processes, and assets. Ensuring that needed  capabilities are available requires effective planning and coordination in  conjunction with training and exercises in which the capabilities are  realistically tested and problems identified and subsequently addressed in  partnership with other federal, state, and local stakeholders. Specific to  DOD, we reported that prior to Hurricane Katrina, disaster plans and  training exercises involving DOD were insufficient, and did not  incorporate lessons learned from past catastrophes to fully delineate the  military capabilities that could be needed to respond to a catastrophic  natural disaster. Moreover, disaster plans had not been tested and refined  with a robust exercise program. As a result of the inadequate plans\u2014and  the lack of realistic exercises to test those plans\u2014a lack of understanding  existed within DOD and among federal, state, and local responders as to  the types of assistance and capabilities that DOD might provide, the timing  of this assistance, and the respective contributions of the active-duty and  National Guard components. We recommended that DOD establish  milestones and expedite the development of detailed plans and exercises  to fully account for the unique capabilities and support that the military is  likely to provide to civil authorities in response to an incident. In  addition, we recently found that although FEMA has developed plans,  guidance, and systems to design exercises, gather lessons learned, and  track corrective actions to implement the NEP, it faces challenges in  ensuring that the exercises are carried out in accordance with Homeland  Security Exercise and Evaluation Program guidance. We recommended,  among other things, that FEMA establish a program management plan and  better ensure that exercises follow Homeland Security Exercise  Evaluation Program guidance, for example, by revising its grant  monitoring guidance to include a checklist of specific requirements for  states that receive grant funds.", "In order to better understand NORTHCOM\u2019s efforts to effectively prepare  for its homeland defense and civil support missions, we were asked to  review NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise program. This review is the final part of a  broader congressional request to review NORTHCOM\u2019s efforts to plan and  coordinate its homeland defense and civil support missions. We have  issued two previous reports in support of that request. For this report,  our objectives were to determine the extent to which (1) NORTHCOM\u2019s  exercise program is consistent with DOD training and exercise  requirements; (2) NORTHCOM involves relevant interagency partners and  states in planning, conducting, and assessing exercises; (3) NORTHCOM is  using lessons learned and corrective actions during exercises to improve  mission preparedness; and (4) NORTHCOM is integrating its exercises  with the NEP.", "In conducting this review, we generally focused our scope on  NORTHCOM\u2019s large-scale exercises conducted since Hurricane Katrina  made landfall in August 2005. To determine the extent to which  NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise program is consistent with DOD exercise  requirements and includes relevant exercise partners, we reviewed  exercise documentation for all 13 large-scale exercises the command  performed since it was established in 2002; evaluated NORTHCOM\u2019s  compliance with requirements established in DOD guidance; and assessed  the level of interagency and state participation in NORTHCOM\u2019s large- scale exercises. We also interviewed Office of the Secretary of Defense,  Joint Staff, NORTHCOM, FEMA, FEMA regional offices, and state officials  with knowledge of and experience with NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise program.  We selected a nongeneralizable sampling of states based on the extent to  which they have participated in major NORTHCOM exercises since  Hurricane Katrina and the varying scenarios of the exercises. The states  we selected played a major role in NORTHCOM exercises by having a  portion of the exercise conducted in their state and having various state  agencies and officials participate. States we selected include Arizona,  California, Michigan, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Washington. We also met  with Nevada officials who participated in a NORTHCOM exercise prior to  Hurricane Katrina\u2014Determined Promise 03\u2014to provide context to the  extent that changes may have been made to NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise  program and help develop our state selection methodology. To determine  the extent to which NORTHCOM is using lessons learned during exercises  to improve mission preparedness, we reviewed DOD, NORTHCOM, and  DHS\u2019s NEP guidance for lessons learned. Based on this guidance, we  assessed the management of all unclassified exercise observations and  issues identified from its last 6 large-scale exercises by determining each  record\u2019s status (open or closed), type (issue or lesson learned), and  disposition after NORTHCOM staff have acted on these records. Finally, to  determine the extent to which NORTHCOM is integrating its exercises  with the NEP we reviewed DOD and DHS guidance regarding the NEP and  how DOD and its subordinate commands are required to or should  participate. We conducted our review between June 2008 and September  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

NORTHCOM uses DOD\u2019s Joint  Training System as the basis to design, develop, and conduct exercises.  The Joint Training System provides an integrated, requirements-based  method for aligning training programs with assigned missions consistent  with command priorities, capabilities, and available resources. The joint  system consists of four phases beginning with the identification of critical  capabilities required based on assigned missions, proceeding through the  planning and scheduling of training events, the execution and evaluation  of required training, and assessing training proficiency against required  capability (see fig. 3).

The program began in September 2004 and included one  exercise in fiscal year 2005. Now the plan is to conduct four exercises  annually. NORTHCOM was given management responsibility for the  Vigilant Guard exercises in 2007, although the National Guard Bureau  retains responsibility for budgeting for these events. Two of the four  annual Vigilant Guard exercises are to be linked to major combatant  command exercises, usually NORTHCOM\u2019s Ardent Sentry and Vigilant  Shield. States hosting a Vigilant Guard exercise determine the objectives  for these events, and NORTHCOM provides support. Separate planning  begins for these Vigilant Guard exercises prior to the related planning  meetings for any linked NORTHCOM exercise. NORTHCOM\u2019s Ardent  Sentry 09 is linked with a Vigilant Guard exercise in Iowa with scenarios  including a train derailment and a chemical spill, an epidemic outbreak,  and terrorism incident."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NORTHCOM Faces Challenges Involving Interagency Partners and States in Planning, Conducting, and Assessing Exercises", "paragraphs": ["A key element to developing effective working relationships with all states  is a well-thought out and consistent process for including the states in  planning, conducting, and assessing exercises. Without such a process,  states may be unwilling to participate in future NORTHCOM exercises,  impacting the seamless exercise of all levels of government and potentially  affecting NORTHCOM\u2019s ability to provide support to civil authorities. We  found that challenges remain which have resulted in inconsistencies in the  way that NORTHCOM involves the states in its exercises. One of DOD\u2019s  challenges is adapting its exercise system and practices to accommodate  the coordination and involvement of other federal, state, local, and tribal  agencies that do not have the same kinds of practices or level of planning  effort. Differences in exercise culture stem from differences in missions,  experience, authority, scope, and resources available to DOD, interagency  partners, and states. DOD has an established, authoritative, time-tested  process for planning, conducting, and evaluating exercises in order to test  and improve preparedness to meet its wide range of critical missions.  Within DOD, training and exercises are considered a vital component of its  overall mission of defending the national interests and significant  resources are devoted to these activities. In contrast, DHS, as the lead for  interagency homeland security efforts, is a new agency and has faced  challenges since it was created due to frequent reorganization and not  being fully staffed. DHS and other civilian agencies and state and local  governments have day-to-day missions and responsibilities that may take  priority over exercises and often do not have the resources or experience  to participate in or conduct exercises. For example, DOD exercises often  are conducted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and may last a week or more  to enhance the realism of the exercise, while civilian agencies generally  participate 8 hours per day, usually\u2014according to NORTHCOM officials\u2014 during normal business hours, and do not exercise longer than a few days.  Therefore, DOD exercises are generally longer in duration, more resource  intensive, and involve more participants than other federal and state  exercises. Furthermore, DOD views itself as the last line of defense and  often exercises until resources are exhausted to fully assess capabilities  and identify areas needing improvement. Civilian agencies and states may  prefer not to exhaust resources during an exercise in order to avoid  appearing unprepared for an incident and the associated political  controversy.", "Another challenge that NORTHCOM faces is exercising with the various  states and territories within its area of responsibility considering the legal  and historical limits of the constitutional federal-state structure. The states  have a wide range and type of civilian state agencies responsible for  emergency management, some of which are headed by the Adjutant  General of the state, who also heads the military department or National  Guard, and others are completely separate entities (see table 4).", "Working with states has been the responsibility of the National Guard and  is relatively new for a federal military command like NORTHCOM.  NORTHCOM officials face challenges in dealing with the various civilian  agencies, differing emergency management structures, capabilities, and  needs of the states. For example, for Ardent Sentry 08 (linked with  National Level Exercise 2-08), NORTHCOM planned a scenario involving a  chemical bomb attack in Seattle, Washington without consulting the state  health department or civil support team\u2014the agencies responsible for  responding to a chemical or biological attack. State officials told us that  NORTHCOM invited the health department to participate once state  officials informed them that they should be involved, but that the scenario  was already locked in without the input of this key participant. DOD  officials told us that they rely on FEMA regional offices to provide  information on state agencies. However, we believe that NORTHCOM  officials should have determined if all relevant agencies were included in  the exercise when directly interacting with state officials during the  scenario development and other planning conferences, before the  scenarios were locked in. Washington emergency management officials  told us that this affected the realism of the exercise.", "NORTHCOM also faces challenges in balancing its training objectives with  those of state agencies and organizations. State and local governments  seek to exercise their first responder capabilities before having their  resources overwhelmed and needing to seek federal assistance. On the  other hand, NORTHCOM seeks to exercise its capability to provide  support to civil authorities when local, state, and other federal resources  are exhausted. This necessarily requires scenarios that exceed the states\u2019  capabilities and that stress DOD capabilities. Officials from four of the  seven states we interviewed told us that NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise scenarios  appeared unrealistic, overwhelmed their states too soon during the  exercise, or did not allow states to fully exercise their own training  objectives. For example, the scenario for Ardent Sentry 06 included  multiple improvised explosive devices detonating over a 4-day period in  various sites, such as the City of Detroit, St. Clair and Wayne Counties,  Michigan, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada with over 14,000 fatalities and a  simultaneous pandemic flu outbreak in Michigan. State emergency  management officials told us that such a large number of casualties would  overwhelm state resources almost immediately, and therefore precluded  fully exercising training objectives for state and local responders.  Officials from these states told us that because they did not have the  opportunity to exercise their own training objectives, they believed  NORTHCOM was using them as a training tool.  A NORTHCOM official  told us that NORTHCOM needs the states to participate in exercises and,  therefore, will be flexible to accommodate other organizations\u2019 training  objectives; however, NORTHCOM ultimately has its own objectives to  exercise. Officials from five of seven states noted that, for example, they  face budget and staffing limitations, and playing a major role in a  NORTHCOM exercise often requires establishing a state emergency  operations center with numerous staff and agencies involved. Given the  expansive scenarios NORTHCOM uses to guide its exercises and the  perception of half of the states we visited that this limits the benefits to  them, we believe that the states may be less likely to expend scarce  resources to participate in future NORTHCOM exercises.", "Inconsistencies with how NORTHCOM involves states in planning,  conducting, and assessing exercises is occurring in part because  NORTHCOM officials lack experience dealing with the various state  agencies and emergency management structures. Inconsistencies are also  occurring because NORTHCOM has not established an informed,  consistent process for including states in its exercises. One aspect of this  process is the way that NORTHCOM requests state participation in its  exercises. Currently, NORTHCOM has various processes for requesting  that other federal departments and agencies participate in its exercises,  such as making the request through the Joint Staff. FEMA officials told us  that requests for state participation in NORTHCOM exercises should be  made through FEMA\u2019s regional offices. However, because NORTHCOM  does not have an established process for requesting state participation,  officials from the states we visited told us that NORTHCOM officials made  requests informally and in a variety of ways, including through the  National Guard Bureau, the state\u2019s National Guard, or FEMA\u2019s regional  offices.  In some cases, such as when the state emergency management  agency and state National Guard have a close working relationship, this  method has been effective for NORTHCOM. However, in other cases, this  method has led to more limited exercises. For example, emergency  management officials from one state told us that NORTHCOM does not  have full state representation if it only exercises with the state National  Guard. In that case, NORTHCOM therefore misses out on interaction with  other key state emergency management officials and responders and  affects the realism of the exercise.", "Another aspect of the lack of a consistent process for requesting state  participation is potentially missing the opportunity to leverage the existing  expertise of the National Guard Bureau and defense coordinating officers  located in each of the 10 FEMA regional offices. As we previously  reported, the National Guard Bureau and defense coordinating officers  have knowledge and experience in dealing with states in their region and  may be a valuable resource for NORTHCOM officials during the planning  and conduct of exercises. The three defense coordinating officers with  whom we met told us that they participate in NORTHCOM exercises, but  currently their role does not involve requesting state participation on  behalf of NORTHCOM or providing state-specific information to  NORTHCOM exercise officials. Without an informed and consistent  process for including the states in planning, conducting, and assessing its  exercises, NORTHCOM increases the risk that its exercises will not  provide benefits for all participants, impacting the seamless exercise of all  levels of government and potentially affecting NORTHCOM\u2019s ability to  provide support to civil authorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NORTHCOM has a Systematic Lessons Learned and Corrective Action Program, but Gaps Remain", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NORTHCOM Has a Systematic Lessons Learned and Corrective Action Process", "paragraphs": ["DOD and NORTHCOM guidance requires that NORTHCOM identify  observations during the course of normal operations, exercises, and real- world events; capture the detail required to fully understand the problem;  and share valid lessons learned and issues as widely as possible.

NORTHCOM conducts a review called a Hotwash within h of completing the exercise so that exercise participants can discuss  observations that significantly impacted their mission and recommend  emergent themes for discussion during a subsequent review known as the  facilitated after-action review. This review, generally held 7 days after the  s to  exercise is completed, provides an opportunity to present major issue senior leaders and obtain the Commander\u2019s guidance for resolution.  However, the extent to which interagency and state officials are atten and participating in NORTHCOM\u2019s postexercise meetings is unclear.  Based on NORTHCOM\u2019s documentation, only two states (out of the last  six major exercises) participated in a Facilitated After Action Review\u2014 California in Vigilant Shield 09 and Alaska in Ardent Sentry 07. Officials  from three states in addition to California told us that they participated  the after-action meeting for the exercises they participated in, but they  may have participated in the regional or national-level meeting rather than  old us  NORTHCOM\u2019s. Officials from two of the seven states we met with t that they did not attend NORTHCOM\u2019s postexercise reviews for the  in  exercises in which they participated at least partly due to staffing and  budget limitations.", "NORTHCOM has also attempted to share lessons learned with other  federal agencies and states by using FEMA\u2019s lessons learned sharing  system. For example, NORTHCOM has posted six reports onto FEMA\u2019s  lessons learned system, including four recent exercise reports and two  reports from operations in 2008. However, with one exception, the  documents that NORTHCOM has made available on this system (1)  include only lists of observations and, in some cases, record-tracking  numbers from JLLIS and previous lessons learned systems, and (2) lack  detailed information on individual lessons learned and corrective actions.  Joint Staff and NORTHCOM officials told us that they do not post detailed  information on the unclassified Lessons Learned Information Sharing  system Web site, because it is not adequately protected from the potential  for unauthorized access to records. As a result, the security of the  information cannot be assured. According to these officials, if an  adversary nation or terrorist group gained access to this information, it  may be possible for them to identify weaknesses in NORTHCOM\u2019s  operations that can be exploited. In a recent exercise summary report  NORTHCOM stated that it will post lessons learned, best practices, and  reports that may benefit their non-DOD mission partners in FEMA\u2019s  Lessons Learned Information Sharing system, which the report describes  as a secure, restricted-access information system. Because security  concerns are preventing NORTHCOM from openly sharing all its  unclassified lessons learned with its interagency partners and the states,  the information NORTHCOM does provide may be of limited value for  helping its partners improve the nation\u2019s disaster responsiveness. Because  NORTHCOM is not fully involving other federal agencies and states in its  lessons learned process, it is missing opportunities to learn lessons from  an exercise. For example, officials from two states did not provide  NORTHCOM with lessons learned from exercises because they did not  attend the command\u2019s post exercise reviews.

We reviewed unclassified records in JLLIS from  NORTHCOM\u2019s previous six large-scale exercises and found at least 77 of  the 375 records or about 20 percent required corrective actions but were  either closed prior to completing the corrective action or closed without  verifying the effectiveness of the corrective action. For example, an  observation was made during Ardent Sentry 07 that NORTHCOM did not  have a process for addressing a foreign nation\u2019s offer of military-to-military  assistance in a major disaster. The issue was validated and the corrective  action developed, but the issue was closed by the originating organization  before the corrective action could be verified or reobserved in a  subsequent exercise. The record was closed even though the Executive  Corrective Action Board directed that it remain open until an exercise of  suitable scope to require significant military support was developed.  Another example of a record being closed without verification or re- observation is an observation made during Ardent Sentry 07 raising  concerns that NORTHCOM personnel could arrive to assess a disaster site  without alerting state officials they would be coming.

NORTHCOM\u2019s lessons  learned manager told us that the command does not have the staff  necessary to oversee the actions on records handled within the other  directorates. In addition, while the checkbox format in JLLIS makes it easy  to see whether an issue is open, awaiting verification, or closed, entries  made in JLLIS regarding corrective actions required, implementation date,  and plan for verification are primarily in a narrative format, which may  make the review and oversight process more time consuming. Without  sufficient oversight, NORTHCOM cannot ensure that corrective actions  are verified and reobserved in a subsequent exercise or operation before  the issue is closed, so that the command knows the solution is effective.  We recognize that such oversight should be addressed without  significantly stressing NORTHCOM\u2019s staff. However, if NORTHCOM does  not ensure that corrective actions are fully resolved, it increases the risk  that these issues may occur again, possibly during crucial, real-world  situations.

FEMA requires that entities, such as state  and local governments, receiving homeland security grant funding for their  exercises adhere to specific Homeland Security Exercise Evaluation  Program guidance for exercise program management, design, conduct,  evaluation, and improvement planning. We reviewed key program  documents, such as the Implementation Plan, and found that this guidance  is unclear about the extent to which federal agencies should use the  Homeland Security Exercise Evaluation Program. For example, the  Implementation Plan states that the NEP does not displace a preexisting  exercise program, and none of the NEP guidance requires that federal  agencies use the Homeland Security Exercise Evaluation Program.  However, the Implementation Plan states that the Homeland Security  Exercise Evaluation Program will serve as the doctrinal foundation for  NEP exercises.", "FEMA officials told us that federal agencies should use this program when  participating in tier I and tier II exercises so that the various exercise  participants have consistency when planning, conducting, and assessing  exercises.

The primary differences between  these sets of guidance are that (1) DOD\u2019s task list, which serves as the  basis for its exercises, includes tasks that are specific to military missions,  such as troop movements and sealifts; (2) DHS guidance provides more  detailed criteria for the postexercise documentation, such as content and  format; and (3) DHS\u2019s planning cycle is generally shorter\u20149 to 15 months  versus 12 to 18 months for DOD. (See table 7.) See app. II for a more  detailed comparison.", "According to both the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation  Program and Joint Training System guidance, it is important to link tasks  and capabilities with exercise objectives to ensure that participants  exercise or train as they would perform in a real-world event. The  Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program recommends using  DHS\u2019s Target Capabilities List or the Universal Task List to formulate the  tasks and capabilities that underlie the objectives for an exercise. These  lists describe the capabilities government entities need and tasks they are  expected to perform to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover  from incidents of national significance. In contrast, NORTHCOM derives  its tasks and capabilities from the Universal Joint Task List to formulate  Joint Mission Essential Tasks. According to NORTHCOM guidance, the  command is required to include in its exercises the Joint Mission Essential  Tasks associated with its Joint Training Plan, which is updated annually.  These tasks are identified by joint force commanders as most essential to  their assigned or anticipated missions with priority given to their wartime  missions and describe their priority wartime requirements. We found that  DOD\u2019s operating instruction for participation in the NEP does not provide  guidance on how DOD components should incorporate tasks and  capabilities derived from sources recommended by the Homeland Security  Exercise and Evaluation Program when participating in NEP exercises.  The primary differences between DHS\u2019 and DOD\u2019s lists are that DOD\u2019s task  lists generally incorporate more descriptive metrics and criteria to assess  performance and include tasks that are specific to military missions, such  as troop movements and sealifts.

In addition,  NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise summary reports for National Level Exercise 1-08  and 2-08 did not contain all information recommended by the Homeland  Security Exercise Evaluation Program. For example, NORTHCOM did not  include the recommended analyses regarding the capabilities and tasks  tied to the exercises\u2019 objectives.", "As stated above, we reviewed NEP guidance such as the Implementation  Plan and found it does not clearly state the extent to which federal  agencies are required to follow the Homeland Security Exercise and  Evaluation Program. As a result of this unclear guidance, we found that  agency officials have varying interpretations of the requirements. For  example, a DOD and a Joint Staff official told us that NEP guidance does  not require agencies to use the Homeland Security Exercise Evaluation  Program even for NEP exercises. Therefore, NORTHCOM uses the Joint  Training System rather than the Homeland Security Exercise and  Evaluation Program as the basis for planning, conducting, and assessing  exercises. However, officials from FEMA\u2019s National Exercise Division told  us that all participating agencies should use the Homeland Security  Exercise and Evaluation Program guidance for tier I and tier II NEP  exercises. FEMA officials stated that federal departments and agencies  should be held accountable for meeting key requirements, but that FEMA\u2019s  authority is limited to guiding, supporting, and coordinating with, but not  directing other federal departments and agencies to comply with guidance.  As we have previously reported, we believe that FEMA\u2019s expanded  leadership role under the Post-Katrina Act provides FEMA opportunities  to instill a shared sense of responsibility and accountability on the part of  all agencies.", "Neither DOD nor NORTHCOM guidance specifically addresses the extent  to which DHS\u2019s Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program  planning and documentation requirements should be followed.

We found  that having differing sets of guidance, such as DOD\u2019s and DHS\u2019 capabilities  task lists and postexercise documentation requirements, makes exercises  more difficult and potentially limits the benefits for participating states.  For example, officials from three states we visited told us that using  NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise planning and reporting requirements rather than  Homeland Security Exercise Evaluation Program guidance has made the  processes more difficult. Further, the Defense Science Board found that  inconsistent approaches to the development and content of postexercise  documentation may affect the ability of organizations to fully learn lessons  identified in exercises.

NORTHCOM\u2019s use of DOD\u2019s Joint Training System  has provided a robust process for planning and conducting exercises to  improve preparedness to achieve its homeland defense and civil support  missions, and its efforts to involve its interagency partners and the states  in exercises have helped to reduce uncertainty about the process for  responding to an incident. However, without a consistent record of what  has occurred during an exercise that is accessible by all exercise  participants, including those from other federal agencies and states,  NORTHCOM cannot ensure that it has met internal standards, trained to  key focus areas, or compared the goals and results of exercises over time.  Further, a key element to developing effective working relationships with  all states is a consistent process for including states in planning and  executing NORTHCOM\u2019s exercises that incorporates state-specific  knowledge and information. By coordinating consistently with  organizations, like FEMA and NGB, that have knowledge and experience  dealing with states, NORTHCOM can improve the value and effectiveness  of exercises for all of the participants involved.", "Exercises provide an opportunity to enhance preparedness by collecting,  developing, implementing, and disseminating lessons learned and verifying  corrective action taken to resolve previously identified issues.  NORTHCOM\u2019s clear procedure for capturing observations in JLLIS and  identifying issues needing corrective action has helped to improve its  capabilities to complete its missions. However, by not providing federal  agencies and states greater access to its lessons learned process,  NORTHCOM will lose opportunities to learn valuable lessons from an  exercise, particularly observations from the states that could enhance  coordination and build more effective interagency relationships. Further,  the risk that issues may reoccur will be increased, particularly when  interagency partners are not aware of key issues or concerns that might  impede the government\u2019s overall responsiveness to a natural or man-made  disaster. In addition, when corrective actions remain open until fully  implemented and verified in a subsequent exercise, NORTHCOM will have  greater assurance that issues raised during exercises are being adequately  addressed and the corrections are in fact solving the problems identified.", "NEP policies and tools for the design, planning, conduct, and evaluation of  exercises are intended to create a common exercise policy and consistent  terminology for exercise planners across all levels of government to  improve the federal government\u2019s ability to evaluate national  preparedness. The steps DOD and NORTHCOM have taken to integrate  exercises with the NEP have helped DHS to prioritize and coordinate  federal exercise activities and enhance the federal government\u2019s ability to  respond to an incident. We recognize that NORTHCOM and DOD must  meet their own mission and exercise requirements and the Joint Training  System may be best suited to meet the high standards required for  NORTHCOM\u2019s exercises. However, achieving national preparedness  requires shared responsibility among federal, state, and local governments  and organizations and an integration of their various standards, policies,  and procedures into the national system. We also recognize that the NEP  continues to evolve and become more useful to federal and state partners.  IHowever, in the absence of clear guidance from DHS on the extent to  which agencies should use Homeland Security Exercise Evaluation  Program planning and documentation guidance, DOD should ensure that  its components clearly understand when the use of this guidance is  appropriate so that both DOD and its exercise partners, such as other  federal agencies and states, derive the most benefits from exercises. This,  in turn, contributes to the ultimate success of a whole-of-government  approach to national preparedness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve NORTHCOM\u2019s consistency with exercise documentation, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct NORTHCOM\u2019s  Commander to develop guidance with specific criteria for postexercise  documentation, particularly the Exercise Summary Report as the official  exercise record, including the content and format to be included in such  reports that will allow the results and lessons learned of exercises to be  easily reviewed and compared.", "To improve NORTHCOM\u2019s involvement of interagency partners and states  in its exercises, we recommend that  the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Commander, U.S. Northern Command, and  other relevant combatant commanders, coordinate with the  Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency  Management Agency to develop guidance and procedures for  consistently involving state officials in planning, executing, and  assessing exercises that incorporate relevant state-specific  information, and  the Secretary of Defense direct NORTHCOM\u2019s Commander to develop  a training plan for NORTHCOM headquarters staff on state emergency  management structures and relevant issues related to working with  civilian state and local emergency management officials.", "To improve NORTHCOM\u2019s involvement of interagency partners and states  in its lessons learned and corrective action process and its management of  corrective actions, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct:    NORTHCOM\u2019s Commander to establish and publicize valid and easily  accessible procedures for non-DOD exercise participants to submit  observations relevant to NORTHCOM, such as placing a template on  NORTHCOM\u2019s publicly accessible Web site or DHS\u2019s Homeland  Security Information Network, so that NORTHCOM officials have a  clear, secure avenue to obtain observations and assess potential  lessons that originate with its exercise partners;  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in consultation and  coordination with DHS, to either resolve information assurance issues  so that the combatant commands, including NORTHCOM, can post  Exercise Summary Reports with lessons learned and observations  from NEP exercises on DHS\u2019s Lessons Learned Information Sharing  system to make them easily accessible to interagency partners and  states or establish an alternative method to systematically collect and  share lessons learned; and  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to revise the joint lessons  learned operating instruction to include procedures to ensure that  appropriate corrective actions are implemented and verified in a  subsequent exercise or operation before being closed and that the  reasons for closure are documented. Possible procedures might be  adding a verification checkbox on JLLIS\u2019s issue management page or  requiring that the directorates and subordinate commands within the  combatant commands provide a status report when a correction is  implemented and reobserved or closed for reasons other than re- observation.", "To improve NORTHCOM\u2019s ability to work with interagency partners on  major national exercises and further achieve the objectives of the NEP, we  recommend that the Secretary of Defense revise the instruction on DOD  participation in the NEP and/or direct the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff to revise the operating instruction regarding DOD participation in the  NEP to provide the general conditions under which the combatant  commands are expected to follow the Homeland Security Exercise and  Evaluation Program planning and documentation requirements or the  DOD\u2019s Joint Training System should be modified for those civil support  exercises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In comments on a draft of this report, DOD generally agreed with the  intent of our recommendations and discussed steps it is taking or plans to  take to address these recommendations.

DHS also reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments,  which we have incorporated where appropriate.", "In response to our recommendation that NORTHCOM develop guidance  with specific criteria for postexercise documentation to allow the results  and lessons learned of exercises to be reviewed and compared, DOD  agreed that such information should be provided in a standardized format  that can be easily accessed and understood by authorized organizations  which might benefit from such knowledge. DOD cautioned that any  actions in response to this recommendation must accommodate  constraints regarding classified information. We agree that properly  securing classified information is a critical responsibility and believe this  can easily be accomplished without undermining the intent of the  recommendation, which is to improve the consistency and completeness  of formal exercise documentation and thereby its overall value.", "In response to our recommendation that DOD coordinate with DHS and  FEMA to develop guidance and procedures for consistently involving state  officials in planning, executing, and assessing exercises that incorporate  relevant state-specific information, DOD agreed that better coordination  for interfacing with state officials can be achieved. DOD also pointed out  that NORTHCOM continues to expand its efforts to work through defense  coordinating officers, existing state National Guard relationships, and  FEMA regional headquarters partners to ensure that states are able to  benefit from participation in DOD-sponsored exercises. However, DOD  also said that while NORTHCOM has continuously engaged and  encouraged state participation in NORTHCOM-sponsored exercises, the  primary audience for such training is and must remain NORTHCOM. DOD  also suggested that our recommendation has applicability to other federal  interagency partners and that the issue should be addressed to the  Exercise and Evaluation Sub-Interagency Planning Committee as a  revision to the National Exercise Program Implementation Plan. As our  report indicates, we agree that NORTHCOM has sought to engage and  involve the states in its comprehensive exercise program. NORTHCOM  plans for and conducts major exercises both inside and outside the  construct of the National Exercise Program. Particularly for NORTHCOM- sponsored exercises focused on the command\u2019s civil support mission, the  effective involvement of and interaction with state and other federal  partners is a critical component of improving and maintaining  NORTHCOM\u2019s preparedness. For NORTHCOM\u2019s participation in national- level exercises, the preparedness goals and objectives of all participants  are equally important. We believe that in developing procedures to  improve coordination with the states, DOD can (1) avoid situations where  exercises meant to improve preparedness are not fully coordinated with  the necessary partners; (2) capitalize on the structures and organizations it  already has in place, such as the defense coordinating officers and  relationships with state National Guard headquarters; and (3) coordinate  with DHS and FEMA to improve the military-civilian interface. With regard  to the latter, the Exercise and Evaluation Sub-Interagency Planning  Committee may indeed be one of the venues at which DOD can effectively  coordinate with its interagency partners.", "With respect to our recommendation that NORTHCOM develop a training  plan for NORTHCOM headquarters staff on state emergency management  structures and relevant issues related to working with civilian state and  local emergency management officials, DOD agreed and noted that  headquarters training is required for all newly assigned NORTHCOM staff.  Further, DOD noted that NORTHCOM sponsors three versions of its  defense support of civil authorities seminar that are targeted to staff at  different seniority levels. We agree that NORTHCOM has continued to  improve the level of awareness and training it provides staff on the  complexities of providing defense support to civilian authorities in the  United States. However, this does not fully address our recommendation.  While training on the general procedures of the national response  framework, the nature of state-federal government relations, and DOD\u2019s  proper role in providing military support to civil authorities is invaluable  for NORTHCOM staff, we continue to believe that this should be  supplemented by the kinds of state-specific information that would  provide both exercise officials and all other staff with an understanding of  the key differences between states. These differences are possibly as  numerous as the number of states and play a role in all routine  interactions between the individual states and DOD officials as well as for  effective coordination for exercise planning and coordination during a  natural disaster or some other no-notice incident requiring defense  support to civil authorities.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that NORTHCOM establish and  publicize valid and easily accessible procedures for non-DOD exercise  participants to submit observations relevant to NORTHCOM, such as  placing a template on NORTHCOM\u2019s Web site or DHS\u2019 Homeland Security  Information Network, so that NORTHCOM officials have a clear, secure  avenue to obtain observations and assess potential lessons that originate  with its exercise partners. DOD indicated that collecting exercise  information from all perspectives would provide additional opportunities  to improve NORTHCOM\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission tasks.", "DOD also agreed with our recommendation that it work with DHS to  either resolve information assurance issues so that NORTHCOM can post  Exercise Summary Reports with lessons learned on DHS\u2019 Lessons Learned  Information Sharing system or establish an alternative method to  systematically collect and share lessons learned. DOD cautioned that  while wide dissemination of information approved for release would be of  great benefit to homeland security entities it continues to adhere to the  Joint Training System and cannot mandate that DHS alter its Lessons  Learned Information System to make accommodations. DOD also noted  that it has procedures in place to allow specifically cleared individuals  from outside DOD access to information contained in Exercise Summary  Reports. We agree that DOD cannot mandate alterations to the Lessons  Learned Information System. We also agree that the Joint Training System  should remain the chief guidance for the conduct of DOD exercises.  However, we continue to believe that in working with DHS on the proper  level and mode of information sharing, DOD may be able to improve the  dissemination of relevant exercise-related information to all appropriate  officials.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff revise the joint lessons learned operating instruction to  include procedures to ensure that appropriate corrective actions are  implemented and verified in a subsequent exercise or operation before  being closed and that the reasons for closure are documented. DOD  indicated that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction  3150.25D could be expanded to provide more guidance and the Joint  Lessons Learned Information System could be updated to provide a  technological solution to address the issue once the process and  procedures are in place. DOD also indicated that the process of verifying  corrective action and closing issues will become more effective with the  modifications it outlined in response to the recommendation.", "In response to our recommendation that DOD revise guidance on DOD  participation in the National Exercise Program to provide the general  conditions under which the combatant commands are expected to follow  the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program planning and  documentation requirements or the DOD\u2019s Joint Training System should  be modified for those civil support exercises, DOD recognized the  importance of ensuring effective interaction with interagency partners for  homeland security-related exercises. However, DOD noted that the  National Exercise Program Implementation Plan contains language placed  there at DOD\u2019s insistence that establishes a process to resolve doctrinal  differences during exercise planning. DOD indicated that together with  provisions in the implementation plan establishing the administration,  scope, and hierarchy of multiagency homeland security exercises and the  5-year National Exercise Program schedule, this should address our  recommendation. DOD further noted that The Joint Training System  remains the Secretary of Defense\u2019s guidance on DOD exercises and that  the National Exercise Program Implementation Plan stipulates that  individual department or agency exercise programs should not be  replaced. We agree that the Joint Training System is and should be DOD\u2019s  primary guidance for ensuring that DOD components train and exercise  according to standards. However, because interagency exercises are  becoming an ever larger part of the national preparedness effort, and to  the extent that effective exercise planning is bolstered by common  procedures, our recommendation is intended to help DOD clarify for its  components the circumstances under which the specific planning and  documentation requirements for the Homeland Security Exercise and  Evaluation Program can be followed without detriment to DOD\u2019s high  training and exercise standards or compromise of the Joint Training  System.", "DOD\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix III.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, Secretary  of Homeland Security, and other interested parties.

To determine the  extent to which NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise program is consistent with  Department of Defense (DOD) training and exercise requirements and  includes relevant exercise partners, we evaluated NORTHCOM\u2019s  compliance with exercise reporting and documentation requirements  established in DOD and command guidance. We reviewed available  guidance to determine requirements for timing, format, and content. We  also compared these requirements with guidance contained in the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Homeland Security Exercise  and Evaluation Program documentation. We reviewed exercise  documentation for all large-scale exercises the command performed since  it was established in 2002 to determine the extent to which the command  complied with the guidance.", "We also performed an assessment of the experiences and level of  participation from some interagency organizations and states in  NORTHCOM\u2019s large-scale exercises. We initially met with Nevada officials  who participated in a NORTHCOM exercise prior to Hurricane Katrina\u2014 Determined Promise 03\u2014to provide context to the extent that changes  may have been made to NORTHCOM\u2019s exercise program and help develop  our state selection methodology. We selected a nongeneralizable sample of  six states based on the extent to which they have participated in major  NORTHCOM exercise since Hurricane Katrina and the varying scenarios  of the exercises. The states we selected played a major role in  NORTHCOM exercises by having a portion of the exercise conducted in  their state and having various state agencies and officials participate.  States we selected include Arizona, California, Michigan, Oregon, Rhode  Island, and Washington. We met with representatives from each state\u2019s  emergency management organization and state national guard. Because of  the methodology selected, the resulting data and information from these  state visits could not be projected to make assumptions about the rest of  the states and what they may experience exercising with NORTHCOM. We  also met with officials from three Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) regional offices that had exercised with NORTHCOM in three of  the last six large-scale exercises. We also interviewed officials from the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Security and  America\u2019s Security Affairs, Joint Staff, and NORTHCOM with knowledge  of and experience with NORTHCOM\u2019s training and exercise program.", "To determine the extent to which NORTHCOM is using lessons learned  during exercises to improve mission preparedness, we reviewed DOD,  NORTHCOM, and DHS National Exercise Program (NEP) guidance for  recording, tracking, and managing lessons learned and assessed  NORTHCOM\u2019s management of exercise observations and issues identified  in several of NORTHCOM\u2019s large-scale exercises since Hurricane Katrina  in 2005. We interviewed NORTHCOM, Joint Staff, and FEMA officials  regarding the various lessons learned management systems, and how  interagency and state access to these systems can be accomplished. We  also spoke with an official in the General Services Administration  regarding the types of federal personal identification verification cards  used by DOD and other federal departments and agencies to access  government computer systems. In reviewing the management of  NORTHCOM\u2019s lessons learned program we identified and reviewed all  unclassified exercise observations from its last six large-scale exercises  that had been activated in NORTHCOM\u2019s area of the Joint Lessons  Learned Information System (JLLIS). Our review of the records in JLLIS  entailed determining each record\u2019s status (open or closed), its type (issue  or lesson learned), and each record\u2019s disposition after NORTHCOM staff  have acted on these records to respond to the issues or lessons learned  documented. Based on our review, we generally placed these records into  one of several categories: open; closed, nonconcur; issue closed with  reobservation; issue closed with no reobservation; and lesson learned. In  addition we reviewed several records that had been merged with other  original records because each related to the same issue; however, the  original record for that issue was not part of our universe. Therefore,  without reviewing the lead record the merged records lacked sufficient  information regarding their disposition and that condition became another  category.", "Finally, to determine the extent to which NORTHCOM is integrating its  training and exercises with the NEP we reviewed DOD, NORTHCOM, and  Department of Homeland Security guidance to identify any differences in  exercise planning and documentation between DOD\u2019s guidance and that  for the NEP. We used that analysis to determine under what conditions  NORTHCOM should apply standards related to the NEP, and how DOD  and its subordinate commands should participate in the NEP tier I or II  exercises. We reviewed NORTHCOM documentation from two major  national exercises conducted during fiscal year 2008 to determine the  extent to which NORTHCOM employed the guidance from the Homeland  Security Exercise Evaluation Program. We determined that national  exercises that are operations-based exercises in that they involved the  deployment of personnel would be the best candidates for evaluating  NORTHCOM\u2019s participation in such exercises. We also interviewed state  emergency management and National Guard officials from six states that  have exercised with NORTHCOM since 2005, to understand the extent to  which NORTHCOM is integrating its exercise planning and conduct with  the interagency as well as various state governments.", "In addressing our objectives, we reviewed plans and related documents,  obtained information, and interviewed officials at the following locations:    NORTHCOM Headquarters, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado  Springs, Colorado  Joint Forces Command, Joint Warfighting Center, Suffolk, Virginia    The Office of the Secretary of Defense, Washington, D.C.
