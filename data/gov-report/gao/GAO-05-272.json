Total U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico grew from $4.1 billion in 1993 to $7.9 billion in 2003. Despite progress, some commodities still have difficulties gaining access to the Mexican market. GAO found that Mexico's use of antidumping, plant and animal health requirements, safeguards and other nontariff trade barriers, such as consumption taxes, presented the most significant market access issues for U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico. Mexico has put in place several programs to help farmers adjust to trade liberalization, but structural problems, such as lack of rural credit, continue to impede growth in rural areas, presenting challenges to full implementation of NAFTA. Lagging rural development fuels arguments that NAFTA has hurt small farmers, although studies, including some Mexican studies, do not support this conclusion. Opponents of NAFTA want to block further tariff eliminations and are demanding renegotiation of NAFTA's agricultural provisions. Concerned about such opposition, U.S. officials acknowledged the need to promote the benefits of NAFTA, while seeking ways to help Mexico address its rural development issues. Historically, U.S. agencies have undertaken many agriculture-related collaborative efforts with Mexico. Since 2001, U.S.-Mexico development activities have taken place under the Partnership for Prosperity (P4P) Initiative to promote development in parts of Mexico where economic growth has lagged. Recognizing the importance of rural development to the success of NAFTA, Department of State and USDA strategies for Mexico call for building on collaborative activities under the P4P to pursue the related goals of rural development and trade liberalization under NAFTA; however, the P4P action plans do not set forth specific strategies and activities that could be used to achieve these goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) created the  world\u2019s largest free trade area and helped Mexico become one of the largest  and fastest growing markets for U.S. agricultural products.

However,  some observers raised concerns about the difficulties Mexico\u2019s more  traditional agricultural producers might encounter as the country opened  up to U.S. products. With more than 22 percent of the population  dependent on the sector, but with many farmers unable to compete under  free market conditions, agriculture is a significant yet vulnerable area of  the Mexican economy. Differences in perceived opportunities and  challenges resulted from the three distinct types of agricultural producers  present in Mexico. Mexico\u2019s agriculture sector consists of a large number  of small traditional farmers, some medium size commercially oriented  growers, and a lesser number of large modern producers. These groups of  farmers differ in many respects including farm size, access to capital, types  of crops produced, and productivity. Small subsistence farmers produce  primarily corn (maize), often at subsistence levels for self-consumption, in  small parcels of less than 5 hectares of mostly rain-fed land. Corn is also  among the major U.S. agricultural exports to Mexico, which is perceived by  some to be in competition with the production of small subsistence  farmers. Medium size farmers are involved in commercial-oriented  operations, however, they face relatively high cost structures, which are  marked by scarcity of capital and insufficiently developed marketing  infrastructure. Some believe that medium size commercial farmers face the  greatest impact from import competition and structural change. On the  other hand, Mexico\u2019s large commercial farmers usually have larger plots of  irrigated land and a higher productivity level. They have better access to  capital, including direct investment and commercial lending from abroad.  Mexican commercial farmers are also typically involved in production of higher-valued commodities, notably fresh fruits and vegetables, which have  undergone dynamic export growth since the early 1990s.", "Agricultural trade expansion since NAFTA\u2019s implementation generally has  been consistent with expectations. While U.S. trade data indicates Mexican  agricultural exports have done well under the agreement, some observers  maintain NAFTA has had negative consequences for small farmers. For  example, one study asserts that employment opportunities for Mexican  subsistence farmers have declined under NAFTA. According to this study,  imports of cheaper corn have contributed to lower corn prices in Mexico,  which has led medium size farms to cut back their demand for labor  supplied by subsistence farmers. However, a December 2003 World Bank  report noted that NAFTA did not bring about many of the anticipated  negative effects on poor subsistence farmers and had not had a devastating  effect on Mexican agriculture as a whole. This research notes that as  consumers, Mexican farmers may have benefited from lower corn prices.  In addition, corn production in Mexico has not declined, but rather had  increased by about 14 percent since NAFTA was enacted, to a record high  in 2003.

Some of these problems are related to  Mexico\u2019s tenuous land ownership, known as the ejido system. Some  economists argue that the small size of farm plots under the ejido system  does not make for economically viable production units. In addition, the  ejido system limits farmers\u2019 ability to obtain credit using land as collateral  because the farmers do not have clear ownership of the land. Without  access to credit, farmers cannot shift to new technologies and increase  productivity. According to experts, the lack of rural credit has been a key  impediment to Mexican agricultural development. Mexico\u2019s financial crisis  of 1995 exacerbated the problem of rural development by severely limiting  the Mexican government\u2019s budget available to carry out programs to invest  in rural areas. In addition, according to USDA, other challenges identified  by experts that contribute to the lack of rural development include: low  education level, poor rural infrastructure, environmental problems related  to land use, and low levels of technology.", "While U.S. officials note that NAFTA has greatly benefited Mexican  agriculture overall, they express concern about the challenges posed by  lagging rural development to the long-term successful implementation of  the agreement. U.S. officials caution that lagging rural development fuels  the arguments made by opponents of NAFTA that cheap imports from the  United States have depressed Mexican agricultural product prices, hurting  small farmers and deepening rural poverty. In its fiscal year 2005 Unified  Export Strategy for Mexico, USDA acknowledged the need for efforts to  highlight the benefits of NAFTA for Mexico\u2019s economy while seeking ways  to help Mexico address its rural development issues.", "The implementation of NAFTA became a major political issue as Mexico  prepared to eliminate tariffs and tariff rate quotas in January 2003.  Elimination of these tariffs provided U.S. agricultural exports even greater  access to the Mexican market. In order to respond to intense criticism by  the opponents of NAFTA at that time, USDA officials had to engage in  extensive dialogue with Mexican legislative and executive officials, and  they mounted a public information drive to explain the benefits of NAFTA  for Mexican agriculture. Ultimately Mexico eliminated the tariffs, but the  administration of Mexican President Vicente Fox found it necessary to  negotiate a national agreement on agriculture with various domestic  constituencies. He intended the agreement\u2014referred to as Acuerdo  Nacional para el Campo\u2014to address concerns about perceived negative  effects of trade liberalization on Mexico\u2019s rural poor. As part of this  agreement, the Mexican government commissioned several Mexican  academic institutions to study the impacts of NAFTA on Mexican  agriculture. This research generally confirmed that structural problems  confronting Mexican agriculture preceded the implementation of NAFTA.  However, certain Mexican producer groups continue to pressure the  government, and a number of members of Mexico\u2019s Congress have strong  ties to groups that oppose NAFTA.", "U.S. and Mexican government officials and agricultural experts warned  that there may be considerable opposition to the next round of tariff  elimination in 2008. These officials cited the experience in the months  leading up to the latest round of agricultural tariff elimination in 2003. In  addition, they note that corn, one of the three remaining commodities  scheduled to have tariffs lifted in 2008, is a commodity of particular  concern in Mexico. Corn cultivation has ancient roots in Mexican rural  culture; is central to the Mexican diet, accounting for about one-third of  total calories; and remains the principal crop of subsistence farmers. For  these reasons, eliminating tariffs on corn will be a sensitive cultural issue,  as well as a matter of economic concern.", "Certain farm groups in Mexico have argued that allowing cheap imports of  U.S. corn will drive the Mexican agriculture into ruin. Mexican politicians  who oppose NAFTA note the continuing economic distress in rural areas of  Mexico and insist on renegotiation of the agricultural provisions of the  agreement to improve the conditions of Mexican farmers. Although the  total elimination of already low Mexican tariffs on corn may not have much  economic significance for U.S. producers, failure to comply with the final  phase of tariff elimination may undercut support for NAFTA among U.S.  producers who were in favor of the agreement with the expectation that it  would lead to genuinely free trade. Additionally, U.S. trade officials have  expressed serious reservations about any attempt to renegotiate the  agricultural provisions of NAFTA, because it could lead to demands to  renegotiate other aspects of the agreement and undermine the agreement  as a model for trade liberalization throughout the Western Hemisphere."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Agencies Undertake Collaborative Agricultural Efforts, but Do Not Focus on Rural Development Challenges to Mexico\u2019s Transition to Liberalized Trade", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 10 years, U.S. agencies, primarily led by USDA, have carried  out numerous activities that benefit both U.S. and Mexican agricultural  interests.

Mexico, however, requires that apples undergo a process  called \u201ccold treatment\u201d before U.S. apple shipments can be imported into  Mexico. Additionally, Mexico required that the Mexican government  inspect and certify U.S. storage and treatment facilities. The treatment and  inspection process increased U.S. producers\u2019 cost of exporting apples to  Mexico. In 1998, Mexico turned over supervision of the inspection program  to USDA. Nevertheless, according to the U.S. Apple Association, some  apple-producing states have been effectively shut out of the Mexican apple  market because of the prohibitive treatment and certification costs.

In Mexico, the different cuts of beef  generally all have the same value, whereas in the United States different  cuts of beef have different values. These different values have led to  antidumping cases against the United States because any commodity that  sells for less than the value of the product in the home country is  considered dumping. According to the National Cattlemen\u2019s Beef  Association representative, demand for variety meats (such as tripe and  liver) is significantly higher in Mexico than it is in the United States.

Prior to NAFTA,  Mexico restricted access to its corn market through import licensing  requirements, and there was no guaranteed level of access for U.S. imports.  During NAFTA negotiations, it was widely believed in Mexico that  immediate increases in imports of U.S. corn would displace Mexican corn  producers.

For example, in the early 1990\u2019s, Mexico lifted a  ban on using corn to feed livestock, which immediately increased demand  for imports of yellow corn from the United States, which had been  declining for several years. In 2003, yellow feed corn exports comprised  more than 80 percent of U.S. corn exports to Mexico. Additionally, in the  years following NAFTA, Mexico has usually allowed higher levels of  imports than are required under the NAFTA TRQs in order to ensure that  domestic demand for corn is fully met. Thus, Mexico has generally applied  much lower tariffs on these additional quantities than those set forth under  the agreement. These more liberal market access policies for yellow (feed)  corn imports are driven in part by a need to provide feed for Mexico\u2019s  expanding livestock industries. Notwithstanding these policies toward feed  corn imports, a USDA analysis of Mexico\u2019s corn market notes that imports  of white corn (i.e., corn generally used directly for human consumption)  from the United States have declined since 2000, partly because the  Mexican government has provided marketing funds to domestic producers  of white corn.

Under  NAFTA, Mexico agreed to phase out rice tariffs over a 9-year period, with  all tariffs to be eliminated by 2003. With the phasing out of tariffs on rice,  the volume of U.S. exports has increased by an average of 14.4 percent  annually from 1994 to 2003 (see fig. 9). U.S. rice exports to Mexico  accounted for 17.7 percent of U.S. rice exports worldwide, and exports to  Mexico totaled about $140 million in 2003.", "In December 2000, Mexico initiated an antidumping investigation on  imports of long-grain milled rice from the United States. Mexican rice  millers (who process rice that competes with U.S. milled rice imports)  alleged that U.S. milled rice is being sold in Mexico at a prices less that its  fair market value. The Mexican government subsequently levied  antidumping duties in April 2000 and June 2002 on specific U.S. rice  imports. A U.S. rice industry representative told us that the U.S. rice  industry attempted to resolve the issue through the industry-to-industry  negotiations but that the negotiations were unsuccessful. Following the  industry negotiations, the United States formally requested WTO  consultations with Mexico in June 2003. These consultations were held  from July 31 through August 1, 2003, on the basis of concerns regarding  Mexico\u2019s methodology for determining injury to the domestic market and  for calculating dumping margins. WTO consultations failed to resolve the  issue, and in February 2004 a WTO dispute panel was formed to resolve the  case. The U.S. rice industry representative said that several other U.S.  commodity groups were supporting this case in the WTO because the case  deals with broad issues related to Mexico\u2019s application of the antidumping  law that could affect their exports as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Status and Future Challenges", "paragraphs": ["A ruling on the WTO dispute is expected in April 2005.

The three main support programs implemented since  the early 1990s are PROCAMPO, marketing support, and Alianza.", "PROCAMPO (Programa de Apoyos Directos al Campo)", "Budget: PROCAMPO is the largest agricultural support program,  accounting for 35 percent of Mexico\u2019s Agriculture Ministry\u2019s (SAGARPA)  budget in 2003, around $1.27 billion.", "Goal: PROCAMPO is a 15-year program that provides transitional  income support to Mexican agriculture as it undergoes structural  changes in response to market conditions and the phasing out of trade  barriers under NAFTA. The political objective is to manage the  acceptability of the free trade agreement among farmers and to prevent  extensive levels of poverty and out-migration.", "How it operates: The program makes payments on a per-hectare basis to  any producer who cultivates a licit crop on eligible land or utilizes that  land for livestock or forestry production or some ecological project.  Eligible land is defined as that which has been cultivated with corn,  sorghum, beans, wheat, barley, cotton, safflower, soybeans, or rice in  any of the three agricultural cycles before August 1993. There are three  types of PROCAMPO payments: preferential, traditional, and  capitalized. Preferential payment is for producers with fewer than 5  hectares in nonirrigated lands who only produce in the spring-summer  cycle. For the spring-summer 2003 agricultural cycle, the payment levels  equaled 1,050 Mexican pesos ($100) per hectare. The traditional  payment is for the rest of the producers. It was 905 pesos ($86) per  hectare in 2003. The capitalized payment is made under certain  conditions to producers who request the sum of their future  PROCAMPO payments.", "Beneficiaries: During 2001, 2.7 million producers with a total of 13.4  million hectares received PROCAMPO payments. Around 75 percent of  farmers in the PROCAMPO database have less than 5 hectares of land.", "Changes in the program: There was a proposal in November 2002, as  part of a broader Mexican government initiative for rural support, to  update the payments according to yields. However, this action was  never put into practice. Another program will be created for producers  who are not currently registered in PROCAMPO, who also may be  considered for assistance to smooth out income fluctuations. Also, the  National Agreement\u2019s emergency spending proposal contains 650  million pesos ($62 million) for the inclusion of additional land on the  PROCAMPO roster. According to Mexican officials, even where there  are new producers enrolling, the total benefiting area has not changed  because those new producers are filling the place left by former  producers whose lands are no longer eligible to receive support.", "Impact: PROCAMPO has become an important source of some rural  households\u2019 income, and it may have income multiplier effects when  recipients put the money they receive to work to generate further  income. The Mexican government reported that between 1989 and 2002  incomes from agricultural businesses have lost importance, while other  sources, such as government support programs, remittances, salaries,  and wages, have increased their share in rural households\u2019 income.  Scholars have found payment from PROCAMPO has forestalled the  income decline of subsistence farmers. In addition, scholars found that  payment from PROCAMPO generated an income multiplier effect,  which meant that the PROCAMPO payment was used productively and  generated additional income for rural households. However, scholars  believe that the level of payment from PROCAMPO was not large  enough to offset the risks of switching to more profitable crops, which is  part of the goals of the marketing support program (discussed below).", "Marketing Support and Regional Market Development Program (Programa  de Apoyos Directos al Productor por Excedentes de Comercializaci\u00f3n para  Reconversi\u00f3n Productiva, Integraci\u00f3n de Cadenas Agroalimentarias y  Atenci\u00f3n a Factores Cr\u00edticos, formerly Programa de Apoyos a la  Comercializaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo de Mercados Regionales)", "Budget: The marketing support program is the second largest  agricultural program. Marketing Support and Regional Market  Development Program accounts for about 16 percent of SAGARPA\u2019s  budget. For 2003, the budget was around $580 million.", "Goal: The program supports various aspects of agro-marketing and  commerce. The Agricultural Marketing Board (ASERCA) was created to  substitute the traditional direct intervention that the government  formerly made through a parastatal state trading enterprise for sorghum  and wheat.", "How it operates: The program has seven subprograms: (1) direct  payment to producers, (2) price supports, (3) collateral loans, (4) crop  conversion, (5) other types of support, (6) slaughter house certification,  and (7) special support for corn. The major subprogram is the direct  payment to producers. This program provides payments to producers of  rice, corn, wheat, sorghum, barley, canola, copra, peanuts, cotton, and  safflower in certain areas, usually on a per-ton basis.", "Beneficiaries: Beneficiaries of the marketing support program on  average have more land than PROCAMPO payment recipients.  According to Mexican government documents, around 22 percent of the  respondents to its annual survey of the marketing support program have  fewer than 5 hectares, while almost half have more than 15 hectares. In  2004, the program supported 240,000 producers.", "Changes in the program: In 2003, Mexican farmers asked for support  that would \u201cmirror\u201d what was provided U.S. farmers under the U.S.  Farm Bill, which led the Mexican government to establish \u201ctarget  income\u201d support. The new program has seven subprograms including  direct payments for (1) target income, (2) slaughtering in certified  slaughter houses, (3) accessing domestic forages, (4) crop conversion,  (5) price hedging, (6) pledging, and (7) other specified activities.  Additionally, barley, copra, and peanuts are no longer on support list.  For a period of 5 years, the government plans to guarantee a target  income, expressed per ton, for producers of certain grains and oilseeds.  Nearly 17 billion Mexican pesos ($1.6 billion) have been designated for  this program. In determining whether a producer has reached the target  income, the government evaluates a producer\u2019s income from selling on  the market, and if the income from selling on the market falls short of  the target income, the government will provide additional support to  ensure that farmers\u2019 incomes reach the set target. Under the former  program, just a few states were able to request support, while the new  program makes payments to producers with commercial surpluses in all  states.", "Impact: The program has had an impact on crop patterns and migration.", "The \u201ctarget price\u201d program has led to concentration in basic crop  production instead of crop diversification. Mexican officials hope the  new \u201ctarget income\u201d approach will help farmers to be more responsive  to the market conditions. A Mexican official document points out that  the program is an important factor in mitigating migration from the  countryside, but the document also recognizes that the program did not  succeed in integrating farmers into the marketing chain. Thirty percent  of the respondents to the program annual survey said they would have  sought employment somewhere else if they had not received this  assistance. A USDA study of grain production finds that the marketing  supports, along with the constitutional reforms that allow the rental of  ejidal lands, have facilitated the emergence of large-scale farms of corn  and dried beans.", "Alianza (Alianza para el Campo)", "Budget: Alianza accounts for about 15 percent of SAGARPA\u2019s budget,  about $570 million in 2003.", "Goal: The goals of the programs are to boost agricultural productivity  and promote the transition to higher value crops. The objectives include  increasing producer income, improving the balance of trade, achieving  an agricultural production growth rate higher than the population  growth rate, and supporting the overall development of rural  communities.", "How it operates: The programs were grouped under four categories:  agriculture, livestock, phytosanitary, and technology transfers. Activities  include better use of water and fertilizer, adoption of improved seeds,  better disease and pest control practices, improved genetic quality of  crops and livestock, improved cattle stocks, better health and sanitation  practices, and pasture development and related infrastructure  development for increased production. These programs are  decentralized and are financed jointly by federal and state governments  and producers.", "Beneficiaries: The evaluation done by the United Nations Food and  Agriculture Organization (FAO) found that the program serves farmers  with various socio-economic backgrounds, educational levels, ages,  farm size, and income levels. The FAO evaluation also found that  medium size producers have benefited the most from the agriculture  program, and 24 percent of small farmers have benefited.", "Changes: In 2002, for the first time, general objectives were established  for all the sub programs. These objectives are to (1) increase income, (2)  diversify employment options, (3) increase investment in rural  development, (4) strengthen producer group organizations, and (5)  advance sanitary standards. To achieve these objectives, strategies were  established to integrate standards, bring together regional producer  groups, and discuss important issues such as land and water use. Also in  2002, there was recognition by the government of a need to transfer  technology and investment to the rural sector.", "Impact: The FAO evaluation pointed out some benefits from Alianza.", "For example, technology helped certain areas get access to water.  Alianza also created a forum to consolidate processes of participation  and implementation of different policies for the agricultural sector,  allowing the participation of the state and producers in the  conversation.

For  a full list and descriptions of FSIS activities, see table 9.", "In its efforts to protect U.S. consumers, FDA has also undertaken activities  that benefit Mexican agricultural producers. FDA\u2019s approach has been to  work with Mexican government agencies to help them establish effective  food safety regulatory, inspection, and enforcement infrastructure,  focusing particularly on microbiological hazards. For example, if a food- borne disease outbreak resulting from a Mexican import occurs, FDA  determines the cause and works with the Mexican government to try and  resolve the problem and develop a system to prevent future outbreaks.  FDA officials explained that in 1997 their agency launched its Food Safety  Initiative (FSI) to improve the safety of the U.S. food supply, which  includes imported foods. Because Mexico exports around $3 billion in  fruits and vegetables to the United States each year, an important FSI  component has been to help Mexican commodity exporters become more  familiar with FDA regulatory requirements and to improve their ability to  comply with U.S. food safety regulations. FDA activities under FSI have  basically involved a series of training programs since 2002 for Mexican fruit  and vegetable exporters, academics, and government officials. In addition  to activities under FSI, FDA established the Southwest Import District  Office in 1999 to enhance food inspection activities along the Mexican  border. The Southwest Import District inspects imported goods entering  the United States through the Mexican Border from Brownsville, Texas, to  San Diego, California.

For example, FAS arranged for USAID to use  its U.S. fellowship program to place one of its participants at Financiera  Rural. Through this fellowship, Financiera Rural hosted a professor from  the University of Minnesota who assisted the agency in developing a  strategic plan to incorporate the new paradigm for rural development  proposed in the P4P conferences, acknowledging that Financiera Rural is  better suited to operate as a second-tier lender. This strategic plan calls for  the development of rural financial lending intermediaries in Mexico, which  will be fostered using a model that complies with Mexico\u2019s legal  framework, determined by a study to be conducted jointly by the  Financiera Rural and the International Development Bank. The new  strategic plan also calls for the agency to fund any productive endeavor in  the countryside, not only agricultural production. Activities could include  such things as eco-tourism, rural gas stations, and transportation services.  According to Financiera Rural officials, the guidance provided by the  USAID fellow has positively contributed to Financiera Rural operations  because funding and access to these types of resources and knowledge are  not otherwise available in Mexico.

OPIC\u2019s mission is to help U.S. businesses invest  overseas, to foster economic development in new and emerging markets,  and to complement the private sector in managing the risks associated with  foreign direct investment. According to OPIC officials, for over 30 years  there had been resistance by the Mexican government to allow the agency  to operate in Mexico because of concerns over sovereignty. Mexico did not  want a U.S. government agency to provide loans in Mexico because that  would mean that the agency could ask for collateral and possibly own  Mexican property in the case of default on a loan. However, in 2003, an  agreement was reached through P4P to allow OPIC to operate in Mexico.", "Since the bilateral agreement was signed, OPIC has begun to provide  financing for five projects in Mexico, including one related to agriculture.
