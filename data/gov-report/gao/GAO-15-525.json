These challenges pertain to three key areas. First, NNSA may not have a sufficient supply of lithium material for defense program requirements. NNSA officials told GAO in April 2015 that, due to additional recent increases in demand, its supply of currently qualified lithium\u2014lithium approved for use in weapon systems in refurbishment\u2014will run out by 2018 without additional actions. Second, at NNSA's Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where lithium production operations are conducted, the existing lithium production facility and equipment are at risk of catastrophic failure. In March 2014, for example, a 300-pound slab of concrete fell from the ceiling into an active work area (this area is no longer in use). Third, fiscal constraints could cause delays in the construction of a new lithium production facility. NNSA, in its lithium production strategy, also identifies various actions that it could take to mitigate these challenges\u2014including procuring lithium from outside sources and outsourcing certain aspects of the lithium production process. However, the mitigating actions are in early stages of development, and may bring additional challenges.", "In developing and implementing its lithium production strategy, NNSA did not develop a mission need statement that is fully independent of a particular solution, contrary to the agency directive on Program and Project Management for the Acquisition of Capital Assets, which governs the design and construction of new facilities (DOE Order 413.3B). According to this directive, the mission need statement should be independent of a particular solution, and it should not be defined by the equipment, facility, technological solution, or physical end-item. This allows the program office responsible for the capital asset project to explore a variety of alternatives. In January 2015, NNSA program officials submitted a mission need statement for lithium production for approval to the Deputy Administrator for Defense Programs, NNSA. It was approved on June 10, 2015. The mission need statement included, among other things, a description of the capability gap, alternatives for addressing its mission need\u2014such as building a new facility, leasing off-site facilities, or outsourcing lithium processing\u2014and estimated cost and schedule ranges. However, the document expresses the capability gap in terms of a particular solution\u2014specifically, a new facility. For example, it includes multiple references to an alternative facility to replace the existing facility, suggesting that NNSA gave preference to building a new facility. In addition, it did not include cost and schedule estimates for six of the seven alternatives presented in the mission need document. The mission need statement includes cost and schedule estimates only for the alternative of building a functioning facility at Y-12. NNSA officials told GAO that they plan to analyze other alternatives for meeting the mission need for lithium production. However, by seemingly giving preference to a particular solution in its mission need document, NNSA is not following DOE's project management order, which may preclude serious consideration of other potential viable alternatives. A mission need statement biased toward a particular solution may introduce bias into the rest of the analysis of alternatives process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NNSA objectively consider all alternatives, without preference for a particular solution, as it proceeds with its analysis of alternatives process.

The isotope  lithium-6 is a key component of nuclear weapons and is therefore  essential for the refurbishment of the nuclear weapons stockpile. Natural  lithium consists approximately of 7.5 percent of the isotope lithium-6 and  92.5 percent of the isotope lithium-7. NNSA\u2019s Y-12 National Security  Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, separated lithium-6 from lithium-7  using a process that required large quantities of mercury, and resulted in  worker exposure to mercury and environmental contamination, from 1954  through 1963.", "NNSA still has a large supply of lithium-6 in storage and in retired  weapons awaiting disassembly. NNSA relies on contractors to carry out  its lithium production operations at its Y-12 site. Since 1963, Y-12\u2019s  lithium production operations have relied on existing supplies of lithium-6.  Specifically, to produce lithium for NNSA\u2019s defense programs, Y-12  recovers lithium-6 from disassembled weapons, cleans it, and prepares  the cleaned lithium into forms suitable for refurbished weapons. Until May  2013, Y-12 relied on a cleaning process known as \u201cwet chemistry.\u201d Wet  chemistry involves purifying lithium from dismantled weapons and storing  it as lithium chloride. To be usable in refurbished weapons, the lithium  chloride must be converted first to lithium metal and then treated with  hydrogen gas to create lithium hydride or treated with deuterium gas to  create lithium deuteride. In May 2013, due to the deteriorating conditions  of NNSA\u2019s 72-year old lithium production facility at the Y-12 site (building  9204-2), Y-12 suspended its wet chemistry and conversion operations. In  doing so, Y-12 suspended its ability to convert the existing inventory of  lithium chloride into lithium usable for refurbished weapons.", "To meet lithium demand without its wet chemistry capabilities, Y-12  began in May 2013 to rely exclusively on a process known as Direct  Materials Manufacturing (DMM)\u2014which involves recycling lithium hydride  and deuteride directly from disassembled weapons and manually sanding  the outer layer of the lithium material to remove impurities. At the same  time, however, projected demand for lithium for use in refurbished  weapons tripled. As a result, according to a 2013 assessment, Y-12  concluded that it could run out of usable lithium by 2020 if it does not take  additional actions.", "In light of the deteriorating condition of building 9204-2, in August 2013,  NNSA\u2019s Y-12 contractor proposed a strategy for meeting lithium demand  that included, among other things, increased use of DMM in existing Y-12  facilities for lithium production through 2025. The strategy, according to Y- 12\u2019s proposal, called for the design and construction of a new lithium  production facility that would provide lithium production capabilities  beyond 2025. In a February 2014 memorandum from the Assistant  Deputy Administrator of Stockpile Management to the NNSA Production  Office Manager regarding \u201cLithium Production Capability and Supply,\u201d  NNSA committed to working with Y-12 to implement the strategy. In  January 2015, Y-12 finalized a \u201cLithium Materials Production Transition  Implementation Plan\u201d (Implementation Plan), which describes the major  elements of its lithium strategy\u2014particularly the \u201cbridging\u201d actions  required to meet lithium demand until a new lithium production facility is  operational.

Objectively analyzing alternatives helps ensure that the best alternative  that satisfies the mission need is chosen. According to Order 413.3B, the  mission need must be independent of a particular alternative, allowing the  program office responsible for the capital asset project to explore a  variety of alternatives. We previously found that DOE and NNSA officials  had acknowledged that unreliable analysis of alternatives is a risk factor  for major cost increases and schedule delays for NNSA projects.

NNSA\u2019s supply of currently  qualified lithium\u2014lithium approved for use in weapon systems in  refurbishment\u2014will run out by 2020, according to the lithium production  strategy. In April 2015, NNSA officials told us that due to additional recent  increases in demand, with no additional action to increase supply, this  date has moved to 2018. According to Y-12 officials, about 50 percent of  lithium is lost as machine dust in the machining process.

Because NNSA\u2019s  weapons dismantlement and disassembly decisions drive the  availability of source material for DMM, changes to the schedules  could impact the available supply of lithium. According to Y-12  documents, NNSA\u2019s decisions to hold certain weapons components  for eventual, but not immediate, reuse and to hold some in its  strategic reserve have decreased the amount of lithium material  available. We previously found that NNSA\u2019s retention of certain  weapons components and uncertain policy decisions regarding when  some will be released for disassembly pose challenges to Y-12\u2019s  ability to plan for future work. Y-12 officials told us that they estimate  future supply and base their planning on NNSA\u2019s dismantlement and  disassembly schedule.

Because source material  undergoing DMM is purified only through a surface cleaning (i.e.,  manual sanding and wiping), according to the lithium production  strategy, ensuring that the end product can be chemically certified\u2014 part of the qualification\u2014requires that the source material be selected  from a supply of recycled lithium components known to possess  sufficient chemical purity to meet specifications. In other words, not all  potential sources of lithium will be of sufficient purity or quality, which  may further reduce the available supply.", "Third, it is more time-consuming to qualify lithium under Y-12\u2019s current  cleaning process (DMM). According to Y-12 officials, qualifying lithium  produced through DMM is more rigorous and time-consuming  because the lithium source material recovered from each dismantled  weapon system must be qualified separately. In addition, the  feedstock\u2014cleaned lithium ready for machining\u2014must also be  qualified. In contrast, when source material is purified using wet  chemistry, the resulting feedstock is homogeneous and therefore the  source material and feedstock only have to be qualified once for use  in a given weapon system.", "According to NNSA officials, with no additional action to increase supply,  Y-12 may run out of qualified lithium by 2018.

For example, the document describes the primary  capability gap as the loss of Y-12\u2019s wet chemistry process due to the  degraded condition of building 9204-2. The mission need statement  details this gap in terms of functional and operational gaps, including (1)  the continued physical deterioration of the building where lithium  operations are being conducted and the resulting shortage of  components; (2) the continuous deterioration of mechanical and electrical  systems in the existing facility (building 9204-2), with increasing  unsustainable energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions, which will  affect controlled work environments, ongoing operations, and delivery of  mission work; (3) the inability to introduce new technologies into the  facility due to its degraded condition; and (4) the facility\u2019s noncompliance  with current codes. NNSA\u2019s mission need statement also characterizes  the capability gap in terms of demand for lithium but devotes most of the  mission need statement to describing the current condition of its existing  lithium production facility. According to the mission need statement,  specific lithium requirements are contained in the Fiscal Year 2015  Production and Planning Directive and the classified annexes of the  Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plans. This is the only  characterization in the mission need statement of the capability gap in  terms of demand for lithium. The remaining discussion describes the  capability gap in terms of the degraded condition of building 9204-2.  Order 413.3B and related guidance do not state that the capability gap  should be defined in terms of program requirements.", "NNSA\u2019s mission need statement lists seven alternatives for addressing its  mission need: do nothing, outsource the lithium processing capability, refurbish/repurpose one or more of the existing Y-12 facilities,  lease off-site suitable facilities,  secure third-party financing to build one or more new facilities,  consider new modular facilities to transfer missions from existing  facility or facilities that are beyond repair, and build a complete and functioning facility at Y-12.", "According to DOE Order 413.3B, the mission need should be  independent of a particular solution, and should not be defined by the  equipment, facility, technological solution, or physical end-item. In  addition, the DOE order states that the mission need should be described  in terms of the general parameters of the solution, how it fits within the  mission of the program, and why it is critical to the overall  accomplishment of the department\u2019s mission, including the benefits to be  realized. However, some of language used and information included in  NNSA\u2019s mission need statement suggests that NNSA may have given  preference to a single alternative\u2014building the Lithium Production  Capability facility at Y-12\u2014before identifying a mission need and  conducting an analysis of alternatives. For example, the section  describing the benefits from closing the capability gap includes phrases  such as, an alternative facility that is code compliant, and replacing the existing facilities with an alternative facility will  significantly improve NNSA\u2019s capability and efficiency in performing its  Stockpile Stewardship and other national security missions at Y-12.", "In addition, NNSA included in its mission need statement rough-order-of- magnitude estimates of the project cost and schedule ranges for only one  alternative\u2014build and equip a functioning facility at Y-12. According to its  mission need statement, NNSA estimates that construction of the new  facility will cost $302 million to $646 million (with $431 million \u201clikely\u201d) and  includes a schedule range estimate for project completion between fiscal  year 2024 and fiscal year 2026. Providing such estimates for only one  alternative is contrary to DOE guidance that states that a mission need  statement should provide a rough order of magnitude estimate of the  project cost and schedule ranges to acquire various capability alternatives  that address the stated mission need.", "NNSA officials said that they did not include cost and schedule estimates  for other alternatives because there is no DOE requirement to do so.  These officials acknowledged that DOE guidance states that a mission  need statement is to provide cost estimates for various alternatives, but  noted that this provision is not a requirement. NNSA officials noted that  they plan to analyze other alternatives for meeting the mission as part of  CD-1. However, because NNSA\u2019s mission need statement did not include  rough-order-of-magnitude estimates of the project cost and schedule  ranges for other alternatives, it appears to be biased toward a particular  solution and may introduce bias into the rest of the analysis of  alternatives process. This, in turn, could undermine the purpose of the CD  process: to help ensure that NNSA chooses the best alternative that  satisfies the mission need on the basis of selection criteria, such as  safety, cost, or schedule.", "Giving preference to a particular solution may exclude serious  consideration of other potential viable alternatives. In our December 2014  report on the analysis of alternatives process applied by NNSA, we found  that conducting such an analysis without a predetermined solution is a  best practice. In that report, DOE and NNSA officials acknowledged that  unreliable analysis of alternatives is a risk factor for major cost increases  and schedule delays for NNSA projects. We recommended that DOE  incorporate best practices into its analysis of alternatives requirements to  minimize the risk of developing unreliable analyses of alternatives and  incurring major cost increases and schedule delays on projects. DOE  agreed with our recommendation, but we noted in the report that DOE\u2019s  unspecified, open-ended date for responding to this recommendation may  have indicated a lack of urgency or concern about the need to implement  these recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We are encouraged that NNSA officials plan to analyze alternatives for  meeting the mission need for lithium production requirements as they  proceed with the conceptual design phase of their capital asset  acquisition process. However, by completing its preconceptual design  (CD-0) phase with a mission need statement that is not fully independent  of a particular solution, NNSA is not following DOE\u2019s project management  order and may limit objective consideration of the other six alternatives  identified for meeting mission requirements. Having prepared cost and  schedule estimate ranges for only one of the seven alternatives\u2014thus  demonstrating preference for that alternative\u2014may affect the rest of  NNSA\u2019s analysis of alternatives process.

We did not conclude  that NNSA would not conduct an analysis of alternatives, but that its  mission need statement for lithium production was not fully independent  of a particular solution, and that demonstrating preference for one  alternative\u2014a replacement facility for lithium production\u2014may affect the  rest of NNSA\u2019s analysis of alternatives process and could potentially  undermine NNSA\u2019s ability to choose the best alternative that satisfies the  mission need.
