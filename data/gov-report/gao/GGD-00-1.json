The concern centered on frontline enforcement employees who have face-to-face dealings with taxpayers during the potentially confrontational process of assessing and collecting taxes. In response, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is seeking to transform the agency\u2019s culture to one that more fully embraces customer service as a core organizational value. The Commissioner began this transformation by replacing IRS\u2019 old mission statement, which emphasized collecting the proper tax at the least cost, with a new one, which emphasizes providing world-class customer service by helping taxpayers understand and meet their tax responsibilities and applying the tax law with integrity and fairness. IRS has begun a number of long-range initiatives to make the new mission statement a reality, including developing new organizational performance measures and revamping the overall performance management system.", "In light of this, you asked us to review the extent to which the current employee evaluation system can support the new mission statement during the period IRS will need to revamp its performance management system. Specifically, the objectives for this report are to (1) determine the relative emphasis on revenue production, efficiency, and customer service in enforcement employees\u2019 annual written evaluations; (2) identify features of the evaluation process that might be used to greater advantage to reinforce the importance of customer service; and (3) describe IRS initiatives to promote customer service, including those to encourage enforcement employees to be taxpayer oriented. To address these issues, we analyzed a representative sample of the two most recent enforcement employee evaluations prepared under IRS\u2019 old mission statement for the period ending June 1998. Thus, our results are most appropriately used as baseline data for determining the degree to which supervisors might need to change the way they prepare employee evaluations under the current process to better reflect IRS\u2019 new mission."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The employee evaluation process is an important tool for influencing employee behavior. At IRS, as in other federal agencies, employee evaluations are the official documents used to support many personnel actions, including within-grade pay increases, performance awards, promotions, reductions-in-force, and adverse performance-based actions. As stated in IRS documents, the process is intended to accurately reflect employees\u2019 performance, facilitate their development, and improve and enhance their work.", "For enforcement (and most other IRS) employees, the evaluation process is to include an annual formal written evaluation and a midyear progress review. The annual written evaluation involves a quantitative assessment of performance, which may be supported by narrative commentary. Supervisors who complete the evaluations are to address how well employees perform a number of critical job elements, which are job skills that must be performed at or above a set standard for an employee\u2019s performance to be judged acceptable. The critical elements include technical skills\u2014the specialized skills needed to process cases, such as workload management and case analysis\u2014as well as customer relations, which involves interpersonal skills in dealing with taxpayers.", "The number of critical job elements on which an enforcement employee is evaluated generally has ranged from five to seven, depending on his or her job classification (e.g., tax auditor, revenue officer, or revenue agent). Each element is rated on a 5-point scale, with 1 being unacceptable and 5 being outstanding. A score of 3 is to be given for performance deemed fully successful. The evaluation forms for the types of enforcement employees we reviewed have similar formats and critical job elements, as the examples shown in appendix II illustrate. Progress reviews are also required, preferably at midyear, and are to be communicated by supervisors to each of their employees.", "IRS policy imposes several additional requirements. Notably, the supervisor who is responsible for assigning an employee\u2019s work is also responsible for preparing and signing his or her evaluation. The evaluation must be reviewed, approved, and signed by a higher level manager. And to help ensure the accuracy and fairness of the rating, the supervisor who prepares the evaluation is to observe the performance of the employee during the rating period.", "In evaluating employee performance, supervisors are to exercise caution when describing employees\u2019 skills and contributions vis-a-vis revenue production and efficiency, so as not to improperly emphasize the accomplishment of statistical or numerical goals. IRS policy prohibits rating officials from using enforcement statistics, such as the average amount of taxes assessed or collected, in employee evaluations. However, during hearings held by the Senate Committee on Finance in September 1997, witnesses alleged that IRS\u2019 focus on enforcement statistics at the organizational level was encouraging enforcement officers to take unnecessary and inappropriate enforcement actions against taxpayers.IRS\u2019 Internal Audit subsequently reviewed the use of such statistics by examination and collection supervisors and found an atmosphere largely driven by statistical measures. In November 1998, we reported that 75 percent of revenue agents, tax auditors, and revenue officers believed that enforcement results affected their evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet our reporting objectives, we reviewed the two most recent evaluations for each employee as of June 1998 in a statistically representative sample of 19,096 examination and collection frontline employees and the supplemental documentation supporting those evaluations.

We also interviewed responsible IRS headquarters officials and 30 supervisors in 3 district offices and sent division chiefs in all 33 IRS district offices a survey on how supervisors allocated their time.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.

Looking only at the comments in the technical skill portion of the evaluations, comments on revenue production and efficiency outnumbered customer service by about four to one. Of the comments in the customer relations element, we estimate that about three-fourths related to customer service and one-fourth to revenue production and efficiency.", "In considering these results, it is important to point out that, to some extent, the design of IRS\u2019 employee evaluations for enforcement personnel could lead supervisors to focus on revenue production and efficiency. This is because customer relations is only one of five or more equally weighted critical job elements upon which employees are evaluated. Because the other, more technical elements logically tend to involve considerations of revenue production and efficiency, the evaluation likely would focus on such issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments on Customer Service Did Not Emphasize the Importance of the Taxpayers\u2019 Point of View and Understanding", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis also revealed that, overall, many of the customer service comments did not emphasize the importance of taking into account the taxpayers\u2019 point of view or whether they understood the tax issues being raised by the enforcement employee. To illustrate, consider the following results on comments regarding employees\u2019 assistance in helping taxpayers to better understand their tax issues. As shown in table 2, an estimated 53 percent of the employees received evaluations discussing their efforts to describe the law and regulations related to the examination and collection process to the taxpayer. An estimated 4 percent received evaluations discussing efforts to check on taxpayers\u2019 understanding of these issues by asking taxpayers questions or soliciting their responses. Both approaches can improve taxpayer understanding. However, the latter approach\u2014and comments as to its use or lack thereof\u2014can also help reinforce the importance of targeting explanations to the needs of the taxpayer.", "Most of the comments regarding whether the employee applied the tax law with integrity and fairness also did not reflect the taxpayer\u2019s point of view.", "As shown in table 3, an estimated 31 percent of the employees had comments in their evaluations discussing whether the employee balanced taxpayer\u2019s interests with the government\u2019s interests by listening to and considering the taxpayer\u2019s position. Comments that were more reflective of the taxpayer\u2019s point of view, such as whether the employee considered a variety of actions to try to meet taxpayer needs, such as proposing an installment agreement to meet the tax liability, or took proactive action, such as identifying tax credits or deductions the taxpayer was entitled to, were each made for about 6 percent of the employees.", "As shown in table 4, an estimated 38 percent of the employees received evaluations indicating that they listened to taxpayers, and 32 percent received evaluations indicating that they were courteous with taxpayers. \u201cOver the last year the Service is emphasizing payments be obtained at the conclusion of the examination. It can truly be said that the agent has kept to this philosophy. The agent always seeks to obtain full payment of the deficiency, penalties, and interest. This shows a strong commitment to the Service programs.\u201d", "Further, the above comment was contained in the narrative for the customer relations critical job element and seems to equate good customer relations with success in obtaining full payment in every case. \u201cYou set clear, reasonable deadlines and follow-up on them promptly, usually with an appropriate collection tool rather than a phone call. Your success in that regard is referenced above. During the selection of cases for one entity review it was noted that 84% of your inventory was less than 5 months old. On another it was noted that only 4 of your cases had been assigned for longer than six months.\u201d", "While this discussion of the employee\u2019s performance may be appropriate, it was not balanced with statements indicating the employee considered the taxpayer\u2019s circumstances when setting deadlines and taking follow-up actions.", "Although the employee\u2019s actions from the perspective of revenue production and efficiency may warrant discussion, given IRS\u2019 new mission statement, these comments logically would need to be balanced with comments on the employee\u2019s action from the perspective of customer service.

An additional estimated 12 percent of employees received an evaluation that duplicated the narratives from the prior year, sometimes repeated word-for-word.

Table 5 shows the extent of missing and duplicate narratives.", "According to the examination and collection division chiefs who completed our survey in IRS\u2019 33 district offices, enforcement supervisors have an average of 12 employees that they supervise. To reduce the administrative burden associated with completing the evaluations, IRS and NTEU agreed that supervisors could omit narratives from evaluations under two circumstances. Supervisors can omit all narratives for employees who have earned the same numerical rating in every critical job element as the prior year. In these cases, supervisors may revalidate the prior evaluation without having to prepare a new evaluation. Also, supervisors are allowed to omit narratives for critical job elements when employees receive a numerical rating of either 5 (outstanding) or 4 (exceeds fully successful) for those elements, and the numerical rating is the same as or higher than the prior year\u2019s rating.

All but one of these supervisors we talked to indicated that direct observation of employees was the best method for evaluating customer service skills. However, 25 of the 30 supervisors said that they did not have time to spend in the field with their employees and also complete their other supervisory and administrative responsibilities. The supervisors\u2019 administrative burden and its effect on supervisors\u2019 ability to manage their employees was also raised in a 1991 nationwide IRS survey of revenue officer supervisors and more recently by the Professional Managers Association. In a December 17, 1998, message to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the association stated, \u201cOne of the major concerns of frontline managers is the excessive administrative burden placed on them.\u201d", "Supervisors we interviewed suggested several options that would give them more time to spend in the field with their employees and on other employee evaluation activities. These options included reducing their administrative duties, providing clerical staff to take over some of their administrative duties, and reducing the number of employees that report to them.

IRS has also taken several interim actions to promote customer service in evaluating enforcement employees.", "IRS\u2019 new strategic goals are intended to promote customer service by (1) providing service to each taxpayer by such means as being prompt, professional, and helpful to taxpayers when additional taxes may be due; (2) providing service to all taxpayers by such means as increasing the fairness of compliance; and (3) increasing productivity by providing a quality work environment for employees.", "To evaluate how well it is achieving these new goals, IRS has also developed new organizational performance measures that are intended to balance customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and business results. Customer satisfaction is to be measured through written or telephone surveys to obtain taxpayers\u2019 perceptions of how they were treated by IRS employees during interactions. Employee satisfaction is to be measured through annual employee surveys of work environment satisfaction. The quality aspects of business results are to be measured through samples of completed cases taken under its various operational quality review programs, while the quantity aspects are to be based on data collected on such outcome-neutral items as the number of cases handled. IRS is in the process of providing training to supervisors and employees on the new balanced measures, which emphasizes customer service.", "IRS also intends to revamp its entire performance management system as required by the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. Performance management systems are broad systems for managing employee behavior that incorporate the evaluation process and other managerial actions. Office of Personnel Management regulations define performance management as the integrated processes agencies use to (1) communicate and clarify organizational goals, (2) identify accountability for accomplishing organizational goals, (3) identify and address developmental needs, (4) assess and improve performance, (5) measure performance for recognizing and rewarding accomplishments, and (6) prepare appraisals.", "It is difficult to determine when IRS\u2019 new system would become fully operational. As we have reported, IRS faces formidable challenges to achieve this and other reforms related to its ongoing modernization efforts. As we noted, IRS is attempting to implement all of the reforms in a comprehensive, rather than sequential, fashion. The integrated approach that IRS is using makes sense and has the potential to significantly improve the way IRS interacts with taxpayers. However, it also presents a significant challenge. At the same time IRS is attempting to reform its performance management system, it also is striving to revamp its business practices, restructure its organization, and implement new technology. Effectively implementing such a broad and complex set of interdependent changes will strain IRS\u2019 management capacity. Having to make the transition while continuing to operate the existing tax administration process will strain the agency further. These factors and IRS\u2019 poor track record for implementing reforms suggest that it could be years before a new performance management system is fully operational.", "IRS recognizes that revamping its performance management system is a major effort. With respect to enforcement employees in particular, IRS has recognized that the evaluation process is an important part of any performance management system and may be a key to improving customer service. In laying out its long-term strategy for creating a customer- oriented work force, IRS has identified the need for change in the evaluation process for enforcement and other employees so that supervisors communicate what constitutes good customer service, ensure that employees adopt the new desired behaviors, and assess and develop employees\u2019 customer service skills. IRS has also recognized that short- term improvements in employees\u2019 customer service are needed and has advised managers to think of ways they could begin fostering the new orientation.", "IRS has incorporated into the evaluation process a new performance standard relating to the fair and equitable treatment of taxpayers that employees must meet at a passing level to retain their jobs. The retention standard, which was required by the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, says that employees must \u201cAdminister the tax laws fairly and equitably, protect all taxpayers\u2019 rights, and treat each taxpayer ethically with honesty, integrity, and respect.\u201d When evaluating employees, supervisors are to first determine whether the employee met the retention standard and, if the employee did, then proceed to evaluate the employee on the critical job elements. IRS officials expect that most employees will meet the retention standard.", "The new retention standard was put in place in July 1999. IRS issued guidance on how managers were to implement the retention standard. The guidance included examples of behaviors that would meet the standard and those that would not. Supervisors were also instructed to develop other examples of behavior tailored to their employees\u2019 occupations. By July 31, 1999, supervisors were to have held individual or group meetings with their employees to discuss how employees would be evaluated under the standard.", "In addition, the Collection Division has taken two steps to restructure its evaluation system for revenue officers to better reflect the increased value that IRS now places on customer service. The division has (1) revised its standard position description for revenue officers and (2) reduced the number of critical job elements for revenue officers from five to three. The three revised critical job elements of customer relations and assistance, case resolution, and case management take the place of time and workload management, case decisions, investigation and analysis, accounts maintenance, and customer relations.", "The revised elements became effective in July 1999. The guidance issued to IRS district collection officials on implementing the revised elements is not as comprehensive as the guidance issued for the new retention standard. The guidance instructs supervisors to meet with their employees to discuss the revised position description and critical job elements. It does not, however, explain or provide examples of how the revised elements are to be incorporated into the evaluation process or to be used to evaluate revenue officers.", "In a related effort, the Examination Division was exploring the extent to which critical job elements for revenue agents should reflect IRS\u2019 auditing standards. By linking the critical job elements with the auditing standards, the Examination Division hoped to reduce the number of standards supervisors must refer to when evaluating employee performance.

He said IRS is developing a Manager\u2019s Guide to Performance Management that would provide detailed information on the entire appraisal process, including monitoring and evaluating employee performance. He said that the guide, which is expected to be issued in October 1999, would specifically address the conditions under which managers should provide a narrative for critical job elements and conduct field visits. He also stated that mandatory mid- year progress reviews are to be conducted.", "The Commissioner did not specifically say if he would enforce existing agency policies requiring supervisors to review a sample of employees\u2019 caseloads.  However, he stated that current IRS procedures require periodic reviews of employees\u2019 caseloads, which we interpret to mean the current requirement for annually reviewing a sample of employees\u2019 caseloads will be enforced. As our report points out, case reviews are important for determining whether employees\u2019 case decisions were made in accordance with agency policies and procedures.", "The Commissioner stated that IRS plans to discuss with NTEU representatives our recommendation that more comprehensive guidance on the revised critical job elements be provided to Collection supervisors. He stated that the revised critical job elements represent a reordering of previous job elements under the current appraisal system and that IRS worked closely with NTEU to define the features of this appraisal system. Therefore, IRS plans to collaboratively work with NTEU to develop any additional guidance regarding incorporating the revised elements for revenue officers into the evaluation process.  We believe that this is an appropriate approach to take. Our recommendation is based on the premise that customer service starts with the frontline employees, who need to know what IRS expects, and that supervisors are a key link in explaining those expectations.

For comments on revenue production, we included comments such as those discussing (1) dollars assessed or collected by the employee, (2) number of cases in which the taxpayer agreed with IRS\u2019 assessment, or (3) use of collection tools by the employee to secure payment from the taxpayer. For comments on efficiency, we included comments such as those discussing (1) timeliness and output, such as the number of overage cases, which are cases that have been in inventory for more than a certain length of time, and (2) the average number of hours needed to complete work on a return.", "For customer service comments, we included comments on the extent to which the employee (1) helped taxpayers to understand and meet their tax responsibilities and (2) applied the law with integrity and fairness.

To strengthen our understanding of how supervisors allocated their time, we interviewed 30 supervisors from the Northern California, Kansas-Missouri, and Georgia District Offices, which we chose because of their proximity to our offices, and sent a survey to examination and collection division chiefs in IRS\u2019 33 district offices.", "To obtain data describing any IRS initiatives to promote customer service, we interviewed IRS headquarters officials, attended IRS training sessions introducing IRS\u2019 new initiatives, and reviewed draft documents describing the new initiatives.", "Our review was subject to some limitations. Our choice of evaluative statements as supporting revenue production, efficiency, and customer service, and our analysis of supervisors\u2019 written comments required us to make judgments that were, in part, subjective.

You have maintained a vigorous program of appropriate enforcement with many seizures resulting in full payment and some others going to Chapter 11. These have included restaurants, an attorney\u2019s office, a bakery, a social club and several vehicles.\u201d \u201cYou set clear, reasonable deadlines and follow-up on them promptly, usually with an appropriate collection tool rather than a phone call. Your success in that regard is referenced above. During the selection of cases for one entity review it was noted that 84% of your inventory was less than 5 months old. On another it was noted that only 4 of your cases had been assigned for longer than six months.\u201d \u201cOn another case, she found that the taxpayers had no mortgage on their home, she dealt with the taxpayers and convinced them that they needed to take out a mortgage. They took out that mortgage and fullpayed the liability.\u201d \u201cYour case files show that you consistently demand full payment, warn T/Ps  of enforcement and document Publication 1. receipt. Taxpayers\u2019 rights are fully observed with respect to lien filing and final notice issuance before levy. During the year you have had frequent enforcement activity with BMF  cases . . .. The fact that so many of these led to full payment is indicative of your proper direction and refusal to accept less.

The customer relation aspects of the -A- and -B- case examinations are significant. The examinations were conducted in a timely manner with documented efforts to maintain the forward momentum of the examinations.
