In addition, experts and research have reported that nursing home staff levels, particularly low staff levels, lead to higher antipsychotic drug use.", "Agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have taken several actions to address antipsychotic drug use by older adults in nursing homes, as described in HHS's National Alzheimer's Plan; however, none have been directed to settings outside of nursing homes, such as assisted living facilities or individuals' homes. While the National Alzheimer's Plan has a goal to improve dementia care for all individuals regardless of residence, HHS officials said that efforts to reduce antipsychotic use have not focused on care settings outside nursing homes, though HHS has done work to support family caregivers in general.

Furthermore, RAND  estimated that dementia costs will more than double by 2040 due to the  aging of the American population. While dementia is most commonly  associated with a decline in memory, it can also cause changes in mood  or personality, loss of communication, and, at times, agitation or  aggression. These behavioral symptoms can become challenging for  caregivers, both at home and in institutions such as nursing homes. To  manage these behaviors, antipsychotic drugs are sometimes prescribed.

Another industry  group attributed the actual prescribing of antipsychotic drugs to hospital  care culture and stated that the prescribing of antipsychotics is a common  practice in hospitals for treating individuals with dementia. A research  study that examined the medical charts of 73 residents in seven nursing  homes found 84 percent of the residents that had been admitted to the  nursing home from the hospital were admitted on at least one  psychoactive medication\u2014including antipsychotics.", "Finally, experts we spoke with indicated that caregivers\u2019 frustration with  the behavior of individuals with dementia can lead to requests for  antipsychotic drugs. For example, an advocacy group we spoke with  mentioned that a caregiver may request an antipsychotic drug for an  individual with dementia in an effort to keep them in the home. The  individual with dementia may not recognize their relative, which can  cause them agitation. To keep the individual calm so that they can stay in  the home and not be placed in a nursing home, an antipsychotic  medication may be prescribed. Representatives from another provider  group explained that when an individual with dementia has an unmet  need, they may also appear to be in distress, which may cause the  caregiver to become frustrated because they do not know how to relieve  this distress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS Agencies\u2019 Actions Focused on Reducing Antipsychotic Drug Use by Older Adults with Dementia Target Nursing Home Residents, Not Those in Other Settings", "paragraphs": ["HHS agencies, including CMS, AHRQ, and NIH, have taken actions to  address antipsychotic drug use by older adults with dementia in nursing  homes.

CMS used  publicly reported measures from the Nursing Home Compare website to  track the progress of the National Partnership and, according to officials,  to reach out to those states and individual facilities with high prescribing  rates. In the fourth quarter of 2011, which was deemed the baseline,   23.8 percent of long-stay nursing home residents nationwide were  prescribed an antipsychotic drug. While the National Partnership did not  reach its target reduction in 2012, by the end of 2013 the national use  rate decreased to 20.2 percent, a 15.1 percent reduction. The majority  of states showed some improvements in their rates; however some states  showed much more improvement than others. For example, Delaware  showed a 27 percent reduction\u2014from 21.3 to 15.5 percent\u2014in the  prevalence of antipsychotic drug use from 2011 through 2013, while  Nevada saw a smaller reduction of 2.7 percent\u2014from 20.3 to   19.7 percent\u2014during the same period. The National Partnership is  working with state coalitions, as well as nursing homes to reduce this rate  even further. In September 2014, CMS established a new set of national  goals to reduce the use antipsychotic drugs in long-stay nursing home  residents by 25 percent by the end of 2015 and 30 percent by the end of  2016, which, assuming a baseline of 23.8 percent, would lead to a  prescribing rate of 16.7 percent. Beginning in January 2015, CMS\u2019s Five- Star Quality Rating System for nursing homes will be based, in part, on  this measure of the extent to which antipsychotic drugs are used in the  nursing home.

The measure used for  Medicare Part D plans differs in a few respects from the measure  used to assess nursing homes. First, the Medicare Part D measure  examines chronic use, defined as having at least 3 months or more of  a prescription for an atypical antipsychotic drug, whereas the nursing  home measure includes any use. Additionally, the Medicare Part D  measure only includes atypical antipsychotic drugs, compared to the  nursing home measure, which includes all antipsychotic drugs. Of the  421 Medicare Part D plans reporting in 2012, the rate of use among  Medicare Part D enrollees residing in nursing homes ranged from 0 to  almost 64 percent. The average among all Medicare Part D plans in  2012 was approximately 22 percent of enrollees residing in nursing  homes having at least 3 months or more of a prescription. CMS told  us that variation in antipsychotic prescribing among Medicare Part D  plans may be explained by the prescribing practice in the plan\u2019s  service area, nursing home willingness to allow the use of  antipsychotic drugs for the behavioral symptoms of dementia, resident  need, and success in implementing interventions to reduce the  inappropriate use of antipsychotic drugs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions of Other HHS Agencies", "paragraphs": ["In addition to CMS actions, AHRQ and NIH have awarded research  grants for work related to antipsychotic drug use by older adults with  dementia in nursing homes.", "AHRQ has funded individual grants for work related to antipsychotic  drug use in nursing homes through its Center for Evidence and  Practice Improvement and the Centers for Education & Research on  Therapeutics (CERT) program.

In some cases, the benefits to prescribing the drugs may  outweigh the risks. HHS has taken important steps to educate and inform  nursing home providers and staff on the need to reduce unnecessary  antipsychotic drug use and ways to incorporate non-pharmacological  practices into their care to address the behavioral symptoms associated  with dementia. However, similar efforts have not been directed toward  caregivers of older adults living outside of nursing homes, such as those  in assisted living facilities and private residences. Targeting this segment  of the population is equally important given that over 1.2 million Medicare  Part D enrollees living outside of nursing homes were diagnosed with  dementia in 2012 and Medicare Part D pays for antipsychotic drugs  prescribed to these individuals. While the extent of unnecessary  prescribing of antipsychotic drugs is unknown, older adults with dementia  living outside of nursing homes are also at risk of the same dangers  associated with taking antipsychotics drugs as residents of nursing  homes. In fact, the National Alzheimer\u2019s Project Act was not limited to the  nursing home setting, but calls upon HHS to develop and implement an  integrated national plan to address dementia. HHS\u2019s National Alzheimer\u2019s  Plan addresses antipsychotic drug prescribing in nursing homes only,  however, and HHS activities to reduce such drug use have primarily  focused on older adults residing in nursing homes. Given that HHS does  not specifically target its outreach and education efforts relating to  antipsychotic drug use to settings other than nursing homes, older adults  living outside of nursing homes, their caregivers, and their clinicians in  these settings may not have access to the same resources about  alternative approaches to care.
