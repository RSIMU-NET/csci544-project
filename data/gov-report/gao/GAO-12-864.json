These dual-eligible beneficiaries have greater health care challenges than other Medicare beneficiaries, increasing their need for care coordination across the two programs. In addition to meeting all the requirements of other MA plans, D-SNPs are required by CMS to provide specialized services targeted to the needs of dual-eligible beneficiaries as well as integrate benefits or coordinate care with Medicaid services. GAO was asked to examine D-SNPs' specialized services to dual-eligible beneficiaries. GAO (1) analyzed the characteristics of dual-eligible beneficiaries in D-SNPs and other MA plans, (2) reviewed differences in specialized services between D-SNPs and other MA plans, and (3) reviewed how D-SNPs work with state Medicaid agencies to enhance benefit integration and care coordination. GAO analyzed CMS enrollment, plan benefit package, projected revenue, and beneficiary health status data; reviewed 15 D-SNP models of care and 2012 contracts with states; and interviewed representatives from 15 D-SNPs and Medicaid agency officials in 5 states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About 9 percent of the dual-eligible population is enrolled in 322 Medicare dual-eligible special needs plans (D-SNP), a type of Medicare Advantage (MA) plan. All dual-eligible beneficiaries are low income, but those in D-SNPs tended to have somewhat different demographic characteristics relative to those dual-eligible beneficiaries in other MA plans. On the basis of the most current data available (2010-2011), compared to those in other MA plans, dual-eligible beneficiaries in D-SNPs were more frequently under age 65 and disabled, more likely to be eligible for full Medicaid benefits, and more frequently diagnosed with a chronic or disabling mental health condition. In spite of these differences, the health status of D-SNP enrollees as measured by their expected cost to Medicare was similar to the health status of dual-eligible enrollees in other MA plans in 2010. D-SNPs provide fewer supplemental benefits--benefits not covered by Medicare fee-for-service (FFS)--on average, than other MA plans. Of the 10 supplemental benefits offered by more than half of D-SNPs, 7 were offered more frequently by other MA plans and 3 were offered more frequently by D-SNPs. Yet D-SNPs spent proportionately more of their rebate--additional Medicare payments received by many plans--to fund supplemental benefits compared to other MA plans, and less to reduce Medicare cost-sharing, which is generally covered by Medicaid. The models of care GAO reviewed, of 107 submitted for 2012, described in varying detail how the D-SNP planned to provide specialized services, such as health risk assessments, and meet other requirements, such as measuring performance. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers Medicare and oversees Medicaid, did not require D-SNPs to use standardized measures in the models of care, which would make it possible to compare the performance of D-SNPs. While D-SNPs are not required to report that information to CMS, such information would be useful for future evaluations of whether D-SNPs met their intended results, as well as for comparing D-SNPs. CMS stated that contracts between D-SNPs and state Medicaid agencies are an opportunity to increase benefit integration and care coordination. Our review of the contracts indicated only about one-third of the 2012 contracts contained any provisions for benefit integration, and only about one-fifth provided for active care coordination between D-SNPs and Medicaid agencies, which indicates that most care coordination was done exclusively by D-SNPs, without any involvement of state Medicaid agencies. However, some D-SNP contracts with state Medicaid agencies specified that the agencies would pay the D-SNPs to provide all or some Medicaid benefits. Representatives from the D-SNPs and Medicaid officials from the states GAO interviewed expressed concerns about the contracting process, such as limited state resources for developing and overseeing contracts, as well as uncertainty about whether Congress will extend D-SNPs as a type of MA plan after 2013, and the implementation of other initiatives to coordinate Medicare and Medicaid benefits for dual-eligible beneficiaries that could replace D-SNPs. To increase D-SNPs' accountability, GAO recommends improving D-SNP reporting of services provided to dual-eligible beneficiaries and making this information available to the public. In its comments on a draft of GAO's report, CMS generally agreed with our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About 9 million of Medicare\u2019s over 48 million beneficiaries are also eligible  for Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that finances health insurance  coverage for certain categories of low-income adults and children.

In the same year, dual-eligible beneficiaries were  about 15 percent of Medicaid enrollees but accounted for nearly   40 percent of Medicaid spending. Disproportionate spending for these  individuals is largely because dual-eligible beneficiaries are more likely  than other Medicare beneficiaries to be disabled; report poor health status  and limitations in their activities of daily living, such as bathing and  toileting; and have cognitive impairments, mental disorders, and certain  chronic conditions such as diabetes and pulmonary disease.

To compare the mental health characteristics and health  status of dual-eligible beneficiaries in D-SNPs with dual-eligible  beneficiaries enrolled in other MA plans and FFS, we analyzed CMS data  on 2010 beneficiary risk scores, which measure expected Medicare costs  for each beneficiary on the basis of demographic and diagnosis data.  Specifically, we calculated the average risk scores for dual-eligible  beneficiaries in D-SNPs, other MA plans, and FFS in 2010.analyses, we used enrollment and plan benefit data to identify the type of  plan (D-SNP, other MA plan, or FFS) in which each beneficiary was  enrolled.", "To determine the extent to which D-SNPs\u2019 specialized services differed  from services offered by other MA plans, we used CMS\u2019s 2012 plan  benefit data to compare D-SNPs\u2019 supplemental benefits, such as dental  and vision coverage, that are outside the original Medicare FFS benefit  package, with the supplemental benefits offered by other MA plans. We  also used CMS\u2019s 2012 bid pricing tool data, which contain information MA  plans submitted to CMS on their projected revenue requirements for  providing Medicare-covered services to enrolled beneficiaries, to  understand how D-SNPs and other MA plans fund the supplemental  benefits they offer. Additionally, we interviewed officials from 15 D-SNPs  that had enrolled at least 100 dual-eligible beneficiaries in both 2010 and  2011 to discuss what services are available to dual-eligible beneficiaries  in D-SNPs and, when applicable, whether differences exist between the  care coordination services they offer in their D-SNPs and their MA  organization\u2019s other MA plans. We judgmentally selected these D-SNPs  to cover a range of geographic regions and plan sizes. We also reviewed  the 2012 models of care submitted to CMS by these 15 D-SNPs\u2014 representing 14 percent of the 107 models of care we received from  CMS. The model of care provides a narrative description of how the  D-SNP will address certain clinical and nonclinical elements, such as a  health risk assessment and an adequate provider network.

We supplemented this analysis with  interviews of officials from five state Medicaid agencies judgmentally  selected to cover a range of geographic areas,our sample of D-SNPs.", "We assessed the reliability of the data we received from CMS by  performing appropriate electronic data checks and by interviewing agency  officials who were knowledgeable about the data.

The contracts  between D-SNPs and state Medicaid agencies we reviewed are limited to  contracts submitted to CMS for 2012.

CMS then adjusts the  monthly payments to MA plans on the basis of beneficiaries\u2019 risk scores.  If an MA plan\u2019s bid exceeds the benchmark, the plan must charge each of  its beneficiaries an additional premium to make up the difference. If a  plan\u2019s bid is less than the benchmark, a proportion of the difference is  returned to the plan as additional Medicare payments called rebates,  which must be used to reduce premiums, reduce cost sharing, or provide  mandatory supplemental benefits, such as vision and dental care.

Under existing coordination efforts, integrating benefits  requires an investment of resources from states to work with D-SNPs, or  other stakeholders, but according to experts most of the financial savings  accrue to Medicare, because most savings result from services that are  largely paid for by Medicare, such as reductions in the number or length  of hospital stays. Under the financial alignment initiative, savings will be  shared by Medicare and Medicaid without reference to whether the  savings are achieved in Medicare or Medicaid services, although the  allocation of these savings between Medicare and Medicaid has not yet  been finalized.

As a  result, it would be difficult for CMS to use any data it might collect on  these measures to compare D-SNPs\u2019 effectiveness or evaluate how well  they have done in meeting their goals.

According to CMS,  \u201chis variability is to be expected, as States and MA organizations can  develop agreements for  to assume responsibility for providing  or arranging for a wide range of Medicaid services based on each State\u2019s  ability and interest in integrating its Medicaid program with Medicare via a  SNP.\u201d Thirty-three percent of the 124 D-SNP contracts with state  Medicaid agencies for 2012 that we reviewed expressly provided for the  delivery of at least some portion of Medicaid benefits, thereby integrating  Medicare and Medicaid benefits. The contracts varied in the extent of the  Medicaid benefits for which a plan was responsible. About 10 percent  provided a limited number of Medicaid services, such as dental or vision  benefits. In contracts where there was some integration of Medicare and  Medicaid benefits, states contracted for the different services, making  comparisons among the contracts difficult. Of the 23 percent that  integrated most or all Medicaid benefits, 64 percent of D-SNPs provided  all Medicaid benefits, including long-term care support services in  community settings and institutional care; 25 percent provided most  Medicaid benefits, including long-term support services in community  settings but not institutional care; and 11 percent provided most Medicaid  benefits but did not provide any long-term support services or institutional  care. (See fig. 5.)", "Sixty-seven percent of contracts between D-SNPs and state Medicaid  agencies did not expressly provide for D-SNPs to cover Medicaid  benefits. To carry out MIPPA\u2019s requirement that each D-SNP contract  provide or arrange for Medicaid benefits to be provided, CMS guidance  has required that contracts list the Medicaid benefits that dual-eligible  beneficiaries could receive directly from the state Medicaid agency or the  state\u2019s Medicaid managed care contractor(s).", "For D-SNPs contracting with state Medicaid agencies to provide all or  some Medicaid benefits, the capitated payment reflected variation in  coverage and conditions. One state that contracts for all Medicaid  benefits except a limited number of services including long-term care  services paid the D-SNP at a rate of $423 per member per month.  Another state, which contracted for a limited number of benefits, including  Medicare-excluded drugs, expanded dental coverage, and case- management services, paid the D-SNP $132 per member per month. This  state\u2019s Medicaid agency retained responsibility for inpatient hospital  services and long-term care coverage. Some contracts, rather than  stating a single capitation rate, gave payment rates for different  categories, including risk or acuity level, beneficiary age, and service  location, as well as whether the beneficiary was designated as nursing  home eligible and whether services for these beneficiaries were provided  in the community or facility setting. Within one state, payment rates  ranged from just under $170 per month for dual-eligible beneficiaries who  were neither nursing home eligible nor had a chronic mental health  condition and were living in the community to over $8,600 per month for  dual-eligible beneficiaries residing in a nursing facility and requiring the  highest level of care.", "Some of the 2012 contracts providing for payments from state Medicaid  agencies to D-SNPs did not address the direct provision of benefits, often  providing for payments to the D-SNP for assuming the state\u2019s  responsibility for paying dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2019 Medicare copayments,  coinsurance, and deductibles. These payments ranged from $10 to $60  per member per month.", "While all contracts between D-SNPs and state Medicaid agencies for  2012 provided for some level of care coordination to beneficiaries,  approximately 19 percent expressly provided for active coordination of  beneficiary services between the D-SNP and the state Medicaid  agency. Most active coordination occurs when dual-eligible beneficiaries  transition between care settings or between Medicare and Medicaid.  Thirteen percent of all contracts contained provisions requiring D-SNPs  and the state Medicaid agency to coordinate the transition of beneficiaries  between care settings (such as hospital to nursing home) within a given  time frame. For example, one state\u2019s D-SNP contracts directed the plans  to notify the Medicaid service coordinators or agency caseworker, as  applicable, no later than 5 business days after a dual-eligible beneficiary  had been admitted to a nursing facility. The other 6 percent of contracts  included provisions for providing different coordination activities such as  requiring the plan to work with Medicaid staff to coordinate delivery of  wrap-around Medicaid benefits.", "The remaining 81 percent of all contracts did not specifically address  D-SNPs\u2019 coordination with state Medicaid staff, such as case managers.  Rather, these contracts indicated that the D-SNP would coordinate  Medicaid and Medicare services but did not specify the role of the state  Medicaid agency in coordinating those services. Because D-SNPs are  required by Medicare to provide care coordination services to dual-eligible  beneficiaries, these services are often provided without reimbursement or  payment from the state Medicaid agency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "D-SNP and State Officials Expressed Some Concerns about Contracting", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Concerns about Resource Investment", "paragraphs": ["D-SNP representatives and state Medicaid officials we spoke with  reported that contract development and submission to CMS are resource- intensive. State officials reported that because they had limited resources,  they needed to balance the benefits of the contract with the time and  resources needed to develop and oversee it. As one state Medicaid  official said, the state \u201cbandwidth\u201d\u2014resources\u2014was a challenge, and she  was concerned about contracting with the large number of D-SNPs in her  state. This official added that the state did not want to be in the position of  making contractual commitments that could not be honored because of  limited funds or other resources. In contrast, the plan representatives we  interviewed expressed interest in continuing to operate D-SNPs and were  therefore eager to contract with states despite any challenges that might  exist. Beginning in 2013, D-SNPs will not be permitted to operate without  state contracts.", "Representatives from 12 of the 15 plans and officials from 3 of the 5 state  Medicaid agencies we spoke with pointed out that establishing a contract  between Medicaid and a Medicare plan highlights conflicts between  federal and state requirements. A representative from one D-SNP told us  that it was challenging for plans and state Medicaid agencies to agree  about the characterization of dual-eligible beneficiaries because Medicare  and some states have different definitions. Officials from one state  Medicaid agency and D-SNP representatives reported difficulty  reconciling the difference between the Medicare contracting cycle, which  is based on the calendar year, and the fiscal year contracting cycle for  their states. They reported that, if a contract would not cover the entire  calendar year, CMS would not approve it. In one case, a state Medicaid  official reported that CMS\u2019s deadline of July 1, 2012, for 2013 contracts  would occur before the state signed contracts for 2013. Sometimes non- Medicaid structures conflict with CMS\u2019s contracting requirements for  D-SNPs. A representative of one D-SNP told us that Medicaid benefits for  individuals with developmental disabilities were managed through a  contract with the state\u2019s family services agency, not the state Medicaid  agency. Therefore, to provide services to this population, the D-SNP had  to become a subcontractor to the family services agency. The official said  that the D-SNP and the state need to work with CMS to develop a  subcontracting relationship that is acceptable. State Medicaid officials  and D-SNP representatives reported that they did not always have the  resources or the administrative ability to resolve these types of issues  before entering into a contract.", "Beginning in 2013, D-SNPs must secure a contract with the state  Medicaid agency in each state in their service area. To do this, D-SNPs  may need to establish new relationships with state officials who,  according to the D-SNP representatives we interviewed, sometimes have  very limited knowledge of Medicare and its requirements. However, some  states have experience with Medicaid managed care and in some cases,  D-SNP representatives had previously worked with the state on Medicaid  contracts, thereby somewhat easing the transition to working with  D-SNPs.", "Plan representatives and state Medicaid officials told us that uncertainty  about the future made them cautious in contracting. Authority for SNPs to  restrict enrollment to special needs populations (such as dual-eligible  beneficiaries) currently expires at the end of 2013; SNPs may not  continue as a unique type of MA plan if Congress does not extend this  authority. Were this to occur, states would lose any advantages they  might have gained from investing their resources to work with D-SNPs to  integrate benefits and coordinate care. Furthermore, uncertainty  regarding the future of D-SNPs creates uncertainty for the states about  how to continue to serve dual-eligible beneficiaries currently enrolled in  D-SNPs.", "Uncertainty about the implementation of state demonstrations under the  CMS initiative to align Medicare and Medicaid services\u2014financial  alignment initiative\u2014has made some states hesitant to enter into  contracts with D-SNPs. As of June 2012, all proposals had been made  available for public comment but CMS had not finalized agreements with  the states. Medicaid officials from two states told us that if their proposed  financial alignment demonstrations were implemented, D-SNPs in their  states would cease to exist. Some states were moving forward with  D-SNP contracts while concurrently preparing to shift D-SNPs to a  different type of managed care plan if their demonstration proposal is  implemented. However, officials from one state told us that they did not  have sufficient clarity about the direction of the state Medicaid program in  relation to its proposed demonstration to enter into contracts. Even in  those states where demonstrations would not eliminate D-SNPs,  contracting challenges as well as potential financial incentives associated  with the demonstrations from the financial alignment initiatives create  disincentives for states to work with D-SNPs outside of the financial  alignment initiatives and, therefore, leaves the future of D-SNPs in  question in these states as well."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["D-SNPs have the potential to help beneficiaries who are eligible for both  Medicare and Medicaid navigate these two different systems and receive  the health services that meet their individual needs. However, CMS has  not required D-SNPs to report information that is critical to better holding  plans accountable and determining whether they have realized their  potential. Although the models of care D-SNPs must submit to CMS  generally state what these plans intend to do, they do not all report the  number of services they intend to provide. For example, plans are not  required to report the number of enrollees they expect to designate as  most vulnerable, or how many and which additional services they will  provide to these enrollees. Although D-SNPs are required to collect  performance and outcome measures, they are not required to use  standard measures such as existing measures of hospital readmission or  patient health status and cognitive functioning. Further they are not  required to report these measures to CMS, and, lacking standard  measures, it would in any case be difficult to compare D-SNPs\u2019  effectiveness. Standardizing these measures should have a minimal  effect on D-SNPs\u2019 administrative efforts, because additional measures  could replace some or all of the measures currently used as well as much  of the narrative in models of care. Standardizing measures could also  reduce CMS\u2019s administrative efforts by streamlining review of D-SNPs.  Additional standardized information would allow CMS to meet its goals for  accountability for effective and efficient use of resources.", "Further, CMS has neither evaluated the sufficiency and appropriateness  of the care that D-SNPs provide nor assessed their effectiveness in  integrating benefits and coordinating care for dual-eligible beneficiaries.

HHS did  question the usefulness of quantifying the number of members expected  to receive services described in the documents, stating that the model of  care is a framework for indicating how the SNP proposes to coordinate  the care of SNP enrollees. However, as we noted in the draft report, we  believe such information could be useful in later evaluating whether   D-SNPs met their intended goals.", "HHS also concurred with our recommendation that CMS should require  D-SNPs to collect and report standard measures relevant to the  populations they serve, and stated that CMS is working to create new  measures that will be relevant to dual-eligible beneficiaries in D-SNPs.  HHS also stated that CMS currently collects a broad range of standard  quality measures, including HEDIS, as well as structure and process  measures. HHS included in its response a recent Health Plan System  Management memorandum that CMS sent to MA organizations, including  D-SNPs, which outlined updated reporting requirements for 2013. HHS  also noted that in addition to the data it currently collects, CMS requires  D-SNPs to conduct both a Quality Improvement Project and a Chronic  Care Improvement Project, and asked GAO to note this in the final report.

We note in the report that some of the supplemental benefits  offered at lower rates by D-SNPs may be covered by Medicaid, thereby  reducing the need for them to be covered by D-SNPs. Second, SNP  Alliance representatives were concerned with our definition of FIDESNPs.  They explained that CMS\u2019s definition, which we used, limits FIDESNPs to  those that integrate all Medicare and Medicaid benefits without any limits,  such as the number of nursing home days covered. They contended that  some D-SNPs may be considered fully integrated even though they do  not include all benefits, such as nursing home care, and may have some  limits. However, in reporting on CMS activities we have no basis for using  different definitions than those formally applied by the agency. Third, SNP  Alliance representatives stated that the ability of their D-SNP members to  fully integrate benefits through contracting is limited by the capacity and  interest of state Medicaid agencies. We note in the report that state  Medicaid agencies we interviewed acknowledged limitations in their  capacity for contracting. Fourth, SNP Alliance representatives had some  concern with our emphasis on estimating how many beneficiaries are  expected to receive the services described in the model of care, stating  that all dual-eligible beneficiaries would have access to the services  described based on need. However, as we stated in the draft report,  information is not generally available on the number of beneficiaries that  use these benefits. Finally, SNP Alliance representatives were supportive  of the state demonstrations under the financial alignment initiative. They  noted that D-SNPs are being used as a platform for half of the state  demonstrations, with the remainder being based on a Medicaid model.
