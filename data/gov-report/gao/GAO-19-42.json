The United States, along with Canada, Denmark, Norway, and  Russia, borders the Arctic Ocean. In 2018, the Department of Defense  (DOD) updated its National Defense Strategy emphasizing the need to  deter aggression from Russia or China, both of which have expressed  interest in the Arctic.", "DOD\u2019s last Arctic Strategy was published in 2016 and defines the desired  end-state for the Arctic: a secure and stable region where U.S. national  interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is defended, and nations  work cooperatively to address challenges. Multiple DOD entities are  involved in supporting Arctic operations. DOD\u2019s 2016 Arctic Strategy  states that the Commander of the U.S. Northern Command is to advocate  for the DOD capabilities required to operate in the Arctic environment,  supporting DOD Arctic stakeholders in identifying capability requirements  and shortfalls.

The Naval Sea Systems Command\u2019s mission includes, among  other things, providing materiel support to the Navy, such as ships and  shipboard combat systems and components; coordinating shipbuilding  and repair; and performing research, development, and test and  evaluation for submarines and other undersea warfare. The Coast Guard  stated in its 2013 Arctic Strategy that, to advance the U.S. interests in the  Arctic region, the Coast Guard must work with stakeholders to promote  maritime safety, security, and environmental responsibility in the region.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 included a  provision for the Navy to report on its Arctic capabilities. The act also  included a provision that we review the Navy\u2019s report, which we refer to  as the June 2018 report, within 90 days of the report\u2019s issuance. This  report (1) assesses the extent to which the Navy\u2019s June 2018 report  aligns with current Arctic threat level assessments and the capabilities  required to execute DOD\u2019s 2016 Arctic Strategy and (2) describes any  current requirements for ice-hardened vessels and DOD\u2019s approach for  evaluating the capabilities needed as Arctic requirements evolve.", "We focused our review on the naval capabilities needed to execute  DOD\u2019s 2016 Arctic Strategy, with a focus on surface capabilities. For  objective one, two analysts independently assessed the June 2018 report  against the capabilities needed to execute DOD\u2019s 2016 Arctic Strategy  and the five elements required by the National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2018. A third analyst reviewed these assessments and  reconciled any discrepancies. We conducted interviews with DOD and  Navy officials to identify current naval capabilities used to meet Arctic  requirements and attended threat briefings and conducted interviews at  the U.S. Northern Command and at the Office of Naval Intelligence to  identify the current threat status in the Arctic region. We assessed the  June 2018 report against the current naval capabilities and threat status  identified in those interviews and briefings. We reviewed The United  States Navy Arctic Roadmap for 2014 to 2030 that the Office of the Chief  of Naval Operations issued in 2014 to provide guidance to prepare the  Navy to respond effectively to future Arctic region contingencies,  delineate the Navy\u2019s leadership role, and articulate the Navy\u2019s support to  achieve national priorities in the Arctic. We reviewed information from  DOD and the Department of State about the freedom of navigation  program established in 1979 to maintain the global mobility of U.S. forces  and unimpeded commerce. We also interviewed officials about the need  for that program in the Arctic and about the program\u2019s benefits and risks.  We reviewed a Navy technical document on operating ships in polar  environments, and interviewed Naval Sea Systems Command and Coast  Guard officials on what is known about the cost and feasibility of \u201cice- hardening\u201d existing ships for Arctic operations.", "For objective two, to determine how DOD identifies its evolving  capabilities and the requirements of the Arctic, we reviewed the Chairman  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction 3170.01I, Joint Capabilities  Integration and Development System (JCIDS), which establishes the  process for identifying, assessing, validating, and prioritizing joint military  capability requirements. We also reviewed the U.S. Northern  Command\u2019s fiscal year 2017 assessment of capability gaps related to the  Arctic and discussed with U.S. Northern Command officials the capability  gaps identified using this process.

We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Scientific research on and projections of the changes taking place in the  Arctic vary, but there is a general consensus that the Arctic is warming  and that its sea ice is diminishing. For example, scientists at the  National Snow and Ice Data Center reported that for 2018 the minimum  amount of sea ice coverage in the Arctic\u2014typically occurring in  September each year\u2014was the sixth lowest in the satellite record and  656,000 square miles fewer than the mean for the 1981 through 2010  time frame. Further, the scientists found that the 12 lowest recordings of  September ice coverage on satellite record have all occurred in the past  12 years. Figure 1 shows the sea ice coverage (i.e., extent) in the Arctic  for September 2018 compared with the median ice edge for 1981 through  2010.", "While much of the Arctic Ocean remains ice-covered for the majority of  the year, most scientific estimates predict there will be a continued  decrease in sea ice coverage in the Arctic Ocean in the summer  sometime in the next 20 to 40 years. According to the Navy\u2019s Arctic  Roadmap for 2014 to 2030, while there may be less sea ice there in the  future, the ice that remains will continue to be a challenge to those  operating in the area.", "Most commercial ship activity in the Arctic is regional\u2014shipping into or  out of the Arctic, mainly in support of commercial activity\u2014not trans- Arctic. However, according to the official Navy estimate from 2013, the  decreasing coverage of sea ice will result in more open water allowing  increased maritime activity along three trans-Arctic routes from 2012  through 2030: the Northern Sea Route, the Northwest Passage, and the  Trans-Polar Route (see fig. 2). This development could, for example,  reduce by thousands of miles and by several days of travel the shipping  of goods between countries in Asia and North America.", "Increased economic activity in the Arctic could potentially increase the  need for military capabilities there to safeguard U.S. interests. For  example, estimates of significant oil, gas, and mineral deposits in the  Arctic have increased the interest in exploration opportunities in the  region. These resources include an estimated 13 percent of the world\u2019s  undiscovered oil; 30 percent of the world\u2019s undiscovered gas; and  approximately $1 trillion of minerals including gold, zinc, nickel, and  platinum. According to information provided by the Department of State,  the vast majority of these resources are within the undisputed continental  shelf of the respective coastal states. Officials from the Department of  State stated that disputed claims related to the small remaining portions  of the Arctic seabed may be addressed within the international framework  established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.", "However, as we reported in 2015, even with the changing climate and  growing interest in the region, several enduring characteristics will  continue to provide challenges to surface navigation in the Arctic for the  foreseeable future. These include large amounts of winter ice and  increased movement of ice from spring to fall. Increased movement of  sea ice makes its location less predictable, a situation that increases the  risk that ships can become trapped or damaged by ice impacts. In  addition, the lack of infrastructure in the Arctic region affects the reliability  of shipping through the area. Economic factors such as risk costs, as well  as changes in the shipping market resulting from the Panama Canal  expansion may also affect the amount of shipping along these routes. As  figure 3 shows, even as the seasonal ice decreases over time, the Navy  has projected that the Arctic will remain impassable for most commercial  ships for most of the year from 2012 through 2030. These factors  combined are likely to affect the pace at which commercial activity will  increase.", "We have previously examined emerging issues and challenges for the  United States in the Arctic.

Specifically, the June 2018  report and the information it provides for each of the reporting elements  discusses how the department can execute the 2016 DOD Arctic  Strategy.", "The strategy contains two overarching objectives: to (1) ensure security,  support safety, and promote defense cooperation and (2) prepare to  respond to a wide range of challenges and contingencies to maintain  stability in the region. These objectives reflect DOD\u2019s assessment that  there is a low level of military threat in the Arctic, as well as the stated  commitment of the Arctic nations to work within a common framework of  diplomatic engagement. In the strategy, DOD identifies the types of  investments that will need to be made over time as activity in the region  increases; however, DOD also discusses the importance of assessing the  needs in the Arctic and of balancing potential Arctic-specific capabilities  investments against other national security priorities and fiscal realities.  The Arctic threat assessment briefings we received from officials at the  U.S. Northern Command and the Office of Naval Intelligence also  reflected the low risk for conflict in the Arctic referenced in the Navy\u2019s  June 2018 report.

These capabilities in the Arctic region are consistent with those  identified in The United States Navy Arctic Roadmap for 2014 to 2030 to  execute the 2016 DOD Arctic Strategy, and as corroborated in our  discussions with U.S. Northern Command and Navy officials.", "In addition, the Navy discusses the significant limitations of its surface  ships for Arctic operations in the June 2018 report. The limitations  identified are consistent with information contained in the U.S. Navy Cold  Weather Handbook for Surface Ships and with information we discussed  with Naval Sea Systems Command officials who oversee modifications to  the fleet and the acquisition of new ships. For example, Navy officials told  us that top-side icing has detrimental effects on ships. As sea spray  accumulates on a ship deck and freezes, a ship can lose some of the  capabilities of its external sensors and radars and a ship\u2019s stability in the  water decreases as the ship\u2019s center of gravity becomes top heavy. Navy  and Coast Guard officials told us that while the Coast Guard regularly  operates in the Arctic given its ice-breaking and maritime safety missions,  among others, Navy surface ships have not been designed to maneuver  and operate in icy waters. Although some of the Navy\u2019s T-class ships  have some capability to operate in light or broken first-year ice due to the  inherent strength of their hulls, traditional surface combatant ships (e.g.,  Cruisers, Destroyers, or Frigates) are not designed to operate in icy  waters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Report Provides Information on the Gaps between Current Naval Capabilities and the Ability to Execute DOD\u2019s Strategy", "paragraphs": ["Reporting Element Two: The Navy was required to report on any gaps that exist  between the current naval capabilities and the ability of the department to fully execute  its updated strategy for the Arctic region.", "The June 2018 report provides information on this required element, with  the Navy stating that the department can execute the 2016 DOD Arctic  Strategy with current naval capabilities.

This  plan provides guidance to prepare the Navy to respond effectively to  future Arctic Region contingencies, delineates the Navy\u2019s leadership role,  and articulates the Navy\u2019s support to achieve national priorities in the  region. At the time of our review, DOD was in the process of drafting  another report\u2014on DOD arctic capability and resource gaps\u2014as required  by section 1054 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2018. In addition, according to Navy officials, the Navy was also drafting  its Arctic Strategic Outlook, which is a follow-up to The United States  Navy Arctic Roadmap for 2014 to 2030. According to DOD and Navy  officials, both forthcoming reports will focus on contextualizing Arctic  needs within the framework of the 2018 National Defense Strategy.

According to the Navy, because there is no  specific capability requirement for the Navy to ice-harden ships, the report  does not list or name potential ice-hardening candidates among existing  vessels or provide cost or schedule estimates for ice-hardening vessels.  Officials with the Naval Sea Systems Command, which develops cost and  schedule estimates for ship modifications and new construction, told us  that they had not conducted life-cycle cost studies for ice-hardening  existing ships because there is no capability requirement for an ice- hardened ship and, therefore, no ship design on which to base such a  study or estimate.", "Furthermore, the June 2018 report states that the Navy is leveraging  cooperative research with international partner-nations such as Canada,  Denmark, Finland, and Norway, to better understand how other Arctic  nations are meeting additional requirements for Arctic operations. Navy  officials from the Naval Sea Systems Command stated that ships built to  operate in ice and extreme cold environments have unique features,  including stronger, thicker construction of all portions of the hull that  would come into contact with ice; different hull form design; redesigned  propellers constructed of higher than traditional strength material;  increased strength ship parts, such as rudders and seawater intakes and  discharges designed to resist the formation or accumulation of ice; and  more powerful heating and ventilation to accommodate sustained  operations in extreme cold environments, among other things. They also  noted that research completed to date has advanced the Navy\u2019s  knowledge in several of these areas including hull form and propeller  design.", "Navy officials estimated that a new ship design might require 20 years to  reach initial operational capability. They noted the process might take  only 10 years if the Navy can leverage an ongoing program, such as the  DDG-51 Class program. Navy officials cautioned that the combination of  features that enable ice-capable ships to sustain operating in extreme  cold environments could compromise other performance areas such as  speed, range, and ship motion. Officials told us that this would add to the  Navy\u2019s already strained efforts to maintain existing global naval presence  requirements.", "Although the June 2018 report did not discuss any cost and schedule  adjustments that might arise from ice-hardening or new ship construction,  we have previously reported that the Navy has faced challenges meeting  its shipbuilding cost, schedule, and performance goals over the past  decade. Specifically, we found that the 11 lead ships most recently  delivered to the Navy cost $8 billion more to construct than initially  budgeted for. Navy officials stated that the Navy contractor construction  yards currently lack expertise in the design for construction of winterized,  ice-capable surface combatant and amphibious warfare ships.  Accordingly ice-hardening and winterization design practices could  introduce cost and schedule risk, challenging the execution of an ice- hardened new construction ship building program for an ice-capable ship.  If the Navy executes this potential program without the requisite  knowledge at key points it could be at risk of cost and schedule growth  that we have seen in recent Navy shipbuilding programs. The Navy has  faced these challenges in part because the department has proceeded  with construction prior to completing technology development and ship  design. We have found that successful ship building programs are based  on sound business cases, starting with the lead ship, and on the  attainment of critical levels of knowledge at key points in the process prior  to making significant investments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Navy Does Not Have a Capability Requirement to Ice- Harden Existing Vessels or Construct New Ones and Is Evaluating Arctic- Related Capabilities Using the Established DOD Process", "paragraphs": ["Navy officials said that the Navy does not currently have a specific  capability requirement for ice-hardening existing vessels or for the  construction of new ones, and stated that the Navy or Joint Force is  unlikely to produce such a requirement in the near term.

All DOD  components use the JCIDS process or variations of the process within  their organizations to identify, assess, validate, and prioritize joint military  requirements.", "Before starting the JCIDS process, the military services, combatant  commanders, and other DOD components conduct capabilities-based  assessments or other studies to assess capability requirements and  associated capability gaps and the associated risks. In October 2017, the  Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) validated U.S. Northern  Command\u2019s initial capabilities document identifying three gaps in the  ability to exercise/deploy, position, and conduct deterrence/decisive  operations in ice-diminished Arctic waters. At the time of our review, the  JROC had reviewed and validated the U.S. Northern Command\u2019s Arctic  initial capabilities document and designated it for further study by the  Navy. The validation of an initial capabilities document by the JROC is  an early part of the JCIDS process, and informs updates to capability  requirement documents related to specific materiel and nonmateriel  capability solutions to be pursued.", "A Navy official stated that the capability gaps identified in the U.S.  Northern Command\u2019s validated initial capabilities document will now  compete for resources with other issues designated for study across the  Navy. According to a Navy official, whenever the Navy initiates a study,  this triggers the analysis of alternatives phase of the JCIDS process.  Under this process, each alternative would need to be specifically  evaluated for its costs and benefits. DOD officials noted that there are  several analytical steps in the JCIDS process during which potential  solutions for any identified gaps are analyzed. They told us that potential  solutions might also include alternatives other than ice-hardening or new  ship construction, such as adding capabilities to Coast Guard ships or  partnering with allies to achieve common strategic goals in the Arctic.", "Even as the seasonal ice decreases over time, according to Navy  officials, the Arctic will remain impassable for most commercial ships for  most of the year.
