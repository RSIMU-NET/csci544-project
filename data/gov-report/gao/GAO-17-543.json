To address these questions, GAO reviewed reports issued by PRC and others; obtained views from USPS and PRC, as well as postal stakeholders and experts who have submitted public comments to PRC proceedings; and collected information from six countries\u2014France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden, and the United Kingdom\u2014that have eliminated their postal monopolies, selected based on criteria including their share of global mail volume.", "GAO is making no recommendations in this report.

This figure suggests that USPS's net income would decline by this amount if its monopolies were eliminated. To develop these estimates, PRC identifies the mail covered under USPS's monopolies for which a potential entrant might compete to provide service if the monopolies were to be eliminated; such mail is referred to as \u201ccontestable.\u201d PRC's estimated value of these monopolies has increased substantially in recent years\u2014it was $3.28 billion in fiscal year 2012\u2014and PRC staff expects that the value will continue to increase in the next few years due to increased volumes of contestable mail.", "Narrowing or eliminating USPS's letter delivery and mailbox monopolies would likely have varied effects, according to views provided by postal stakeholders, experts, USPS, and PRC. For example, all parties agreed that allowing other entities to deliver letters could decrease USPS's revenues, and that additional strain would be placed on USPS's ability to continue providing the current level of universal service. Additionally, some stakeholders said that allowing other entities to deliver items to the mailbox could adversely affect the security of mail and increase clutter that would impair USPS's delivery efficiency. On the other hand, most of the postal experts we interviewed said that allowing entry to this market by private competitors could result in increased competition that would spur USPS to become more efficient. Officials from foreign posts or regulators in all six of the countries GAO contacted reported increases in competition after ending their postal delivery monopolies, and some of these countries also reported losses of revenue and market share for the carriers providing universal service. Stakeholders, experts, foreign officials, and USPS agreed that postal policies are interdependent and therefore need to be considered in tandem with one another; officials from all six countries we contacted told us that concurrent postal policy changes, such as increasing a post's degree of commercial freedom or decreasing the scope of its universal service obligation, assisted their transitions away from postal monopolies.", "Estimating the effects of laws that apply differently to USPS and its private competitors would require steps including defining appropriate study objectives and assessing scope and methodological tradeoffs. For example, objectives would need to clarify the extent of financial effects to be estimated\u2014whether for USPS as a whole, for only specific products, or for USPS relative to competitors. Scoping decisions would need to define the specific areas to be studied, the period of time to be reviewed, and the type of data to be collected. This would involve multiple considerations, including determining which laws to include and how to address differing stakeholder views. Additional judgment would be needed to address any lack of consensus on methodologies and to determine the appropriate degree of time and resources. For example, a comprehensive study estimating the effects of every law would require significant time and resources; if estimates were desired in a shorter time frame\u2014or if financial resources were limited\u2014tradeoffs would be required."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is a critical part of today\u2019s  communications and commerce. In fiscal year 2016, USPS delivered 154  billion pieces of mail to 156 million delivery points, generating revenues of  $71.5 billion. USPS has dual roles, one as an independent establishment  of the executive branch required to provide universal delivery service,  and the other as a self-financing entity operating in a business-like  manner. Congress has long provided USPS with revenue protection in  the form of statutory monopolies to deliver letter mail and access  mailboxes. These monopolies protect USPS\u2019s revenues, which helps  USPS fulfill its universal service mission. The letter delivery monopoly has  prevented private competitors from engaging in \u201ccream-skimming\u201d  activity, wherein they could otherwise offer service on low-cost routes at  rates below USPS\u2019s while leaving USPS with high-cost routes. The  mailbox monopoly was created to protect postal revenues by preventing  the private delivery of unstamped mail. Despite the revenue protection  these monopolies have offered USPS as it has carried out its mission to  provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to the public, universal  service remains at risk due to USPS\u2019s poor financial status. This is due, in  large part, to trends that include declining volumes of profitable First- Class Mail and growing expenses. USPS\u2019s net losses were $5.6 billion in  fiscal year 2016\u2014and are greater than $62 billion over the past decade\u2014 and USPS has reported that it expects continuing losses and liquidity  challenges for the foreseeable future under its current business model  and statutory framework.", "Congress, USPS, and other postal stakeholders have considered a range  of different business models to address USPS\u2019s financial difficulties and  define its future role in an evolving postal marketplace. As part of these  considerations, questions have been raised about the continued need for  the letter delivery monopoly and the mailbox monopoly and, more  broadly, about a variety of laws that apply differently to USPS and its  private delivery competitors such as United Parcel Service (UPS) and  FedEx. As your request noted, it is important that policymakers  understand the advantages and disadvantages of USPS\u2019s status as an  independent establishment of the executive branch. This report focuses  on (1) what is known about the value of USPS\u2019s letter delivery and  mailbox monopolies, (2) views on the potential effects of narrowing or  eliminating these monopolies; and (3) considerations that would need to  be addressed to estimate the value of USPS\u2019s financial advantages and  burdens resulting from laws that apply differently to USPS and its private  competitors.", "To determine what is known about the value of USPS\u2019s letter delivery and  mailbox monopolies, we primarily focused on the latest estimates of their  value issued by the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC)\u2014an  independent establishment of the executive branch that regulates  USPS\u2014by interviewing and obtaining supporting documentation from  PRC officials. To identify potential effects of narrowing or eliminating  (\u201crelaxing\u201d) USPS\u2019s monopolies, we obtained views of 16 selected postal  stakeholder organizations (\u201cstakeholders\u201d) and 9 selected postal experts,  chosen because they had previously expressed views on these  monopolies and other postal issues. These perspectives are not  generalizable, but they provide a wide range of views on postal monopoly  issues\u2014and they represent some of the key groups with whom Congress  interacts when developing postal policy. We also contacted selected  foreign postal operators and their regulators in six industrialized countries  that have eliminated statutory delivery monopolies to collect information  on their experiences; the six countries were selected based on several  criteria including their revenues relative to other nations who have  eliminated their postal monopolies. To identify considerations that would  need to be addressed to estimate the value of USPS\u2019s financial  advantages and burdens resulting from laws that apply differently to  USPS and its private competitors, we reviewed criteria from the  government auditing standards, relevant laws, and a 2007 Federal Trade  Commission (FTC) report that identified federal and state laws that apply  differently to USPS private companies providing similar competitive  products. In addition, we obtained the views of postal stakeholders who  have previously submitted relevant public comments to obtain their views  on considerations regarding how these estimates could be updated.

Since USPS\u2019s  original establishment, its letter delivery monopoly has been both  broadened and reduced at various times through statutory and regulatory  changes that have redefined which types of correspondence and other  materials are covered. For example, the enactment of the 2006 Postal  Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) resulted in several changes  to USPS\u2019s letter delivery monopoly, including establishing price and  weight limits on mail covered by the monopoly.", "With regard to USPS\u2019s mailbox monopoly, legislation enacted in 1934  prohibited the delivery of unstamped mail into mailboxes, essentially  granting exclusive access to mailboxes (\u201cmailbox monopoly\u201d) to USPS  which remains in place to this day. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the  constitutionality of the mailbox monopoly in 1981, stating that mailboxes  are an essential part of national mail delivery and that postal customers  agree to abide by laws and regulations that apply to their mailboxes in  exchange for USPS agreeing to deliver and pick up mail. In addition,  USPS regulations restrict which types of items may be placed upon,  supported by, attached to, hung from, or inserted into a mailbox. The  Postal Inspection Service, a part of USPS, is responsible for enforcing  postal laws, including the restriction on placing mail without postage in  mailboxes and laws that prohibit mail theft, obstruction of mail, and mail  fraud.", "PAEA also set forth reporting requirements on USPS\u2019s letter delivery and  mailbox monopolies, its universal service obligation (USO), and laws that  apply differently to USPS and its competitors. Pursuant to these  requirements, PRC issued a 2008 report that, among other things,  estimated the value of USPS\u2019s letter delivery and mailbox monopolies  and the cost of its USO. The Federal Trade Commission issued a 2007  report that, among other things, estimated the financial impact of laws  that apply differently to USPS and its competitors.

PRC also examines  the impact of eliminating solely the mailbox monopoly using the same  methodology. Most of the postal experts we interviewed said they consider PRC\u2019s method of estimating the loss in mail volume and  revenues that USPS would experience if the monopolies were lifted to be  a reasonable approach to measuring their value.

Similarly, the value of the mailbox  monopoly alone rose from $700 million to $1.03 billion over the same  timeframe. Moving forward, although USPS\u2019s overall mail volumes are  declining, PRC staff told us that they believe the volume of mail that  entrants would be likely to successfully compete for if the monopolies  were eliminated will increase, and therefore the value of the monopolies  is expected to rise.

In particular, the study  examined the extra costs that are involved in door delivery\u2014the main  option available to USPS\u2019s competitors\u2014compared to delivery to  mailboxes, especially when mailboxes are located at the curbside, in  cluster boxes, or centralized mailrooms in large residential and  commercial buildings. Using the average costs of door delivery compared  to average delivery costs to these other mailbox locations that are less  costly to access, the study estimated that USPS\u2019s costs would have been  $14.9 billion greater in fiscal year 2013 if it had to deliver all mail and  packages to the door, as its competitors generally do. It is important to  note that this work did not measure the value of USPS\u2019s monopolies as  the reduction in USPS\u2019s net revenues if they were to be eliminated; as  such, this work is not comparable to PRC\u2019s analysis or estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relaxing USPS\u2019s Monopolies Could Likely Have Varied Effects", "paragraphs": ["Narrowing or eliminating (\u201crelaxing\u201d) USPS\u2019s letter delivery and mailbox  monopolies could likely have a number of varied effects.

One expert  opposed to relaxing USPS\u2019s mailbox monopoly noted that much of the  increased delivery to mailboxes\u2014were access to be broadened\u2014would  be advertising mail and suggested that it would be questionable to relax  this monopoly to primarily facilitate advertising distribution.", "USPS and PRC: USPS stated that relaxing its mailbox monopoly could  negatively affect mail safety and security and that doing so would result in  both decreased efficiencies and service performance, and threaten the  financing of its universal service obligation. First, USPS stated that  removing this monopoly could increase opportunities for criminal activity  involving mail and complicate the enforcement of postal laws. USPS  added that, in addition to direct harm to consumers and employees who  could be harmed by dangerous substances in mailboxes, USPS and the  mailing industry could suffer from the resulting lack of public trust in the  mail as a secure communication medium. Second, according to USPS, its  efficiency and service performance could also be adversely impacted,  particularly regarding the delivery of market-dominant mail volumes. For  example, increased mailbox clutter due to the presence of items left there  by third-parties would mean that USPS letter carriers would have to  spend time determining which items to take with them (collection mail)  and which to leave behind (items delivered by alternative delivery  providers)\u2014or may not be able to fit mail into a mailbox at all. Third,  USPS advised that allowing third-party mailbox deliveries could allow  competing providers to skim relatively profitable mail volume away from  USPS, leaving it with less revenue to finance the costs of its universal  service obligation. In regard to the mailbox monopoly, PRC cited its 2008  report, which stated that past public proceedings indicate a broad  spectrum of support for its continuation and cited disadvantages to USPS  if this monopoly were to be eliminated, including difficulty investigating  mail fraud, maintaining mail security, and efficiently collecting mail from  cluttered mailboxes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Postal Experts Believe Relaxing USPS\u2019s Monopolies Could Increase Competition, Efficiency, and Innovation", "paragraphs": ["Seven of the nine experts we interviewed said that relaxing USPS\u2019s  monopolies could create competition in the postal market.

For example, in the United  Kingdom, officials from Royal Mail stated that it had to modernize its  operations to successfully compete in the current postal market.

The significant deterioration in USPS\u2019s  financial condition, its increasing debt, and the grim forecast for declining  overall mail volumes over the next decade led GAO to add USPS\u2019s  financial condition to its High-Risk List in 2009. Moreover, the financial  condition of USPS is but one outcome of the changing landscape of the  postal sector. We reported in 2010 that, given the changing use of mail,  many of the statutory and regulatory elements that shape USPS\u2019s  structure and service\u2014as well as the broader delivery market\u2014might be  relevant to reconsider. These include (1) the appropriate universal  service obligation, in light of fundamental changes in the use of mail; (2)  whether USPS requires a monopoly over delivery of certain types of letter  mail and access to mailboxes to finance\u2014in part or wholly\u2014its universal  postal service obligation; and (3) whether USPS should be solely  responsible for providing universal postal service, or whether that  responsibility should be shared with the private sector. Such  considerations may assist Congress, USPS, and other postal  stakeholders as they work not only on issues related to the letter delivery  and mailbox monopolies, but also to address USPS\u2019s financial difficulties  and define its future role in an evolving postal marketplace."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Assessing the Impact of Laws that Apply Differently to USPS and Private Competitors Would Involve Various Considerations", "paragraphs": ["We have reported that, as long as it remains a federal entity protected by  the postal monopoly, USPS\u2019s ability to compete with the private sector  should be balanced with appropriate oversight and adequate legal  standards to ensure fair competition. In this regard, some postal  stakeholders have maintained that USPS has competitive advantages  because it is exempt from some laws governing the private sector. On the  other hand, USPS has reported that it is subject to statutory requirements  to which its private competitors are not. Given these differences, it is  important to understand the constraints and limitations that would  complicate the process of arriving at estimates that would be useful for  policymakers. To help summarize the key considerations that would need  to be addressed to estimate the value of USPS\u2019s financial advantages  and burdens resulting from laws that apply differently to USPS and its  private competitors, they are organized into four broad categories: (1)  objectives to study, (2) scope to be covered, (3) methodology to be used,  and (4) reporting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Study Objectives Would Need to Be Defined", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with government auditing standards, it would be important for  anyone examining the laws that apply differently to USPS and its private  competitors to carefully define the objectives of the study.

Developing these questions is a critical step, as their answers will  guide decisions on what specific information will be needed for reporting,  which in turn will identify the parameters of the study\u2019s scope and  methodology and lay the framework for the context in which the findings  are presented.

Scoping considerations for this type of study would  include, for example: (1) which laws to include, (2) whether to include  data already studied or collect new data, (3) how to address the difficulty  in quantifying some effects, and (4) how to handle differing stakeholder  views on scope.", "Many Laws Apply Differently to USPS Than to Its Competitors  Many laws apply differently to USPS and its competitors (see table 2).  FTC found that some laws have positive financial effects on USPS, while  others have negative financial effects. These laws also affect private  competitors; for example, USPS\u2019s letter and mailbox monopolies limit the  types of items competitors can deliver and where they can leave items.  The number and type of laws to be included in such a study would affect  its approach and eventual results. For example, significant time and  resources would be required for a study to estimate the financial effects  for all laws that apply differently to USPS and its competitors\u2014as well as  the net effect of these legal differences. If results were needed more  immediately\u2014or if financial resources were limited\u2014decisions would  need to be made to narrow the scope.", "The analysis of what laws to include and their impact on USPS\u2019s  operations is further complicated because while some laws appear to  provide USPS with financial advantages, whether or not they actually do  may depend on how they are interpreted and applied in practice. For  example, FTC\u2019s 2007 report stated that, although some jurisdictions  refrain from ticketing its vehicles, USPS has agreed to pay parking fines  in other jurisdictions; it is unclear whether USPS vehicles are exempt  from being ticketed. In another area, the FTC report found that USPS  benefits from \u201cdisparate customs treatment,\u201d but did not offer explanation  for the reasoning behind this finding. Further, postal pension and retiree  health benefit fund assets for postal retirees are in funds that by law are  required to be invested solely in Treasury securities, which are backed  by the full faith and credit of the federal government. In contrast, private companies can and do invest retirement funds in more diversified  portfolios.", "Use of Findings from Other Studies  Another consideration is what information to include from previous  studies. One would have to decide whether or not to use PRC\u2019s annual  estimates and reports on the financial effects on USPS of laws related to  its universal service and public service costs and the value of USPS\u2019s  monopolies. In postal labor negotiations, USPS has presented the result  of studies on the comparability of postal wages and benefits with the  private sector; however, the results have been contested by major postal  labor unions involved in collective bargaining.", "Challenges in Quantifying Some Effects  In some cases, effects may be challenging to quantify\u2014in part because  they have not been previously quantified, and in part due to the  complexity of developing estimates. For example, FTC\u2019s 2007 report that  estimated the effects of laws on USPS wages did not attempt to estimate  the financial effects of every law. FTC\u2019s report stated it would have been  difficult to quantify the effects of some laws, such as USPS\u2019s ability to  obtain property through eminent domain and disparate customs treatment  for USPS and its competitors. Overcoming these challenges may require  additional time and resources, as well as the acceptance of risk beyond  the control of the team conducting the study, such as lack of available  data.", "Addressing Differing Stakeholder Views on Scope  Key postal stakeholders hold differing views on what the scope of a  potential study might be. For example, although National Association of  Letter Carriers (NALC) officials told us that NALC does not see any  need for an update to the 2007 FTC report, they added that such an  update should not attempt to study the comparability of USPS wages to  the private sector. NALC officials explained that postal unions have  negotiated and debated with USPS over the definition of \u201ccomparability\u201d  and \u201ccomparable levels of work.\u201d NALC officials added that there is no  one objective or scientific definition of these terms, which must be  negotiated by the parties in the face of changing circumstances and  debate, and stated that the collective bargaining table is the appropriate  venue for this debate. In contrast, USPS officials told us that any future  study should estimate the comparability of both USPS wages and  benefits to the private sector."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Methodology Considerations Would Involve Judgments", "paragraphs": ["Government auditing standards state that a study\u2019s methodology  describes the nature and extent of procedures for gathering and  analyzing evidence needed to address its objectives, which should be  sufficient and appropriate to support findings to reduce the risk of  improper conclusions. When deciding upon a study\u2019s methodology, one  would need to address such challenges as (1) lack of consensus on  methodology options, (2) constraints on time and resources, and (3)  limitations on publicly available data and supporting documentation. The  decisions made about how to address these challenges would help  determine the usefulness of the estimates to policymakers.", "Lack of Consensus of Methodology Options  No consensus exists on the most appropriate methodology that should be  used to estimate the financial effects of certain laws that apply differently  to USPS and its competitors. For example, USPS officials told us that  there is no generally accepted consensus on how to measure the  comparability of postal wages and benefits and said it has used  numerous methodologies over the years to make estimates in this area. A  NALC official explained that USPS and postal unions have long disagreed  on the definition of \u201ccomparability\u201d and \u201ccomparable\u201d levels of work.  Depending on how a study approaches this issue, it could affect decisions  about methodology and data. USPS has preferred to define comparability  as the level of USPS wages and benefits for different jobs performed by  USPS relative to similar jobs performed by companies in the entire private  sector (e.g., similar jobs performed by USPS competitors and mail  processing jobs performed by private companies in the mailing industry),  while the postal unions have preferred to compare USPS with its large  competitors such as United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx.", "Potential Constraints on Time and Resources  Some methodologies would require considerable time and resources to  collect the necessary data, and any constraints in these areas may  influence the choice of methodology. A study estimating the financial  effects of all laws that apply differently to USPS and its private  competitors would require significant time and resources; if estimates  were desired in a shorter time frame\u2014or if financial resources were  limited\u2014tradeoffs would be required. For example, USPS officials told us  that, when estimating the value of USPS\u2019s exemption from property and  real estate taxes for USPS-owned properties, the most appropriate data  would be the current assessed value of each USPS-owned property and  the current applicable tax rate(s). However, they noted that USPS does  not have data on the assessed value for its owned properties. They  estimated that collecting data on a valid sample of USPS-owned  properties would require specialists such as tax assessors and  appraisers, and cost $7.6 million to $9 million\u2014an amount they deemed  to be cost-prohibitive. With respect to estimating wage and benefit  comparability, USPS officials stated that the different types of work  performed by postal employees in the various bargaining units does not  lend itself to a one-size-fits-all approach to private sector comparability or  a single answer for all USPS employees. They said that USPS has  generally used multiple methodologies to estimate wage and benefit  comparability in each collective bargaining proceeding. They also noted  that some of these methodologies require a high degree of expertise  and/or subject matter knowledge, such as expertise in statistical or  regression analyses, as well as specialized knowledge and experience in  employee compensation and wage determination. These factors have  implications for the time and resources that would be required to estimate  wage and benefit comparability.", "Additionally, USPS officials said that collecting data on the value of  USPS\u2019s exemption from vehicle registration fees would require a review  of state registration fees for each state and vehicle type, as well as other  information.", "Limitations on Public Data and Supporting Documentation  Some USPS data and documentation that could be useful for a future  study may not be publicly available, either because USPS has not been  asked to disclose it in public proceedings or because it is considered  exempt from public disclosure. For example, USPS is not required to  disclose information prepared for use in connection with the negotiation of  collective bargaining agreements, which would include USPS studies of  wage and benefits comparability prepared for such negotiations. While  data and documentation relating to USPS\u2019s competitive products could be  instrumental to evaluating any specific financial effects of legal  advantages and disadvantages on competitive products, USPS often  classifies this information as proprietary and does not disclose it  publicly. In addition, according to USPS officials, certain data may need  to be collected from USPS\u2019s private competitors who may consider such  data to be proprietary and exempt from public disclosure, such as trade  secrets. Thus, it is unclear whether these data and their supporting  documentation would be available to certain organizations conducting  such a study and, if so, under what circumstances and with what  limitations they may be able to be discussed in a publicly-available report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reporting Considerations", "paragraphs": ["In order for estimates to be as useful as possible to readers, the report  would need to include sufficient information to allow for informed  discussion about the results.

Regardless of the reasons behind any given proposal, estimating the  potential financial effects of specific laws could provide Congress and  other stakeholders with information that could be used to consider  possible changes to these laws. Estimates of the effects of certain laws  on USPS, specifically on its competitive products, and on these products  relative to its competitors could be different in their nature and timeframes  than the information regularly provided by the Congressional Budget  Office (CBO) on the estimated financial effects of proposed laws on  federal government revenues and expenses.", "Considering the longstanding disagreements over controversial issues in  this area, it would be particularly helpful for such a study to be conducted  by an independent party free of conflicts of interest.

USPS also wrote that, in the current financial environment, it would not be  responsible for policymakers to implement such changes while  maintaining the USO in its current form. Our report acknowledges these  points and states that postal stakeholders and experts agree that actions  to narrow or eliminate USPS\u2019s monopolies could reduce its revenues,  placing a greater financial burden on USPS and threatening its ability to  provide universal service.", "Regarding the relaxation of foreign postal monopolies, USPS emphasized  that other reforms were made in tandem with changes to postal  monopolies in other countries, including government aid and changes to  afford the incumbent carrier greater commercial freedom to manage its  businesses. Although our draft report stated that we found broad  consensus among postal stakeholders and experts\u2014as well as both  USPS and PRC\u2014that any potential changes to USPS\u2019s monopolies  should be considered in tandem with broader postal policies, we updated  our report to include additional context in response to USPS\u2019s comments.", "USPS took issue with the information provided by officials from foreign  posts and regulators that the narrowing or elimination of their monopolies  resulted in increased efficiency, and noted that many other postal policies  were undertaken at the same time, as discussed above. Moreover, USPS  wrote that the effects of postal liberalization in other countries has no  bearing upon USPS because some of the efficiency advances that other  countries have seen in recent years were realized many years ago in the  United States. Our report states that it is important to remember the  context in which the posts operate differs greatly from one country to the  next, and that each country is in a unique situation and uses specific  measures to address its challenges and opportunities. At the same time,  we state that although we did not directly evaluate the implications of  each liberalization experience or how it may apply to the United States,  the experiences nonetheless provide important context for the  consideration of any changes to USPS\u2019s monopolies.

In response to USPS\u2019s suggested clarification of PRC\u2019s  estimates presented in table 1, we added a note to make it clear that,  while PRC\u2019s estimates presented in the table represent the effect on  USPS\u2019s net income if its mailbox monopoly or both monopolies were to  be eliminated, it is not the case that subtracting the estimated value of the  mailbox monopoly from the estimated value of the combined letter  delivery and mailbox monopolies provides the value of the letter delivery  monopoly alone. In addition, USPS also expressed concern that the  discussion of the 2015 paper by Robert Shapiro could wrongly imply  equivalent credibility to the work performed by PRC. We recognize this  concern. Our report states that Shapiro\u2019s work did not measure the value  of the monopolies as the reduction in USPS\u2019s net revenues if they were to  be eliminated, but rather focuses on other financial implications of the  mailbox monopoly.

First, we  created and distributed a questionnaire to 21 postal stakeholder  organizations (\u201cstakeholders\u201d) that (1) testified and filed comments during  the public comment solicitations as part of the work of the 2003  President\u2019s Commission on the USPS; (2) provided testimony or  comments to PRC on universal service and the postal monopoly, and (3)  GAO previously surveyed during audit work conducted in support of the  prior GAO reported titled U.S. Postal Service: Strategies and Options to  Facilitate Progress toward Financial Viability. We initially selected and  contacted 25 organizations\u2014including postal unions, management  associations, mailing associations, and private companies\u2014to which it  was planned to distribute the questionnaire. Subsequently, GAO learned  that two of these stakeholders were no longer in existence and that two of  them had merged into a single organization, resulting in a list of 21  stakeholders who received a copy of the questionnaire. GAO pretested  this questionnaire with two stakeholders to ensure that it was clearly  worded, unbiased, comprehensive, and that terminology was used  correctly and made changes to the content of the questions in response.  GAO received responses from 16 of the 21 stakeholders\u2014a response  rate of 76.2 percent\u201411 of which were completed questionnaires and 5  were comprised of correspondence answering some or all the questions  posed. We also provided this questionnaire to USPS and PRC, both of  whom completed it. In addition, we also conducted structured interviews  with nine postal experts to obtain their views on the potential impacts of  narrowing or eliminating USPS\u2019s monopolies. Many of these experts were  identified as postal consultants and individuals who worked on or  commented on PRC\u2019s 2008 report on universal service and the postal  monopoly; others were recommended by stakeholders or agency  officials. We determined through a literature search and prior audit work  that each expert has substantial knowledge and experience in postal  issues. We created and pretested an interview guide with two experts to  ensure that questions were accurate, clear, and unbiased, and made  changes in response. We analyzed the responses received from postal  stakeholders and experts and summarized both their reasons for favoring,  opposing, or holding no position on whether USPS\u2019s monopolies should  be narrowed or eliminated and what they believed the potential effects of  doing so may be. While the responses from the judgmentally-selected  group of postal stakeholders and experts are not generalizable, they  provide a wide range of views among those who have previously  expressed views on the postal monopoly and related policy issues\u2014and  represent some of the key groups with whom Congress interacts when  developing postal policy.", "Further, to determine what have been the experiences of foreign postal  administrations in selected industrialized countries that have narrowed or  eliminated its postal monopolies, we collected information from the top 20  major postal markets, as determined by the Universal Postal Union  (UPU), a specialized agency of the United Nations that coordinates  international postal polices. Using this information, we identified countries  (1) with the largest global shares of postal revenue and domestic mail, (2)  with developed economies (classified by their level of development as  measured by per capita gross national income); and (3) have fully  liberalized their postal monopoly laws. Based on these criteria, we  selected six countries\u2013Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Sweden, and the  United Kingdom. Using a list of contacts provided by PRC officials, we  sent requests to both the postal administration and regulator in each of  these six nations to obtain information regarding their respective  liberalization experiences.

Contestable mail is of most interest to an entrant  because there is minimal work related to sorting and transport. For the  analysis of the elimination of both monopolies, all contestable mail  categories are considered to be available to a potential entrant, should it  decide to serve the route. In the case of the analysis of the mailbox  monopoly alone, PRC only analyzes the contestable mail categories that  fall outside of the letter delivery monopoly. In the latter case, private  delivery companies are currently allowed to provide such service, such as  delivery of magazines and advertising mail not covered by USPS\u2019s  delivery monopoly; however, because private delivery companies are not  currently able to place items in mailboxes, they may choose not to deliver  these items.

To ascertain which routes an entrant might serve, PRC uses data  on mail volumes, by each type of mail category, for a sample of routes it  obtains from USPS. Based on that route-level volume data, and the  specific economic assumptions described above, PRC is able to calculate  the entrant\u2019s prospective profitability on the set of sample routes\u2014and  thus ascertain which routes the entrant would enter if the monopolies  were lifted. Once the entered routes are determined, PRC can estimate  USPS\u2019s volume and revenue losses due to entry. PRC\u2019s calculation of  USPS\u2019s expected loss in net revenues is considered to be the estimated  \u201cvalue\u201d of USPS\u2019s monopolies.", "Some Considerations of PRC Method  PRC\u2019s economic analysis informs, with caveats, stakeholders and  decision-makers about the value of USPS\u2019s monopolies. However, some  elements of its analysis are important to consider when interpreting the  findings. In particular:", "PRC assumes that if an entrant chooses to serve a route\u2014that is, the  entrant believes it can make a profit on the route\u2014it will immediately  garner 100-percent of the contestable mail volume on that route.  However, in practice, it may take time for an entrant to gain a  significant foothold in the market. Alternative assumptions or  sensitivity analyses that attempt to consider the time an entrant would  require to build its business\u2014in part due to how mailers make  purchasing decisions when there are multiple competitors\u2014might  shed light on the reasonableness of the model\u2019s current assumptions  on the entrant\u2019s market share.", "PRC uses USPS data on individual postal routes as the geographic  level for this analysis. However, it is possible that potential entrants  could make decisions on a broader regional basis, particularly  because mailers (i.e., the entrant\u2019s potential customers) might make  their purchasing decisions on a broader geographic basis. PRC staff  told us that routes abutting one another typically have similar volume  characteristics, which would minimize concerns about the small  geographic scope of the PRC approach. Nevertheless, it is difficult to  ascertain the extent to which using this small geographic scope in this  analysis would result in a pattern of entry in alignment with a viable  business plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PRC\u2019s Estimated Value of USPS\u2019s Monopolies Has Risen in Recent Years Due to Increased Volumes of Contestable Mail", "paragraphs": ["Since 2008, PRC has conducted an annual analysis to estimate the lost  net revenues that USPS would incur if its monopolies were eliminated.  For 2015, which is the most recent year available, PRC estimated that the  elimination of both the letter and mailbox monopolies would result in  $5.45 billion loss in net revenues for USPS, while the elimination of solely  the mailbox monopoly would result in $1.03 billion in lost net revenues.  PRC staff told us that increases in the value of the postal monopolies in  recent years were due to growing contestable mail volumes, and added  that they expect these volumes to continue rising in the near future.
