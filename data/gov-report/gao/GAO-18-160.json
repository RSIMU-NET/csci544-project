The territories, like U.S. states in some cases, borrow through financial markets. Puerto Rico in particular has amassed large amounts of debt, and defaulted on billions of dollars of debt payments. In response to the fiscal crisis in Puerto Rico, Congress enacted and the President signed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) in June of 2016, which established an Oversight Board with broad powers of budgetary and financial control over Puerto Rico and requires GAO to study fiscal issues in all five U.S. territories.", "In this report, for each territory for fiscal years 2005-2015, GAO examined (1) trends in public debt and its composition, (2) trends in revenue and its composition, (3) the major reported drivers of the territory's public debt, and (4) what is known about the ability of each territory to repay public debt.", "GAO analyzed the territories' single audit reports; interviewed officials from the territories' governments, ratings agencies, and subject matter experts; and reviewed documents and prior GAO work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Puerto Rico: Between fiscal years 2005 and 2014, the latest figures available, Puerto Rico's total public debt outstanding (public debt) grew from $39.2 billion to $67.8 billion, reaching 66 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Despite some revenue growth, Puerto Rico's net position was negative and declining during the period, reflecting its deteriorating financial position. Experts pointed to several factors as contributing to Puerto Rico's high debt levels, and in September 2016 Puerto Rico missed up to $1.5 billion in debt payments. The outcome of the ongoing debt restructuring process will determine future debt repayment.", "American Samoa: American Samoa's public debt more than doubled in fiscal year 2015 to $69.5 million, but remained small relative to its economy, with a debt to GDP ratio of 10.9 percent. American Samoa's debt was primarily used to fund infrastructure projects. Between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, revenues grew and the government's net position was positive and generally improving. GAO previously reported that American Samoa relies heavily on the tuna processing and canning industry. Disruptions in this industry could affect its ability to repay debt.", "Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI): CNMI's public debt declined from $251.7 million to $144.7 million between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, decreasing CNMI's debt to GDP ratio to 16 percent. Most of CNMI's debt was used to refinance prior debt and fund infrastructure projects. Despite revenue growth since fiscal year 2011, CNMI's net position was negative and generally declining during the period. GAO previously reported that labor shortages may affect GDP. This could impede CNMI's ability to repay debt in the future.", "Guam: Between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, Guam's public debt more than doubled from almost $1 billion to $2.5 billion, with a debt to GDP ratio of 44 percent for fiscal year 2015. Most of Guam's debt was used to comply with federal requirements and court orders. Revenue grew during this period, and net position fluctuated significantly, with a negative balance in fiscal year 2015. Despite recent and expected economic growth, GAO found that large unfunded pension and other post-employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities may present a risk.", "U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI): Between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, USVI's public debt nearly doubled, reaching $2.6 billion and a debt to GDP ratio of 72 percent. Since 2010, most of USVI's debt was used to fund general government operations. Revenue remained stagnant and net position was negative and declining during the period, reflecting a deteriorating financial position. While USVI holds a year's worth of debt service payments in reserve, GAO found that economic uncertainty and looming government pension fund insolvency by 2023 may hamper repayment. In early 2017, USVI was unable to access capital markets to issue new debt at favorable rates. Although the government adopted a financial plan intended to reduce expenditures and increase revenue, the plan does not address USVI's significant unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities and it is unclear whether the plan will produce the intended level of savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States has five territories\u2014Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam, and the  U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI)\u2014that are permanently inhabited and have  elected governors, territorial legislatures, and non-voting members in the  U.S. House of Representatives. Local officials make budgetary decisions  about borrowing and therefore the level of debt held by the public in each  territory. These territories, like U.S. states in some cases, borrow through  financial markets for long-term investments, such as infrastructure  projects, or when their budgets are in deficit. The territories, like other  borrowers, pay interest on their debt. Both the amounts borrowed and the  interest rates determine the amount of interest spending. If unchecked,  interest spending can absorb resources that could be used instead to  provide government services. In extreme situations, borrowers might be  unable to borrow at favorable rates if the market loses confidence in their  ability to repay the debt.", "Puerto Rico, in particular, has amassed large amounts of debt.

In  addition, we obtained and reviewed data on each of the territories\u2019  revenue from the same single audit reports for each fiscal year for both  the primary governments and component units.  Our analysis primarily  focused on trends in general revenues  because the territories\u2019 public  debt is either explicitly or implicitly backed by general revenues.

With the exception of Puerto Rico each of the territories  received modified opinions by auditors on one or more of the single audit  reports included in our analysis. We reviewed each of these opinions and  determined that despite the modified opinions the data we obtained from  each of the single audit reports was reliable for the purpose of describing  trends in debt and revenue and their composition for the fiscal years  included in our analysis.", "To determine the major reported drivers of public debt and what is known  about the territories\u2019 ability to repay, we interviewed officials from the  territories\u2019 governments, including officials from the Governors\u2019 offices,  departments of finance or treasury, and the agency responsible for  issuing and marketing bonded debt. In addition, we interviewed  representatives of the three rating agencies\u2014 Fitch, Moody\u2019s and  Standard and Poor\u2019s\u2014that provide credit ratings for the territories\u2019  securities and an investment bank involved with underwriting the  territories\u2019 bonds.

In addition, we obtained and reviewed relevant  documentation, reports, and analyses from the territorial governments  and ratings agencies.

These factors  included 1) the extent to which territories consistently issued debt to fund  general government operations, 2) the extent to which territories\u2019  economies were vulnerable to shocks due to a heavy dependence on a  single or limited industry, and 3) the extent to which territories faced large  fiscal risks such as pension liabilities.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2016 to October  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Bonds payable are marketable bonded  debt securities issued by the territories\u2019 primary governments or their  component units and held by investors outside those governments. The  primary government is generally comprised of governmental activities  (generally financed with taxes and intergovernmental aid) and business- type activities (generally financed with charges for goods and services).  Component units are legally separate entities for which a government is  financially accountable. For the purposes of this report, any reference to  total government activity and balances includes both the primary  government and component units. Other debt payable may include  shorter term marketable notes and bills issued by territorial governments  and held by investors outside those governments, non-marketable  intragovernmental notes, notes held by local banks, federal loans,  intragovernmental loans, and loans issued by local banks. Pension  liabilities and other post-employment benefits (OPEB)  are not included  in our definition of total public debt.", "Marketable debt securities, primarily bonds with long-term maturities, are  the main vehicle by which the territories access capital markets. Municipal  bonds issued by all five territories have traditionally been attractive to  investors because they are triple tax exempt; interest from the bonds is  generally not subject to federal, state, and local income taxes regardless  of an investor\u2019s state of residence. There are several different types of  marketable debt securities:", "General obligation bonds are bonds issued by territorial governments  that are payable from the general funds of the issuer, although the  precise source and priority of payment for general obligation bonds  may vary considerably from issuer to issuer depending on applicable  law. Most general obligation bonds are said to entail the full faith and  credit (and in many cases the taxing power) of the issuer, depending  on applicable law. In USVI, unlike in the other four territories in which  general obligations bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the  government, debt issued by the primary government is either backed  by 1) both a general obligation of the government and revenue from  USVI\u2019s gross receipts tax, or 2) revenue from the federal excise tax on  rum rebated to the territory.", "Limited obligation bonds are bonds payable from specific taxes that  are limited by law in rate or amount, while revenue bonds are payable  from specific sources of revenue.", "Marketable notes differ from bonds in that they are short-term  obligations of an issuer to repay a specified principal amount on a  certain date, together with interest at a stated rate, usually payable  from a defined source of anticipated revenues. Notes usually mature  in 1 year or less, although notes of longer maturities are also issued.", "Bonds and notes may be issued by both the territories\u2019 primary  governments and by their component units.

Three territories\u2014Guam, CNMI, and USVI\u2014are required by U.S.  law to have a mirror tax code.  In general this means that these  territories must use the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) as their  territorial income tax law. In contrast, American Samoa and Puerto Rico,  which are not bound by a mirror tax code, have established and  promulgated their own income tax regulations. Although Guam and CNMI  are mirror-code jurisdictions, they are authorized under the Tax Reform  Act of 1986 to delink from the IRC if certain conditions are met.", "Revenues are amounts that result from governments\u2019 exercise of their  sovereign power to tax or otherwise compel payment.

In addition to general revenue levels, another measure of  fiscal health is the net position for primary government activities, which  represents the difference between the primary government\u2019s assets  (including the deferred outflows of resources) and the primary  government\u2019s liabilities (including the deferred inflows of resources). In  other words, the net position for primary government activities reflects  what the primary government would have left after satisfying its liabilities.  A negative net position means that the primary government has more  liabilities than assets. A decline in net position may indicate a  deteriorating financial position.

Fiscal risks may be explicit in that the government is legally required to  fund the commitment, or implicit in that an exposure arises not from a  legal commitment, but from current policy, past practices, or other factors  that may create the expectation for future spending.

Despite the increase, the fiscal year 2015 general  revenue of $919.4 million was only about $43 million greater than that  collected 10 years prior. In contrast USVI\u2019s total revenue (i.e. general  revenue and program revenue combined) grew slightly by 2 percent on  average, per year, between fiscal years 2005 and 2015, from $1.6 billion  to $1.9 billion. (See figure 22.)", "USVI has a statutory requirement that a team, composed of senior  executives and legislative officials, meet at least twice a year to establish  an official economic forecast of the territorial economy, including  estimates of the following year\u2019s revenue.  Territory officials  acknowledged that in recent years actual revenues have been less than  had been estimated, citing both adverse economic conditions and  litigation that had blocked the collection of property taxes for several  years. These officials said that a new estimation methodology has been  devised which uses a weighted average of the prior 5 years of actual  revenue.", "USVI\u2019s net position for the primary government declined year over year  from a negative $215.0 million as of fiscal year end 2008 to a negative  $1.5 billion as of fiscal year end 2014; continuing to decline to a negative  $3.7 billion as of fiscal year end 2015.  USVI\u2019s net position for the  primary government as of fiscal year end 2014 is shown prior to  restatement implementing GASB Statement No. 68. In fiscal year 2015,  USVI implemented GASB Statement No. 68 and adjusted its beginning  net position by $2.0 billion, resulting in a restated net position as of fiscal  year end 2014 of a negative $3.5 billion. The implementation of GASB  Statement No. 68 resulted in the territory recognizing previously  unrecognized net pension liabilities and, therefore, a decline in ending net  position in the year of recognition. USVI\u2019s declining net position for its  primary government reflects its deteriorating financial position.", "USVI\u2019s total net position for the primary government and component units  combined increased between fiscal year end 2005 and 2007; it then  declined year over year from positive $490.9 million as of fiscal year end  2008 to negative $3.6 billion as of fiscal year end 2015."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Since 2010, USVI\u2019s Public Debt Has Been Used Primarily for General Government Operations", "paragraphs": ["More than a third of USVI\u2019s current bonded debt outstanding as of fiscal  year 2015 was issued to fund government operating costs. Before that  time bonded debt outstanding issued on behalf of the primary government  was used either to refinance earlier bond issues; fund infrastructure  projects such as improvements to schools, public safety facilities, and  transportation infrastructure; or to assist privately-owned industrial  enterprises, specifically construction at the Cruzan and Diageo rum  distilleries and payment of a portion of the costs of sewage and solid  waste disposal at the Hovensa oil refinery.", "In the period following the recession of 2008, revenues declined and  there were continuing demands for spending. In response, USVI issued  debt for the purpose of financing regular government operating expenses.  Between July 2010 and December 2014, USVI issued almost $850 million  in bonds for this purpose with maturities ranging between 1 and 20  years.", "According to territory officials, several factors contributed to USVI\u2019s  increasing reliance on debt to fund government operations, including the  recession of 2008, the 2012 closure of the Hovensa oil refinery, a decline  in USVI\u2019s share of worldwide rum sales, and a decline in visits from cruise  ship passengers. According to a senior government official, the closure of  the Hovensa refinery was particularly detrimental to the territory\u2019s  economy and resulted in the loss of 2,000 jobs on St. Croix and a  significant decrease in revenue. As of April 2017, USVI\u2019s unemployment  rate was 10.3 percent.", "USVI officials cited several federal requirements that contributed to  USVI\u2019s need to issue debt. Because USVI is part of the mirror tax code,  officials noted that USVI is required to pay the EITC to its residents, but is  not reimbursed for this by the federal government. In contrast, state  governments do not pay EITC because it is a federal benefit administered  through the federal tax code.  EPA directives for improving landfills and  water projects and federal banking regulations that treat branches of U.S.  banks placed in USVI as non-U.S. banks\u2014thereby discouraging large  banks from having branches in USVI\u2014were also cited as reasons that  USVI has issued debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Uncertainty and Large Fiscal Risks May Significantly Limit USVI\u2019s Ability to Repay Public Debt", "paragraphs": ["USVI officials expressed confidence in the territory\u2019s ability to repay public  debt, but we found that large fiscal risks and exclusion from capital  markets may hamper its ability to do so. USVI\u2019s bonds are backed by the  gross receipts tax on some individuals and entities doing business in  USVI and by excise tax revenues collected by the federal government  and remitted to USVI as required by statute. Officials said that revenues  from the gross receipts tax and excise tax rebates\u2014from which debt  service payments are made\u2014are monitored on a month-by-month basis.  Also, officials cited as a protection against default the \u201clockbox\u201d provisions  that USVI has had contractually for some time and that were written into  its statutes in 2016. According to these provisions, gross receipts tax  and excise rebate revenue go directly to an escrow account in a New  York bank, and the escrow agent makes debt service payments twice a  year from the account; a year\u2019s worth of payments is held in reserve at all  times.", "USVI officials expressed confidence that these provisions make it difficult  for USVI to default on its debt payments. However, in a recent statement,  Moody\u2019s rating service said that these security provisions have not been  tested in a stress scenario where the government faces a lack of funds to  provide basic services. This observation was part of a statement issued  by Moody\u2019s in late January 2017 in which it announced it had  downgraded USVI\u2019s matching fund bonds (those backed by excise tax  rebates) to noninvestment grade.", "Other rating agencies expressed similar concerns. For example, Standard  & Poor\u2019s cited 1) the government\u2019s fiscal distress, as evidenced by its  significant structural imbalance and continued reliance on deficit financing  to fund operations; 2) revenue backed bond issues that have exhibited  either declining or flat growth absent tax rate increases and are levied on  a limited and concentrated base; 3) adequate, but substantially reduced,  debt service coverage; and 4) a limited economy, concentrated in rum  production, tourism, and government.", "In late January 2017, USVI cancelled a new bond issuance it was  attempting to market to provide additional financing for general  government operations. The bond issuance was authorized by the USVI  legislature in 2016, but according to a senior bank official involved in  underwriting USVI bonds, delays in bringing the issuance to market, and  the legislature\u2019s delay in enacting so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d on items such as  beer, cigarettes, and liquor, reduced the chances of successfully  marketing the bond issue to investors. By the time USVI made an effort to  market the bonds in late 2016 and January 2017, the Puerto Rico debt  crisis had increased investors\u2019 concerns about USVI\u2019s debt as well. The  rating downgrades of existing USVI debt, while not the decisive factor  according to the bank official, did reinforce existing skepticism on the part  of potential investors. Ultimately, the early 2017 bond issuance was not  adequately subscribed and the offer failed. USVI effectively lost market  access to new debt even at high interest rates.", "In September 2016, the administration released its 5-year financial plan.  The two major features of this plan were a reduction in government  expenditures by limiting hiring and reducing non-personnel costs, and a  proposal for increasing revenue through taxes on beer, rum, wine,  brandy, sugar-laden carbonated beverages, and cigarettes, among other  revenue generating measures. The legislature passed the tax increase  bill, with some modification of the Governor\u2019s proposal, in early March  and the Governor signed it into law on March 22, 2017.", "In the 5-year financial plan, the administration said that adopting austerity  and tax measures would eliminate future deficits, which otherwise would  amount to more than $130 million for each fiscal year between 2017 and  2021. A senior USVI official expressed a belief that the level of  consumption of cigarettes, for example, will remain at pretax levels  despite the higher cost. However, due to elasticity of demand, an  increase in the price of cigarettes could decrease cigarette consumption  and therefore revenues. If the tax increases do not produce the  anticipated level of revenue, and if USVI is not able to regain access to  capital markets, it will place even more stress on the debt service  arrangements currently in effect.", "Moreover, the recent measures do not address the fiscal risk presented  by unfunded pension liabilities and OPEB for government employees.  USVI reported an unfunded pension liability of over $3 billion, which was  83 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2015.  According to an independent  consulting firm\u2019s August 2016 report conducted for the USVI Government  Employees Retirement System, the retirement fund will become insolvent  in 2023 without adding financial resources and adjusting benefit levels.", "Territory officials cited several reasons for the large unfunded pension  and OPEB benefit liabilities. These include recent legislation that resulted in more retirees eligible for pensions and a decline in the active USVI  government workforce that resulted in a narrower ratio of retirees to  workers, dropping from 6-to-1 in fiscal year 1982 to almost 1-to-1 in fiscal  year 2015. In addition, officials told us that the most significant cause for  the current condition of the retirement system is the primary government  making contributions to the system below the amounts required by law.", "Some measures have been taken to address the retirement fund\u2019s  impending insolvency, and other steps have been recommended.  According to territory officials, USVI law changed in 2005, resulting in  increased required pension contributions from all newly hired employees  except for judges and legislators. In 2013, a Pension Reform Task Force  (Task Force) recommended legislation that would 1) increase government  and employee contributions towards pension benefits, 2) raise  contribution rates for senators and judges, 3) reduce retiree current  benefits by 10 percent, 4) increase the early retirement age from 50 to 55  and the regular retirement age from 60 to 65, 5) limit cost of living  increases, and 6) change the formula used to calculate benefits.", "In October 2015, the Legislature enacted and the Governor signed  legislation that raised retirement ages for some employees, changed the  basis for determining pension levels to career earnings, and allowed the  retirement system to invest funds in lower-rated securities. This did not,  however, address most of the Task Force recommendations. Territory  officials told us that the administration will put forward additional pension  reform proposals in the near future, however it remains unclear what  those reforms will entail and when they will take effect.", "Moreover, territory officials told us that since 2011 the government has  paid less than half of actual post-employment benefit costs, leaving an  unpaid current obligation of $357 million as of fiscal year 2015. The  unfunded liability for post-employment benefits, projecting anticipated  future costs, was most recently calculated in October 2013; at that time it  was just over $1 billion. USVI\u2019s pension and OPEB obligations are  already contributing to the territory\u2019s debt burden, and will likely continue  to do so at an increasing rate.

With the exception of Puerto Rico, each of the territories  received modified opinions by auditors on one or more of the single audit  reports included in our analysis.

All tax revenues, including tax revenues that are  dedicated to particular purposes, are reported in general revenues. Tax  revenues represent the largest component of general revenues and  include both derived tax revenues (resulting from assessments imposed  on exchange transactions, such as income taxes and sales taxes) and  imposed nonexchange revenues (resulting from assessments imposed on  non-exchange transactions, such as property taxes and fines). General  revenues also include other forms of revenue, such as unrestricted aid  from other governments and investment earnings. Our analysis primarily  focused on trends in general revenues because the territories\u2019 public debt  is either explicitly or implicitly backed by general revenues. We also  included total revenue\u2014general revenues and program revenues   combined\u2014in our analysis because it reflects revenue generated by the  territories\u2019 component units and could be used to service debt payments.", "In addition to general revenue levels, another measure of fiscal health is  the net position for primary government activities, which represents the  difference between the primary government\u2019s assets (including the  deferred outflows of resources) and the primary government\u2019s liabilities  (including the deferred inflows of resources). In other words, the net  position for primary government activities reflects what the primary  government would have left after satisfying its liabilities. A negative net  position means that the primary government has more liabilities than  assets. A decline in net position may be indicative of a deteriorating  financial position. While our analysis primarily focuses on trends in the net  position for the primary government, we also include certain information  on trends in the total net position for the primary government and  component units combined.", "To determine the major reported drivers of public debt and what is known  about the territories\u2019 ability to repay this debt, we interviewed officials from  the territories\u2019 governments, including officials from the Governors\u2019  offices, departments of finance or treasury, and the agency responsible  for issuing and marketing bonded debt.

Our responses to Guam\u2019s technical comments are not corrections.", "After reviewing Guam\u2019s comments, we expanded the information  provided on revenue and net position for all 5 territories. For example,  for Guam, we included on pages 41 and 42 of this report, additional  information on revenue where we combine primary government  revenue and component unit revenue.  2.  Since our objective was to provide the most comprehensive metric of  total public debt, it would have been incorrect for us to exclude public  enterprise and revenue bond debt in our measure.  3.  We do not compare the relative public debt burdens of the territories  in this report. Further, pension liabilities are not included in our  definition of public debt. Our definition of total public debt does include  component unit debt, which Guam excludes from the calculations  presented in its response.  4.  On pages 41 and 42 of this report we include both a measure of  primary government revenue, and a measure of primary government  revenue and component unit revenue combined; an \u201capples-to- apples\u201d comparison can be made to our total public debt figure, which  includes component unit debt.  5.  Our calculation of total public debt outstanding for Guam is the total of  bonds payable and notes payable, both the current and noncurrent  portions, and other debt as defined on page 8 of this report. Guam\u2019s  calculation of total public debt outstanding as shown in the table is all  noncurrent liabilities except the net pension liability and results in a  higher amount for fiscal year 2015 than our calculation. For bonds  payable, our calculation includes both the current and noncurrent  portions of bonds payable. Guam\u2019s calculation of bonds payable as  shown in the table only includes the noncurrent portion and results in  a lower amount for fiscal year 2015 than our calculation. As a result of  these differences, our calculation of bonded debt outstanding as a  percentage of total public debt outstanding for fiscal year 2015 is  higher than Guam\u2019s calculation.  6.  As noted on page 42 of this report, while revenue generally grew,  Guam\u2019s net position for the primary government fluctuated  significantly between fiscal years 2005 and 2015. Since fiscal year  end 2006, Guam\u2019s net position for the primary government has been  negative and trending downward. Guam\u2019s total net position for the  primary government and component units also combined fluctuated  significantly. On page 41 and 42 of this report, we explicitly note the  increase in revenue, however in the long-term significant financial  risks may outweigh any given year\u2019s revenue increase.  7.  Based on our methodology, which includes component unit debt,  Guam\u2019s total public debt outstanding was $2.5 billion for fiscal year  2015.  8.  We used total public debt outstanding, not solely tax-supported debt  to calculate the debt-to-GDP ratio for all 5 territories. As reported on  page 39 of this report, Guam\u2019s debt to GDP ratio is 44 percent for total  public debt and 42 percent for bonded debt for fiscal year 2015. We  do not rank the U.S. territories in this report.  9.  The per capita amounts presented in the report are based on debt  amounts from Guam\u2019s fiscal year 2015 audit as reported in the single  audit report. However, the debt amounts and population figure shown  in the table differ from those used in our calculations. Total public debt  and bonded public debt outstanding used in our per capita  calculations are calculated as discussed in comment 5 above, which  differ by about $7 million from the amounts cited in the table. In  addition, the population figure used in our per capita calculations is on  a fiscal year basis, which results in 161,500 for fiscal year 2015.  10. Pension liabilities are not included in our definition of public debt. The  debt per capita numbers that we present in this report are based on   total public debt. For Guam that figure for fiscal year 2015 was $2.5  billion.  11. We disagree with Guam\u2019s comment that the presentation in this report  is negative. The final section in the discussion of Guam notes both the  elements that may contribute to continued economic growth in Guam  and the vulnerabilities and risks to the future: a high total debt burden  and vulnerability to economic changes in its tourism and military  industries.
