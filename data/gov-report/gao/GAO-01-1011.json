Concern has arisen that the increasing use of these medications in school might provide additional opportunities for drug abuse. No data exists on the extent to which attention disorder drugs have been diverted or abused at school, or the extent to which state laws or regulations guide local school officials in safely administering these drugs. Middle and high school principals reported little diversion or abuse of attention disorder drugs. For the first seven to nine months of school year 2000-2001, about eight percent of principals in public middle and high schools reported that attention disorder drugs had been diverted or abused at their school. Most of the principals reported that school officials administer attention disorder medications, with about two percent of the school's students on average being administered attention disorder drugs on a typical day. Medications are given by nurses in about 60 percent of the schools, and by non-health professionals, such as secretaries, in most of the remaining schools. Medications are kept locked in almost all (96 percent) of the schools, according to the principals, and students are observed while taking their medications. Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia have either statutes, regulations, or mandatory policies addressing the administration of medication to students. State provisions require schools to obtain written parental authorization to administer medication, ensure that the medication is securely stored, and store prescription medication in the original pharmacy container."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Children diagnosed with attention deficit disorders are commonly treated with stimulant medications, such as Ritalin or Adderall.

Although there are a number of disorder subtypes, as a group these disorders are referred to as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Symptoms include hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and inattention. The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s diagnostic manual provides criteria for identifying ADHD; however, there is no agreed upon test to confirm an attention disorder. Estimates of the prevalence of the disorder vary widely. A recent international review of 19 epidemiological studies conducted in various countries since 1980 on the prevalence of ADHD in school-age children reported ranges of 2 percent to 18 percent. The review found that the ADHD prevalence rate varies depending on the diagnostic criteria, the children included in the sample, and how the data were collected. Researchers conducting the review concluded with a \u201cbest\u201d estimate of between 5 and 10 percent of children and adolescents having some form of this disorder.", "Although controversial, stimulants are the most common treatment for attention disorder symptoms and are the only drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose. Methylphenidate is the most widely used stimulant, but amphetamines have been increasingly prescribed. Antidepressants, including buproprion and velafaxine, are not approved by the FDA for the treatment of ADHD; however, they are sometimes prescribed by physicians for ADHD if stimulant medications are ineffective or inappropriate for a particular patient.", "ADHD drugs come in generic forms, but are often referred to by their brand names. Methylphenidate brand names include Ritalin (see fig. 1), Concerta, Methylin and Metadate. Brand name amphetamines include Adderall, Dexedrine, and Dextrostat. Both types of stimulants are available in quick acting, but short duration (2 to 6 hours) tablets. Recently, sustained or extended release tablets lasting 8 to 12 hours have become available, and a once-a-day skin patch is under development. Longer acting drugs may reduce the need for some children to take their medications at school. Several companies are testing nonstimulant drugs for ADHD treatment that do not have the potential for abuse or physical dependency associated with stimulant drugs.", "Methylphenidate and amphetamines are classified under the federal Controlled Substances Act as Schedule II drugs\u2014those with a high potential for abuse and severe psychological or physical dependence if abused. A 1995 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) review of methylphenidate concluded that based on studies of laboratory animals and humans, methylphenidate was similar in pharmacological effects to cocaine and amphetamines. The DEA establishes annual production quotas for Schedule II drugs by analyzing data on past sales, inventories, market trends, and anticipated need.", "The production quotas for methylphenidate and amphetamines have risen considerably since 1990. (See table 1.) A number of factors have contributed to the increase in the quotas, according to researchers. Key factors include (1) the number of people diagnosed as having ADHD has grown with an expansion in the criteria used to diagnose ADHD; (2) longer periods of treatment for the disorder; (3) more girls are receiving medication than in prior years; and (4) a greater public acceptance of psychopharmacologic treatment of youth. According to data obtained by DEA, about 80 percent of the prescriptions for amphetamines and methylphenidate were to treat children with ADHD.", "Along with the increase in the use of stimulant medications have come concerns that these drugs may be being diverted from their prescribed use, or otherwise abused. School settings are perceived as particularly vulnerable for abuse because schools store attention disorder drugs for students needing medication while at school. DEA interviews in 1997 with schools officials in three states indicated that schools might leave medications in unsecured locations, such as teachers\u2019 desks, making theft possible. A number of anecdotal news accounts of students abusing these drugs at school have heightened concerns. (See app. IV.) However, no studies are available to document the degree to which these medications are diverted at school. There is some evidence from a small number of studies and national data that abuse of these drugs does occur. (See app. V.) For example, the University of Michigan has surveyed a national sample of public and private 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students since 1991. Of 12th graders surveyed in 2000, 2 percent reported using Ritalin without a prescription in the past year. The University of Michigan survey does not specify where drug use occurred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Incidents of Diversion or Abuse of Attention Disorder Drugs Identified by Schools", "paragraphs": ["Based on our survey, an estimated 8 percent of principals in public middle schools and high schools in the United States reported at least one incident of diversion or abuse of attention disorder drugs during the current 2000-2001 school year.

An additional 3 percent of school principals reported at least one possible incident, but were uncertain of the drugs involved.", "Of the 8 percent reporting an incident of diversion or abuse in the current school year, only methylphenidate was involved at 73 percent of the schools, and only amphetamines were involved at 20 percent of the schools. In the remaining cases, the specific drug could not be determined or both drugs were involved. Using the U.S. Department of Education designations for community, we classified schools as being located in central cities, urban communities, or small towns. We compared incident rates by school and community type. (See fig. 3.) Due to the low number of incidents overall, we were unable to draw any statistical conclusions about possible association between these factors and the incidence rate.", "Principals reporting any incident at their school were asked to briefly describe the incident for which they had the most information. A content analysis of the 51 incidents described by our sample respondents showed that in 38 cases the student gave or sold pills to other students. For example, \u201cStudent brought Adderall to school and attempted to sell it to other students.\u201d A second type of incident (4 cases) involved pills being stolen from other students or the school. The remaining incident descriptions were varied, such as \u201cIn all (6) cases, a pill was found outside the entrance to the main building. We aren\u2019t sure if it is a student taking the medication at school or bringing it from home and dropping it outside.\u201d", "The students involved in the estimated 8 percent of schools with reported diversion or abuse incidents were most often expelled or suspended from school as a consequence of the incident, according to principals. Other measures taken by schools in response to the incident are shown in table 2. An estimated 42 percent of the principals that were aware of an incident did not call police regarding the drug diversion or abuse incident.", "Consequently, measures of attention disorder diversion or abuse based on official police records may underreport actual occurrences.", "Most principals did not perceive the diversion or abuse of prescribed attention disorder drugs to be a major problem at their school. An estimated 89 percent reported that it was less of a problem than other illicit drug use, excluding alcohol and marijuana. In general, illicit drug use (excluding alcohol and marijuana) was reported to be not a problem at all or a minor problem by approximately 78 percent of the principals. In addition, the most frequent comments voluntarily written by principals were comments regarding the lack of an ADHD medication abuse problem at their school. For example, one principal stated that \u201cI feel comfortable in stating that there is \u2018NO DIVERSION\u2019 of medication that is administered through the office/clinic.\u201d We compared incident rates by the principal\u2019s assessment of the problem, but were unable to draw any statistical conclusions about a possible association due to the low number of incidents overall."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Schools Dispense Attention Disorder Medications and Follow Drug Security Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Most school officials reported that attention disorder medications are administered to students during the school day, most often by a nurse.

As shown in figure 4 estimates, statistically more middle school officials (96 percent) administered ADHD medications than did high school officials (83 percent). However, incident estimates by community type were not statistically different.", "While 90 percent of principals in our study population reported that their schools administer attention disorder medications, a relatively small fraction of students attending these schools were administered attention disorder medications while at school. An estimated 1.1 percent of students (in schools where drugs are administered) were dispensed methylphenidate and an estimated 0.5 percent of students were administered amphetamines, for an overall rate of almost 2 percent.", "A DEA drug diversion official expressed concern during recent congressional testimony with the volume of methylphenidate on hand at school for student daytime dosing. Our survey found that 6 percent of schools stored 600 pills or more, while over half of the schools stored 100 pills or less. (See fig. 5.)", "At schools that dispense attention disorder medications, the personnel approved to administer medications varied among schools. Nurses were reported to most often carry out that task, and second to nurses, nonhealthcare professionals, such as secretaries, most often dispense medications. (See table 3.) Lack of a nurse or other trained healthcare professional was noted as a concern by several principals. Of the 107 optional comments written by principals in our survey, 13 comments were about the need for nurses to administer medication to students. For example, one wrote, \u201cSchool districts should be forced to provide full- time nursing services so that only medically-trained personnel can distribute medication.\u201d", "For nonhealthcare professionals administering attention disorder medications, all but 5 percent of school officials reported some kind of training was provided to prepare staff for their duties.

An additional 24 percent of schools kept medications in either a locked cabinet or a locked office or room. Some school principals noted that during nonschool hours medication security was tighter, such as locking the room in which medication was stored in addition to a locked cabinet, or using a vault. Of those reporting that medications were kept locked, the average number of people with access was three people, and at most schools (93 percent) fewer than six persons have access to the medications. Because most schools secure attention disorder medications in locked storage, and the low overall rate of diversion or abuse, we were unable to draw statistical conclusions about any possible association between number of incidents, medication security, or security and school type.", "Cabinet and door locks school B Almost all (96 percent) of the school principals in schools that administer medications reported that students are observed when they are administered medication to assure that it is taken.", "Of the 90 percent of schools that administer attention disorder medications, about 48 percent have parents only transporting student medications from home to school. Another 34 percent of schools allow either parents or students to transport medications and 12 percent had students transporting their own medications. Among those schools that have students transporting their own medications, several principals commented that controls were in place to assure that none of the medication was diverted from home to school. For example, one principal reported that the medication bottle must be taped closed with the number of pills inside indicated on the bottle and accompanied by a note signed by the parent.

The other eight states and the District of Columbia do not expressly delegate authority to local schools, but provide for the regulation of medication administration in schools based on statewide or districtwide requirements.", "We analyzed provisions in the 37 states and the District of Columbia based on five common statewide requirements for administering medication at schools: (1) whether schools must obtain authorization from the student\u2019s parent or guardian to administer medication, (2) whether schools must obtain written orders or instructions from the student\u2019s physician or other licensed medication prescriber to administer medication, (3) whether schools must receive and store prescription medication in an original container with proper pharmaceutical labeling, (4) whether schools must provide storage for medication that is secure and inaccessible except to authorized school personnel, and (5) whether schools must document the administration of medication to the student in a medication log.", "Although these five categories represent the more common statewide requirements, they do not represent the full array of state requirements that regulate the administration of medication in schools. For example, Maine and New Jersey have minimum state requirements for school medication administration policies, but not in one of the five categories reflected in appendix VI. Maine requires that all unlicensed personnel receive training before administering medication, while New Jersey prohibits anyone other than a doctor, nurse, or parent from administering medication in a non-emergency situation. Other states limit the amount of medication that schools may store; require parents or guardians to deliver medications to schools; establish procedures for returning and/or destroying any unused medications; and establish safeguards specific to self-administration of medications by students.", "From our review, we found that 28 states and the District of Columbia require that schools obtain authorization from the student\u2019s parent or guardian before administering medication. Virtually all of these jurisdictions specifically require written authorization. In addition, 19 states and the District of Columbia require that schools obtain orders or instructions from the student\u2019s physician or other licensed medication prescriber before administering medication. In most of these jurisdictions, the requirement for a medication order is met if the prescriber provides specific instructions for administration (e.g., the name, route, and dosage of the medication and the frequency and time of the administration).", "However, in two states, Utah and Washington, schools must also obtain a written statement from the prescriber that administering medication at school is medically necessary or advisable. Finally, 22 states and the District of Columbia require schools to obtain prescription medication in an original container with proper pharmaceutical labeling.", "Eighteen states specify the manner in which schools must store medication to ensure its security. These states vary in terms of the level of security required. States such as Indiana, Iowa, and Oklahoma simply require a secure or inaccessible location to store medication. However, most states specify locked storage for medication and a few impose more stringent security measures. For example, Massachusetts requires schools to store prescription medications in a securely locked cabinet, which is substantially constructed and anchored to a solid surface, with access to keys restricted.", "Sixteen states require schools to document the administration of medication to the student in a medication log or other like-named record.Documentation requirements vary between these states. Although some of the states do not specify the content or format of the medication log, many require, at a minimum, that the log reflect the date, time, and dosage of the medication given to the student, and the name or signature of the person administering the medication. A few states impose additional documentation requirements. For example, along with other states, Connecticut requires schools to document any skipped dose and the reason for it; Maryland requires scheduled pill counts for controlled substances and reconciliation against the medication log; and Massachusetts requires schools to document the return of any unused medication to the student\u2019s parents.", "From our survey responses, we found that 13 states do not have applicable statutes, regulations, or mandatory policies addressing the administration of medication in schools, as reflected in appendix VI.
