The Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2007 extended the penalty for misstated appraisals to estate and gift taxes.", "Among its objectives, GAO was asked to (1) describe the extent to which individual, estate, and gift tax returns are likely to involve an appraiser and the extent to which IRS audits them; (2) describe how IRS selects returns likely to involve appraisals for compliance examinations, and assess whether the current appraisal threshold is useful; and (3) assess IRS procedures for ensuring that itsappraisal experts are qualified.", "To accomplish these objectives, GAO analyzed IRS data, reviewed IRS guidance, and interviewed appropriate IRS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Appraisers\u0092 most prominent role relative to the three types of tax returns GAO studied is in the valuation of estates. In the most recent years for which GAO had data, appraisers were likely involved in the valuation of property worth from $75 billion to $167 billion reported on estate tax returns in 2009. In contrast, less than $17 billion worth of gifts in 2009 and less than $10 billion in noncash contributions in 2008 likely involved an appraiser. Gift tax returns that likely used appraisers had higher audit rates than gift returns that were unlikely to have appraisers. The use of appraisers was not associated with higher audit rates for estate tax returns and individual returns with noncash contributions.", "The Internal Revenue Service\u0092s (IRS) procedures for selecting returns to audit do not specifically target noncash contributions or gift or estate tax returns supported by appraisals. Nevertheless, returns with appraisals do get included in the population of audited returns because certain types of returns on which IRS does focus, such as higher-income ones, are also the most likely ones to have noncash charitable contributions that require appraisals. The current appraisal threshold for certain contributions over $5,000 has existed since 1984. The absence of an inflation adjustment over the past 25 years means that many contributors who pay for appraisals would not have needed to do so when the current threshold was first introduced. IRS seldom takes issue with appraisals for noncash contributions. Consequently, there seems to be little risk in Congress raising the $5,000 dollar threshold.", "IRS appraisal experts in one division met standards for ensuring that they were qualified. However, art appraisal experts in another division are not subject to either a comprehensive quality review program or continuing education requirements specific to appraising art. The lack of comprehensive quality reviews and mission-specific continuing education requirements could make the art appraisers less effective than they otherwise would be."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS develop a comprehensive quality review program for Art Appraisal Services (AAS) and establish appraisal training requirements specifically for AAS staff.

IRS agreed with our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The tax liabilities of individuals who make noncash charitable donations  or who receive inheritances or gifts of property can depend significantly  on the valuation of the property. Valuable property such as art, cars,  businesses, real estate, and easements, by law must be independently  appraised to determine exactly how much the taxpayer should report on a  tax return. An appraisal is an opinion about the value of a particular asset  at a particular time and is prepared following professionally accepted  procedures. If appraisals overvalue the property in the case of charitable  donations, or undervalue the property in the case of bequests or gifts,  taxpayers may\u2014intentionally or mistakenly\u2014pay less tax than they  should. Although the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has not determined  the extent to which appraisals contribute to misreporting, data from an  IRS study on taxpayer noncompliance showed a 45 percent error rate on  noncash charitable deductions, totaling $4.6 billion in lost revenue. For  about every five errors favorable to the taxpayer, one was unfavorable to  the taxpayer. In 2005 IRS and the Joint Committee on Taxation identified  overvalued donations of conservation easements as a particularly  problematic issue. The problem persists. In 2011 the Department of  Justice sought and the District Court for the District of Columbia issued an  injunction against a company that IRS identified as improperly  encouraging taxpayers to seek appraisers who would misvalue  conservation easement contributions on building fa\u00e7ades for noncash  charitable deductions.", "Congress addressed appraisal-related noncompliance in the Pension  Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) and the Tax Technical Corrections Act of  2007 (TTCA).

TTCA extended the civil  penalties for misstated appraisals to estate and gift tax valuations.", "Because of your interest in how these laws may have affected tax  compliance, you asked us to review IRS\u2019s enforcement efforts with  respect to appraisals. In this report we (1) describe the extent to which  individual, estate, and gift tax returns are likely to involve appraisers\u2019  valuations, the extent to which IRS audits such returns, and the extent to  which appraiser-specific penalties have been levied; (2) describe how IRS  selects and staffs returns likely to involve appraisers that it chooses for  examination, how examiners determine whether an appraisal is accurate,  and the extent to which IRS uses contractors to provide appraisal  expertise, as well as assess the usefulness of the current appraisal  reporting threshold; and (3) assess IRS\u2019s procedures for ensuring that its  appraisal experts are qualified.", "To identify the extent to which appraisers\u2019 valuations may cause an issue  for estate and gift tax returns and for returns of individuals making  noncash charitable contributions, we analyzed IRS Statistics of Income  (SOI) samples of these three populations of returns for filing years 2007  through 2009 (for estate and gift tax) and tax years 2005 through 2008  (for individual returns with noncash contributions). To identify the rate at  which IRS audits returns with potential issues caused by appraisers and  the amounts of tax adjustments for appraiser-related cases, we had IRS  match the cases we analyzed from the SOI sample of taxpayers claiming  noncash contributions against examination results data available from the  Examination Operational Automation Database (EOAD), which contains  information on audit adjustments relating to specific audit issues. Given  the limitations of the issue coding in the database, we can reliably report  on adjustments relating to noncash contributions but not specifically  relating to the appraisal of those contributions. EOAD does not contain  data for estate and gift tax audits, so we had IRS match the SOI cases for  those taxes to data from the Enforcement Revenue Information System.  This process allowed us to reliably determine which returns were audited.  We calculated confidence intervals for all of our estimates. To report the  number of appraiser penalties, we consulted with the IRS penalties  officials who track the penalty created under the PPA.", "To describe how IRS selects and staffs appraisal-related examinations,  we reviewed IRS staffing and case selection procedures and interviewed  IRS officials responsible for examination planning. To gather information  on how IRS audits tax returns with appraisals, we identified through our  data analysis a random sample of tax year 2008 returns that were likely to  involve appraisals and that had been audited by IRS. We then reviewed  the examination files for these cases to identify any inconsistencies  between stated examination policies in the Internal Revenue Manual  (IRM) and the recorded activities of examiners. To determine the extent of  contractor use for appraisal-related examinations, we reviewed  contracting procedures in the IRM and other documentation from IRS. We  then compiled data from IRS records detailing the use of contractors.  GAO previously has found IRS\u2019s system for recording contracts to be  unreliable for financial accounting, but the data was still reliable for  purposes of this report.

For individuals,  noncash charitable contributions are reported on Form 1040, U.S.  Individual Tax Return, Schedule A, Itemized Deductions, and  contributions of $500 or more must be itemized on Form 8283, Noncash  Charitable Contributions. With certain exceptions, taxpayers claiming  noncash contribution deductions of items or groups of similar items  exceeding $5,000 must obtain qualified appraisals for the donated  property, and report those on Form 8283, Section B (see app. II for more  detail). The provisions concerning qualified appraisals do not apply to  estate or gift taxes. For those taxes IRS simply requires taxpayers to  support property values with an appraisal, which could be a written  appraisal by a professional appraiser, but does not have to be in every  case.  Estate taxes are reported on Form 706 and gift taxes on Form 709  (see app. II for more detail on how appraisals may appear on these  forms). In general, the higher the appraised value of a noncash charitable  contribution, the higher the deduction a taxpayer might claim. Conversely,  the lower the appraisal for property reported on gifts and estate taxes  returns, the less tax must be paid.", "IRS has long had the authority to impose a penalty on a taxpayer for  valuation misstatements included on a return, but prior to the PPA, IRS  did not have specific authority to impose a penalty on the appraiser who  prepared the valuation. The penalty rate has two levels related to the  proportion of the misstatement. The PPA changed the thresholds for the  two levels and increased the penalty rate for larger misstatements. The  act also added an appraiser penalty, which applies to any person who  prepared a misstated appraisal and knew or reasonably should have  known would be used to support an individual income tax return. In  2007, TTCA made the appraiser penalty applicable for appraisals  improperly supporting estate and gift tax returns.", "The responsibility for identifying cases with appraisals and staffing  examinations on appraisals largely rests with IRS\u2019s Small Business and  Self-Employed (SB/SE) Division, which handles complex individual  returns and gift and estate returns, and its Large Business and  International (LB&I) Division, which handles partnership returns with  assets greater than $10 million.

First, given that the PPA penalties  apply to appraisals accompanying returns filed after August 17, 2006, IRS  officials said that they estimated that returns containing appraisals that  could be subject to the penalty would not enter the audit stream for a few  years. Therefore, IRS targeted 2009 to issue guidance and make  computer system changes. IRS posted a notice about the legislation in  2006 and on August 18, 2009, issued an interim guidance memorandum  as initial instructions for examiners on the application of the appraiser  penalty. This guidance, which was developed by SB/SE and accepted by  the other divisions of IRS, included procedures to make the penalty  accessible by examiners and deliver the appropriate appraiser penalty  assessment notices to appraisers. Second, IRS officials said that they  had to create the computer infrastructure for examiners to apply and  record penalties, draft and approve the form letters to be sent out to those  assessed the penalty, and prepare the guidance for IRS examiners in the  time between the PPA\u2019s passage and the issuance of final guidance on  the appraiser penalty.

Consequently, when  choosing returns to audit, IRS does not know whether any particular  return has a related appraisal. For similar reasons, gift and estate returns  also are not targeted for specific appraisal issues.", "Similarly, IRS does not staff examinations based on appraisals. The  examiners who lead these teams are generalists and do not necessarily  have specific expertise relating to appraisal techniques. The presence of  an appraisal as a potential audit issue does not affect how IRS assigns  these generalists to specific cases.", "Individual noncash contributions, gift, and estate tax returns with  appraisals all may be selected for examination indirectly because of  characteristics that are correlated with appraisals. For example, SB/SE  field audit priorities focus on high wealth individuals, who are more likely  to make the kinds of large noncash contributions, give large gifts, or have  large estates that would include items requiring appraisals. In tax year  2008 individuals with adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 or more  accounted for over 75 percent of the noncash contributions of real estate,  easements, art, and collectibles reported on Forms 8283, even though  they represented less than 15 percent of individuals filing that form. Other  SB/SE priorities that may indirectly involve appraisals include abusive  transactions and special examination projects.

IRS  selects a portion of its examination inventory using a computerized  scoring system called the Discriminant Index Function. Within this  system, the presence of unusual, large, or questionable contributions is  one of numerous factors that can increase the probability that a return will  be selected for audit. IRS also has a matching program that compares  Form 8283 with Form 8282, which includes the amounts donee  organizations report to have received when they dispose of contributed  assets. Mismatches between these returns can lead to an examination.

The agency does not require documentation of such  judgments when the issue has not initially identified for examination. Our  review of 80 examination files from tax year 2008 with $5,000 or more in  noncash charitable contributions showed that Forms 8283 were  incorrectly filled out in 17 cases but the examiner made no change. In  10 of those cases, the examiner did not leave a record explaining why no  further action was taken; therefore, we could not determine whether the  examiners made a conscious decision not to follow up on the incorrect  Forms 8283. In the other seven cases where the Form 8283 was  incorrect and the examiner left a record, the taxpayers supplied additional  information during the audit that satisfied the examiners. This shows that  taxpayers can be compliant with the appraisal rules even when they do  not fill out Form 8283 correctly. We found no obvious incorrectly reported  Forms 8283 in the other 63 cases.", "Our file review also suggests that, even in cases where examiners do  change noncash contribution deductions, few of those changes are due to  problems with appraisals. As discussed previously, for tax year 2007,  examiners made no changes to such deductions in the majority of cases  in which noncash contributions were identified as a potential problem to  review. Our file review showed that in only a small percentage of the  cases in which noncash contributions were changed was the change  made due to a problem with an appraisal. These facts suggest that IRS is  not finding widespread noncompliance with appraisals for noncash  contributions and the potential revenue yield from auditing appraisals of  lower-value items is likely to be small. At the same time, the number of  taxpayers who are required to pay for appraisals of items with relatively  low values (in real, inflation-adjusted terms) has likely increased because  the $5,000 threshold has not been changed since Congress set it in 1984.

Although IRS does not specifically target tax returns that involve  appraisals, the policies and procedures that IRS has in place to audit  estate, gift, and individual income tax returns ensures some coverage of  returns that do involve appraisals. For example, IRS already gives priority  to higher-income individual returns in the examination selection process,  and such returns are more likely to have appraisals supporting noncash  contributions than the general population of returns.", "There are two areas where changes might lead to reduced taxpayer  burden or improved agency performance relating to appraisals. First, the  fact that the $5,000 threshold at which taxpayers are required to obtain  qualified appraisals for noncash contributions has remained unchanged  for more than 25 years means that some contributors today must hire  appraisers to value property that would not have needed appraisals in the  mid-1980s, when the threshold was adopted. The high no-change rate  that we found through our data analysis and our file review indicates that  IRS examiners find relatively little noncompliance relating to appraisals for  noncash contributions. This low rate of detected noncompliance implies  that very little revenue is gained by auditing appraisals of assets worth  less than $10,000. Consequently, there seems to be little risk in adjusting  the threshold for price inflation to better reflect the level Congress initially  believed was appropriate to deter noncompliance. This adjustment would  reduce the compliance burdens for contributors of such property and, if  similar adjustments were made periodically in the future, would serve to  maintain consistent treatment of taxpayers over time. Second, the lack of  appraisal training requirements for AAS appraisers and the lack of a  comprehensive quality control process for AAS cases put the quality of  potentially high-value appraisal cases involving art at risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure the quality of IRS\u2019s examination of appraisal issues, the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue should take the following two actions:  \uf0b7  ensure that a more comprehensive quality review system for work  performed by AAS staff is implemented and  \uf0b7  develop more specific and documented appraisal training  requirements for AAS staff, as LB&I has done for engineers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the compliance burden on taxpayers making noncash  contributions, Congress should consider raising the threshold at which  taxpayers are required to have qualified appraisals for a particular  contribution.
