These concerns have increased during the past year with the significant expansion of the Federal Air Marshal Program, which has created numerous relatively high-paying job opportunities for existing federal uniformed police officers and reportedly has lured many experienced officers from their uniformed police forces. GAO's objectives were to (1) determine the differences that exist among selected federal uniformed police forces regarding entry-level pay, retirement benefits, and types of duties; (2) provide information on the differences in turnover rates among these federal uniformed police forces, including where officers who separated from the police forces went and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available and used to address turnover; and (3) provide information on possible difficulties police forces may have faced recruiting officers and the extent to which human capital flexibilities were available to help these forces recruit officers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2002, entry-level police officer salaries varied by more than $10,000 across the 13 police forces, from a high of $39,427 per year to a low of $28,801 per year. Four of the 13 police forces received federal law enforcement retirement benefits. Between October 1, 2002, and April 1, 2003, 12 of the 13 police forces received pay increases, which narrowed the pay gap for entry-level officers at some of the 13 forces. Officials at the 13 police forces reported that while officers performed many of the same types of duties, the extent to which they performed specialized functions varied. Total turnover at the 13 police forces nearly doubled (from 375 to 729) between fiscal years 2001 and 2002. Additionally, during fiscal year 2002, 8 of the 13 police forces experienced their highest annual turnover rates over the 6-year period, from fiscal years 1997 through 2002. Sizable differences existed in the turnover rates among the 13 federal uniformed police forces during fiscal year 2002. The availability and use of human capital flexibilities to retain employees, such as retention allowances, varied. GAO found that the increase in the number of separations (354) across the 13 police forces between fiscal years 2001 and 2002 almost equaled the number of officers (316) who left their forces to join the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Given that the buildup in staffing for TSA's Federal Air Marshal Program has been substantially completed, the increase in turnover experienced in fiscal year 2002 at 12 of the 13 police forces may have been a one-time occurrence.

To address our objectives,  we interviewed officials from and reviewed documents provided by the  following federal uniformed police forces: Bureau of Engraving and  Printing Police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Police, Federal  Protective Service, Government Printing Office Police, Library of Congress  Police, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Police, Pentagon Force  Protection Agency, Supreme Court Police, U.S. Capitol Police, U.S. Mint  Police, U.S. Park Police, U.S. Postal Service Police, and the U.S. Secret  Service Uniformed Division.

The act, among other things, restructured parts of the executive  branch of the federal government to better address the threat to the United  States posed by terrorism. The act established a new Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), which includes two uniformed police forces  within the scope of our review\u2014the Federal Protective Service and the  Secret Service Uniformed Division. These police forces were formerly  components of the General Services Administration and the Department of  the Treasury, respectively. Another component of DHS is the TSA, which  protects the nation\u2019s transportation systems. TSA, which was formerly a  component of the Department of Transportation, includes the Federal Air  Marshal Service, which is designed to provide protection against hijacking  and terrorist attacks on domestic and international airline flights. The  Federal Air Marshal Program increased significantly after the September  11, 2001, terrorist attacks, resulting in the need for TSA to recruit many Air  Marshals during fiscal year 2002. By fiscal year 2003, the buildup in the  Federal Air Marshal Program had been substantially completed. Federal  Air Marshals are not limited to the grade and pay step structure of the  federal government\u2019s General Schedule. As a result, TSA has been able to  offer air marshal recruits higher compensation and more flexible benefit  packages than many other federal police forces.", "Federal uniformed police forces operate under various compensation  systems. Some federal police forces are covered by the General Schedule  pay system and others are covered by different pay systems authorized by  various laws. Since 1984, all new federal employees have been covered by  the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). Federal police forces  provide either standard federal retirement benefits or federal law  enforcement retirement benefits.", "Studies of employee retention indicate that turnover is a complex and  multifaceted problem. People leave their jobs for a variety of reasons.  Compensation is often cited as a primary reason for employee turnover.  However, nonpay factors, such as age, job tenure, job satisfaction, and job  location, may also affect individuals\u2019 decisions to leave their jobs.", "During recent years, the federal government has implemented many  human capital flexibilities to help agencies attract and retain sufficient  numbers of high-quality employees to complete their missions. Human  capital flexibilities can include actions related to areas such as  recruitment, retention, competition, position classification, incentive  awards and recognition, training and development, and work-life policies.  We have stated in recent reports that the effective, efficient, and  transparent use of human capital flexibilities must be a key component of  agency efforts to address human capital challenges.

The average  retention allowances paid to officers in fiscal year 2002 were about   $1,000 at the Pentagon Force Protection Agency, $3,500 at the Federal  Protective Service, and more than $4,200 at the NIH Police. The police  forces reported various reasons for not making greater use of available  human capital flexibilities in fiscal year 2002, including  lack of funding for human capital flexibilities,  lack of awareness among police force officials that the human capital  flexibilities were available, and  lack of specific requests for certain flexibilities such as time-off awards or  tuition reimbursement.", "The limited use of human capital flexibilities by many of the 13 police  forces and the reasons provided for the limited use are consistent with our  governmentwide study of the use of such authorities.

We further stated that the insufficient or  ineffective use of flexibilities can significantly hinder the ability of  agencies to recruit, hire, retain, and manage their human capital.  Additionally, in May 2003, we reported that OPM can better assist agencies  in using human capital flexibilities by, among other things, maximizing its  efforts to make the flexibilities more widely known to agencies through  compiling, analyzing, and sharing information about when, where, and  how the broad range of flexibilities are being used, and should be used, to  help agencies meet their human capital management needs.

However, our discussions  with human capital officials in the 13 police forces found that separating  officers provided them with a variety of reasons why they chose to leave  their police forces, including increased pay, additional benefits, greater job  satisfaction, and personal reasons. We did not contact separating officers  to determine why they decided to move to other jobs and whether the new  jobs was comparable in pay, benefits, and job responsibilities.   Nevertheless, with the information we obtained, we were unable to  discern any clear patterns between employee turnover and pay. That is,  turnover varied significantly among police forces that had similar pay for  entry-level officers.", "Third, the U.S. Secret Service suggested that we calculate the differences  in retirement benefits that would accrue to officers in the different forces.   We noted in our report that different forces had different retirement plans  with significant differences in benefits. However, calculating the  retirement benefits of a hypothetical police officer at each of the forces  was beyond the scope of our review.", "Finally, the U.S. Secret Service noted that fundamental differences exist  among the agencies\u2019 authorities, responsibilities, duties, and training  requirements, and that this could account for differences in compensation.

Of  the 316 officers who went to TSA, about 53 percent (166) had fewer than   5 years of experience on their forces. An additional 19 percent (59) had   5 years to less than 10 years of experience on their forces.", "Table 10 shows that about 25 percent (148) of the 599 police officers who  voluntarily separated from their forces in fiscal year 2002 took other  federal law enforcement positions. Officers with fewer than 5 years of  experience on their forces accounted for about 79 percent (117) of the  separations to other federal law enforcement positions, and officers with   5 years to less than 10 years of experience accounted for an additional   16 percent (23).", "Table 11 shows that of the 13 police forces surveyed, 11 reported problems  ranging in severity from a little or some extent, to a very great extent, with  retaining officers in the Washington MSA. Of these 11 police forces,   4 characterized their agencies retention difficulties as a very great extent.  Two police forces, the Government Printing Office Police and the Library  of Congress Police, reported no difficulty with retention.", "Police forces reporting difficulties indicated a number of commonalities in  terms of why officers had left the forces. Among the reasons given were    better pay at other agencies;    better benefits, including law enforcement retirement, at other agencies;    better morale at other agencies;    more challenging work at other agencies;    promotional opportunities at other agencies;  too much overtime at their police forces; and  retirements from their police forces.", "Library of Congress Police officials attributed their low turnover rate to  pay, working conditions, and the fact that the force does not have any age  restrictions, which allows the force to hire older, more experienced  officers. Each of the forces with retention difficulties reported steps taken  to address the problem, including providing retention allowances,  improving training, and improving working conditions. Additionally,  officials from several police forces reported that they were considering  providing increases in retention allowances and student loan repayments  to address their retention difficulties.", "Only two police forces, the Pentagon Force Protection Agency and the  Supreme Court Police, reported that the measures they had taken had  solved the retention problem to a great extent; the remaining police forces  indicated either that the measures taken had had a little or no effect or  that it was too early to determine whether the measures taken would solve  the retention problem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Use of Human Capital Flexibilities", "paragraphs": ["Table 12 illustrates the use of human capital flexibilities by the 13 police  forces included in our review. While agency officials reported that a  variety of human capital flexibilities were available across the agencies,  there was variation among agencies both in terms of the specific  flexibilities available and in the frequency of use. For instance, only 3 of  the 13 agencies reported the availability of recruitment bonuses, and none  were given in fiscal year 2002. Ten of the 13 reported the availability of  performance-based cash awards, and 9 of these agencies made these  awards in amounts averaging $109-$2,500."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Recruiting Strategies and New Hire Selection Process", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the National Institutes of Health", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the United States Secret Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Supreme Court of the United States", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: GAO Contacts and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the persons named above, Leo M.
