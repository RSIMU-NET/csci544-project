It is also a time when legitimate taxpayers may learn that they are a victim of IDT refund fraud, which occurs when a thief files a fraudulent return using a legitimate taxpayer's identity and claims a refund. In 2015, GAO added IDT refund fraud to its high-risk area on the enforcement of tax laws and expanded its government-wide high-risk area on federal information security to include the protection of personally identifiable information. With IRS's reliance on computerized systems, recent data breaches at IRS highlight the vulnerability of sensitive taxpayer information.", "This statement discusses IRS's efforts to address (1) customer service declines, (2) IDT refund fraud challenges, and (3) information security weaknesses.

According to IRS, this is due in part to the additional $290 million in funding Congress provided to improve customer service, identity theft (IDT) refund fraud, and cybersecurity efforts. However, IRS expects its performance for the entire fiscal year will not reach the levels of earlier years. In 2012 and 2014, GAO made recommendations for IRS to improve customer service, which it has yet to implement. Consequently, in December 2015, GAO suggested that Congress require the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to work with IRS to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy that incorporates elements of these prior recommendations.", "IDT refund fraud poses a significant challenge. Although the full extent of this fraud is unknown, IRS estimates it paid $3.1 billion in IDT fraudulent refunds in filing season 2014, while preventing the processing of $22.5 billion in fraudulent refunds (see figure).", "IRS has taken steps to combat IDT refund fraud, such as increasing resources dedicated to combating the problem. However, as GAO reported in August 2014 and January 2015, additional actions can further assist the agency, including assessing the costs, benefits, and risks of improving methods for authenticating taxpayers. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 included a provision to accelerate filings of W-2 information from employers to the IRS that would help IRS with pre-refund matching. GAO suggested that Congress provide Treasury with authority to lower the threshold for e-filing W-2s, which would further enhance pre-refund matching.", "In March 2016, GAO reported that IRS had instituted numerous controls over key financial and tax processing systems; however, it had not always effectively implemented other controls intended to properly restrict access to systems and information, among other security measures. While IRS had improved some of its access controls, weaknesses remained in controls over key systems for identifying and authenticating users, authorizing users' level of rights and privileges, and encrypting sensitive data. These weaknesses were due in part to IRS's inconsistent implementation of its agency-wide security program, including not fully implementing 49 prior GAO recommendations. GAO concluded that these weaknesses collectively constituted a significant deficiency for the purposes of financial reporting for fiscal year 2015. As a result, taxpayer and financial data continue to be exposed to increased risk."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO previously suggested that Congress consider requiring that Treasury work with IRS to develop a customer service strategy, and providing Treasury with the authority to lower the annual threshold for e-filing W-2s.

It is also  during this period that IRS processes most of the approximately 150  million individual tax returns it will receive, conducts initial screening for  compliance, and issues more than 100 million refunds. The scale of these  operations alone presents challenges, in addition to ensuring the security  of taxpayers\u2019 personal and financial information. Customer service is one  of those challenges.", "Another major challenge for IRS during the filing season is the growing  and evolving problem of IDT refund fraud and IRS efforts to prevent,  detect, and resolve it. This crime occurs when a refund-seeking fraudster  obtains an individual\u2019s Social Security number, date of birth, or other  personally identifiable information (PII) and uses it to file a fraudulent tax  return seeking a refund. This crime costs the federal government billions  of dollars in both IDT refunds paid to fraudsters and costs incurred by IRS  in its efforts to combat it. Further, it burdens legitimate taxpayers because  authenticating the victims\u2019 identities is likely to delay processing their  returns and refunds, in those cases where a legitimate refund is due.  Moreover, the victim\u2019s PII can potentially be used to commit other crimes.  Given current and emerging risks, in 2015 we expanded the enforcement  of our tax laws high-risk area to include IRS\u2019s efforts to address IDT  refund fraud.", "In carrying out its mission to collect taxes, process tax returns, and  enforce U.S. tax laws during the filing season and beyond, IRS relies  extensively on computerized systems and on information security controls  to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive  personal and financial information for each U.S. taxpayer. We first  designated federal information security as a government-wide high-risk  area in 1997. As we did with IDT refund fraud, in 2015 we expanded this  area to include protecting the privacy of PII that is collected, maintained,  and shared by both federal and nonfederal entities as a government-wide  high-risk area. Two recent information security incidents at IRS highlight  the challenges and importance of ensuring that controls protecting  taxpayer data are effectively implemented:  In June 2015, the Commissioner of the IRS testified that unauthorized  third parties had gained access to taxpayer information from its Get  Transcript service. According to IRS officials, criminals used  taxpayer-specific data acquired from nondepartment sources to gain  unauthorized access to information on approximately 100,000 tax  accounts. These data included such PII as Social Security  information, dates of birth, and street addresses. In an August 2015  update, IRS updated this number to be about 114,000, and reported  that an additional 220,000 accounts had been inappropriately  accessed. In a February 2016 update, the agency reported that an  additional 390,000 accounts had been accessed. Thus, IRS has  reported a total of about 724,000 accounts that were inappropriately  accessed. The online Get Transcript service has been unavailable  since May 2015.", "In March 2016, IRS stated that as part of its ongoing security review, it  had temporarily suspended the Identity Protection Personal  Identification Number (IP PIN) service on IRS.gov. The IP PIN is a  single-use identification number provided to taxpayers who are victims  of IDT to help prevent future IDT refund fraud. The service on IRS\u2019s  website allowed taxpayers to retrieve their IP PINs online. Taxpayers  passed IRS\u2019s authentication checks by confirming their identities  through site inquiries, asking for personal, financial, and tax-related  information. The IRS stated that it was conducting further review of  the IP PIN service and is looking at further strengthening the security  features before resuming service. As of April 13, this online service  was still suspended.", "In response to challenges in these three areas, in fiscal year 2016,  Congress provided IRS with $290 million in additional funding intended to  improve customer service, IDT identification and prevention, and  cybersecurity efforts. According to IRS\u2019s spending plan this funding will  be used to invest in (1) increased telephone level of service, including  reduced wait times and improved performance on IRS\u2019s Taxpayer  Protection Program/Identity Theft Toll Free Line ($178.4 million); (2)  cybersecurity including network security improvements, protection from  unauthorized access, and enhanced insider threat detection ($95.4  million); and (3) IDT refund fraud prevention ($16.1 million).", "My statement today focuses on IRS\u2019s efforts to address (1) declines in  customer service, (2) the challenge of identity theft refund fraud, and (3)  information security weaknesses we have identified.", "My statement is based in part on our previous reports issued between  December 2012 and April 2016.

From January 1 through  March 26, 2016, IRS received about 38.2 million calls to its automated  and live assistor telephone lines\u2014a slight decrease compared to the  same period last year. Of the 14.7 million calls seeking live assistance,  IRS had answered 9.9 million calls\u2014a 72 percent increase over the 5.7  million calls answered during the same period last year. Further, the  average wait time to speak to an assistor also decreased from 24 to 10  minutes.", "IRS anticipated that 65 percent of callers seeking live assistance would  receive it this filing season, which ended April 18. IRS\u2019s performance for  telephone service during the filing season as of March 26, 2016 has  exceeded IRS\u2019s anticipated level\u201474 percent of callers have received  live assistance.", "IRS attributed this year\u2019s improvements to a number of factors. As noted  above, of the additional $290 million IRS received in December 2015, it  allocated $178.4 million (61.5 percent) for taxpayer services to make  measurable improvements in its telephone level of service. With the  funds, IRS hired 1,000 assistors who began answering taxpayer calls in  March, in addition to the approximately 2,000 seasonal assistors it had  hired in fall 2015. To help answer taxpayer calls before March, IRS  officials told us that they detailed 275 staff from one of its compliance  functions to answer telephone calls. IRS officials said they believe this  step was necessary because the additional funding came too late in the  year to hire and train assistors to fully cover the filing season. IRS also  plans to use about 600 full-time equivalents of overtime for assistors to  answer telephone calls and respond to correspondence in fiscal year  2016. This compares to fewer than 60 full-time equivalents of overtime  used in fiscal year 2015.", "However, IRS expects that the telephone level of service will decline after  the filing season. As a result, the telephone level of service for the entire  2016 fiscal year is expected to be at 47 percent. As we reported in  March 2016, IRS\u2019s telephone level of service for the fiscal year has yet to  reach the levels it had achieved in earlier years (see figure 1).", "In addition to answering telephone calls, IRS responds to millions of  letters and other correspondence from taxpayers. In 2015, we reported  that the percentage of correspondence cases in IRS\u2019s inventory classified  as \u201coverage\u201d\u2014cases generally not processed within 45 days of receipt by  IRS\u2014has stayed close to 50 percent since fiscal 2013. Minimizing  overaged correspondence is important because delayed responses may  prompt taxpayers to write again, call, or visit a walk-in site. Moreover, an  increasing overage rate could lead to more interest paid to taxpayers who  are owed refunds.", "In March 2016, IRS officials attributed improvements made this filing  season, in part, to assistors working overtime. These officials reported  that IRS\u2019s office that responds to taxpayer inquiries and handles  adjustments had slightly more than 700,000 correspondence cases in  inventory at the end of January and expect about 1 million cases in  inventory by the end of April. They described IRS\u2019s correspondence  inventory as manageable, but steadily increasing. Officials said that, after  the filing deadline, assistors will turn their attention to correspondence.", "IRS also offers online services to millions of taxpayers through its  website, including tax forms and interactive tax assistance features.

Examples include:  Telephone and Correspondence. In December 2012, we recommended  that IRS define appropriate levels of service for telephones as well as  correspondence. IRS neither agreed nor disagreed with this  recommendation and, as of October 2015, the agency had not developed  these customer service goals. While IRS has taken some steps to modify  services provided to taxpayers, a strategy would help determine the  resources needed to achieve customer service goals. Recognizing the  importance of such as strategy, in December 2014, we recommended  that IRS systematically and periodically compare its telephone service to  the best in business to identify gaps between actual and desired  performance. IRS disagreed with this recommendation, noting that it is  difficult to identify comparable organizations. We do not agree with IRS\u2019s  position; many organizations run call centers that would provide ample  opportunities to benchmark IRS\u2019s performance.", "Recognizing the need to improve performance responding to taxpayer  correspondence, in December 2015, we recommended to Treasury that it  include overage rates for handling taxpayer correspondence as a part of  Treasury\u2019s performance goals. Treasury neither agreed nor disagreed  with this recommendation.", "Online Services. In April 2013, we recommended that IRS develop a  long-term online strategy that should, for example, develop business  cases for all new online services. In March 2016, IRS officials reported  that IRS\u2019s Future State initiative is intended to provide better service to  taxpayers through multiple channels of communication, including online.  We have not yet assessed IRS\u2019s Future State initiative. However, a long- term comprehensive strategy for online services should help ensure that  IRS is maximizing the benefit to taxpayers from this investment and  reduce costs in other areas, such as for IRS\u2019s telephone operations.", "Comprehensive Customer Service Strategy. In fall 2015, Treasury and  IRS officials said they had no plans to develop a comprehensive  customer service strategy or specific goals for telephone service tied to  the best in the business and customer expectations. These officials told  us that the agencies\u2019 existing efforts were sufficient. However, we  continue to believe that, without such a strategy, Treasury and IRS can  neither measure nor effectively communicate to Congress the types and  levels of customer service taxpayers should expect and the resources  needed to reach those levels. Therefore, in December 2015, we  suggested that Congress consider requiring that Treasury work with IRS  to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy. In April 2016,  IRS officials told us that the agency has established a team to consider  our prior recommendations in developing a comprehensive customer  service strategy or goals for telephone service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Billions of Dollars Have Been Lost to IDT Refund Fraud, and IRS Faces Challenges in Combating This Evolving Threat", "paragraphs": ["During the filing season many taxpayers learn that their private  information has been stolen and they have been victims of IDT refund  fraud. This generally occurs when the taxpayer attempts to file a tax  return only to learn that one has already been filed under the taxpayer\u2019s  name. For these taxpayers, IRS has taken action to improve customer  service related to IDT refund fraud. As we reported in March 2016,  between the 2011 and 2015 filing seasons, IRS experienced a 430  percent increase in the number of telephone calls to its Identity Theft Toll- Free Line. As of March 19, 2016, IRS had received more than 1.1  million calls to this line.

IRS  develops estimates of the extent of IDT refund fraud to help direct its  efforts to identify and prevent the crime. While its estimates have inherent  uncertainty, IRS estimated that it prevented or recovered $22.5 billion in  fraudulent IDT refunds in filing season 2014 (see figure 2). However,  IRS also estimated, where data were available, that it paid $3.1 billion in  fraudulent IDT refunds. Because of the difficulties in knowing the amount  of undetectable fraud, the actual amount could differ from these  estimates.", "IRS has taken steps to address IDT refund fraud; however, it remains a  persistent and continually changing threat. IRS recognized the challenge  of IDT refund fraud in its fiscal year 2014-2017 strategic plan and  increased resources dedicated to combating IDT and other types of  refund fraud. In fiscal year 2015, IRS reported that it staffed more than  4,000 full-time equivalents and spent about $470 million on all refund  fraud and IDT activities. As described above, IRS received an additional  $290 million in fiscal year 2016 to improve customer service, IDT  identification and prevention, and cybersecurity efforts. The agency plans  to use $16.1 million of this funding to help prevent IDT refund fraud,  among other things. As we reported in April 2016, the administration  requested an additional $90 million and an additional 491 full-time  equivalents for fiscal year 2017 to help prevent IDT refund fraud and  reduce other improper payments. IRS estimates that this $90 million  investment in IDT refund fraud and other improper payment prevention  would help it protect $612 million in revenue in fiscal year 2017, as well  as protect revenue in future years.", "As we previously reported, IRS also works with third parties, such as tax  preparation industry participants, states, and financial institutions to try to  detect and prevent IDT refund fraud. In March 2015, the Commissioner  of the IRS convened a Security Summit with industry and states to  improve information sharing and authentication. IRS officials said that 40  state departments of revenue and 20 tax industry participants have  officially signed a partnership agreement to enact recommendations  developed and agreed to by summit participants. IRS plans to invest a  portion of the $16.1 million it received in fiscal year 2016 into identity theft  prevention and refund fraud mitigation actions from the Security Summit.  These efforts include developing an Information Sharing and Analysis  Center where IRS, states, and industry can share information to combat  IDT refund fraud.", "Even though IRS has prioritized combating IDT refund fraud, fraudsters  adapt their schemes to identify weaknesses in IDT defenses, such as  gaining access to taxpayers\u2019 tax return transcripts through IRS\u2019s online  Get Transcript service. According to IRS officials, with access to tax  transcripts, fraudsters can create historically consistent returns that are  hard to distinguish from a return filed by a legitimate taxpayer.

Improving authentication could help IRS  prevent fraud before issuing refunds. In January 2015, we reported that  IRS\u2019s authentication tools have limitations and recommended that IRS  assess the costs, benefits and risks of its authentication tools. For  example, individuals can obtain an e-file PIN by providing their name,  Social Security number, date of birth, address, and filing status for IRS\u2019s  e-file PIN application. Identity thieves can easily find this information,  allowing them to bypass some, if not all, of IRS\u2019s automatic checks  according to our analysis and interviews with tax software and return  preparer associations and companies. After filing an IDT return using an  e-file PIN, the fraudulent return would proceed through IRS\u2019s normal  return processing.", "In response to our recommendation, in November 2015, IRS developed  guidance for its Identity Assurance Office to assess costs, benefits, and  risk. According to IRS officials, this analysis will inform decision-making  on authentication-related issues. IRS also noted that the methods of  analysis for the authentication tools will vary depending on the different  costs and other factors for authenticating taxpayers in different channels,  such as online, phone, or in-person. In February 2016, IRS officials told  us that the Identity Assurance Office plans to complete a strategic plan for  taxpayer authentication across the agency in September 2016. While IRS  is taking steps, it will still be vulnerable until it completes and uses the  results of its analysis of costs, benefits, and risks to inform decision- making.", "W-2 Pre-refund Matching. Another pre-refund strategy is earlier  matching of employer-reported wage information to taxpayers\u2019 returns  before issuing refunds. As we reported in August 2014, thieves  committing IDT refund fraud take advantage of IRS\u2019s \u201clook-back\u201d  compliance model. Under this model, rather than holding refunds until  completing all compliance checks, IRS issues refunds after conducting  selected reviews, such as verifying identity by matching names and  Social Security numbers and filtering for indications of fraud. However,  we found that the wage information that employers report on the Form W- 2, Wage and Tax Statement (W-2), has generally been unavailable to IRS  until after it issues most refunds. According to IRS, pre-refund matching  would potentially save a substantial part of the billions of taxpayer dollars  currently lost to fraudsters.", "Increasing electronically-filed (e-file) W-2s. In December 2015, the  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 amended the tax code to  accelerate W-2 filing deadlines to January 31. This represents  important progress. Building on that, other policy changes may also  be needed in concert with moving W-2 deadlines. Agency officials and  third-party stakeholders told us that these changes include lowering  the employee threshold requirement for employers to e-file W-2s.  Because of the additional time and resources associated with  processing paper W-2s submitted by employers, Social Security  Administration officials told us that a change in the e-file threshold  would be needed to sufficiently increase the number of e-filed W-2s.  Backlogs in paper W-2s could result in IRS receiving W-2 data after  the end of the filing season. Therefore, we have suggested that  Congress should consider providing the Secretary of the Treasury  with the regulatory authority to lower the threshold for electronic filing  of W-2s from 250 returns annually to between 5 to 10 returns, as  appropriate.", "Assessing the costs and benefits of pre-refund W-2 matching. In  August 2014 we reported that the wage information that employers  report on Form W-2 is unavailable to IRS until after it issues most  refunds. Also, if IRS had access to W-2 data earlier, it could match  such information to taxpayers\u2019 returns and identify discrepancies  before issuing billions of dollars of fraudulent IDT refunds. We  recommended that IRS assess the costs and benefits of accelerating  W-2 deadlines.", "In response to our recommendation, IRS provided us with a report in  September 2015 discussing (1) adjustments to IRS systems and work  processes needed to use accelerated W-2 information, (2) the  potential impacts on internal and external stakeholders, and (3) other  changes needed to match W-2 data to tax returns prior to issuing  refunds, such as delaying refunds until W-2 data are available. IRS\u2019s  analysis for this report will help it determine how to best implement  pre-refund W-2 matching, given the new January 31 deadline for filing  W-2s.", "Improving feedback on external leads. A post-refund strategy to  combat IDT refund fraud involves IRS\u2019s External Leads Program. This  program involves financial institutions and other external parties providing  information about emerging IDT refund trends and fraudulent returns that  have passed through IRS detection systems. In August 2014, we reported  that IRS provided limited feedback to external parties on IDT leads they  submitted and offered external parties limited general information on IDT  refund fraud trends. We recommended that IRS provide actionable  feedback to all lead-generating third parties, and IRS neither agreed nor  disagreed.", "However, in response to our recommendation, IRS took a number of  steps. First, in November 2015, IRS reported that it had developed a  database to track leads submitted by financial institutions and the results  of those leads. IRS also stated that it had held two sessions with financial  institutions to provide feedback on external leads provided to IRS.  Second, in December 2015, IRS officials told us that the agency sent a  customer satisfaction survey asking financial institutions for feedback on  the external leads process. The agency was also considering other ways  to provide feedback to financial institutions. Third, in April 2016, IRS  officials told us that they plan to analyze preliminary survey results by  mid-April 2016. Finally, IRS officials reported that the agency shared  information with financial institutions in March 2016 and plans to do so on  a quarterly basis.

Examples  include:  Identifying and authenticating users\u2014such as through user  account-password combinations\u2014provides the basis for establishing  accountability and controlling access to a system. IRS established  policies for identification and authentication, including requiring  multifactor authentication for local and network access accounts, and  establishing password complexity and expiration requirements. It  also improved identification and authentication controls by, for  example, expanding the use of an automated mechanism to centrally  manage, apply, and verify password requirements. However,  weaknesses in identification and authentication controls remained.  For example, the agency used easily guessable passwords on  servers supporting key systems.", "Authorization controls limit what actions users are able to perform  after being allowed into a system. They should be based on the  concept of \u201cleast privilege,\u201d granting users the least amount of rights  and privileges necessary to perform their duties. While IRS  established policies for authorizing access to its systems, we found  that it continued to permit excessive access in some cases. For  example, users were granted rights and permissions in excess of  what they needed to perform their duties, including for an application  used to process electronic tax payment information and a database  on a human resources system.", "Cryptography controls protect sensitive data and computer  programs by rendering data unintelligible to unauthorized users and  protecting the integrity of transmitted or stored data. IRS policies  require the use of encryption and it continued to expand its use of  encryption to protect sensitive data. However, key systems we  reviewed had not been configured to encrypt sensitive user  authentication data.", "IRS also had weaknesses in configuration management controls, which  are intended to prevent unauthorized changes to information system  resources (e.g., software and hardware), and provide assurance that  systems are configured and operating securely. Specifically, while IRS  developed policies for managing the configuration of its information  technology (IT) systems and improved some configuration management  controls, it did not, for example, ensure security patch updates were  applied in a timely manner to databases supporting two key systems we  reviewed, including a patch that had been available since August 2012.", "To its credit, IRS had established contingency plans for the systems we  reviewed, which help ensure that when unexpected events occur, critical  operations can continue without interruption or can be promptly resumed,  and that information resources are protected. Specifically, IRS had  established policies for developing contingency plans for its information  systems and for testing those plans, as well as for implementing and  enforcing backup procedures. Moreover, the agency had documented  and tested contingency plans for its systems and improved continuity of  operations controls for several systems.", "Nevertheless, the control weaknesses we found can be attributed in part  to IRS\u2019s inconsistent implementation of elements of its agency-wide  information security program.

This, in turn, will allow IRS to limit  users\u2019 access to the minimum necessary to perform their job-related  functions, protect sensitive data when they are stored or in transit, audit  and monitor system activities, and physically secure its IT facilities and  resources.", "In commenting on drafts of our reports presenting the results of our fiscal  year 2015 audit, the IRS Commissioner stated that while the agency  agreed with our new recommendations, it will review them to ensure that  its actions include sustainable fixes that implement appropriate security  controls balanced against IT and human capital resource limitations.", "In conclusion, this year\u2019s tax filing season has generally gone smoothly  and IRS has improved customer service. While IRS has some initiatives  to review customer service and consider improvements, it still needs to  develop a comprehensive strategy for customer service that will meet the  needs of taxpayers. This strategy could include setting customer service  goals as well as benchmarking and monitoring performance.", "IRS also needs to strengthen its defenses for addressing IDT refund fraud  that is informed by assessing the cost, benefits, and risks of IRS\u2019s various  authentication options.", "Finally, weaknesses in information security can also increase the risk  posed by IDT refund fraud. While IRS has made progress in  implementing information security controls, it needs to continue to  address weaknesses in access controls and configuration management  and consistently implement all elements of its information security  program. The risks to which the IRS and the public are exposed have  been illustrated by recent incidents involving public-facing applications,  highlighting the importance of securing systems that contain sensitive  taxpayer and financial data.", "Chairman Roskam, Ranking Member Lewis, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my statement.
