In the past, Medicare had permitted these providers of these portable diagnostic tests to receive, in addition to the fee for performing the test, a separate payment for transporting the necessary equipment. However, HCFA eliminated separate transportation payments for ultrasound services effective January 1, 1996. HCFA eliminated separate transportation payments for EKG services effective January 1, 1997, but these payments were temporarily restored by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA).", "Some claim that eliminating separate transportation payments could ultimately increase Medicare outlays and adversely affect beneficiaries. They argue that providers will be less willing to provide EKG and ultrasound services without a separate transportation payment. As a consequence, Medicare could incur ambulance charges for homebound beneficiaries or those in nursing facilities to travel to hospitals for EKG and ultrasound diagnostic tests.", "Concerned over the possible adverse effect of the revised payment policies, you asked us to study how HCFA\u2019s change would affect Medicare beneficiaries and program costs. To address your concerns, we identified and analyzed (1) the Medicare recipients, places of service, and providers who might be affected most; (2) the number of services that would be affected by the changed policy; and (3) the effect on Medicare\u2019s program costs.", "We analyzed a national sample of Medicare claims data for 1995\u2014the last year in which carriers could pay separate transportation fees for both ultrasound and EKG equipment. Because relatively few of these diagnostic tests were performed in beneficiaries\u2019 residences, we focused our attention on tests conducted in nursing homes. With help from appropriate medical personnel, we reviewed medical records of nursing home residents in two states who had received either ultrasound or EKG services in the home during 1995. In addition, we discussed HCFA\u2019s policy with HCFA officials and industry representatives and sought the opinions of several medical associations and health care associations. We performed our work between April 1997 and February 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards except that we did not verify HCFA\u2019s data. We note, however, that this database, consisting of all Medicare Part B claims for a 5-percent sample of beneficiaries, is often used by researchers investigating important issues in health economics and policy.

For example, physicians do not receive separate transportation payments when they visit Medicare beneficiaries in nursing homes. However, this policy is not followed when it comes to the transportation of equipment used to do diagnostic tests. HCFA established specific guidance for carriers to follow regarding portable x-ray and EKG services. Because HCFA did not issue specific instructions for other diagnostic tests, such as ultrasound, each Medicare carrier developed its own policies.", "Section 1861(s)(3) of the Social Security Act provides the basis for the coverage of diagnostic x-rays furnished in a Medicare beneficiary\u2019s residence. HCFA believes that because of the increased costs associated with transporting x-ray equipment to the beneficiary, the Congress intended for HCFA to pay an additional amount for the transportation service furnished by an approved portable x-ray supplier. Thus, HCFA has established specific procedure codes to pay for the transportation of x-ray equipment.", "HCFA added EKG services allowed in homes to the established list of approved services that suppliers may provide and established a code to pay for the transportation of EKG equipment. Many Medicare carriers limited payment of transportation costs for EKG services to portable x-ray suppliers. However, others had allowed it for other types of providers such as independent physiological laboratories (IPL).", "HCFA never established a national policy for transportation costs related to ultrasound services. Each carrier developed its own policy. Medical directors for each of the carriers decided whether to reimburse for transportation costs separately. In 15 states, carriers had a policy to reimburse separately for transportation costs associated with ultrasound services.", "Beginning January 1, 1996, carriers could allow transportation payments for only the following services: (1) x-ray and standard EKG services furnished by an approved portable x-ray supplier and (2) standard EKG services furnished by an IPL under special conditions. For all other types of diagnostic tests payable under the physician fee schedule, travel expenses were considered \u201cbundled\u201d into the procedure payment. For example, carriers could no longer make separate transportation payments associated with ultrasound services.", "After further review, HCFA again revised its policy. HCFA concluded that the statute authorized carriers to make separate transportation payments only for portable x-ray services. Therefore, HCFA published a final regulation providing that effective January 1, 1997, carriers would no longer make separate transportation payments associated with EKG services.", "The enactment of the Balanced Budget Act in August 1997 caused additional changes in Medicare\u2019s transportation payment policy. First, BBA temporarily restored separate payments for transporting EKG equipment but not ultrasound equipment during 1998. The law requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make a recommendation by July 1, 1998, to the Committees on Commerce and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on whether there should be a separate Medicare transportation fee for portable EKGs starting in 1999.", "Second, BBA phases in a prospective payment system for skilled nursing care that will pay an all-inclusive per diem rate for covered services. Beneficiaries needing skilled care after being discharged from the hospital are covered under Part A for 100 days of care during a benefit period. Part A coverage includes room and board, skilled nursing and rehabilitative services, and other services and supplies. Thus, the per diem rate paid to nursing facilities would include all services during the period the beneficiary is receiving posthospital extended care. For example, services such as EKGs and ultrasound will no longer be paid for separately but will be included in the per diem rate. The prospective payment provision begins July 1, 1998.", "Third, BBA establishes an ambulance service fee schedule beginning in 2000. This provision is designed to help contain Medicare spending on ambulance service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nearly 90 Percent of Portable EKGs and Ultrasound Tests Are Done in Nursing Homes", "paragraphs": ["Medicare paid for more than 14 million EKG and 5 million ultrasound services in 1995 at a cost to the Medicare program of about $597 and $976 million, respectively. Most EKG and ultrasound services were performed in physicians\u2019 offices or hospitals. In 1995, about 2 percent of the EKG and less than 1 percent of the ultrasound services were provided in beneficiaries\u2019 homes or nursing homes, costing the Medicare program about $12 million for the EKGs and $8 million for the ultrasound services. Of these services, about 88 percent of the EKG and 82 percent of the ultrasound services were done in a nursing home. These services were usually provided by portable x-ray suppliers and IPLs. Table 1 compares these services in these settings.", "Because HCFA regulations allowed EKG service transportation payments to be paid only to portable x-ray providers and certain IPLs for EKG services done in a beneficiary\u2019s residence, it is not surprising that these providers accounted for 83 percent of all Medicare EKG services performed in nursing homes. Likewise, these two types of providers accounted for a high portion of the Medicare ultrasound services provided in nursing homes. General practitioners, cardiologists, and internists also provided EKG and ultrasound services.", "In 1995, 1,317 providers were doing EKGs and 337 were doing ultrasound services in nursing homes. Of the total EKG providers, 676 were portable x-ray suppliers and 75 were IPLs.

Thus, this change in transportation policy will have a larger effect on Medicare spending in some geographic areas.", "Eleven states accounted for nearly three-fourths of the 255,000 EKGs done in nursing homes. This appears to be disproportionately high when compared with the nursing home population in the 11 states. Figure 1 shows the use rates in each state per 100 Medicare nursing home residents.", "Furthermore, a handful of providers in each of these states accounted for most of the services. For example, in New York 7 percent of the providers accounted for 77 percent of the services.

An additional 37 percent of the portable EKGs and 68 percent of the ultrasound tests were done without the providers\u2019 receiving additional payments for transporting the equipment. Consequently, 56 percent of the EKG services and 89 percent of the ultrasound tests provided to beneficiaries in their place of residence would be unaffected by the elimination of separate transportation payments.", "There is some uncertainty, however, as to whether (and to what extent) providers will cut back on services for which they previously received a transportation payment. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that at least some of these services would also continue under a revised payment policy. If providers reduced services in nursing homes, some residents would be inconvenienced by having to travel to obtain these tests.

However, these savings would have materialized only to the extent that homebound beneficiaries and nursing home residents did not travel outside in Medicare-paid ambulances to receive these tests. We cannot predict the likelihood that savings will be realized because they depend upon the future actions of portable equipment providers and nursing home operators.", "Providers of portable equipment may continue to provide EKG and ultrasound services even if they no longer receive the separate transportation payments. Many mobile providers have established private business relationships with the nursing homes they serve and may be eager to maintain those relationships. In addition, many also provide other services to nursing homes, such as x-ray services. Therefore, they would be likely to continue EKG services to some degree.", "Prospective payment may change the way nursing facilities provide services. Some nursing homes may purchase the equipment to provide diagnostic tests in house. Representatives from two of the seven nursing homes we visited told us that they were considering purchasing EKG equipment and having nursing home staff perform the tests. The representatives noted that this would be feasible because EKG equipment is relatively inexpensive and staff need only limited training to perform the tests (no certification is needed). They also noted that residents needing EKGs would receive quicker service if the equipment were always on the premises.", "Because nursing homes may have additional transportation or staff costs for each test, the revised payment policy may produce Medicare savings by reducing the use of EKG and ultrasound services. During our review of case files at selected nursing homes, we observed a number of instances in which beneficiaries entering the nursing home were receiving EKG tests, although there were no indications that these beneficiaries were experiencing any problems to warrant such tests. In many of these situations, nursing home officials said that the tests provided baseline information.

We agree that our approach was conservative so as not to understate the potential for additional Medicare spending. However, as we state in the report, if providers continue to supply these services for business reasons, then Medicare might save money or incur additional costs below our estimated upper limit because fewer beneficiaries would need transporting by ambulance for the services.

We eliminated all codes that represented only a physician\u2019s interpretation or report and codes for procedures that were delivered in settings other than nursing homes.

Most of the beneficiaries who the nurses believed would have needed an ambulance were totally bedridden. The concern generating the order for the test had been either that an episode developed late at night or that a condition was serious enough to border on a call to 911.
