The variance data provided were from the  Department of Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) monthly variance reporting tool  which the department uses for internal oversight and external reporting  purposes. We identified the investments with reported variances of 10  percent or more from estimates as having significant variances and  determined the number of months they reported significant variances. For  these investments, we obtained the reason for the significant variances  from the information reported by Treasury on OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard (in  Treasury\u2019s Chief Information Officer comments) and followed up with IRS  for clarification as needed. Because the Affordable Care Act (ACA)  investment was not reporting monthly cost and schedule variances in  Treasury\u2019s reporting tool, we requested and analyzed the quarterly project  management reports summarizing the investment\u2019s cost and schedule  performance. We also identified OMB reporting requirements for  measuring progress towards useful segments and analyzed IRS\u2019s  monthly cost and schedule variance reports and the quarterly reports to  Congress that are derived from them against these requirements.", "For our second objective, we selected seven investments: Customer  Account Data Engine (CADE) 2; Modernized e-File (MeF); IRS.gov\u2014 which is comprised of the Public User Portal, Registered User Portal, and  Employee User Portal\u2014Return Review Program (RRP); Information  Reporting and Document Matching (IRDM); e-services; and ACA. We  performed a detailed analysis of the cost and schedule performance for  these seven investments in our April 2013 review of IRS\u2019s major  investments summarized in our prior report. We selected them again for  this review because (1) we identified reliability issues in the April 2013  review that we wanted to follow up on, and (2) these investments are still  critical to IRS\u2019s mission. As noted earlier, while ACA is not classified as  major investment in fiscal year 2013, we included it in our selection  because of its criticality to IRS\u2019s mission and expected costs. In addition,  IRS began reporting on it as a major investment in fiscal year 2014.", "We identified how each of the six investments in our selection which  reported monthly cost and schedule variances during fiscal year 2013  calculated projected amounts. We interviewed IRS officials responsible  for performing these calculations. We also determined the extent to which  these variances were included in the monthly reports by reviewing  monthly variance reports from October 2012 through September 2013. In  addition, to determine, for these investments, the extent to which the IRS  included variance data for completed activities in its external reporting  within the 60-day time frame specified in Treasury guidance, we analyzed  the four quarterly reports on the performance of IT investments submitted  by IRS to the appropriations committees and GAO between December  2012 and September 2013. Further, we identified all the activities  included in the variance calculations by analyzing monthly variance  reports and supplementing our analyses with interviews of IRS officials  cognizant of the manner in which IRS reports these variance data to  Treasury, including the Acting Manager of the IRS\u2019s Strategy and  Planning group which has oversight responsibility for this reporting. We  recently reported that IRS did not have guidance from Treasury for  calculating the variances associated with in-process activities. As such,  we did not perform a qualitative assessment of the investments\u2019 process  for calculating cost and schedule variances.", "To address our third objective, we interviewed IRS officials to determine  what progress the agency had made in developing a quantitative  measure of progress in delivering scope as we recommended in June  2012. When we learned IRS had not addressed our recommendation,  we followed up on the causes, and, for each of the investments in our  selection, identified the qualitative methods IRS said it was using instead.  We also analyzed the \u201cfunctional performance\u201d information IRS has  begun to include in its quarterly reports to the congressional committees  and GAO to determine the extent to which it completely and clearly  describes how delivered scope compares to what was planned.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2013 to April 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The variance  noted was due to resource contention\u2014staff were pulled off of IMF to  work on CADE 2 development and testing.", "IRDM experienced cost underruns from April 2013 to September  2013. The variances noted were due to, among other things, (1)  delivery partner services costing less than planned because of a delay  in the contract award being utilized and (2) costs were less than  planned because resources were reduced on the Business Master  File Analytics project and utilized on the Case Inventory Selection and  Analytics project.", "Integrated Data Retrieval System experienced a cost underrun in  September 2013. The variance noted was due to actual labor costs  being lower than planned due in part to retirements, attrition, and the  government-wide pay freeze.", "For investments that were significantly behind schedule, the Treasury  Chief Information Officer\u2019s comments on the federal IT dashboard  identified the following reasons:", "End User Systems and Services experienced a schedule overrun in  October 2012.

A baseline change request was submitted and  approved in April 2013.", "For ACA, MeF, and TSS, IRS reported the following reasons:", "ACA experienced a cost overrun for the last quarter of fiscal year. The  overrun noted was due to a timing difference between planned  obligations and actual contract award dates. ACA also experienced  cost underruns throughout the first three quarters of the fiscal year.  The underruns noted were due to (1) delays in contract awards, (2)  re-evaluation of the needs for technical contractor support, and (3)  underrun in IRS labor because of slower than expected hiring due to  sequestration.", "MeF experienced a cost overrun in October 2012. The variance noted  was due to a delay in the roll out of new forms and added  performance tuning stabilization and monitoring into the production  system; and baseline change request submitted. Additionally, MeF  experienced cost underruns from May 2013 to June 2013 and from  August 2013 to September 2013. The variances noted were due to (1)  the under-budget cost as the result of significantly lower infrastructure  costs than originally anticipated and the decoupling of XML  enhancement work, (2) lower infrastructure costs, (3) removal of  scope, and (4) fewer than anticipated change requests received from  business partners.", "Telecommunications Systems and Support experienced schedule  overruns from November 2012 through September 2013. The  variances noted were due to (1) delays associated with two projects\u2014 Video Conferencing and Enterprise Electronic Fax and Networks  Convergence, (2) construction delays associated with Hurricane  Sandy, and (3) delays associated with the phone carrier providing toll  free numbers. A baseline change request was submitted to address  the schedule variance. The investment also experienced cost  underruns from July 2013 to September 2013. The variances noted  were due to (1) changes in project scope, (2) projected costs being  incorrectly reported, and (3) a reduction in planned spending.

Information contained within these profiles includes, but is not  limited to:  Current life-cycle phase: Life-cycle phases can be represented as  planning; development, modernization, and enhancement;  operations and maintenance; or mixed. Planning refers to preparing,  or acquiring the information used to design the asset; assess the  benefits, risks, and risk-adjusted costs of alternative solutions; and  establish realistic cost, schedule, and performance goals for the  selected alternative, before proceeding to full acquisition or  termination of a project. Development, modernization, and  enhancement refers to projects and activities that result in new  assets/systems or projects and activities that result in changes or  modifications to existing assets that lead to substantive  improvements, implement legislative or regulatory requirements, or  meet an agency leadership request. Operations and maintenance  refers to those projects and activities that are operating in a  production environment.

There are a number of approaches that can be utilized by an  investment. IRS\u2019s Enterprise Lifecycle methodology includes the  following approaches: waterfall, planned maintenance, iterative, and  managed services. Waterfall is a sequential development of a  solution with planned reviews and formal approvals required before  continuation of work. The planned maintenance approach manages  change in an organized manner, minimizes the disruption caused by  frequent system changes, and increases the efficiency and  effectiveness of the system change process. Additionally, the  iterative approach is an adaptive development approach in which  projects start with a conceptual vision of the solution and end with  deployment, with repeated cycles of requirement discovery,  development, and testing in between. Finally, the managed services  approach is designed to capitalize on the benefits of managed  services provided by either an outside service, internal business  processes, and/or existing infrastructure service provider. This  provides useful information on the requirements of how a project is to  progress through the life cycle.", "Contract type: For purposes of this report, this can be broken down  into two categories. The first is firm, fixed price contracts in which the  price is not subject to any adjustments. The second is cost  reimbursement contracts which provide for the payment of allowable  incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. Types of cost  reimbursement contracts include, but are not limited to (1) cost plus  fixed fee in which actual costs and a fixed fee can be charged;  however, costs are not allowed to exceed the agreed upon estimate  without approval; and (2) cost plus incentive fee that provides for an  initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the  relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.", "Number of rebaselines: Rebaselines are changes to projects\u2019 cost,  schedule, and performance goals (i.e., baselines).
