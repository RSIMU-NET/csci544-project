The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plays a key role  in overseeing federal IT investments.

Federal IT spending has risen to an estimated $65 billion in  fiscal year 2008.", "OMB plays a key role in overseeing the implementation and management  of federal IT investments. To improve this oversight, Congress enacted the  Clinger-Cohen Act in 1996, expanding the responsibilities delegated to  OMB and agencies under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Among other  things, Clinger-Cohen requires agency heads, acting through agency chief  information officers, to better link their IT planning and investment  decisions to program missions and goals and to implement and enforce IT  management policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines. The act also  requires that agencies engage in capital planning and performance and  results-based management. OMB\u2019s responsibilities under the act include  establishing processes to analyze, track, and evaluate the risks and results  of major capital investments in information systems made by executive  agencies. OMB must also report to Congress on the net program  performance benefits achieved as a result of major capital investments in  information systems that are made by executive agencies.", "In response to the Clinger-Cohen Act and other statutes, OMB developed  policy for planning, budgeting, acquisition, and management of federal  capital assets. This policy is set forth in OMB Circular A-11 (section 300)  and in OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide (supplement to Part 7 of  Circular A-11), which directs agencies to develop, implement, and use a  capital programming process to build their capital asset portfolios. Among  other things, OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide directs agencies to    evaluate and select capital asset investments that will support core  mission functions that must be performed by the federal government and  demonstrate projected returns on investment that are clearly equal to or  better than alternative uses of available public resources; institute performance measures and management processes that monitor  actual performance and compare to planned results; and   establish oversight mechanisms that require periodic review of operational  capital assets to determine how mission requirements might have changed  and whether the asset continues to fulfill mission requirements and deliver  intended benefits to the agency and customers.", "To further support the implementation of IT capital planning practices as  required by statute and directed in OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide, we  have developed an IT investment management framework that agencies  can use in developing a stable and effective capital planning process.  Consistent with the statutory focus on selecting, controlling, and  evaluating investments, this framework focuses on these processes in  relation to IT investments specifically. It is a tool that can be used to  determine both the status of an agency\u2019s current IT investment  management capabilities and the additional steps that are needed to  establish more effective processes. Mature and effective management of IT  investments can vastly improve government performance and  accountability.

However, the federal government faces  enduring IT challenges in this area. For example, in January 2004 we  reported on mixed results of federal agencies\u2019 use of IT investment  management practices. Specifically, we reported that although most of  the agencies had IT investment boards responsible for defining and  implementing the agencies\u2019 investment management processes, agencies  did not always have important mechanisms in place for these boards to  effectively control investments, including decision-making rules for  project oversight, early warning mechanisms, and/or requirements that  corrective actions for underperforming projects be agreed upon and  tracked.

Accordingly, we  made several recommendations to agencies to improve their practices.", "In previous work using our investment management framework, we  reported that the use of IT investment management practices by agencies  was mixed. For example, a few agencies that have followed the framework  in implementing capital planning processes have made significant  improvements. In contrast, however, we and others have continued to  identify weaknesses at agencies in many areas, including immature  management processes to support both the selection and oversight of  major IT investments and the measurement of actual versus expected  performance in meeting established performance measures.
