The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014oversees health care coverage provided through Medicare, Medicaid, and the exchanges. Most servicemembers, and former servicemembers who retired from military service, and their dependents are entitled to DOD coverage, according to DOD officials. Those who are not entitled to DOD coverage, such as reservists and certain of their dependents, may be eligible to purchase it. Former servicemembers who left military service for reasons other than retirement are not eligible for DOD coverage. All former servicemembers are generally eligible for VA coverage.

VA does not generally require cost-sharing for those with certain service-connected conditions or low incomes, while it may for others.", "DOD and VA provide information about exchange-purchased coverage on their websites, including that their coverage satisfies the requirement for minimal essential coverage (MEC) established by PPACA. VA informs its beneficiaries that they do not qualify for federal subsidies that lower the cost of exchange plans, even if they meet income and other requirements, because VA coverage satisfies the requirement for MEC. VA also informs its beneficiaries that they may opt out of VA coverage, and thus potentially qualify for federal subsidies. DOD, however, does not provide information indicating that most individuals with DOD coverage cannot opt out of it and, therefore, cannot qualify for federal subsidies. Nor does DOD inform those that have the option of purchasing DOD coverage that they may qualify for federal subsidies, if they do not choose DOD coverage. This is inconsistent with federal internal controls that require communication with stakeholders, and by providing this information, DOD could potentially help servicemembers, certain former servicemembers, and their dependents make more informed decisions regarding their health care coverage.", "About 27 million servicemembers, former servicemembers, and their dependents had health care coverage through DOD, VA, Medicare, or Medicaid, or a combination of these in 2012, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.

For example, Medicare Part  A coverage does not generally require payment of premiums, but  beneficiaries who did not pay Medicare taxes while working may be  required to pay a monthly premium (of up to $426 in 2014). Part A beneficiaries\u2014including former servicemembers and their  dependents\u2014may be responsible for a deductible, coinsurance, or a  copayment for services. Medicare Parts B and D coverage generally  requires individuals to pay a monthly premium. The monthly premium for  Medicare Part B in 2014 ranges from $104.90 to $335.70, depending on  the beneficiary\u2019s income. Additionally, Medicare Part B generally requires  individuals to pay 20 percent of the cost of the medical service received.  Medicare Parts A and B have a per service limit on cost-sharing, but no  annual limit on these out-of-pocket costs. The costs, including premiums  and copayments, for Medicare Part C vary by health plan though there  are certain, established cost limits. For example, Medicare Advantage  plans are not able to charge more in cost-sharing than Original Medicare  for certain services, such as chemotherapy, renal dialysis, and skilled  nursing facility care. Specifically, Medicare Advantage plans cannot  require beneficiaries to share in the cost of the services beyond what is  allowed for Medicare Part B for services, which generally requires  beneficiaries to pay 20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount.  Additionally, Medicare Advantage plans have a yearly limit, which varies  by plan, on an individual\u2019s out-of-pocket costs for medical services. There  are no such annual out-of-pocket cost limits in the Original Medicare  program.", "A beneficiary generally pays no premium for this coverage unless the beneficiary or  spouse has worked fewer than 40 quarters in his or her lifetime, but the beneficiary is  responsible for required deductibles, coinsurance, and copayment amounts.", "Certain servicemembers and former servicemembers and their  dependents who have Medicare Parts A and B are also automatically  covered by TRICARE for Life. Because TRICARE for Life serves as  supplemental coverage that may minimize out-of-pocket expenses, such  as copayments and deductibles, these individuals may have lower out-of- pocket expenses than an individual who does not have this additional  coverage.", "State Medicaid programs may not impose premiums or cost-sharing on  certain populations or services. Specifically, states are prohibited from  imposing premiums on Medicaid beneficiaries\u2014including dependents of  servicemembers and former servicemembers\u2014with incomes below 150  percent of the federal poverty level. Additionally, states may not impose  cost sharing on services provided to certain populations, such as children  under the age of 18 or pregnant women. Further, states may not charge  cost-sharing for certain services, including emergency and family  planning services. States can choose to impose premiums or cost- sharing for other Medicaid beneficiaries, but these costs are subject to  certain limits. For example, total premiums and cost-sharing amounts  cannot exceed 5 percent of a family\u2019s income.", "Exchange-purchased coverage provided by participating health insurance  issuers may require beneficiaries\u2014including servicemembers, former  servicemembers, and their dependents\u2014to pay premiums and cost- sharing, such as deductibles and copayments. Individual premium and  cost-sharing amounts depend on the type of plan purchased, and  exchange plans are categorized according to the costs expected to be  paid by the plan\u2014designated as bronze, silver, gold, or platinum. For  example, a bronze plan will typically have lower premiums and higher  cost-sharing when services are delivered, while a gold or platinum plan  will have higher premiums and lower cost-sharing. Additionally, PPACA established an annual limit on cost-sharing for exchange plan  beneficiaries, which in 2014, was $6,350 for self-only coverage and  $12,700 for other coverage.", "PPACA established two forms of federal subsidies for exchange- purchased coverage\u2014premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions\u2014 which reduce costs of the coverage to individuals who qualify. To qualify  for federal subsidies, individuals must be eligible to enroll in an exchange  plan, meet income criteria, and not have MEC, including coverage  through government-sponsored programs, such as DOD or VA, Medicare,  or Medicaid. Individuals who purchase health care coverage through the  exchanges may qualify for premium tax credits if they have an income   Cost-sharing  between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. reductions, available to individuals with incomes from 100 to 250 percent  of the federal poverty limit, are only available to individuals who purchase  a silver plan through an exchange. In addition, the amounts of cost- sharing assistance vary by income. For example, in the case of one state  plan, individuals with incomes at 150 percent of the federal poverty level  and with a silver plan would have their primary care visit copayment  reduced from $45 to $3 and their specialty care visit copayment reduced  from $65 to $5.", "Federal subsidies for exchange-purchased coverage may be available to  certain former servicemembers and certain dependents of  servicemembers and former servicemembers who are not covered by  DOD or VA health care, if they meet applicable income and other   Most servicemembers and former servicemembers and  requirements.their dependents have MEC and therefore are ineligible for premium tax  credits and cost-sharing reductions, regardless of their income.Therefore, in order to qualify for federal subsidies, these individuals would  first need to cancel their government-sponsored coverage.

VA\u2019s website  also provides information on how former servicemembers and their  dependents who are enrolled in VA coverage may cancel this coverage, if  they so choose. This type of information may be useful for former  servicemembers and their dependents to compare the costs and other  factors associated with VA coverage with the costs of exchange plans.  For example, in some circumstances, former servicemembers and their  dependents who do not live near a VA medical center may wish to  consider whether federal subsidies may make exchange-purchased  coverage affordable and whether that coverage may enable them to  receive care closer to home.", "However, unlike VA\u2019s website, DOD\u2019s website does not provide  information on circumstances under which servicemembers or former  servicememembers who retired from military service, or their dependents  might qualify for federal subsidies, which could be useful in understanding  their health care choices. Specifically, DOD\u2019s website does not inform  servicemembers and former servicemembers that retired from military  service that they and their dependents are statutorily entitled to TRICARE  coverage and, as a result, they may not opt out of this coverage in order  to potentially qualify for federal subsidies.

DOD officials also stated that to avoid confusion, they direct  servicemembers and their dependents who are no longer eligible for  TRICARE, such as those who have separated from military service or  young adults over the age of 26, to obtain information on other coverage  options from the healthcare.gov website. However, healthcare.gov does  not inform servicemembers, former servicemembers that retired from  military service, and their dependents who may qualify for federal  subsidies that these subsidies are not available to individuals who have  coverage through TRICARE.

In general, if an individual chooses to  receive care from a VA provider, VA pays in full if the care is for a service- connected disability and, for a non-service-connected disability, may  assess any copayments that an individual may owe through VA rules.
