The Navy and its shipbuilders have learned lessons from construction of the first two seaframes that have positioned them to more effectively construct future vessels. However, technical issues with the first two seaframes have yet to be fully resolved. Addressing these technical issues has required the Navy to implement design changes at the same time LCS 3 and LCS 4 are being built. Incorporating changes during this phase will likely require additional labor hours beyond current forecasts. Together, these challenges may hinder the ability of shipbuilders to apply lessons learned to follow-on ships and could undermine anticipated benefits from recent capital investments in the LCS shipyards. Challenges developing mission packages have delayed the timely fielding of promised capabilities, limiting the ships' utility to the fleet during initial deployments. Until these challenges are resolved, it will be difficult for the Navy to align seaframe purchases with mission package procurements and execute planned tests. Key mine countermeasures and surface warfare systems encountered problems in operational and other testing that delayed their fielding. For example, four of six Non-Line-of-Sight Launch System missiles did not hit their intended targets in recent testing, and the Department of Defense has since canceled the program. Further, Navy analysis of anti-submarine warfare systems has shown the planned systems do not contribute significantly to the anti-submarine warfare mission. These combined challenges have led to procurement delays for all three mission packages. Mission package delays have also disrupted program test schedules--a situation exacerbated by early deployments of initial ships--limiting their availability for operational testing. In addition, these delays could disrupt program plans for simultaneously acquiring seaframes and mission packages. Until mission packages are proven, the Navy risks investing in a fleet of ships that does not deliver promised capability. The Navy entered contract negotiations in 2009 for fiscal year 2010 funded seaframes with an incomplete understanding of LCS program costs. These contract negotiations proved unsuccessful, prompting the Navy to revise its acquisition strategy for the program. The contractors' proposals for construction of the next three ships exceeded the approximate $1.4 billion in funds the Navy had allocated in its fiscal year 2010 budget. In response, the Navy revised its strategy to construct one seaframe design instead of two for fiscal year 2010 ships and beyond in an effort to improve affordability. Navy cost analyses completed prior to the failed negotiations in 2009 lack several characteristics essential to a high-quality cost estimate. These characteristics include the completion of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and an independent review of the cost estimate. The Navy plans to complete a more comprehensive cost estimate before award of additional ship contracts in 2010."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends the Secretary of Defense take actions to ensure more realistic cost estimates, timely incorporation of design changes, and coordination of seaframe and mission package acquisition.

The Navy is procuring the first four ships in two different designs  from shipbuilding teams led by Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics.  Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics currently build their designs at  Marinette Marine and Austal USA shipyards, respectively.

To deploy LCS\u2019s mine countermeasures and anti- submarine warfare systems, the Navy will rely extensively on (1)  automated launch, handling, and recovery systems embedded in each  seaframe and (2) helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles. The Navy\u2019s  acquisition approach is to populate initial versions of mission packages  with a mixture of developmental and production-representative systems,  gradually moving to all production-representative systems that constitute  the baseline configuration for each package. The Navy plans to procure 55  seaframes and 64 mission packages (24 mine countermeasures, 24 surface  warfare, and 16 anti-submarine warfare) as part of the LCS program.", "The Navy has required LCS seaframes to meet Level 1 survivability  standards. Ships built to Level 1 are expected to operate in the least severe  environment, away from the area where a carrier group is operating or the  general war-at-sea region. These vessels should also maintain good  handling in bad weather\u2014including seas above 30 feet high (sea state  8)\u2014and have systems for fighting fires on board the ships, hardening  against electromagnetic pulses, and protection against chemical,  biological, or radiological contamination. Unlike surface warships like  cruisers and destroyers, Level 1 ships (including LCS) are not designed to  maintain their mission capabilities after incurring substantive damage.  Current ships in the fleet built to the Level 1 standard include material  support ships, mine-warfare vessels, and patrol combatants.", "Two broad categories of contract types are available for government  procurements, including ship procurement: fixed-price and cost- reimbursement. Fixed-price contracts provide for a firm price or, in  appropriate cases, an adjustable price that may include a ceiling price, a  target price, or both. This contract type places the risk on the contractor,  who generally bears the responsibility of increased costs of performance.  Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred  costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. This contract type places  most of the risk on the government, which may pay more than budgeted  should incurred costs be more than expected when the contract was  signed.", "The Navy awarded cost-reimbursable contracts for detail design and  construction of the first two seaframes\u2014LCS 1 and LCS 2\u2014in December  2004 and October 2005 for $188.2 million and $223.2 million, respectively.  It later exercised options on each of these contracts in June and December  2006 for construction of the third and fourth ships (LCS 3 and LCS 4).  However, changing technical requirements, evolving designs, and  construction challenges increased the government\u2019s estimated prices at  completion for the LCS 1 and LCS 2 seaframes to about $500 million each.  This cost growth precipitated concern within the Navy that similar  outcomes were possible for LCS 3 and LCS 4. In response, the Navy  reassessed program costs and structure, revisited the acquisition strategy  for future ships, and entered into negotiations with its shipbuilders to  convert the LCS 3 and LCS 4 contracts into fixed-price contracts. The Navy  was unable to reach agreement with its shipbuilders on fixed-price terms  for these ships, subsequently leading the Navy to terminate, in part, the  LCS 3 and LCS 4 contracts in April and November 2007 for the  convenience of the government. In March and May 2009, the Navy  awarded new fixed-price contracts for LCS 3 and LCS 4.

Leading commercial  firms assess a ship design as stable once all basic and functional design  activities have been completed. Basic and functional design refers to two- dimensional drawings and three-dimensional, computer-aided models  (when employed) that fix the ship\u2019s hull structure; set the ship\u2019s  hydrodynamics; route all major distributive systems including electricity,  water, and other utilities; and identify the exact positioning of piping and  other outfitting within each block of the ship. At the point of design  stability, the shipbuilder has a clear understanding of both ship structure  as well as ship electrical, piping, and other systems that traverse individual  blocks of the ship. To achieve design stability, shipbuilders need suppliers  (also called vendors) to provide complete, accurate system information  prior to entering basic design. This vendor-furnished information  describes the exact dimensions of a system or piece of equipment going  into a ship, including space and weight requirements, and also  requirements for power, water, and other utilities that will have to feed the  system.", "As is typical for all ships, the LCS construction phase includes several  steps: block fabrication, assembly and outfitting of blocks, block erection,  launch, and delivery. During block fabrication, metal plates are welded  together into elements called blocks. Blocks are the basic building units  for a ship, and when completed they will form completed or partial  compartments, including accommodation space, engine rooms, and  storage areas. Blocks are generally outfitted with pipes, brackets for  machinery or cabling, ladders, and any other equipment that may be  available for installation at this early stage of construction. This allows a  block to be installed as a completed unit when it is welded to the hull of  the ship. Installing equipment at the block stage of construction is  preferable because access to spaces is not limited by doors or machinery,  unlike at later phases. Blocks are welded together to form grand blocks  and then erected with other grand blocks in a drydock or, in the case of  LCS, in a building hall. Finally, once the ship is watertight and the decision  is made to launch\u2014or float the ship in water\u2014the ship is then towed into  a quay or dock area where final outfitting and testing of machinery and  equipment like main engines will occur. Afterwards, the ship embarks on  sea trials where performance is evaluated against the contractually  required specifications and overall quality is assessed. Following sea trials,  the shipyard delivers the ship to the buyer.", "LCS 1 was delivered to the Navy in September 2008, with LCS 2 following  in December 2009.

Currently, LCS 1 is on deployment, LCS 2 is  undergoing post-delivery work, and LCS 3 and LCS 4 remain in different  stages of construction. In addition, development and testing activities for  the mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, and surface warfare  mission packages continue.

LCS 1 will conduct operations  where it will be able to take advantage of its speed and will be equipped  with an incomplete version of the surface warfare package. Because the  surface warfare mission package is incomplete, the range of missions LCS  1 is capable of executing will be constrained during its initial deployment.", "Furthermore, the surface warfare mission package onboard LCS 1 has yet  to be fully integrated with the seaframe and lacks key capabilities  necessary to defeat surface threats. For example, the 30-millimeter guns  have undergone testing with the LCS 1 seaframe, but have yet to be fully  integrated with the ship\u2019s combat suite. Also, while the guns provide a  close range self-defense capability, Navy officials report LCS 1 is currently  unable to automatically transfer tracking data from the ship\u2019s radar to the  30-millimeter guns. In addition, because of excess MH-60R helicopter  demands, the Navy has assigned the armed helo variant of the MH-60S  helicopter to LCS 1 for its maiden deployment. Although this MH-60S  variant carries air-to-surface missiles and crew-served side machine guns  (among other offensive capabilities), it does not have the multi-mode radar  found on the MH-60R\u2014a shortfall that could constrain LCS 1\u2019s ability to  execute surface warfare missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mission Package Delays Coupled with Early Deployment of LCS Seaframes Require Deferral of Key Test Events", "paragraphs": ["Neither LCS seaframe design\u2014nor any of the three LCS mission  packages\u2014has completed initial operational test and evaluation.

Under the terms of the  new strategy, the Navy will contract with a single source on a fixed-price  basis for up to 10 ships (2 ships awarded per year) through fiscal year  2014.

For the basic construction cost  element, the Navy relied primarily on contractor cost proposals dating to  May 2008 and November 2008.

To supplement our analysis and gain additional  visibility into the Navy\u2019s process for developing its LCS estimate, we  interviewed officials from Naval Sea Systems Command\u2019s Cost  Engineering and Analysis directorate; LCS Seaframe program officials; and  the Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 to August 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Methodology Used to Perform Cost Estimating Analysis", "paragraphs": ["To evaluate estimated Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) seaframe procurement  costs as outlined in the Navy\u2019s total ownership cost baseline (August  2009), GAO employed criteria from our Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide. In developing this guide, GAO cost experts identified 12 steps  consistently applied by cost-estimating organizations throughout the  federal government and industry and considered best practices for the  development of reliable cost estimates.

Is the WBS product-oriented, traceable to the statement of work,  and at an appropriate level of detail to ensure that cost elements  are neither omitted nor double-counted?  b.  Is the WBS standardized so that cost data can be collected and  used for estimating future programs?  c.  Does the cost estimate WBS match the schedule and earned value  management (EVM) WBS?  d.  Is the WBS updated as the program becomes better defined and to  reflect changes as they occur?  e.  Is there a WBS dictionary that defines what is included in each  element and how it relates to others in the hierarchy?", "Step Five: Identify Ground Rules and Assumptions    Are there defined ground rules and assumptions that document the  rationale and any historical data to back up any claims?  a.  Have risks associated with any assumptions been identified and  traced to specific WBS elements?  b.  Have budget constraints, as well as the effect of delaying program  content, been defined?  c.
