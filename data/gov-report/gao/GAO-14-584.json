Several contracting and program officials said that their commands gave more attention to whether LPTA is an alternative option in light of declining budgets and efficiency initiatives.

In contrast, in the eight tradeoff case studies, contracting and program officials were less certain about requirements, were looking for innovative solutions, or wanted to use non-cost factors to differentiate vendors. For example, the United States Army Corps of Engineers used technical non-cost factors to evaluate vendors' abilities to use robotics for explosives disposal. These factors are generally consistent with guidance in the Federal Acquisition Regulation and DOD's March 2011 source selection procedures.", "DOD, through courses offered by the Defense Acquisition University (DAU) and the military departments, provides both classroom and online training related to source selection processes to its acquisition personnel.

In these cases, DOD may award a contract   to other than the lowest-priced vendor if DOD determines that a           higher-priced vendor provides a greater benefit to DOD, and this greater  benefit is worth paying an additional cost, or price differential.  Alternatively, DOD may also use a best value, lowest price technically  acceptable (LPTA) process. In the LPTA process, DOD awards to the  lowest priced vendor that is technically acceptable, and no tradeoffs are  permitted. Proper implementation of these processes is essential to  ensure that DOD lays the foundation for successful acquisition outcomes,  especially at a time of declining spending.", "Committee reports from the Senate and House Armed Services  committees and the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 mandated GAO  to report on DOD\u2019s use of best value processes.

From a population of 2,851 contracts with  over $1 million in obligations, we selected a random projectable sample of  227 contracts. We then used a $25 million threshold to divide our data set  based on a Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement  (DFARS) requirement that contracts for products or services with          $25 million or more in estimated total costs for any fiscal year have  written acquisition plans, which contain information on the anticipated  source selection process. For contracts with obligations of $25 million or  more, we compared the percentage of contracts solicited using the best  value processes to fiscal year 2009 data that we reported in October  2010. Our prior report did not include contracts with lower obligations.  Ninety-three contracts from this sample had higher obligations of          $25 million or more and 134 contracts had lower obligations over            $1 million and less than $25 million. We determined that 44 contracts  were either incorrectly coded, such as non-competed contracts that were  identified as competed or contracts that used source selection processes  other than the best value processes. We excluded these contracts, which  resulted in a total of 183 contracts in our sample that we reviewed,  including 86 contracts with obligations of $25 million or more and 97  contracts with obligations over $1 million and less than $25 million. After  accounting for these errors and assessing the reliability of FPDS-NG data  by electronically testing the data to identify problems with consistency,  completeness, or accuracy and reviewing relevant documentation, we  determined that FPDS-NG data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of our review. We obtained and analyzed solicitation documents for all  contracts in our sample to identify what source selection process DOD  used. Further, we reviewed our sample of contracts that DOD awarded  using tradeoff to identify how often DOD considered non-cost factors  more important than price, and identified the most frequently used       non-cost factors. We also used FPDS-NG and contract and solicitation  documentation to identify characteristics of the contracts in our sample.", "To identify what factors DOD considers when choosing a source selection  process, we analyzed the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), DFARS,  and DOD and military departments\u2019 policy and guidance on source  selection. We supplemented the review of these documents with  interviews of senior DOD policy officials at Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy, and at the Army, Navy, and Air Force headquarters.  We also interviewed officials from at least two commands\u2014based upon  such factors as the number of contract actions and obligation amounts\u2014 at each military department (Army, Navy, and Air Force), as well as the  Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to discuss factors affecting their decision  on which source selection process to use. In addition, we selected 16  new, competitively awarded contracts from our sample with obligations  ranging from $1.1 million to $150.7 million in fiscal year 2013 to further  our understanding of why acquisition\u2014including contracting and  program\u2014officials chose a particular source selection process. Our 16  case studies included a selection from each military department and DLA,  different product and service types, and a mix of tradeoff and LPTA  processes. We also interviewed industry associations to identify their  perspectives about DOD\u2019s source selection processes.", "To determine what training DOD provides to its acquisition personnel on  source selection processes, we met with Defense Acquisition University  (DAU) officials and instructors and reviewed training materials. We also  obtained workforce data from the DOD Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), Human Capital  Initiatives.

Within the best value continuum, DOD  may choose a process that it considers the most advantageous to the  government, either the LPTA or the tradeoff process (see figure 1).", "DOD may elect to use the LPTA process where the requirement is clearly  defined and the risk of unsuccessful contract performance is minimal. In  such cases, DOD may determine that cost or price should play a  dominant role in the source selection. When using the LPTA process,  DOD specifies its requirements in the solicitation. Contractors submit their  proposals and DOD determines which of the contractors meet or exceed  those requirements, no tradeoffs between cost or price and non-cost  factors are permitted, and the award is made based on the lowest price  technically acceptable proposal submitted to the government.", "By contrast, DOD may elect to use a tradeoff process in acquisitions  where the requirement is less definitive, more development work is  required, or the acquisition has a greater performance risk. In these  instances, non-cost evaluation factors, such as technical capabilities or  past performance, may play a dominant role in the source selection  process. Tradeoffs among price and non-cost factors allow DOD to  accept other than the lowest priced proposal. The FAR requires DOD to  state in the solicitation whether all evaluation factors other than cost or  price, when combined, are significantly more important than,  approximately equal to, or significantly less important than cost or price.", "In October 2010, we reported that DOD used best value processes for  approximately 95 percent of its new, competitively awarded contracts in  which $25 million or more was obligated in fiscal year 2009. DOD  awarded approximately 26 percent using the LPTA process and 69  percent using the tradeoff process. DOD awarded the remaining 5  percent using sealed bidding, which is a competitive process where  award is made to the responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the  invitations for bid and is most advantageous for the government  considering only price and price-related factors included in the  solicitation. At that time, we found that the majority of the contracts were  awarded using a tradeoff process in which all evaluation factors other  than cost or price, when combined, were significantly more important than  cost or price. Our analysis showed that DOD considered past  performance and technical capability evaluation factors as the most  important among the non-cost factors. Further, we found using a tradeoff  process can be more complex and take more time than other source  selection methods, and requires that acquisition staff have proper  guidance, needed skills, and sound business judgment. While DOD and  the military departments had taken steps to improve source selection  procedures, acquisition personnel noted a lack of training to assist them  in deciding whether or not a price differential is warranted when making  tradeoff decisions. We recommended that to help DOD effectively employ  best value tradeoff processes, DOD develop training elements, such as  case studies, that focus on reaching tradeoff decisions, as it updates its  training curriculum. DOD concurred and implemented the  recommendation in August 2012.", "DOD issued new guidance that emphasizes affordability and  standardization of best value processes since our analysis of fiscal year  2009 contracts. In September 2010, the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD(AT&L)) issued a  memorandum that established its Better Buying Power Initiative to obtain  greater efficiency and productivity in defense spending. In its  memorandum, USD(AT&L) emphasized that DOD must prepare to  continue supporting the warfighter through the acquisition of products and  services in potentially fiscally constrained times. USD(AT&L) noted that  DOD must \u201cdo more without more.\u201d In April 2013, USD(AT&L) issued  another memorandum to update the Better Buying Power Initiative. This  memorandum identifies seven areas USD(AT&L) is pursuing to increase  efficiency and productivity in defense spending. One area is incentivizing  productivity and innovation in industry and government. As part of this  guidance, USD(AT&L) states that \u201cbest value\u201d in a competitive source  selection should generally indicate that the government is open to paying  more (up to some amount) than the minimum price bid in return for a  product that provides more than the minimum needed performance. In  addition, USD(AT&L) states that LPTA should be used in situations where  DOD would not realize any value from a proposal exceeding its minimum  technical or performance requirements and that another process should  be used when standards of performance and quality are subjective. A  second area of this guidance includes improving the professionalism of  the total acquisition workforce. DOD has previously reported that training  is a critical element of improving and sustaining a high quality workforce  with the right skills and capabilities.", "USD(AT&L) also issued source selection procedures in March 2011 to  standardize the methodology and process that DOD uses to conduct  competitively negotiated source selections. For example, USD(AT&L)  outlined a common set of principles and procedures for conducting  acquisitions using the best value processes including the use of  standardized rating criteria and descriptions for technical capability and  past performance factors. Further, similar to information presented in the  Better Buying Power Initiative, USD(AT&L) stated in the procedures that  the LPTA process may be used in situations where the government would  not realize any value from a proposal exceeding minimum technical or  performance requirements, often for acquisitions of commercial or       non-complex services or supplies which are clearly defined and expected  to be low risk. In its April 2013 memorandum updating the Better Buying  Power Initiative, USD(AT&L) directed the director of Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy to update the guidance to describe  the characteristics of a technically acceptable solution by July 1, 2013. As  of July 2014, DOD officials are coordinating comments on a draft revision  of the guidance. The Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy official  in charge of the revision told us the original due date of July 1, 2013 was  established before they decided to do a more comprehensive update of  the guidance, which has contributed to the date slipping for its  completion.", "During the time that USD(AT&L) issued these initiatives and guidance\u2014 specifically, between fiscal years 2009 and 2013\u2014DOD experienced a  number of changes in its contracting activity, including:", "Total obligations for products and services decreased from            $380 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $310 billion in fiscal year 2013,", "Obligations on new, competed contracts decreased from $70 billion in  fiscal year 2009 to $43 billion in fiscal year 2013, and", "Obligations on new, competed contracts of $25 million or more  decreased from $39 billion in fiscal year 2009 to $24 billion in fiscal  year 2013.", "See figure 2 for our analysis of DOD\u2019s contract obligations from  FPDS-NG for fiscal year 2013.", "Even though DOD\u2019s obligations decreased between fiscal year 2009 and  2013, it did acquire a similar mix of products and services in both years.

Further, declining  budgets encouraged contracting and program officials to streamline  requirements. For example:", "The Executive Director of Army Contracting Command\u2014Aberdeen  Proving Ground, one of five Army Contracting Command centers\u2014 said that overall there is an increased cost consciousness regarding  acquisitions, resulting from the Better Buying Initiatives and declining  budgets. As a part of that increased cost consciousness, there is an  increased willingness and necessity to re-examine tools that could  present better prices. For example, the Executive Director referred to  LPTA as \u201ca tool that has been at the bottom of the source selection  tool box collecting dust for some time.\u201d As it became necessary to  take a look at what is really needed, they have \u201cdusted off\u201d the LPTA  tool and had more discussions about how to set the technical  acceptability at an appropriate level where there is no additional  benefit from paying for more than that level.", "Contracting officials from Naval Facilities and Engineering Command  stated that in the current fiscal environment of \u201cdoing more with less,\u201d  they are educating their contracting personnel to use LPTA when  appropriate. For example, on March 28, 2013, the Command sent an  email communication to its contracting staff that provided guidance on  the use of LPTA for task orders on multiple award contracts that are  less than $10 million. The guidance stated that the contracting officer  may choose to consider only price or cost for award purposes when  the requirement is valued at less than $10 million, considered to be  non-complex, and where non-cost factors are deemed unnecessary.  These officials stated LPTA is less complex and less time consuming  than tradeoff, and as a result, they can save personnel resources. In  addition to internal guidance, Navy officials told us that the Better  Buying Power Initiative also directs acquisition personnel to look for  efficiencies and streamlining in acquisitions.", "Contracting officials from Naval Supply Systems Command stated  they increased their scrutiny on tradeoff acquisitions, which has  contributed to a cultural shift to increase the consideration of LPTA as  an alternative source selection process. The command issued an  October 9, 2012 memorandum to contracting activities that states if  non-cost factors are more important than price, the acquisition must  be reviewed by a senior level acquisition executive.", "Similarly, Air Force Materiel Command contracting and program  officials stated that given the budget environment, it is increasingly  difficult to justify higher dollar solutions from a technical standpoint  when solutions may exist that meet the minimum requirement.", "DLA contracting officials stated that in light of resource constraints, it  is increasingly common to purchase products that meet the program\u2019s  needs without overstating the requirement.

To help address concerns that  DOD had become too reliant on contractors to support core functions and  to rebuild the capacity and skill sets that eroded in the years that followed  the downsizing of the workforce in the 1990s, DOD increased its number  of acquisition workforce positions from 133,103 in fiscal year 2009 to  151,355 in fiscal year 2013\u2014including a 9.5 percent increase or an  additional 2,616 positions\u2014in the contracting career field.", "DAU officials identified five training courses that are taken either online or  in the classroom to provide acquisition personnel, including contracting  and program officials, the knowledge and skills necessary to make source  selection decisions. Contracting personnel are required or recommended  to complete all five of the identified training courses at some point in their  career to obtain specific DAWIA certifications. Additionally, DAU makes  these classes available to personnel outside the DAWIA acquisition  workforce. Based on our analysis of student self-reported exit data in  fiscal year 2013 and our discussion with DAU officials, we found that  many graduates for these courses did not indicate their career field when  completing the course registration or exit survey, particularly for online  courses, which makes it difficult to know how many personnel outside of  the DAWIA workforce with acquisition-related responsibilities took these  courses. In September 2011, we reported on personnel working on  service acquisitions who are outside the DAWIA acquisition workforce  with acquisition-related responsibilities and found the number of these  individuals to be substantial. As such, we recommended that the  Secretary of Defense establish criteria and a time frame for identifying  personnel outside the DAWIA acquisition workforce with            acquisition-related responsibilities.

We determined 1) the extent to which DOD used best value  processes in fiscal year 2013; (2) the factors DOD considers when  choosing a source selection process; and (3) training DOD provides to its  acquisition personnel on source selection processes. In addition, in  response to a matter identified in a 2013 report from the House Armed  Services Committee, appendix II includes information on the military  departments\u2019 acquisitions of body armor vests in fiscal year 2013.", "To determine the extent DOD used the best value processes in fiscal year  2013, we used data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) as of October 2013 to identify a population of  contracts based on the following criteria: (1) newly awarded by DOD in  fiscal year 2013, (2) competitively awarded, and (3) had obligations of  over $1 million in fiscal year 2013. This analysis identified a population of  2,851 contracts, and from this population we selected a stratified random  sample of 227 contracts, with the strata defined by whether the contract  had obligations of $25 million or more, or whether its obligations totaled  over $1 million and less than $25 million. We divided the data into two  groups including contracts with higher obligations of $25 million or more  and contracts with lower obligations over $1 million and less than          $25 million. We used the $25 million threshold to divide our data set  based on a Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement  (DFARS) requirement that contracts for products or services with          $25 million or more in estimated total costs for any fiscal year have  written acquisition plans, which contain information on the anticipated  source selection process. more, we compared the percentage of contracts solicited using best value  processes to fiscal year 2009 data we reported in October 2010.prior report did not include contracts with lower obligations of less than  $25 million.", "DFARS \u00a7 207.103(d)(i)(B).", "We obtained and analyzed the solicitation documents for all of the  contracts in our sample to identify the source selection process DOD  used. We verified the contract award fields in FPDS-NG with contract and  solicitation data to ensure that the contracts within our sample were        in-scope. Based on that analysis, we determined that a total of 44  contracts were out of scope for our review. These 44 contracts were  excluded from our analysis, because they were either incorrectly coded in  our key parameters, or were awarded using processes outside of the  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 14 on sealed bidding or Part  15 on contracting by negotiation (which includes best value processes)  and consequently should not have been in our sample, resulting in a total  of 183 contracts in our review (see table 6). After accounting for these  errors, we assessed the reliability of FPDS-NG data by electronically  testing the data to identify problems with consistency, completeness, or  accuracy and reviewed relevant documentation. We determined that the  FPDS-NG data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selection,  our sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided different estimates, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 8 percentage  points). This is the interval that would contain the actual population value  for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn. Unless otherwise  noted, percentage estimates of contracts with obligations of $25 million or  more have 95 percent confidence intervals within +/- 8 percentage points  of the estimate itself. Similarly, for contracts with obligations over            $1 million and less than $25 million, percentage estimates have  confidence intervals within +/- 10 percentage points of the estimate itself.", "In addition, to compare characteristics of contracts in our sample that  used best value processes for both strata, we determined contract type,  the type of procurement (product versus service), and if commercial item  procedures were used for our sample using FPDS-NG data and  conducted data reliability analysis on these fields, by verifying this  information with the contract and solicitation documents. For the contracts  identified as tradeoff, we analyzed the contract and solicitation  documentation to identify the most frequently used non-cost evaluation  factors and their relative importance to price.", "To identify what factors DOD considers when choosing a source selection  process, we analyzed the FAR, DFARS, and DOD and military  departments\u2019 regulation, policy, and guidance on source selection. We  interviewed senior DOD policy officials at Defense Procurement and  Acquisition Policy, and at the Army, Navy, and Air Force headquarters.  We also interviewed officials from at least two buying commands\u2014based  upon such factors as the number of contract actions and obligation  amounts\u2014at each military department (Army, Navy, and Air Force), as  well as the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to discuss factors affecting  their decision process on which source selection process to use. In  addition, we analyzed our sample of 183 contracts and selected 16 new,  competitively awarded contracts with obligations ranging from $1.1 million  to $150.7 million to further our understanding of why acquisition officials  chose the source selection process. Our 16 case studies\u20148 tradeoff and  8 LPTA\u2014included at least 1 from each military department and DLA,  different product and service types, and amount of dollars obligated in  fiscal year 2013. For the case studies, we interviewed DOD contracting  and program officials and reviewed contract documentation, including the  acquisition plan, solicitation, and source selection decision memorandum  to further understand the source selection decision making process. The  results from our review of these selected contracts cannot be generalized  beyond the specific contracts selected.", "During the course of our review, we also interviewed officials from the  following commands:", "Department of the Army, Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen  Proving Ground, Maryland; Medical Command, Fort Detrick,  Maryland; and Intelligence and Security Command, Fort Belvoir,  Virginia", "Department of the Army, United States Army Corps of Engineers,  Washington, D.C., and Huntsville Center, Alabama", "Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent  River, Maryland; Naval Facilities Command, Navy Yard, Washington,  D.C.; and Naval Supply Systems Command, Mechanicsburg,  Pennsylvania", "Department of the Navy, United States Marine Corps Installations and  Logistics Command, Navy Annex, Virginia; and Marine Corps  Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia", "Department of the Air Force, Installation Contracting Agency and Air  Force Materiel Command, both located at Wright-Patterson Air Force  Base, Ohio", "Defense Logistics Agency-Energy, Ft. Belvoir, Virginia; and Defense  Logistics Agency-Troop Support, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Joint Theater Support Contracting Command, Kabul, Afghanistan.", "To determine what training DOD provides to its acquisition personnel on  source selection processes, we met with Defense Acquisition University  (DAU) officials and instructors and reviewed training materials. We also  obtained attendance and workforce data from the DOD Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics),  Human Capital Initiatives. Further, we collected and reviewed military  department and command specific training documents to identify if  additional source selection training is given in addition to DAU provided  training. We also interviewed DOD policy officials at Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy, several commands at the military  departments, as well as contracting and program personnel at the  contracting offices of the selected military departments from the 16 case  studies on training provided related to source selection processes.", "We supplemented these case studies with interviews with industry  associations to identify their perspectives about DOD\u2019s source selection  processes.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2013 through July  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Knowledge of requirements or  vendors were key considerations in each acquisition, but distinct needs  led to different decisions about which source selection process to use  even when acquiring the similar product.", "The Marine Corps issued one delivery order to purchase soft body  armor vests for $2.3 million in fiscal year 2013 using the lowest price  technically acceptable (LPTA) process. It issued this order from a  multiple award, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract  awarded to two vendors in fiscal year 2009 using the LPTA process.  The contracting officer told us they chose to use LPTA for the base  contract because they consider soft body armor vests to be a  commodity product with clearly defined technical performance  specifications. Further, the contracting officer, in consultation with the  program office, saw no opportunity for tradeoff above industry  standard because the industry standard met their current needs.  Ongoing research and development showed that any tradeoff for  enhanced performance would lead to the armor being heavier, an  unacceptable outcome. For the base contracts, the Marine Corps  awarded to the second and third lowest priced vendors, because the  lowest priced vendor was deemed non-responsible.", "DLA issued 23 delivery orders to purchase soft body armor vests for  $288.1 million in fiscal year 2013. It issued these orders from three  separate IDIQ contracts awarded to three vendors in fiscal years 2011  and 2012 using the tradeoff process. DLA contracting officials told us  that they chose to use the tradeoff process for these contracts  because they wanted to use past performance as a key discriminator,  which is generally not allowed using the LPTA process. Further,  because DLA buys for sustainment purposes and its quantity needs  fluctuate, officials told us that past performance was a critical  determination factor requiring the use of the tradeoff process, in  addition to the vendor\u2019s historic production capacity, delivery  schedule, and other performance capabilities.", "The Army issued one delivery order to purchase soft body armor  vests for $10,201 in fiscal year 2013 using the LPTA process. It  issued this order from one of the multiple award, IDIQ contracts  awarded to eight vendors in fiscal years 2009 and 2010 using the  tradeoff process. Army contracting officials told us they chose to use  the tradeoff process for the base contract, because it provided the  Army more discretion in evaluating past performance as well as  leaving open the possibility that industry vendors might offer a more  innovative solution. Once the Army had a group of qualified vendors  on contract, they could then use the LPTA process for subsequent  buys."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact name above, the following staff members made  key contributions to this report: Molly Traci, Assistant Director; James  Kim; Anh Nguyen; Erin Stockdale; Jina Yu; Claire Li; Jessica Drucker;  Danielle Greene; Roxanna Sun; John Krump; Mark Ramage; Julia  Kennon; Virginia Chanley; and Carol Petersen."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
