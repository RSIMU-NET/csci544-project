The extent and nature of franchise relationship problems are unknown because of a lack of readily available, statistically reliable data--that is, the data available are not systematically gathered or generalizable. Absent such data, opinions varied as to the need for a federal statute to regulate franchise relationships.

For purposes of this report, we refer to franchise relationship issues or problems as those that arise after the franchise agreement has been signed (i.e., post-sale). Specifically, our objectives were to describe (1) FTC\u2019s efforts to enforce its Franchise Rule, including FTC\u2019s analysis of complaints and actions taken regarding franchises and business opportunity ventures; (2) FTC\u2019s efforts to communicate and coordinate its franchise and business opportunity enforcement activities with selected state regulatory officials; and (3) the availability of data on the extent and nature of franchise relationship problems. We are also providing information on the views of FTC staff, franchise trade association officials, and selected state regulatory agency officials regarding the need for federal legislation on franchise relationships.", "To meet our objectives, we obtained and analyzed data from and discussed these issues with FTC staff responsible for enforcing the Franchise Rule; obtained and analyzed information from franchise and business opportunity regulatory officials in the nine states that have both franchise and business opportunity disclosure laws (California, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, South Dakota, Virginia, and Washington); and discussed franchise relationship issues with officials from franchise trade associations. We also discussed franchise relationship issues with officials from Iowa, as it has been recognized by franchise trade officials as having the most comprehensive franchise relationship law of all the states. We conducted our work between August 2000 and June 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

According to the International Franchise Association (IFA), about 75 industries\u2014such as those involving fast food, service, maintenance, and lodging\u2014operate within the franchise format to distribute goods and services to consumers. IFA estimates that there are 1,500 business-format franchises that operate more than 320,000 franchised units in the United States. IFA estimates that these franchises account for 50 percent of all retail sales and generate $1 trillion in sales annually in the United States. Data on the number and overall value of business opportunity ventures were not available, in part, because according to FTC staff, there is no national association or attorney group that represents business opportunities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal and State Protections for Prospective Franchise and Business Opportunity Purchasers", "paragraphs": ["In 1950, fewer than 100 companies used franchising in their marketing operations, but with the rapid expansion of franchising in the 1960s, federal and state governments began to see the need to protect prospective franchise purchasers. In 1971, FTC announced it would initiate a proceeding concerning the promulgation of a trade regulation rule on franchise sales and pre-sale disclosures. Public hearings on franchising commenced in 1972, and in 1978, FTC issued its final Franchise Rule, which took effect in October 1979. The Rule, which has the full force and effect of federal law, was promulgated in response to widespread evidence of unfair or deceptive acts or practices in connection with the sale of franchises and business opportunities.", "FTC provided the following distinctions, consistent with the Franchise Rule, between a franchise and a business opportunity:   A franchise requires payment of at least $500 for the opportunity to sell trademarked goods and services with significant assistance or control of the franchisor. An example of a franchise is a fast food restaurant chain.", "To buy a franchise, the prospective purchaser would pay a required fee for the opportunity to sell the chain\u2019s products. In turn, the chain would help the purchaser by (1) arranging for a store location, (2) providing training on how to prepare the products, and (3) providing advertising, among other things. The purchaser would agree to abide by the chain\u2019s standards for cleanliness, quality, uniforms, and so on.", "A business opportunity requires payment of at least $500 for the opportunity to distribute goods and services of the seller with assistance in the form of locations or accounts. Business opportunities are less structured than franchises and impose fewer ties between the sellers and buyers. An example of a business opportunity is the purchase of vending machine routes, where the purchaser would pay a required fee for the opportunity to sell the company\u2019s products (e.g., soft drinks, snack foods) through vending machines. The purchaser would buy the vending machines and products from the company, and the company would inform the purchaser of specific stores or locations in which to place them.", "The Franchise Rule is designed to enable prospective franchise and business opportunity owners to protect themselves before investing by providing them with the information needed to assess potential risks and benefits, make meaningful comparisons with other investments, and further investigate the business. This information is contained in detailed disclosure documents that must be provided to prospective purchasers at least 10 business days before they pay any money or legally commit to a purchase. The document includes financial and other information about the seller, the business, and the business relationship, including the name, address, and telephone number of other purchasers;   a fully audited financial statement of the seller; the background and experience of the business\u2019 key executives; the seller\u2019s litigation history; the cost of starting and maintaining the business; and the responsibilities the buyer and seller will have to each other once the franchise or business opportunity is bought, including termination and renewal rights.", "Regarding the latter, the Franchise Rule requires the seller to disclose basic information about its policies and practices, including matters such as termination and renewal rights. However, the Franchise Rule does not prescribe the terms and conditions for carrying out those policies and practices.", "The Franchise Rule requires disclosures only to prospective purchasers. Franchise and business opportunity sellers do not register or file their disclosure documents with FTC, and FTC generally does not review or approve disclosures, advertising, or agreements. FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection enforces the Franchise Rule. According to FTC staff, during fiscal years 1997 through 1999, the Bureau spent an average of 13 workyears, or about 6 percent of its approximately 221 workyears, on Franchise Rule activities and enforcement.", "In addition to the Franchise Rule, FTC enforces section 5 of the FTC Act, which declares unlawful unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Section 5 also provides that FTC does not have authority to declare an act or practice unlawful (FTC\u2019s \u201cunfairness\u201d jurisdiction) unless three specific criteria are met: (1) the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers, (2) the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition, and (3) the act or practice is not reasonably avoidable by consumers. According to FTC staff, in exercising its authority, FTC brings \u201cdeception\u201d cases in many consumer protection fields, including the sale of franchises and business opportunities.", "In general, only FTC, not private parties, can enforce violations of the Franchise Rule or FTC Act. The FTC Act provides FTC with a broad range of remedies for violations, including injunctions, civil penalties, and refund of money to franchise and business opportunity purchasers. Also, in 1998, in conjunction with the National Franchise Council (NFC), FTC approved, on a trial basis, an Alternative Rule Enforcement Program to resolve technical or minor violations of the Franchise Rule that otherwise would be referred to the Department of Justice for civil penalty action. Franchisors FTC refers to the program are trained in Franchise Rule compliance and are monitored for a period of years. Moreover, potentially injured consumers are notified about the Franchise Rule violation and have the opportunity to resolve any claim, and possibly seek redress, against the franchisor through mediation. Violations involving fraud or unfair or deceptive business practices are not candidates for the program. As of April 2001, nine companies had been referred to the Alternative Rule Enforcement Program.", "States also have a role in regulating the sale of franchises and business opportunities. California passed the first franchise disclosure law in 1970. Today, 15 states have specific franchise disclosure laws and 24 states have specific business opportunity disclosure laws that are designed to protect prospective purchasers. Like the federal Franchise Rule, these state laws require franchise and business opportunity sellers to provide each prospective purchaser with a pre-sale disclosure document containing financial and other information. Unlike the Franchise Rule, some of these state laws require franchisors and business opportunities to file their disclosure documents with a designated state agency to review for accuracy and/or completeness.", "In 1995, as part of its continuing review of trade regulation rules, FTC announced that it was beginning to explore the need to revise the Franchise Rule. In October 1999, FTC published proposed revisions to the Rule, which focus exclusively on the sale of franchises. According to FTC, the proposed revisions would reduce inconsistencies in federal and state disclosure requirements governing franchise sales, address changes in the marketing of franchises\u2014such as the sale of franchises through the Internet\u2014and provide expanded disclosures concerning franchise relationships. FTC intends to conduct a separate rulemaking proceeding for business opportunities once it has completed the Franchise Rule review process because FTC views business opportunities as distinct business arrangements that require separate disclosure requirements. For example, FTC staff noted that many of the current Franchise Rule\u2019s pre- sale disclosures do not apply to the sale of most business opportunities, which typically involve fairly simple contracts or purchase agreements. Because of pending comment periods and subsequent FTC review and approval activities, FTC staff told us they could not provide specific information on when the revised Rule would be issued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Protections Over Franchise Relationships", "paragraphs": ["FTC\u2019s Franchise Rule only addresses how a franchise or business opportunity is sold to a prospective purchaser. It generally does not regulate the nature of the agreement a prospective franchise or business opportunity venture purchaser may sign or changes in the relationship after the initial contract has been signed. FTC staff told us that FTC generally lacks the authority to intervene in private franchise contracts and related relationship issues. Rather, these issues are generally considered matters of contract law that traditionally have been governed at the state level. Currently, 17 states have enacted franchise relationship laws of general applicability to govern the franchise relationship after the agreement has been signed. These laws vary in their scope, with Iowa\u2019s relationship law recognized as the most comprehensive.", "State franchise relationship laws generally provide for a private right of action that permits franchisees to bring lawsuits for violations under their respective state\u2019s particular law. States that do not have specific disclosure or relationship laws have other laws to protect consumers, such as general consumer protection or fraud statutes. These other laws give parties the right to file a lawsuit directly in state court. (App. II lists the states that have business opportunity disclosure, franchise disclosure, and/or franchise relationship laws.)", "Currently, federal laws governing franchise relationships are specifically limited to the automobile and petroleum industries. Under the Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act of 1956, a franchise automobile dealer can bring an action in U.S. District Court against its automobile manufacturer to recover damages caused by the manufacturer\u2019s failure to act in good faith in (1) performing or complying with any of the terms or provisions of the franchise agreement or (2) terminating, canceling, or not renewing the franchise. Under the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act of 1978, a franchisor engaged in the sale or distribution of motor fuel is prohibited from terminating a franchise during the term of the franchise agreement unless the termination or nonrenewal is based on grounds specified in the law. The act mandates a 90-day advance notice of the termination or nonrenewal, unless under the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to provide 90 days\u2019 notice. The act also provides for franchisees to file a lawsuit against franchisors in U.S. District Court for failure to comply with the act\u2019s requirements. The legislative histories of both acts indicated that they were needed to remedy the disparity of power between the franchisor and the franchisee.", "As mentioned earlier, Congress and others have debated whether a federal statute is needed to generally regulate franchising, particularly in regard to franchise relationship issues. Much of the debate has centered on the relative bargaining power franchisees have when dealing with their franchisors over various issues, such as the location of new franchise outlets or the termination of franchise relationships without good cause and advance, written notice. Various bills have been introduced in Congress that would have statutorily applied federal regulation to franchises in general. Among other things, these proposals would have expanded federal jurisdiction to include issues involving the relationship between franchisees and franchisors after the franchise agreement is signed. One bill, H.R. 3308, the Small Business Franchise Act of 1999, would have \u201cestablished minimum standards of fair conduct in franchise sales and franchise business relationships.\u201d According to the bill, the purpose of the act would be \u201cto promote fair and equitable franchise agreements, to establish uniform standards of conduct in franchise relationships and to create uniform private Federal remedies for violations of Federal Law.\u201d (App. III provides additional information on federal and state laws and regulations related to franchise relationship issues.)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FTC\u2019s Complaints and Enforcement Activities Focused Mostly on Business Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["FTC has focused most of its franchise and business opportunity enforcement activities on business opportunity ventures because, according to FTC staff, problems such as fraud and other types of misrepresentation are much more prevalent with business opportunities than with franchises. In fact, complaints about business opportunity ventures, including those about fraudulent activity, have been much more common than those about franchises. FTC also focused most of its franchise and business opportunity investigations and court cases on business opportunities. From 1993 through 1999, FTC opened 332 investigations, most of which entailed business opportunity issues. From 1993 through 2000, FTC filed 142 business opportunity and 20 franchise cases in court and obtained some sort of relief in all of them. Although FTC has been successful with the cases it has pursued, we could not determine why FTC closed some of the business opportunity and franchise investigations it had opened because FTC did not require its staff to document why investigations are closed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Complaints Pertained to Business Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["From January 1993 through June 1999, FTC reported that it received 3,680 business opportunity and franchise complaints, of which 3,392 (92 percent) pertained to business opportunities and 288 (8 percent) pertained to franchises. According to FTC staff, although the complaint data in its database are the most comprehensive available, they do not necessarily provide a complete picture of all complaints that came to FTC from 1993 through June 1999. The FTC staff added that, for many reasons, complete data for earlier years (especially 1993 and 1994) do not exist. As a result, the FTC staff said that they would be reluctant to extrapolate from the complaint data that complaints have increased significantly since 1993. They added that more complete data for determining trends would be complaints filed in 1997 and beyond. Table 1 shows all of the business opportunity and franchise complaints FTC reported it received each year from 1993 through June 1999.", "According to FTC staff, the growth in the number of complaints documented during 1997 through June 1999 could be attributable to a number of things, including changes in the way FTC collects and compiles complaint data. For example, in 1998, FTC established a toll-free hotline and published a Web-based on-line complaint form, which allow consumers to report problems and allegations about such factors as abuses related to the Franchise Rule. In addition, FTC has received more complaints in recent years because it now has agreements with many groups\u2014such as state Attorney General Offices and regional Better Business Bureaus\u2014that collect and refer complaints for input into FTC\u2019s Consumer Sentinel complaint database.", "FTC staff provided us with the results of FTC\u2019s analysis of the 288 franchise complaints it received from January 1993 through June 1999. FTC\u2019s analysis showed that 134 of the 288 franchise complaints did not contain sufficient information to determine the specific allegation that was being made. Of the remaining 154 complaints, FTC\u2019s analysis showed that   13 alleged problems involving pre-sale disclosure issues covered by the Franchise Rule, such as failure to provide disclosure documents;   96 contained allegations pertaining exclusively to post-sale issues that are not covered by the Franchise Rule, such as threats to terminate a franchise relationship or failure to provide a promised franchise location; and   45 contained allegations involving both pre-sale disclosure issues covered by the Rule and post-sale issues not covered by the Rule.", "According to FTC\u2019s Franchise Rule Coordinator, FTC has reviewed franchise and business opportunity complaints on a regular basis and has used more sophisticated methods as they have become available. From 1993 through 1997, for example, the Franchise Rule Coordinator said he manually prepared detailed monthly and annual reports of complaints and enforcement activities for distribution throughout FTC. In 1998, when FTC improved its data reporting and retrieval capabilities via its Consumer Response Center, the Franchise Rule Coordinator stopped preparing formal reports. Instead, he said he reviewed database files on a regular basis to identify potential investigations and trends, while other FTC staff also reviewed complaint data for investigative potential, especially in connection with law enforcement sweeps.", "The Franchise Rule Coordinator said that, beginning in January 2000, he requested monthly reports to aid him in reviewing franchise complaints. Consequently, since March 2000, FTC has generated monthly reports of all franchise complaints, which the Coordinator said he personally reviews for investigative potential. FTC has not analyzed each of the individual business opportunity complaints it has received, but FTC staff said that they believe that almost all of the business opportunity complaints represent pre-sale concerns about either fraud or misrepresentation\u2014such as false or unsubstantiated earnings claims\u2014that fall under FTC\u2019s jurisdiction. The Franchise Rule Coordinator told us that FTC uses other means to evaluate business opportunity complaints. For example, he said that (1) staff from the Consumer Response Center review the business opportunity complaint data to look for patterns and practices of violations, (2) analysts in FTC\u2019s Division of Planning and Information review complaint data for trends, and (3) federal and state enforcement officials discuss complaints during periodic conference calls with FTC staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Investigations and Court Cases Focused on Business Opportunities", "paragraphs": ["Since 1993, FTC focused most of its franchise and business opportunity investigations and court cases on business opportunities.

According to FTC\u2019s Franchise Rule Coordinator, the remaining 164 (49 percent) investigations could not be clearly categorized from the information FTC had available because the investigating attorney did not note or was not able to determine whether the business was a franchise or a business opportunity. He also told us that although it is likely that more than 90 percent of these 164 investigations involved business opportunities, he could not provide exact numbers because FTC\u2019s focus is on whether or not some type of violation occurred, not the type of business. Table 2 provides information on the number of franchise and business opportunity investigations FTC opened during 1993 through 1999.", "In regard to the fluctuations in the number of investigations FTC has opened from 1993 through 1999, FTC staff noted that the number of franchise investigations FTC opened decreased from 43 during 1993-94, to 16 during 1995-99. The FTC staff stated that the reasons for the decrease include the following.", "Between late 1994 and early 1995, FTC recognized that business opportunities represented a much larger problem than franchises. As a result, FTC began to focus its enforcement efforts on business opportunities.", "Franchise cases are much more complex than business opportunity matters and consume a significant amount of law enforcement resources. There are practical limits to the number of franchise investigations that staff can pursue at any one time because they are resource-intensive.", "FTC staff told us that the number of business opportunity and franchise investigations opened do not directly correlate with the number of complaints because (1) investigations are opened as a result of sweeps and other internal case generation activities, such as reviews of the Internet and newspapers, that are not necessarily complaint-based and (2) not all complaints get investigated. Regarding the latter, FTC staff explained that many complaints do not result in an investigation because they do not meet FTC\u2019s criteria for opening an investigation. For example, depending on the type of problem alleged, the complaint may involve issues outside FTC\u2019s jurisdiction. Also, FTC examines such things as the level of consumer injury and the number of consumers affected to determine whether it is in the public interest to open an investigation. Regarding the latter, FTC staff said that individual complaints may not show that a company has engaged in a pattern or practice of illegal conduct that would warrant opening an investigation. According to FTC\u2019s analyses of the complaints it has received, the vast majority are isolated matters involving single complaints against companies. Based on these factors, most complaints FTC receives are not investigated. In addition, FTC staff told us that limited resources and other law enforcement priorities prevented FTC from pursuing every meritorious complaint it received involving franchises and business opportunities. (App. IV provides further information on the investigations process and the criteria FTC uses for deciding when to open investigations.)", "To better understand how FTC used its resources to carry out franchise and business opportunity investigations, we attempted to determine how long it took FTC staff to process and close investigations using the number of hours they billed for each of the 332 investigations opened from 1993 through 1999. However, information on hours billed was available for only 217 (65 percent) of the 332 investigations FTC opened throughout the period. The 217 investigations included 125 that were closed with no further legal action and 92 that resulted in cases being filed. For the 125 investigations that FTC closed with no further legal action, FTC staff billed from 1 to 3,367 hours, with an average time of 228 hours and a median time of 64 hours. For the 92 investigations for which FTC filed cases, FTC staff billed from 2 to 5,738 hours, with an average time of 887 hours and a median time of 628 hours.", "According to FTC staff, the overwhelming majority of the investigations for which no or few hours were billed involved business opportunities. The staff added that the reasons why staff may not have charged any or few hours include that (1) staff determined that the company was out of business, (2) a state or other law enforcement agency was already looking into the matter, (3) staff may not have billed for the time spent on the investigation, or (4) staff may have billed hours to projects that combined investigations (i.e., sweeps) rather than to individual investigations.", "FTC staff told us that FTC does not have specific written criteria or standards to measure whether it carried out its investigations in a timely manner. According to FTC staff, the amount of time it takes FTC staff to complete an investigation depends on several factors, including the facts and complexity of the case, the degree of cooperation obtained from the target of the investigation, and the competing demands of the staff responsible for the investigation.

Among the other criteria FTC uses to decide which cases to pursue are whether (1) the problem is an isolated event or part of a pattern or practice; (2) there is a viable, meaningful remedy; or (3) there are alternatives to federal intervention.

Thus, it was not clear why FTC did not take further legal action on the other 77 business opportunity and franchise investigations that it closed during the period. FTC staff told us that it is likely these investigations were closed either because of a lack of sufficient evidence of wrongdoing or the subject was out of business. However, the FTC staff did not have any documentation to support their explanation. According to the Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, all transactions and other \u201csignificant\u201d events need to be clearly documented, and the documentation should be readily available for examination.", "During our review, we informed FTC staff that our report would likely contain a recommendation that FTC develop and implement procedures to require FTC staff to document the reasons why franchise and business opportunity investigations are closed. At that time, FTC staff told us that there was little, if any, historical value in reviewing past closed investigations of this type. The staff added that FTC staff has always been required to justify a recommendation to close an investigation in oral discussions with the assistant or associate directors who have responsibility for approving such requests. However, after further consideration, FTC staff determined that documenting the oral discussions was not unreasonable. Accordingly, in June 2001, the Associate Director for the Bureau of Consumer Protection\u2019s Division of Marketing Practices issued a memorandum to all Marketing Practices staff to inform them of revised procedures related to franchise and business opportunity investigations that are closed without filing an action in court. More specifically, the revised procedures specify that each and every Matter Update Notice closing a franchise or business opportunity investigation must state the reason(s) why the investigation is being closed.

Generally, state business opportunity regulatory officials viewed FTC\u2019s communication and coordination efforts as being more effective than did the state franchise regulatory officials we contacted. This may be due, in large part, to the fact that FTC\u2019s communication and coordination efforts with state regulatory agencies during 1998 through 2000 have been primarily focused on business opportunity issues. \u201cThe Commission works closely with other federal agencies, states, and local authorities in a variety of coordinated law enforcement efforts and task forces, including individual cases involving fraud and deceptive advertising, efforts to boost industry compliance with rules and regulations, and consumer and law enforcement training programs.\u201d", "FTC also reported that by sharing information and resources, joint efforts effectively target issues that have direct impact on consumers.

FTC staff noted, however, that FTC\u2019s unfairness authority generally does not apply to franchise relationship issues.

FTC staff told us that this is consistent with FTC\u2019s long-held view that free and informed choice is the best regulator of the market. According to FTC staff, proposed revisions to the Franchise Rule would, among other things, increase (1) franchisors\u2019 disclosures about prior litigation with franchisees; (2) the information available to prospective franchisees concerning source of supply restrictions and the ability to use alternative goods; (3) the disclosures about how sites are selected and the nature of any training programs; and (4) information available about renewals, terminations, and transfers.

A primary source of the manufacturers power over their dealers stems from the unilateral nature of the franchise agreements. Automobile dealers have been subjected to economic duress and intimidation and have been unable to obtain redress in the courts. The bill assures the dealer an opportunity to secure a judicial determination in the courts regardless of the contract terms as to whether the automobile manufacturer has failed to act in good faith in performing or complying with any of the provisions of his franchise or in terminating, canceling or not renewing his franchise.\u201d \u201cIn recent years the friction between franchisors and franchisees in marketing of motor fuels has become so great that it had threatened adverse impacts upon the Nation\u2019s motor fuel distribution and marketing system. Numerous states have initiated various legislative actions to address these petroleum product franchising problems. These actions have unfortunately resulted in an uneven patch work of rules governing franchise relationships which differ from State to State. Needed is a single, uniform set of rules governing the grounds for termination and non-renewal of motor fuel marketing franchises and the notice which franchisors must provide franchisees prior to termination of a franchise or non- renewal of a franchise relationship.\u201d", "Since 1992, several separate proposals for additional franchise relationship legislation have been introduced in Congress, none of which became law.For example, the Small Business Franchise Act of 1999 (H.R. 3308), proposed, among other things, a comprehensive scheme for regulating the franchise relationship and included provisions on contract terminations, and transfers; encroachment; the purchase of goods or services from designated sources of supply; and franchisees\u2019 rights to associate with other franchisees. The bill also provided franchisees with the right to file a lawsuit against franchisors for violations of the act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTC\u2019s Jurisdiction Related to Franchise Relationship Issues", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, FTC\u2019s Franchise Rule only addresses how a franchise is sold to a prospective purchaser. It generally does not regulate the nature of the agreement a prospective franchise purchaser may sign or changes in the relationship after the initial contract has been signed. FTC staff told us that FTC generally lacks the authority to intervene in private franchise contracts and related relationship issues.", "FTC generally does not have specific statutory authority to intervene in or regulate private contractual matters, including franchise contracts. According to FTC, the only relevant authority it has that could possibly relate to franchise relationships is section 5 of the FTC Act, which declares unlawful unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. Section 5 also provides that for FTC to declare an unfair act or practice unlawful (known as FTC\u2019s \u201cunfairness\u201d jurisdiction), three specific criteria must be met: (1) the act or practice causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers, (2) the injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition, and (3) the act or practice is not reasonably avoidable by consumers. According to FTC, given these criteria, its unfairness jurisdiction generally does not give FTC authority to reach the substantive provisions of franchise contracts or otherwise intervene in franchise relationship issues. FTC staff provided further information on FTC\u2019s unfairness jurisdiction criteria as discussed below.", "Substantial injury. According to FTC staff, in order for FTC to exercise its unfairness jurisdiction over the terms and conditions of franchise contracts, there must be evidence of substantial injury. Complaints alleging oppressive contract terms and conditions generally assert that they cause or threaten to cause significant monetary injury to the complainant. FTC staff, added, however, that they seldom see more than a few atypical complaints of this nature about any particular franchise system. Thus, according to FTC staff, in many cases, the \u201csubstantial\u201d injury element of the unfairness criteria cannot be met.", "Countervailing benefits. According to FTC staff, a more difficult issue is countervailing benefits. Franchise systems, like all businesses, are influenced by market forces. Consumer tastes change, and competition may arise unexpectedly. Accordingly, franchisors may desire to create contracts that maximize their ability to respond quickly to market forces. For that reason, a franchisor, for example, may wish to reserve the right to offer franchises on a nonexclusive basis or to reserve the right to sell goods and services through alternative channels of distribution. This enables the franchisor to move quickly to meet the competition if a new territory opens or distribution method arises. Other terms and conditions are designed to ensure system uniformity, which consumers often expect from a franchise system. Therefore, in many instances, a franchisor\u2019s choice of contract terms and conditions are based upon some economic rationale that is designed to benefit consumers and/or the system\u2019s existing franchisees. According to FTC staff, the benefits flowing from these contractual terms may, in some cases, outweigh the allegations of \u201coppression\u201d by complainant franchisees.", "Unavoidability. According to FTC staff, when considering the substantive terms and conditions of franchise contracts, unavoidability is the most difficult standard to satisfy. Franchises are discretionary purchases. That is, no aspiring entrepreneur is forced to purchase a franchise in order to be in business. Moreover, franchising is only one method of entering into a business. Franchising also covers a wide variety of economic sectors, and for the most part, there is competition in each sector. Therefore, the market offers many choices for anyone wishing to operate a business. According to FTC staff, under these circumstances, existing franchisees would be hard-pressed to establish that contractual provisions they voluntarily read, agreed to, and signed were somehow unavoidable. The FTC staff added that proving this is an even more daunting task, because prospective franchisees are required to receive a disclosure document at least 10 business days before they sign the franchise agreement or pay any fee. Presumably, every prospective franchisee has the opportunity to (1) review the disclosure document before signing the contract; (2) seek legal, accounting, or marketing counsel; and (3) speak to both former and current system franchisees. In short, according to FTC staff, it is not FTC\u2019s role to second-guess a prospective franchisee\u2019s wisdom in signing a particular franchise agreement, as long as the prospective franchisee is forewarned about the legal consequences of his or her actions.", "According to FTC staff, isolated instances of miscellaneous relationship issues cannot justify a more widespread investigation of relationship issues, let alone substantive rulemaking that addresses franchise contracts. The staff added that before FTC could consider developing a rule that addresses the substantive terms of private franchise contracts, it would need not only evidence of substantial injury, but also sufficient information that would enable FTC to weigh the alleged injury against any countervailing benefits to the public at large or to competition. In addition, FTC staff noted that FTC would need evidence showing that franchisees cannot reasonably avoid the alleged injury. The staff further stated that while franchisees and their advocates suggest that economic harm to individual franchisees may result from some franchisor practices, they have not shown to date that such injury is substantial and not outweighed by countervailing benefits. Further, FTC staff told us that in at least some instances, prospective franchisees could avoid injury by comparison shopping for a franchise system that offers more favorable terms and conditions and by considering alternatives to franchising as a means of business ownership. Absent evidence on widespread franchise relationship abuses, FTC believes the prudent approach is to continue to investigate instances of such abuses, where they occur, under FTC\u2019s current unfairness authority.", "According to FTC staff, application of FTC\u2019s unfairness jurisdiction in a franchise matter is most likely to occur in a situation in which a franchisor attempts to unilaterally modify a contract or breach a contract with franchisees. They noted that in most instances, such conduct is unavoidable. Nonetheless, for FTC to find unfairness, there still must be substantial injury that is not outweighed by countervailing benefits. To date, FTC has conducted only two franchise investigations that were based solely on FTC\u2019s unfairness jurisdiction, both involving an allegation of a franchisor\u2019s breach of contract. Both investigations were ultimately closed because FTC determined there was insufficient evidence to satisfy the section 5 unfairness criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Jurisdiction", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, franchise relationships are generally considered matters of contract law that traditionally have been governed at the state level.

Other areas covered to varying degrees include the transfer of a franchise, encroachment, the purchase of goods or services from designated sources of supply, franchisees\u2019 right to associate with other franchisees, and forum selection. Regardless of whether or not a state has a law that specifically covers the franchise relationship, franchisees always have the right to file a civil lawsuit against a franchisor for any contractual disputes. Many states have a \u201clittle FTC Act\u201d (modeled after the FTC Act) or some type of general consumer protection or fraud statute that franchisees can use to address contractual disputes. These statutes are referred to in different states, for example, as consumer protection acts, consumer sales acts, deceptive trade practices acts, and consumer fraud acts.

Iowa\u2019s franchise relationship law includes provisions that prohibit franchisors from terminating a franchise without good cause and at least 30 days prior written notice; refusing to renew a franchise unless the franchisor has provided 6 months written notice of nonrenewal and either good cause exists or certain circumstances exist, such as the franchisor completely withdraws from the market served by the franchisee; rejecting a proposed transfer of a franchise unless the proposed transferee fails to meet the franchisor\u2019s reasonable current qualifications for new franchisees and such rejection is not arbitrary or capricious; and requiring that franchisees purchase goods or supplies exclusively from the franchisor or designated sources when goods and supplies of comparable quality are available from other sources.", "According to officials we met with in Iowa, the most contentious part of Iowa\u2019s franchise relationship law relates to encroachment.

The senator added that the primary reason why Iowa got involved in regulating franchise relationship issues was because of a provision in franchise agreements requiring franchisees operating in Iowa to settle disputes and file lawsuits outside of Iowa.

The officials explained that a prospective franchisee may do his or her due diligence, investigate the system, talk to franchisees, and be comfortable in signing the current franchise agreement. The officials noted, however, that most franchise agreements allow the franchisor to materially and unilaterally make changes to the franchise relationship, which can significantly alter the economic conditions for franchisees. They stated that these wholesale changes are made during the term of the franchise agreement through the prevalent use of operations manuals that franchisors reserve the right to amend at any time. The officials added that even more extensive changes are made when the agreement is up for renewal or when the franchise business is being sold.", "According to AFA officials, common examples of contract provisions that give rise to such changes are the franchisor\u2019s reserving the right to increase advertising or royalty fees or impose assessments;   ability to change the operating policy manual, which can encompass fundamental financial and capital requirements and with which the franchise agreement obligates the franchisee to comply;   ability to place additional locations in close proximity to an existing franchisee (encroachment);   ability to distribute products and services through alternative modes of distribution (e.g., direct-shipping of products through catalogues, the Internet, and alternate retailers) and/or another brand name; reserving the right to be the sole supplier of goods and services used or sold from the franchisee\u2019s business, often charging above-market prices to their captive franchisees; and   option to purchase the business when the franchise agreement has expired or is terminated with the provision that the sale price will not be fair market value, but the depreciated value of assets or other such formulas that wholly deny the franchisee the ability to enjoy the fruits or his/her labor.", "AFA officials told us that, while these types of unilateral actions may increase a franchisor\u2019s overall revenues, they can significantly impact a franchisee\u2019s profitability and the value of the business. The officials added that some of the unilateral changes to franchise relationships involve issues that no franchisee could have anticipated upon the initial signing of the contract. In other words, they said that a franchisee may be bound by changes to the relationship that, had they known, they never would have signed the agreement in the first place. AFA officials also told us that some franchise agreements do not allow for contract renewal at all, and if they do, provide that it will be \u201caccording to the then current and materially different terms and conditions.\u201d They added that there is nothing in these provisions that say these terms and conditions will be \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d or any other provision for basic fairness.

According to AFA officials, since FTC staff maintain that FTC generally lacks the authority to intervene in private franchise contracts and related relationship issues, AFA members feel they have no alternative but to seek a legislative solution to their problems.", "AFA believes that federal franchise relationship legislation is needed to address what they consider to be the franchisors\u2019 pervasive misuse of power and to alleviate the inconsistent treatment of franchisees within the states. As such, AFA was a primary proponent of the Small Business Franchise Act of 1999 (H.R. 3308), as introduced in the 106th Congress, which (1) proposed minimum standards of conduct in franchise business relationships and (2) addressed other aspects of the franchise relationship, including contract renewals, terminations, and transfers; the location of new franchises in relation to existing franchises; the purchase of goods or services from sources other than the franchisor; and franchisees\u2019 rights to associate with other franchisees. The bill also provided franchisees with the right to file private civil lawsuits for violations of the act. AFA officials maintain that even if most or many franchisors do not abuse their position and power, effective federal standards are still needed to discourage franchise abuses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IFA Views on Why Federal Franchise Legislation Is Not Needed", "paragraphs": ["According to IFA officials, franchising works because entrepreneurs benefit from the flexibility to structure franchise relationships in the manner that works best for their product, service, or industry. The officials noted that franchise agreements must reserve to the franchisor effective rights to impose discipline on the network in order to (1) ensure a uniform look and quality for the product or service offered by the franchise, (2) maintain system standards for the benefit and value of both the franchisor and the great majority of its franchisees who voluntarily comply with such standards, and (3) protect the consumer from unsafe or otherwise substandard outlets.", "IFA officials also told us that franchisor-imposed changes to the franchise relationship are in the nature of fine-tuning\u2014such as adding a new menu item, initiating a new safety procedure, upgrading software, and the like\u2014 and do not affect the terms and conditions of the franchise agreement. In short, IFA officials said that while franchisors reserve decision-making power over a wide variety of matters during the course of the franchise relationship, that control is what creates value in the form of a uniform brand, market penetration, and customer loyalty\u2014reasons why franchisees invest in the first place. The officials added that the franchisor\u2019s control over network operations is addressed in the disclosure document that is provided to prospective franchisees before they enter into the franchise relationship.", "IFA officials told us that current pre-sale disclosure requirements strike the right balance between legitimate consumer protection and overregulation. The officials noted that pre-sale disclosure laws are the most effective means by which to ensure productive and successful franchise relationships. In particular, they believe that disclosures of (1) current and past litigation involving the franchise system and (2) the names and addresses of both current franchisees, as well as those franchisees who have left the system within the past fiscal year, should provide any franchise investor with the resources necessary to ascertain the prevalence of relationship issues in a particular franchise system.", "According to IFA officials, three primary concerns have guided members of the association in their decision to oppose federal and state franchise relationship legislation.", "Many duties and obligations contained in franchise relationship legislative proposals are undefined or ambiguous, which would create confusion and uncertainty in franchise relationships and touch off an unprecedented increase in litigation. This would result in increased operating costs for franchise companies, the majority of which are small businesses that are not in a position to absorb these additional costs.", "Franchising is a source of economic opportunity and empowerment for women, minorities, and future generations of small-business owners. Franchise relationship legislation would discourage franchise growth and, as a result, have a disproportionate impact on these groups. It is virtually impossible to craft a \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution to the wide variety of franchise business practices involving companies operating in about 75 different industries. There is no common \u201crelationship\u201d legislation that can practically and predictably apply to these many different industries, operating in many different geographical markets, and at many different levels of system maturity and market penetration.", "Regarding the latter, IFA officials explained that because franchising is not an industry\u2014but rather a method of distributing goods and services that is utilized by about 75 different industries\u2014\u201done size fits all\u201d legislation such as the Small Business Franchise Act of 1999 (H.R. 3308) and similar franchise relationship proposals are impractical and unworkable. The officials noted that such legislation contemplates that all franchised concepts and all franchise relationships can be regulated with a uniform law. The officials added that this view of franchising is flawed because it fails to recognize the fundamental difference between business format franchising\u2014a concept that is employed by many heterogeneous businesses operating in a wide variety of dissimilar industries\u2014and other forms of product distribution that are utilized by a very few homogeneous businesses operating in a single industry (such as automobile dealers or petroleum marketers). For these reasons, among others, IFA officials believe that it is inappropriate to make comparisons between proposals to regulate business format franchising and laws that govern manufacturing and distribution relationships such as the Automobile Dealers Day in Court Act or the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act. The officials added that there are virtually no barriers to entry to creating a franchised business, and with very few exceptions, business format franchises do not manufacture products for redistribution by their franchisees. As a result, the franchise relationship is very different from manufacturer-dealer or distributor relationships.", "IFA officials told us that federal legislative proposals, such as the Small Business Franchise Act of 1999, cede too much power to the government and the courts to alter the intent of the parties that have entered into a contract. The officials added that allowing interference in the contract process would severely impair the interpretation of those agreements. The officials also told us that the \u201cminimum standards of fair conduct\u201d contained in legislative proposals would materially alter provisions of existing state law and reverse numerous decisions establishing common law rights and obligations. IFA officials believe that to the extent there are differences between parties in franchising, those differences should be resolved through expanded forms of self-regulation, such as the IFA Ombudsman program, the National Franchise Mediation Program, the IFA\u2019s Franchise Basics and Franchise Sales Compliance educational programs, and the IFA Code of Ethics and enforcement mechanism."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments From the Federal Trade Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments From the Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}], "fastfact": []}
