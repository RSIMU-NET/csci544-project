However, Treasury did not restore interest losses to the ESF because it lacks legislative authority to do so.", "Delays in raising the debt limit can create uncertainty in the Treasury market and lead to higher Treasury borrowing costs. GAO estimated that delays in raising the debt limit in 2011 led to an increase in Treasury\u0092s borrowing costs of about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011. However, this does not account for the multiyear effects on increased costs for Treasury securities that will remain outstanding after fiscal year 2011.

With the Public  Debt Act of 1941, Congress and the President set an overall limit of   $65 billion on Treasury debt obligations that could be outstanding at any  one time and since then have enacted a number of debt limit increases.  Most recently, Congress and the President enacted the BCA, which  established a process that resulted in debt limit increases in three  increments\u2014$400 billion in August 2011, $500 billion in September 2011,  and $1,200 billion in January 2012\u2014for a total increase of $2.1 trillion,  raising the debt limit to $16.394 trillion.

Debt held by the public  primarily represents the amount the federal government has borrowed to  finance cumulative cash deficits.

Intragovernmental debt increases when these accounts run a surplus or  accrue interest on existing securities.", "The Secretary of the Treasury has several responsibilities related to the  federal government\u2019s financial management operations. These include  paying the government\u2019s obligations and investing the excess annual  receipts (including interest earnings) over disbursements of federal  government accounts with investment authority. To meet these  responsibilities, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized by law to  issue the necessary securities to federal government accounts with  investment authority for investment purposes and to borrow the  necessary funds from the public to pay government obligations. normal conditions, Treasury is notified by the appropriate agency (such  as the Office of Personnel Management for the Civil Service Retirement  and Disability Fund (CSRDF)) of the amount that should be invested on  its behalf, and Treasury then makes the investment. In some cases, the  actual security that Treasury should purchase is also specified. When a  federal government account with investment authority needs to make  disbursements, Treasury is normally notified of the amount of securities  that need to be redeemed. In some cases, Treasury is also notified to  redeem specific securities. The Treasury securities issued to federal  government accounts with investment authority count against the debt  limit. If these accounts\u2019 receipts are not invested, the amount of debt  subject to the limit does not increase.", "The majority of securities held by federal government accounts are Government  Account Series (GAS) securities. GAS securities consist of par value securities and  market-based securities, with terms ranging from on demand out to 30 years. Par value  securities are issued and redeemed at par (100 percent of face value), regardless of  current market conditions. Market-based securities, however, can be issued at a premium  or discount and are redeemed at par value on the maturity date or at market value if  redeemed before the maturing date.", "Under normal circumstances, the debt limit is not an impediment to  carrying out these investment responsibilities. However, when federal  debt is near or at the debt limit, increasing the debt limit frequently  involves lengthy debate by Congress. When delays occur, Treasury has  to depart from normal cash and debt management operations to avoid  exceeding the debt limit. In 1986 and 1987, after Treasury\u2019s experiences  during prior debt limit crises, Congress authorized the Secretary of the  Treasury to use the CSRDF and the Government Securities Investment  Fund of the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (G-Fund) to help  Treasury manage federal debt when delays in raising the debt limit occur.

Since the G-Fund invests in one-day securities that are  redeemed and reinvested each business day, the amount of uninvested  principal varied most days depending on the federal government\u2019s  outstanding debt. Although Treasury can accurately predict the outcome  of some events that affect the outstanding debt, it cannot precisely  determine the outcome of others until they occur. For example, the  amount of Treasury securities that Treasury will issue to the public from  an auction can be determined some days in advance because Treasury  can control the amount that will be issued. On the other hand, the amount  of savings bonds that will be issued and redeemed and the amount of  Treasury securities that will be issued to, or redeemed by, various federal  government accounts with investment authority are difficult to precisely  predict. Because of these difficulties, Treasury needed to ensure that the  normal investment and redemption activities associated with Treasury  securities did not cause the debt limit to be exceeded while also   maintaining normal investment and redemption policies for the majority of  these accounts. To accomplish these objectives, for each day of the  above-noted periods, Treasury   calculated the amount of debt subject to the limit, excluding the  receipts that the G-Fund would normally invest; determined the amount of G-Fund receipts that could safely be  invested without exceeding the debt limit and invested this amount in  Treasury securities; and  suspended investment, when necessary, of the G-Fund\u2019s remaining  receipts.", "As of August 1, 2011, the business day prior to the debt limit increase, the  G-Fund had approximately $137.5 billion available for suspension, with  the entire amount suspended as of that date.

On several occasions from   July 15, 2011, through August 1, 2011, and each day from January 4,  2012, through January 27, 2012, Treasury did not fully invest the dollar- denominated portion of the ESF in Treasury securities.

For each day, Treasury  determined the amount of funds that the ESF would be allowed to invest  in Treasury securities and, when necessary, suspended some  investments of the ESF receipts and maturing securities that would have  caused the debt limit to be exceeded.

A programming change to Treasury\u2019s debt accounting  system caused an incorrect calculation of unamortized discounts on  Treasury bills to be subtracted from total debt outstanding in calculating  debt subject to the limit. Treasury identified the error during a  contingency operation on December 29, 2011. At that time, the  cumulative effect of the error was $181 million. The error in the program  was corrected immediately; however, the adjustment to correct the   $181 million was not recorded until January 11, 2012.", "Debt subject to the limit was sufficiently below the debt limit from  November 2, 2011, through January 3, 2012, such that if the error was  taken into account, debt subject to the limit would still have been below  the debt limit.

To determine  whether Treasury would have exceeded the debt limit from January 4,  2012, through January 10, 2012, absent this error, we reviewed the  invested balances of the ESF during this period. Based on our review, we  found that the ESF had sufficient invested balances that could have been  used to manage federal debt during the delay. For example, as of  January 10, 2012, cumulative investments totaling $12.306 billion had  been suspended from the ESF. If the error had not occurred, cumulative  investments totaling $12.487 billion would have been suspended from the  ESF, $181 million more than what was actually suspended, but well  below the approximate $22.7 billion available for suspension. Therefore,  Treasury would have been able to suspend additional investments from  the ESF to remain under the debt limit. As a result of overinvesting the  ESF from January 4, 2012, through January 10, 2012, Treasury also  overpaid interest to the ESF during this period.

Rates for Treasury and other  securities fluctuate from day to day in response to changes in the broader  economy. Focusing on a yield spread rather than changes in individual  interest rates facilitated the measurement of changes in the relative risk of  Treasury securities and the identification of potential risk premiums  (which is represented by a decrease in the yield spread). We also  controlled for other factors that could affect the yield spread, such as the  Federal Reserve\u2019s holdings of Treasury securities and economic  uncertainty.

We found that the 2011 debt limit event led to a  premium on Treasury securities with maturities of 2 years or more while  Treasury securities with shorter maturities either experienced no change  or became slightly less costly relative to private securities. Applying the  relevant increase or decrease in the yield spread shown in figure 2 to all  Treasury bills, notes, bonds, CM bills, and TIPS issued during the 2011  debt limit event period, we estimated that borrowing costs increased by   Many of the Treasury securities  about $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011.issued during the 2011 debt limit event period will remain outstanding for  years to come.
