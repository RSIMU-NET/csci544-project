Each week the Social Security Administration (SSA) pays over $1 billion in cash payments to people with disabilities on DI and SSI. While providing a measure of income security, these payments for the most part do little to enhance the work capacities and promote the economic independence of these DI and SSI recipients. Yet societal attitudes have shifted toward goals, as embodied in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), of economic self-sufficiency and the right of people with disabilities to full participation in society.", "At one time, the common business practice was to encourage someone with a disability to leave the workforce. Today, however, a growing number of private companies have been focusing on enabling people with disabilities to return to work. Moreover, medical advances and new technologies provide more opportunities than ever for people with disabilities to work.", "We found that the DI and SSI programs are out of sync with these trends. The application process places a heavy emphasis on work incapacity, and it presumes that medical impairments preclude employment. And SSA does little to provide the support and assistance that many people with disabilities need to work. Our April 1996 report shows, in fact, that program design and implementation weaknesses hinder maximizing beneficiary work potential. Not surprisingly, these weaknesses also yield poor return-to-work outcomes. Other work we are doing for you highlights strategies from the private sector and other countries that SSA could use to develop administrative and legislative solutions to improve return-to-work outcomes. Indeed, if an additional 1 percent of the 6.3 million working-age SSI and DI beneficiaries were to leave SSA\u2019s disability rolls by returning to work, lifetime cash benefits would be reduced by an estimated $2.9 billion. outcomes. To develop this information, we surveyed people in the private sector generally recognized as leaders in developing disability management programs that focus on return-to-work efforts. We also interviewed officials in Germany and Sweden because the experiences of their social insurance programs show that return-to-work strategies are applicable to a broad and diverse population with a wide range of work histories, job skills, and disabilities.

Administered by SSA, DI and SSI paid over $50 billion in cash benefits to people with disabilities in 1994. To be considered disabled by either program, an adult must be unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity because of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last at least 1 year. Moreover, the impairment must be of such severity that a person not only is unable to do his or her previous work, but, considering his or her age, education, and work experience, is unable to do any other kind of substantial work that exists in the national economy.", "Both programs use the same definition of disability but differ in important ways. DI, established in 1956, is an insurance program funded by payroll taxes paid by workers and their employers into a Social Security trust fund. The program is for workers who, having worked long enough and recently enough to become insured under DI, have lost their source of income because of disability. Medicare coverage is provided to DI beneficiaries after they have received cash benefits for 24 months. Almost 4 million working-age people (aged 18 to 64) received about $34 billion in DI cash benefits in 1994. resources, SSI is financed from general revenues. In most states, SSI entitlement ensures an individual\u2019s eligibility for Medicaid benefits. In 1994, about 2.36 million working-age people with disabilities received SSI benefits.

By 1994, 31 percent of DI beneficiaries and 57 percent of SSI working-age beneficiaries had mental impairments\u2014conditions that have one of the longest anticipated entitlement periods (about 16 years for DI). In addition, the beneficiary population has become, on average, modestly but steadily younger since the mid-1980s.

About 70 percent of new awardees are eligible for disability because their impairments meet or equal the listings.

Because the result of the decision is either full award of benefits or denial of benefits, applicants have a strong incentive to promote their limitations to establish their inability to work and thus qualify for benefits. Conversely, applicants have a disincentive to demonstrate any capacity to work because doing so may disqualify them for benefits. Furthermore, the documentation involved in establishing one\u2019s disability can, many believe, create a \u201cdisability mind-set,\u201d which weakens motivation to work. Compounding this negative process, the length of time required to determine eligibility can erode skills, abilities, and habits necessary to work. employment. Neither do they allay the fear of losing medical coverage and other federal and state assistance that beneficiaries who return to work may face. Studies have identified the risk of losing medical coverage as a major barrier to beneficiaries\u2019 returning to work. Beneficiaries who work and continue to earn countable income above certain amounts will eventually lose medical coverage even though they have not necessarily improved medically or obtained affordable coverage elsewhere.", "Finally, VR has played a limited role in the DI and SSI programs, in part because of restrictive state VR policies and limits on alternatives to providers in the state VR system.

Studies have estimated that the full cost of disability to employers ranges from about 6 to 12 percent of payroll. Such costs include insurance premiums, cash benefits, rehabilitation benefits, and medical benefits paid through workers\u2019 compensation and employer-sponsored disability insurance programs.

In doing so, each individual should be functionally evaluated after his or her medical condition has stabilized to assess potential for returning to work. When appropriate, the private sector uses case management techniques to coordinate the identification, evaluation, and delivery of disability-related services to individuals deemed to need such services to return to work. Transitional work allows workers with disabilities to ease back into the workplace in jobs that are less physically or mentally demanding than their regular jobs.", "The private sector also stresses the need to ensure that physicians and other medical service providers understand the essential job functions of workers with disabilities.

The DI and SSI programs, however, are out of sync with this return-to-work focus. Improving the DI and SSI return-to-work outcomes requires restructuring these programs to better identify and enhance beneficiary return-to-work capacities.   While there is opportunity for improvement, it should be acknowledged that many beneficiaries will be unable to return to work. In fact, almost half of the people receiving benefits are not likely to become employed because of their age or because they are expected to die within several years. For others, work potential is unknown; but research suggests that successful transitions to work may be more likely for younger people with disabilities and for those who have greater motivation and more education.", "Studies have shown that a meaningful portion of DI and SSI beneficiaries possess such characteristics. The DI and SSI disability rolls have been increasingly composed of a significant number of younger individuals. Among working-age SSI and DI beneficiaries, one out of three is under the age of 40. In addition, in 1993, 35 percent of 84,000 DI beneficiaries expressed an interest in receiving rehabilitation or other services that could help them return to work, an indication of motivation. Moreover, a substantial portion\u2014almost one in two\u2014of a cohort of DI beneficiaries had a high school degree or some years of education beyond high school.The literature also suggests that lack of work experience is a significant barrier to employability. A promising sign is that about one-half of DI and one-third of SSI working-age beneficiaries had some attachment to the labor force during the 5 years immediately preceding the year of benefit award.", "Even those who may be able to return to work will face challenges. For example, some may need to learn basic skills and work habits and build self-esteem to function in the workplace. Moreover, the nature of some disabilities may limit full-time work, while others may cause logistical obstacles, such as transportation difficulties. Finally, employer resistance to hiring people with disabilities and tight labor market conditions, particularly for low-wage positions, could constrain employment opportunities.", "Nevertheless, there are compelling reasons to try new approaches. As mentioned, our review of the disability determination process shows that the work capacity of an individual found eligible for DI and SSI benefits may be understated. And this country has experienced medical, technological, and societal advances over the past several years that foster return to work. But weaknesses in the design and implementation of the DI and SSI programs mean that little has been done to identify and encourage the productive capacities of beneficiaries who might be able to benefit from these advances.", "Restructuring of the DI and SSI programs should consider the return-to-work strategies employed by the U.S. private sector and social insurance programs in Germany and Sweden. Lessons from these other disability programs argue for placing greater priority on assessing return-to-work potential soon after individuals apply for disability benefits. The priority in the DI and SSI programs, however, is to determine the eligibility of applicants to receive cash benefits, not to assess their return-to-work potential. In conjunction with making an early assessment of return-to-work potential, the programs should place greater priority on identifying and providing, at the earliest appropriate time, the medical and vocational rehabilitation services needed to return to work. But under the current program design, medical and vocational rehabilitation services are provided too late in the process. Finally, the programs should be designed to ensure that cash and medical benefits encourage beneficiaries to return to work. Presently, however, cash and medical benefits can make it financially advantageous to remain on the disability rolls, and many beneficiaries fear losing their premium-free Medicare or Medicaid benefits if they return to work.", "Although SSA faces constraints in applying the return-to-work strategies of other disability programs, opportunities exist for better identifying and providing the return-to-work assistance that could enable more of SSA\u2019s beneficiaries to return to work.
