This convergence is creating a new breed of information service industry, and permitting the development of the much discussed National Information Infrastructure (NII), commonly known as the information superhighway. The administration envisions the superhighway as a seamless web of communications networks, computers, databases, and consumer electronics\u2014built, owned, and operated principally by the private sector\u2014that will put vast amounts of information at users\u2019 fingertips. It believes that the superhighway, if freed from the constraints imposed by rigid regulatory regimes, will fundamentally change the way we work, learn, shop, communicate, entertain ourselves, and get health care and public services.", "Despite the dramatic advances in technology and the changes sweeping the communications industry, the superhighway\u2019s development is expected to be slow and arduous. As such, its development should not be viewed as a cliff that is suddenly confronted, but rather an increasingly steep slope that society has been climbing since the early communications networks were established. A national and global information infrastructure, which will serve as the foundation for the superhighway, already exists. Telephones, televisions, radios, computers, and fax machines\u2014interconnected through a complex web of fiber optics, wires, cables, satellites, and other communications technologies\u2014are used every day to receive, store, process, display, and transmit data, text, voice, sound, and images in homes and businesses throughout the world. However, the information superhighway is expected to offer much more than separate telephone, data, or video services; it is expected to integrate these services into an advanced high-speed, interactive, broadband, digital communications system.", "Some of the advanced capabilities and services envisioned for the superhighway are beginning to be provided\u2014albeit at a relatively high cost and at low transmission speeds\u2014by the existing information infrastructure. For example, the Internet\u2014a global metanetwork, or \u201cnetwork of networks,\u201d linking over 59,000 networks, 2.2 million computer systems, and over 15 million users in 92 countries\u2014provides many of the services envisioned for the information superhighway. Similarly, a growing number of on-line services, such as CompuServe, America Online, and Prodigy, provide their subscribers with a rich array of information services. Finally, hundreds of communities across America are served by electronic bulletin boards dispensing information to hundreds of thousands of users.", "The administration, believing that the technologies to create, manipulate, manage, and use information are of strategic importance to the United States, has formed a multiagency group\u2014the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF)\u2014to articulate a vision for the information superhighway and to guide its development. The task force, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, is responsible for addressing a wide range of regulatory and technical issues related to the information superhighway and for the coordination of existing federal efforts in the communications area.

Second, it should allow a two-way flow of information, with users being able to both receive and transmit large volumes of digital information. Third, it should be open, ensuring equal access for service and network providers. Finally, it should ensure the security and privacy of databases and users\u2019 communications, and provide a high degree of interoperability and reliability.", "Achieving the grand vision will depend largely on how successfully industry integrates advanced technologies and capabilities into the various layers of the information superhighway. To better understand the integration of advanced telecommunication technologies into the existing communication infrastructure, we developed a conceptual model of the information superhighway, as shown in figure 1.1.", "The model presents the following five critical layers\u2014management, applications, information, networks, and transport\u2014linked with pervasive security, interoperability, and reliability requirements: the transport layer consists of optical fibers, coaxial cable, copper wire, switches, routers, satellites, and transmitters the networks layer consists of thousands of logical networks superimposed on the transport layer the information layer includes databases and electronic libraries containing text, images, and video the applications layer contains software and consumer electronics needed to access the superhighway\u2019s information and services the management layer consists of operations and administrative centers, emergency response teams, and security services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Today\u2019s Networks Provide the Foundation for the Superhighway", "paragraphs": ["With a few exceptions, such as the recently proposed global satellite networks, most experts anticipate that the superhighway will be built on the foundation of the existing communications infrastructure.

The cable-based video networks rely on various approaches to broadcast a one-way broadband video signal to individual subscribers. Finally, the wireless networks use a wide range of analog and digital radio technologies to deliver voice, data, and video services.", "The principal shortcoming of the existing communications infrastructure is its inability to provide integrated voice, data, and video services. Over the years, the voice and data networks have evolved separately, with voice networks relying on circuit switching while data networks largely using packet switching techniques. Thus, a business user requiring voice, data, and videoconferencing services may have to use three separate networks\u2014a voice network, a data network, and a videoconferencing network. The emergence of multimedia applications and the high bandwidth applications in health care, industry, education, and business are beginning to require a network infrastructure capable of supporting multiple types of information.", "The basic architecture of the three types of networks is shown in figure 1.2 (see appendix II for an overview of each of these networks).", "The communications industry is beginning to introduce several new and innovative technologies that could enable the superhighway\u2019s developers to achieve the administration\u2019s vision of the information superhighway.

On November 8, 1988, thousands of computers connected to the Internet were attacked by a worm. While the worm did not damage or compromise data, it did deny service to thousands of users working at the nation\u2019s major research centers. We found that a number of vulnerabilities facilitated this attack, including the lack of a central focal point to address Internet-wide security problems; security weaknesses at host computer sites; and problems in developing, distributing, and installing software patches to operating system software. In response to this incident, the Advanced Research Projects Agency established a Computer Emergency Response Team to assist the Internet community in responding to attacks. Several federal agencies and private-sector organizations also established additional computer emergency response teams coordinated by NIST.", "Five years later, in January 1994, intruders again exploited similar weaknesses. This time, the attack was more serious. The intruders gained access to a number of hosts (computer systems) linked to the Internet. The intruders then installed software that captured user names, passwords, and hosts\u2019 addresses for Internet traffic terminating at, or passing through, the attacked sites. In addition, they installed two Trojan horse programs, one program to provide back-door access for the intruders to retrieve the captured passwords, and a second program to disguise the network monitoring process. With this information, the intruders could access 100,000 Internet accounts.

It helps, through password encryption, to improve identification and access control; it protects confidentiality and data integrity by encrypting the data; and finally, it improves, through encrypted electronic signature and related means, nonrepudiation services.", "Two basic types of cryptographic systems exist: secret key systems (also called symmetric systems) and public key systems (also called asymmetric systems). In secret key cryptography, two or more parties use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. As the name implies, secret key cryptography relies on keeping the key secret. If this key is compromised, the security offered by cryptography is eliminated. The best known secret key algorithm is the Data Encryption Standard. It is currently the most widely accepted, publicly available symmetric cryptographic algorithm. Secret key systems also require that a secure communications channel be established for the delivery of the secret key from the sender to receiver. Such a secure, nonelectronic communications channel for the distribution of secret keys is costly to establish and maintain.", "Unlike secret key cryptography, which employs a single key shared by two or more parties, public key cryptography uses a pair of matched keys for each party. One of these keys is public and the other private. The public key is made known to other parties\u2014mainly through electronic directories\u2014while the private key must be kept confidential. Thus, under the public key system, there is no need to establish a secure channel to distribute keys. The sender encrypts the message with the recipient\u2019s freely disclosed, unique public key. The recipient, in turn, uses her unique private key to decrypt the message.", "Public key cryptography also enables the user to produce an electronic signature. The user encrypts the signature using the private key, which, when decrypted with the public key, provides verification that the message originated from that user. The best known public key algorithm is the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman algorithm. The Pretty Good Privacy software, which implements the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman algorithm, is probably one of the best known public key cryptographic systems. Figure 2.1 highlights the principal features of the secret and public key cryptographic systems.", "A host of related security technologies, including computer memory cards, will also play an important role in securing the information superhighway. Computer memory technology uses a credit-card-size electronic module to store digital information that can be recognized by a network or a host system.

Critics of federal involvement, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation\u2014a public interest organization focused on protecting civil liberties in digital environments\u2014believe that government control of encryption technologies and their implementation represents a danger to civil liberties, and that individuals should be free to choose the technical means for meeting their security requirements. Others, including NIST and Defense officials, maintain that the federal government\u2019s participation and guidance in securing the information superhighway may be needed for several reasons. First, the government is a major consumer of telecommunications services and has unique national security and law enforcement needs that must be addressed. Second, the government, and particularly the Department of Defense, has considerable experience in the areas of computer and communications security. Defense, the developer and operator of the world\u2019s largest secure communications network, could provide expertise needed to help develop the superhighway\u2019s security architecture. The need for such an architecture was underscored by a recent study which noted that it is \u201cimperative to develop at the outset a security architecture that will lay the foundation for protections of privacy, security, and intellectual property rights\u2014safeguards that cannot be supplied as effectively on an add-on basis.\u201d", "Since the invention of the telegraph and telephone, intelligence and law enforcement agencies have conducted legal intercepts of communications both here and abroad.

However, the emergence of digital technologies and the increased availability of sophisticated encryption tools has dramatically eroded the government\u2019s electronic intelligence and analysis capabilities. The proliferation of digital communications is making wiretapping increasingly difficult, while robust encryption prevents third parties, including law enforcement and intelligence agencies, from deciphering and understanding intercepted messages.", "The administration, after coordination with the Congress, industry, and public advocacy groups, has developed a strategy designed to preserve the government\u2019s ability to conduct electronic surveillance, wiretapping, and analysis of voice and data communications between criminals, terrorists, drug dealers, and foreign agents. This strategy includes a major new federal cryptography initiative known as the Key Escrow Standard (popularly known as the \u201cClipper chip\u201d program), the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act requiring the information industry to provide \u201cbuilt-in\u201d wiretapping support in its digital communications systems, and restrictions on the export of encryption technology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Key Escrow Initiative Intended to Improve Communication Security", "paragraphs": ["The Key Escrow initiative is a voluntary program to improve the security and privacy of telephone communications in the private sector while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement.

To ensure that law enforcement agencies are able to understand Clipper-encrypted voice communications, the private encryption keys assigned to each individual Clipper chip are to be escrowed with the government. These keys will be made available to law enforcement agencies for court-ordered wiretaps.", "The Clipper chip, developed by NSA, is a microcircuit incorporating a classified encryption algorithm known as Skipjack. The chip, and its close relative, the Capstone chip, contain a unique key that is used to encrypt and decrypt messages, programmed by the escrow agents. This unique key is then split into two components and delivered to two federal agencies\u2014or escrow agents\u2014for safekeeping. When federal authorities encounter Clipper chip encrypted voice or Capstone chip encrypted data communications during the course of court-authorized wiretapping, they may obtain the unique key necessary for the decryption of the wiretapped communications from the escrow agents. Figure 2.3 shows a Capstone chip and three prototypes of a Clipper chip.", "In April 1993, the President directed the Attorney General to (1) request manufacturers of communications hardware that incorporates encryption to install the Clipper chip in their products, and (2) designate two government organizations as \u201ckey escrow\u201d holders. The President also directed the Secretary of Commerce to initiate, through NIST, a process to develop federal key escrow encryption standards. Despite strong industry opposition, the administration reaffirmed its 1993 directive and instructed the Secretary of Commerce to approve the Clipper chip as a voluntary national standard for encrypted telephone communications. In February 1994, NIST formally approved the new standard. At the same time, the Attorney General designated NIST and the Automated Systems Design Division of the Department of the Treasury as the key escrow agents.", "Critics of the Key Escrow initiative argue that NSA\u2019s refusal to declassify and publish the Skipjack encryption algorithm raises the possibility that the algorithm may have a built-in \u201ctrap door.\u201d Such a trap door would allow intelligence agencies to decrypt Clipper and Capstone encrypted communications at will, without obtaining the private keys from the escrow agents. The critics also note that since robust encryption technology is available both in the U.S. and abroad, there is no incentive for domestic and international industry or private citizens to adopt the Clipper/Capstone technology.", "The misgivings about the Key Escrow initiative were also shared by the Computer System Security and Privacy Advisory Board. In its  June 4, 1993, resolution, the Board stated that the administration has not (1) provided a convincing statement of the problem that Clipper attempts to solve, (2) considered other escrow alternatives including the designation of a third, non-government escrow agent, and (3) fully examined the legal and economic implications of the Clipper chip initiative. The Board recommended that the Key Escrow encryption technology not be deployed beyond current implementations planned within the Executive Branch until the significant public policy and technical issues inherent with this encryption technique are fully understood. The Congress asked the National Research Council to conduct a comprehensive study of national cryptography policy and submit, within 2 years, a report to the Secretary of Defense. In December 1993, the Board endorsed the proposal, noting that the study should be conducted as quickly as possible.", "In July 1994, the administration reaffirmed its commitment to the Key Escrow scheme in general, and to the use of the Clipper chip for telephone communications in particular. It also offered a compromise on the development of the Capstone chip for computer and video networks. Specifically, the administration said that it understood the concerns that industry has regarding the Capstone chip and welcomed the opportunity to work with industry to design a more versatile, less expensive system.

Sixty percent of the calls into and out of the city were disrupted for eight hours. The New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange had to shut down operations. Voice and radar systems that are used to control air traffic from facilities in New York, Washington, and Boston were disabled for five hours.", "Sept. 17, 1991:    Through a power sharing arrangement with New York\u2019s Consolidated Edison, AT&T agreed to use its own power when Consolidated Edison\u2019s facilities were heavily loaded. On this particularly warm day in September, AT&T switched to its own power. Batteries designed to meet the initial instantaneous power demand performed as intended. However, alarms that were intended to inform technicians to start the facility\u2019s diesel generator had been manually disabled. When the batteries discharged, all telephone transmission systems in the facility shut down and voice and data communications controlled by the facility failed. Voice and data communications between the New York, Boston, and Washington Air Route Traffic Control Centers stopped. Three New York area airports closed for several hours. Flights destined for New York were either delayed or canceled. Air traffic at Boston was severely disrupted and delays occurred nationwide. More than 1,174 flights were canceled or delayed and approximately 85,000 passengers were affected. The day after the phone outage, flight schedules were still disrupted because aircraft were not at the right airports for the scheduled morning flights.", "Sept. 10, 1993:    A road crew boring holes for highway road signs in Ohio cut a high-capacity fiber-optic cable belonging to MCI.
