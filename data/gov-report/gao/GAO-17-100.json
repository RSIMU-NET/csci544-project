For example, some company officials said they would like to use high-performance jets to train future spaceflight participants by exposing them to physiological and psychological effects encountered in spaceflight. Other company officials said they would like to use space support vehicles to research how objects or people react in reduced gravity environments. It is difficult to know the size of the market for spaceflight training and research as GAO found no studies on these markets. However, stakeholders said they expect interest in research to increase.", "Some company officials said the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) regulatory framework presents a market challenge because companies cannot get FAA approval to use the aircraft they would like to use to carry passengers or cargo for compensation, thus limiting their ability to operate in the market. FAA's Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) regulates aircraft that companies would like to use as space support vehicles by issuing standard and experimental certificates that help ensure safety. While officials from two companies GAO interviewed have received standard aircraft certification for their space support vehicle, others said the standard certification process is lengthy and not designed for the type of vehicles they would like to use, such as unique, single-production aircraft or retired military jets. In addition, FAA regulations do not allow companies to receive compensation for carrying people or property on an aircraft operating under an experimental certificate. As a result, some of the companies we interviewed have training operations in other countries where they can receive payment for the activity. Further, FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation (AST)\u2014the office that regulates commercial space activities\u2014is only authorized to regulate commercial space activities, such as launches, focusing on the safety of third parties.

We attended a Commercial Space Transportation Advisory  Committee (COMSTAC) meeting and interviewed industry organizations  including the Commercial Spaceflight Federation and the Aerospace  Industries Association. We also conducted a site visit to Florida, which we  selected based on the location of commercial space companies, and met  with officials from Space Florida, a spaceport, and a space support- service provider. We identified stakeholders by asking for a list of  potential stakeholders from FAA\u2019s Office of Commercial Space  Transportation and the Commercial Spaceflight Federation as well by  identifying stakeholders from our previous work on commercial space. We  contacted these stakeholders and identified additional stakeholders  through a snowball technique in which stakeholders identified additional  contacts during interviews.

At the same time, some launch companies are  developing hybrid launch systems, which contain elements of both  aircraft and rocket-powered vehicles. Companies we interviewed  plan to use these vehicles\u2014which take off as an aircraft and then  launch the spacecraft once reaching a certain altitude\u2014to launch non- human payloads and to transport spaceflight participants to space.  For example, WhiteKnightTwo plans to carry Virgin Galactic\u2019s  SpaceShipTwo aircraft to an altitude of 50,000 feet where it will air  launch SpaceShipTwo and the participants on board into space.  According to representatives of launch companies we interviewed,  while most of launch companies\u2019 current activities are focused on  launches, they may also use the aircraft component of a hybrid launch  system for non-launch activities. For example, Virgin Galactic has also  considered using WhiteKnightTwo to carry scientific payloads into  conditions that would simulate spaceflight.", "Spaceports: Spaceports are FAA-licensed launch or reentry sites  used for commercial space launches and reentries that are developed  by private companies and/or states. Spaceports can be co-located  with federal sites or commercial or general aviation airports.  Spaceports generally include launch pads and runways as well as  other infrastructure, such as hangar space, and services, such as  emergency services to be used by commercial space companies. As  of June 2016, there were 10 FAA-licensed nonfederal launch sites.", "Space Support Companies: This category includes companies whose  business plans focus on training future spaceflight participants. This  training simulates conditions encountered in space and can either be  accomplished on the ground using pools and centrifuges or in the air  using aircraft, hence the interest of companies in the commercial  space support vehicle industry. In addition to training, space support  companies offer or plan to offer other services, such as carrying  scientific payloads for micro gravity experiments and repositioning  cargo from one location to another through the air.", "FAA\u2019s Office of Aviation Safety (AVS) oversees civil aviation activities in  the United States. Thus, it regulates aircraft that may be used for space  support activities. AVS is responsible for certifying the airworthiness of  aircraft, pilots, mechanics, and others whose work affects the safety of  those aircraft. When certifying aircraft, AVS inspectors review aircraft  engines, propellers, parts, and equipment, including avionics, to provide a  reasonable expectation of safety.

Specifically, 4 of 9 space support companies, 3 of  13 launch companies, 2 of 5 spaceports, and 4 of 10 other stakeholders  argued that it is necessary for customers to fully understand what they will  experience and the only way to replicate this is through training in high- performance jets. Stakeholders explained that factors that can be  simulated in high performance jets but not through other means include  the stress of a confined environment and exposure to the physiological  and psychological effects of spaceflight. Further, four stakeholders said  this training is necessary to become acquainted with g-forces involved  with spaceflight and that space support vehicles are best able to provide  this training. NASA officials also stated that familiarization with and  experiencing high-g environments while performing time critical  communication is important preparation for spaceflight participants.  See  figure 2 for examples of space support vehicles, including high- performance jets (on left) and the modified Boeing 727 (on right). In  addition, six stakeholders explained that due to the high cost of  spaceflight, getting this experience would be important for someone who  is considering space tourism. However, as discussed below this training  currently is not available in the U.S.", "On the other hand, 13 stakeholders report training can be accomplished  through currently allowed means, including standard certified aircraft and  ground based training. Five of 9 space support companies, 5 of 13 launch  companies, and 3 of 10 other stakeholders reported that it is critical to  expose future spaceflight participants to the conditions they will encounter  in space, but these conditions can be replicated through means other  than high-performance jets. Two space support companies said they  provide ground-based training through centrifuges, pools, and instruction  in space-related topics such as the physiological and psychological  effects of space travel. One launch company reported to us that  spaceflight participants will only need to know how they will react to  microgravity but will not need to know how to accomplish tasks in  microgravity. According to some stakeholders, this acclimation to  microgravity can be accomplished through parabolic flight, centrifuges,  and pools. One company is currently offering a microgravity experience  in a Boeing 727 with an interior that has been modified to accommodate  passengers to this activity, and another company has considered entering  this market with a similar aircraft. Two of 13 launch companies reported  they do not anticipate a high training burden for future customers and  thus would probably not utilize aircraft training or centrifuges.", "The remaining 12 of the 37 stakeholders we interviewed did not comment  on this issue.", "Further, stakeholders representing spaceports have proposed that  spaceports are the proper place to host spaceflight participant training.  Spaceport stakeholders we interviewed said that spaceports provide  runways, launch pads, hangars, and other services such as emergency  response services for commercial space-transportation companies. As  mentioned above, representatives of two of the five spaceports we spoke  to thought space flight training should be provided in high-performance  jets. Two stakeholders we interviewed at spaceports also expressed  interest in hosting companies that provide spaceflight participant training  and see it as a potential source of new revenue, either now or when the  tourism industry evolves and sends customers into space.

For example,  while FAA\u2019s current regulations help ensure passenger safety, they also prevent some companies from providing space support services. While  FAA has started considering this issue, especially for hybrid launch  systems, it has not determined if space support vehicles are needed to  meet the potential research, training, and other needs of the commercial  space industry nor fully examined its current regulations as they relate to  space support vehicles and determined and documented the results of its  assessment. Since FAA has not conducted a comprehensive assessment  of how space support activities fit under its aviation or commercial space  transportation regulatory regimes, officials from some U.S. companies  told us they are delaying investments in space support vehicles. As a  result, it is uncertain if companies will be able to use space support  vehicles for potentially useful spaceflight participant training and research  services to meet the future needs of the commercial space-transportation  industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["To respond to changes in the aviation and commercial space- transportation industries, we recommend that the Secretary of  Transportation direct the FAA Administrator to fully examine and  document whether the current regulatory framework is appropriate for  aircraft that could be considered space support vehicles, and if not,  suggest legislation or develop regulatory changes, or both, as applicable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Transportation for  review and comment.
