However, ONDCP did not issue a National Drug Control Strategy for either 2017 or 2018, as required by statute. ONDCP was also required to assess and certify federal agencies' drug control budgets to determine if they were adequate to meet Strategy goals and objectives. Without a Strategy in 2017 and 2018, ONDCP could not complete this process according to statutory requirements. ONDCP issued a 2019 Strategy and companion documents that addressed some but not all of the selected statutory requirements GAO reviewed. For example, the Strategy and companion documents did not include the required 5-year projection for budget priorities.", "The October 2018 Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act) retained some requirements and introduced new ones for ONDCP. ONDCP met some SUPPORT Act requirements GAO reviewed. For example, ONDCP filled all five coordinator positions described in the SUPPORT Act. However, its approach to meeting other requirements does not incorporate key planning elements. For example, the SUPPORT Act requires that future iterations of the Strategy include a description of how each goal will be achieved, performance evaluation plans, and a plan for expanding treatment of substance use disorders. ONDCP could not provide in writing or otherwise describe its planned steps, interim milestones, resource investments, or overall timeframes\u2014all key planning elements\u2014that would provide assurance it can meet these requirements by the deadline for the next Strategy\u2014February 2020. The SUPPORT Act also required ONDCP to publish an online searchable Data Dashboard of drug control data, with information including quantities of drugs and frequency of their use. While ONDCP published (and later updated) a public version of this resource on its website, as of December 2019, it was not complete (e.g., lacked required data on the unmet need for substance use disorder treatment). Further, ONDCP officials had no information on next steps for fully meeting the requirements. Developing, documenting, and implementing key planning elements to meet these requirements\u2014including resource investments, time frames, and any processes, policies, roles, and responsibilities\u2014would be consistent with key principles for achieving an entity's objective and standards for project management.

Since 2011,  these deaths have also outnumbered injury deaths by firearms, motor  vehicle crashes, suicide, and homicide, according to the Drug  Enforcement Administration. Opioids\u2014particularly highly potent synthetic  opioids like fentanyl that are manufactured to mimic naturally occurring  opioids such as morphine\u2014are currently the main driver of these deaths.  Primarily due to increasing rates of opioid-related deaths and opioid use  disorder, the then-acting secretary of the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) declared the opioid crisis a public health  emergency on October 26, 2017.

According to the President\u2019s fiscal year 2020 budget, federal drug control  funding for fiscal year 2018 was $33 billion.

The ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006 reauthorized  ONDCP through September 30, 2010. After that date, ONDCP continued  to operate under the provisions of the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of  2006 pursuant to continued funding in annual appropriations acts. In  October 2018, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes  Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act  (SUPPORT Act), among other things, reauthorized ONDCP and  amended its authorities. In particular, the SUPPORT Act continues to  require the ONDCP Director to promulgate the National Drug Control  Strategy, and also includes a number of detailed new requirements for its  content and development. For example, the Strategy is required to  include a performance evaluation plan for each long-range goal in the  Strategy for each National Drug Control Program agency. Furthermore,  the SUPPORT Act includes other new requirements, such as the creation  of a publicly accessible Drug Control Data Dashboard that captures an  array of drug related data.", "Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708a(b), we have periodically assessed  ONDCP\u2019s programs and operations.

In March and May 2019, we provided testimony on  our preliminary findings regarding the extent to which ONDCP\u2019s 2019  National Drug Control Strategy met selected statutory requirements.", "To assess the extent to which ONDCP met selected statutory  requirements related to the Strategy for 2017, 2018, and 2019, we  reviewed the current National Drug Control Strategy and three associated  companion documents that ONDCP stated are intended to fulfill their  statutory requirements, and assessed these documents against selected  provisions of the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006. ONDCP officials  told us that they began preparing the current National Drug Control  Strategy, which they issued on January 31, 2019, in early 2018\u2014prior to  the enactment of the SUPPORT Act in October 2018. Officials stated that  they intended for the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy to respond to  the requirements of the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006 because this  was the applicable law at the time that they began drafting the Strategy.  In light of ONDCP\u2019s stated approach, we based our analysis of the 2019  Strategy and companion documents on requirements in the ONDCP  Reauthorization Act of 2006, focusing on the same four provisions we  discussed in our March and May 2019 testimonies. These four  requirements were that the National Drug Control Strategy must contain  (1) annual and quantifiable objectives and targets, (2) a 5-year projection  for program and budget priorities, (3) specific drug trend assessments,  and (4) a description of a performance measurement system. We  selected these four provisions from the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of  2006 because we determined them to be related to aspects of ONDCP\u2019s  role in (a) setting a strategic direction to oversee and coordinate national  drug control policy and (b) ensuring a framework for measuring results.  We also selected these provisions because they were consistent with or  similar to ONDCP\u2019s ongoing responsibilities under the SUPPORT Act,  which is the governing statute for future iterations of the National Drug  Control Strategy. In addition to our analysis of the 2019 Strategy, we  interviewed ONDCP officials about their activities and responsibilities in  overseeing and coordinating national drug control policy.", "To assess the extent to which ONDCP has planned or implemented  actions to meet selected new requirements in the SUPPORT Act, we  reviewed the SUPPORT Act and the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006  to identify requirements from the SUPPORT Act that were relevant to  ONDCP and excluded, for example, requirements for other federal  agencies. Due to the large number of requirements in the SUPPORT Act,  we focused on those that were new and notably different from the  ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006. Based on this review, we selected  seven requirements to examine. Specifically, we selected two requirements to designate officials to fill new coordinator positions\u2014the  performance budget coordinator and the emerging and continuing threats  coordinator; four requirements for new elements to be included in the  National Drug Control Strategy, such as a performance evaluation plan  for each long-range goal in the Strategy; and one requirement to establish  and maintain a drug control data dashboard. We then assessed relevant  documents and information gathered during interviews with ONDCP  officials about any efforts they had taken to address selected  requirements and compared these against the relevant statute and  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government related to  defining and establishing an entity\u2019s objectives.", "To provide additional context for both of our objectives, we also  interviewed officials from three National Drug Control Program  agencies\u2014HHS, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014about their views on and contributions to  ONDCP\u2019s development and implementation of the 2019 National Drug  Control Strategy. We also interviewed these officials about their agencies\u2019  and components\u2019 engagement with ONDCP during the 2017, 2018, and  2019 budget certification process. We selected these agencies because  they received the largest share of 2018 drug control funding. For each  agency, we interviewed headquarters officials who had responsibilities  related to drug control policy and annual drug control budget  submissions. We also selected and interviewed officials from one  component from each agency\u2014the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration from HHS, the Drug Enforcement Administration  from DOJ, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection from DHS. We chose  these components because of their drug control program responsibilities  and their share of the 2018 drug control funding.

Pursuant to the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006, the National Drug  Control Strategy was required to include \u201cannual quantifiable and  measurable objectives and specific targets to accomplish long-term  quantifiable goals that the  Director determines may be achieved  during each year beginning on the date on which the National Drug  Control Strategy is submitted.\u201d The SUPPORT Act retained this  requirement.", "We testified in March 2019 that while the 2019 National Drug Control  Strategy lists seven items it designates as measures of performance or  effectiveness, the document did not indicate how these would be  quantified or measured. The document also did not include targets to be  achieved each year. Our subsequent analysis of the three companion  documents showed that one additional document provided more  information related to this requirement. The 2019 Performance Reporting  System includes 9 goals and 17 quantifiable and measurable objectives  with specific targets for certain years. Specifically, the goals and  objectives identified in the 2019 Performance Reporting System included  educating the public about the dangers of drug use; expanding access to  evidence-based treatment; decreasing the over-prescribing of opioid  medications; and reducing the availability of illicit drugs in the United  States through reduced production, increased seizure trends, and  increased prices and reduced drug purity, among other things. The  document states that each goal \u201cis accompanied by aggressive, but  achievable, objectives with two- and five-year targets from a baseline of  2017.\u201d", "However, the 2019 Strategy does not meet the statutory requirement  because it does not have annual targets that may be achieved each year.  Instead, the Performance Reporting System states that 16 of the 17  objectives in the Strategy have 2-year targets to be achieved in 2019, and  14 of the 17 objectives have 5-year targets to be achieved in 2022. The  objectives do not include annual targets for the other intervening years\u2014 2018, 2020, and 2021, as required. The Performance Reporting System  states that while ONDCP assumes a linear progression from the baseline  year\u20142017, in most cases\u2014to the 2022 target, the trajectory may not  actually be linear, \u201cbut rather it may occur at varying rates over the 5-year  period due to multiple factors which influence the ability to achieve each  of the stated goals and objectives.\u201d In contrast, other information ONDCP  provided to us stated that annual targets can readily be determined from  the linear paths between the 2- and 5-year targets. Without identifying  annual targets, the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy and companion  documents do not meet the statutory requirement. Further, annual targets  would better position ONDCP to monitor progress in intervening years  and make any needed changes to achieve its goals and objectives.", "The SUPPORT Act continues to require ONDCP to establish annual  quantifiable and measurable objectives and specific targets in future  Strategy iterations. By taking steps to address this requirement ONDCP  could further demonstrate whether it is making meaningful progress every  year toward the targets it sets.", "A 5-year projection for program and budget priorities. Pursuant to the  ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006, the National Drug Control Strategy  was required to include \u201ca 5-year projection for program and budget  priorities.\u201d The SUPPORT Act retained this requirement.", "As we testified in March 2019, the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy  did not include this information. Our subsequent analysis of the three  companion documents showed that one document\u2014the 2019  Performance Reporting System\u2014provided more information about  ONDCP\u2019s program priorities but not ONDCP\u2019s budget priorities.  Specifically, 14 of the 17 objectives ONDCP included in the 2019  Performance Reporting System contain various 5-year targets, such as to  reduce the rates of illicit drug and opioid use among youth by 15 percent.  According to ONDCP officials, the objectives and targets in the 2019  Performance Reporting System satisfy the requirement for 5-year  program and budget priorities. However, the document does not include  how these objectives and targets relate to 5-year budget priorities.", "The SUPPORT Act continues to require ONDCP to include a 5-year  projection of program and budget priorities in future Strategy iterations.

Pursuant to the ONDCP  Reauthorization Act of 2006, the National Drug Control Strategy was  required to include assessments of the reduction of the consequences of  illicit drug use and availability and the reduction of illicit drug availability.  We testified in March 2019 that the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy  did not include these assessments. Our subsequent analysis of the three  companion documents showed that the 2019 Data Supplement provided  more information to address the required assessments but did not  address all of the requirements. For example, the assessment of the  reduction of the consequences of illicit drug use and availability was to  include, among other things, the annual national health care cost of illicit  drug use. However, the most recent national health care cost data in the  2019 Data Supplement is from 2007, and ONDCP did not indicate in the  supplement whether more recent data were available. In another  example, the assessment of the reduction of illicit drug availability was to  be measured by, among other things, the number of illicit drug  manufacturing laboratories seized and destroyed and the number of  hectares of marijuana, poppy, and coca cultivated and destroyed  domestically and in other countries. The 2019 Data Supplement  provided data for marijuana and poppy until 2016 and for the quantity of  coca eradicated until 2015.", "The SUPPORT Act no longer requires these specific assessments.

We address  ONDCP\u2019s implementation of this new requirement under the SUPPORT  Act later in the report.", "A description of a performance measurement system.

Our subsequent  analysis of the three companion documents showed that the 2019  Performance Reporting System provides information about some of the  elements the performance measurement system is required to do. For  example, the 2019 Performance Reporting System includes 2-year and 5- year targets for many of its objectives and describes some of the sources  of data that will be used to measure each target. However, it does not  include a description of the system that will accomplish each of the  requirements in the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 2006. For example, it  does not describe a performance measurement system that identifies  major programs and activities of the National Drug Control Program  agencies that support the goals and annual objectives of the National  Drug Control Strategy. Such programs and activities could indicate how  ONDCP expects to achieve these objectives, such as how to educate the  public about the dangers of drug use, or how to expand access to  evidence-based treatment. Additionally, it does not describe how the  performance measurement system monitors consistency between the  drug-related goals and objectives of the National Drug Control Program  agencies and ensures that each agency\u2019s goals and budgets support and  are fully consistent with the National Drug Control Strategy. ONDCP  officials stated they believe the 2019 Performance Reporting System  meets the statutory requirement for a description of a performance  measurement system.", "The SUPPORT Act, as originally enacted in October 2018, no longer  required a description of a performance measurement system. However,  the ONDCP Technical Corrections Act of 2019, enacted in November  2019, amended the SUPPORT Act to reinstate the requirement for a  description of a performance measurement system. Therefore, this  requirement will apply to the 2020 National Drug Control Strategy and  future Strategy iterations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "ONDCP Has Met Some SUPPORT Act Requirements That GAO Reviewed but Its Approach to Meeting Others Does Not Incorporate Key Planning Elements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ONDCP Has Addressed Requirements for New Coordinator Positions", "paragraphs": ["As of August 2019, ONDCP filled all five coordinator positions described  in the SUPPORT Act, two of which are substantively new positions.

Figure 3 outlines the selected requirements for  the Strategy, which were effective upon enactment of the SUPPORT Act  in October 2018.", "Each of the four selected SUPPORT Act requirements described in  Figure 3 requires ONDCP to include specific information in the 2020 and  future National Drug Control Strategy iterations. For example, for each  comprehensive, research-based, long-range, quantifiable goal, the  National Drug Control Strategy must contain (1) a description of how each  goal will be achieved; (2) a performance evaluation plan for each goal;  and (3) a description for how each goal was determined. The National  Drug Control Strategy must also include a plan to expand treatment for  substance use disorders. Officials from ONDCP and selected agencies  told us that in spring 2019 ONDCP requested that the National Drug  Control Program agencies determine how their existing programs and  activities align with the 2019 National Drug Control Strategy, including the  goals and objectives articulated in the 2019 Performance Reporting  System. In October 2019, ONDCP officials told us that the 2020 Strategy  would be issued in accordance with the SUPPORT Act, by the first  Monday in February (February 3, 2020). ONDCP also provided us with  two documents to describe its approach for meeting this deadline. One  document includes a table that lists SUPPORT Act requirements along  with the ONDCP component(s) responsible for implementation and the  deadline. The other document provides a high-level summary of the  National Drug Control Strategy development and interagency review  process. For example, the plan to monitor progress on the drafting of  components\u2019 sections of the Strategy notes that it is to occur through \u201cas- needed (but frequent)\u201d meetings with the deputy chief of staff and the  components and their heads.", "The extensive nature of the new SUPPORT Act requirements, as  described above, indicates that significant implementation steps may be  necessary, such as, a description of the specific steps necessary to  accomplish this overarching task, identification of who will be responsible  for each step, and a schedule of interim milestones. However, neither of  these documents describes such critical implementation steps. Further,  neither specifies what resources or processes, for example, would be  needed and by what specific milestone date ONDCP would accomplish  any particular step to complete the overall work in a timely manner. For  example, the document that includes the table indicates that the deadline  for all requirements related to the National Drug Control Strategy is February 2020. However, some requirements associated with the  development of the Strategy, such as consultation requirements, would  need to be completed before the Strategy\u2019s due date\u2014February 2020.", "According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  under Internal Control Principle 6, to achieve an entity\u2019s mission,  management should define objectives in specific terms so they are  understood at all levels of the entity. This involves clearly defining what  it is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the  time frames for achievement\u2014in other words, key planning elements.  Standards for project management also state that managing a project  involves developing a plan with specific actions and milestone dates.", "Defining these key planning elements will help provide assurance that  ONDCP\u2019s efforts will result in a National Drug Control Strategy\u2014for 2020  and future years\u2014that fully addresses the requirements of the SUPPORT  Act. In addition, developing and documenting these planning elements  would help ONDCP structure its planning efforts through consideration of  resource investments, time frames, and any necessary processes,  policies, roles, and responsibilities to address each requirement.  Furthermore, implementing these planning elements will help ensure that  ONDCP follows a routine planning process going forward, and that future  iterations of the National Drug Control Strategy that ONDCP develops are  consistent with the law.", "Additionally, as of December 2019, ONDCP has not documented key  planning elements to ensure it will meet the SUPPORT Act\u2019s  requirements for the Drug Control Data Dashboard, to make timely  information publicly available on the scope and complexity of drug use  and drug control activities. The SUPPORT Act includes requirements for  what data is to be included in the Drug Control Data Dashboard as well  as its functionality, to ensure it is searchable and sortable. Figure 4  outlines the requirements for the Drug Control Data Dashboard, which  were effective upon enactment of the SUPPORT Act in October 2018.", "In August 2019, ONDCP posted a public version of the Drug Control Data  Dashboard that included information from the 2019 Data Supplement in  spreadsheet format, but did not provide all of the data required by the  SUPPORT Act. For example, the Drug Control Data Dashboard does  not include required data on the extent of the unmet need for substance  use disorder treatment. ONDCP officials shared information regarding  potential data sources they may use to fulfill the additional required data  elements. In addition, ONDCP officials told us that some data  requirements listed in the statute do not exist at this time. For example,  ONDCP officials stated that data do not exist regarding the known and  estimated flow of substances into the United States for the current  calendar year and each of the three previous years. ONDCP officials  stated that there was more work necessary to ensure all the required data  are incorporated into the Drug Control Data Dashboard. At that time, they  also stated that they expected to address all required elements by the  end of 2019. However, we found that they do not have key planning  elements, such as a specific timeline with interim milestones or  documented plans for when and how they would complete this work.  ONDCP subsequently posted an updated version of the Drug Control  Data Dashboard, which we reviewed in December 2019. While the  updated Drug Control Data Dashboard identifies required data elements  that are unavailable, ONDCP has not addressed how or when ONDCP  planned to provide them, such as by identifying alternative data sources  or identifying additional resources that may be necessary for enhanced  data collection efforts.", "The SUPPORT Act also requires the Drug Control Data Dashboard to be  machine-readable and searchable by year, agency, drug, and location, to  the extent practicable. Officials stated in September 2019 they planned to  add this functionality to the Drug Control Data Dashboard in the fall of  2019. In written comments on a draft of this report in December 2019,  ONDCP indicated that the data have been posted in a machine-readable,  sortable, and searchable format. However, as of December 2019, we  found that the Drug Control Data Dashboard is still not fully searchable by  year, agency, drug and location. We have previously reported on key  practices for agencies to follow when reporting government data. These  practices describe, for example, that agencies should ensure their  website\u2019s data search functions and overall interface is intuitive to users.  While effective implementation of such functions can be a significant  undertaking, ONDCP does not have plans to account for timing, content,  functionality, or any additional resources required to fully implement this  requirement. ONDCP officials stated in September 2019 they may need  to consult Congress about additional resources to fulfill all of the  requirements related to the Drug Control Data Dashboard, but stated that  they do not have specific plans for what resources they may request.", "Internal control standards call for agencies to define key planning  elements, including how a task will be accomplished and associated  timeframes. Developing and documenting key planning elements\u2014 including resource investments, time frames, and any necessary  processes, policies, roles, and responsibilities\u2014will better position  ONDCP to fully implement all of the law\u2019s requirements for the Drug  Control Data Dashboard.

However, the  2019 National Drug Control Strategy does not fully comply with the law,  and the agency has not developed key planning elements to help ensure  it will meet its significant additional responsibilities under the SUPPORT  Act. These responsibilities include issuing the National Drug Control  Strategy in accordance with statutory requirements to help prioritize and  measure key efforts to address the drug epidemic and creating a Drug  Control Data Dashboard that contains timely information about the scope  and complexity of the drug epidemic. These responsibilities also extend  beyond the upcoming 2020 Strategy, with requirements to complete  future Strategy iterations on a regular basis. Developing and documenting  key planning elements, such as resource investments, time frames, and  any necessary processes, policies, roles, and responsibilities\u2014will help  ONDCP structure its ongoing efforts. Implementing this approach will then  better position ONDCP to meet statutory requirements for the next  Strategy, due in February 2020, and satisfy all requirements related to the  Drug Control Data Dashboard.

ONDCP provided written comments, which are  summarized below and reproduced in appendix I. ONDCP, DHS, and  DOJ also provided technical comments, which we incorporated, as  appropriate. In an email, an HHS official stated that HHS did not have any  comments on the report.", "In its written comments, ONDCP stated that it accepted the first two  recommendations regarding the need for a robust internal planning  process for National Drug Control Strategies.  Specifically, the first  recommendation is for ONDCP to develop and document key planning  elements to help the agency meet the SUPPORT Act requirements for  the 2020 National Drug Control Strategy and future Strategy iterations.  The second recommendation is for ONDCP to routinely implement an  approach to meet these requirements. In particular, ONDCP agreed to  implement key planning elements for future Strategies that will include  detailed descriptions of planned steps, identifying which ONDCP  component will be responsible for each step, resource investments,  interim milestones, and overall time frames. If implemented as planned,  these actions would address the intent of these recommendations.", "Regarding the third and fourth recommendations related to the Drug  Control Data Dashboard, ONDCP noted that these recommendations  have been rendered moot because the agency has already fully complied  with posting the Data Dashboard to its website. ONDCP also stated that it  has posted to the Data Dashboard all of the drug-related data required by  ONDCP\u2019s statute that currently exists. Further, ONDCP stated that the  data has been posted in machine-readable, sortable, and searchable  format as required and it will be updated on a continuous basis  throughout the year as new data become available. While ONDCP has  included additional information on the Dashboard, the two  recommendations are to develop, document, and implement key planning  elements for the Dashboard to fully meet the law\u2019s requirements, which  ONDCP has not yet done. For example, ONDCP identifies in the  Dashboard which of the required data elements are unavailable, such as  required data on the extent of the unmet need for substance use disorder  treatment. However, as stated in the report, ONDCP has not documented  key planning elements for how it will address these missing data. Such  planning elements could include approaches for collecting the missing  data, such as articulating a plan to work with Congress to identify  alternative data sources or to identify additional resources that may be  necessary for enhanced data collection efforts. Furthermore, ONDCP has  not developed or implemented key planning elements to ensure the Drug  Control Data Dashboard has the search features noted in the statute. In  its current format, the Dashboard is not fully searchable by year, agency,  drug, and location. While the statute indicates that search features should  have been implemented \u201cto the extent practicable,\u201d ONDCP did not  explain why it was not practical to implement them. Therefore, we  continue to believe that developing, documenting, and implementing key  planning elements for the Dashboard to fully meet the law\u2019s requirements  will help enable ONDCP to capitalize on available data to better  understand the scope and nature of the drug crisis.", "ONDCP also noted several points related to our specific findings, as  discussed below.", "First, ONDCP noted that it did issue robust drug budget guidance to  National Drug Control Program agencies during 2017 and 2018. The  report acknowledges that ONDCP provided this guidance. However, as  explained in the report, the guidance is statutorily required to address  funding priorities developed in the National Drug Control Strategy. Since  ONDCP did not issue a Strategy in 2017 or 2018, it could not meet this  statutory requirement.", "In addition, ONDCP stated that it maintains that the 2019 National Drug  Control Strategy met all statutory requirements, and therefore does not  agree with our analysis of its adherence to those requirements. ONDCP  also noted that the four requirements we assessed constitute only a small  portion of the many requirements for the 2019 National Drug Control  Strategy and that the report gives the misleading impression that ONDCP  did not comply with some significant number of requirements. We  recognize that there are a number of requirements for the Strategy;  however, as stated in the report, our review focused on these four  provisions because we determined them to be significant to ONDCP\u2019s  role in setting a strategic direction to oversee and coordinate national  drug control policy, and because they are critical to ensuring a framework  for measuring results. Specifically, the provisions related to including  information in the Strategy related to annual quantifiable and measurable  objectives and specific targets, a 5-year projection for program and  budget priorities, specific drug trend assessments, and a description of a  performance measurement system.  As detailed in the report, we found  that the 2019 Strategy addressed some\u2014but not all\u2014of these four  statutory requirements. For example, we found that the Strategy did not  include a 5-year projection for budget priorities and included only some  information related to specific drug trend assessments. In its written  comments, ONDCP provided additional explanation for why it did not  agree with our characterization of the requirements. For example,  ONDCP stated that it is not able to provide quantitative fiscal year  projections for future years because this would go against long-standing  Office of Management and Budget policy.  Related to drug trend  assessments, ONDCP noted that it reports data generated by other  government agencies, and that policy research funding for ONDCP has  not been appropriated since fiscal year 2011.  We made  recommendations, which ONDCP agreed to implement, focused on  developing and implementing key planning elements such as descriptions  of resource investments; timeframes; and processes, policies, and  responsibilities needed to address each requirement. Implementing these  planning elements could, for example, help ensure that ONDCP  addresses any policy considerations or additional resources needed to  help ensure that future iterations of the Strategy fully meet all statutory  requirements.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the  Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Acting  Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Attorney General,  and other interested parties.
