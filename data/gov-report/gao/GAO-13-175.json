U.S. federal, state, and local officials have stated that the prospect of crime, including violence, spilling over from Mexico into the southwestern United States is a concern. GAO was asked to review crime rates and assess information on spillover crime along the border. Specifically, this report addresses: (1) What information do reported crime rates in southwest border communities provide on spillover crime and what do they show? (2) What efforts, if any, have federal, state, and select local law enforcement agencies made to track spillover crime along the southwest border? (3) What concerns, if any, do these agencies have about spillover crime? (4) What steps, if any, have these agencies taken to address spillover crime?", "GAO analyzed crime data from all of the 24 southwest border counties from 2004 through 2011 and federal documentation, such as threat assessments and DHS's plans for addressing violence along the southwest border. GAO interviewed officials from DHS and DOJ and their components. GAO also interviewed officials from 37 state and local law enforcement agencies responsible for investigating and tracking crime in the border counties in the four southwest border states (Arizona, California, New Mexico, and Texas). While the results of the interviews are not generalizable, they provided insights. GAO is not making any recommendations. DHS provided comments, which highlighted border-related crime initiatives recognized by GAO."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program, the government's centralized repository for crime data, provides the only available standardized way to track crime levels in border counties over time. However, UCR data lack information on whether reported offenses are attributable to spillover crime, and have other limitations, such as underreporting to police. Also, UCR data cannot be used to identify links with crimes often associated with spillover from Mexico, such as cartel-related drug trafficking. Cognizant of these limitations, GAO's analysis of data for southwest border counties with sufficiently complete data show that, generally, both violent and property crimes were lower in 2011 than in 2004. For example, the violent crime rate in three states' border counties was lower by at least 26 percent in 2011 than in 2004 and in one other state lower by 8 percent in 2011 than in 2005.", "Law enforcement agencies have few efforts to track spillover crime. No common federal government definition of such crime exists, and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Justice (DOJ) components, including those with a definition, either do not collect data to track spillover crime, or do not maintain such data that can be readily retrieved and analyzed. However, several components collect violent incident data that could serve as indirect indicators of spillover crime. For example, GAO analysis of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data show that, generally, assaults on agents between southwest border ports of entry were about 25 percent lower in 2012 than in 2006. State and local law enforcement agencies, except for one state agency, do not track what might be considered to be spillover crime because they lack a common definition and do not systematically collect these crime data in a way that can be used to analyze trends. Officials from 22 of 37 state and local agencies told GAO that they have limited resources to collect additional data. Since April 2012, DHS and the Texas Department of Public Safety have coled an effort to propose definitions and metrics for border-related crime by March 2013.", "Law enforcement agencies have varying concerns regarding the extent to which violent crime from Mexico spills into southwest border communities. While DHS and DOJ threat assessments indicate that violent infighting between drug cartels has remained largely in Mexico, DHS assessments also show that aggressive tactics used by traffickers to evade capture demonstrate an increasing threat to U.S. law enforcement. Also, officials in 31 of the 37 state and local agencies stated that they have not observed violent crime from Mexico regularly spilling into their counties; nonetheless, officials in 33 of the 37 agencies were at least somewhat concerned, for example, for the safety of their personnel or residents.", "Law enforcement agencies have undertaken initiatives to target border-related crime, including one effort to address violent crime spilling over from Mexico. For example, in October 2008, DHS developed a contingency plan for the possibility that a significant southwest border violence escalation may exceed DHS assets' ability to respond. In addition, officials from all state and local law enforcement agencies that GAO spoke with said their agencies had undertaken some efforts, either individually or in partnership with others, to combat criminal activities often associated with spillover crime, such as drug and human smuggling."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has identified Mexican drug cartels\u2014whose  trafficking of drugs, cash, and firearms engenders violence\u2014as an  organized crime threat to the United States.

Based on data compiled by the Trans-Border  Institute at the University of San Diego, homicides related to organized  crime increased by 523 percent from 2006 (1,152) through 2011 (7,178)  in the six Mexican states that share the nearly 2,000-mile border with the  United States. As an extension of its counternarcotics policy, and in  response to the possibility that violence in Mexico may spread, or spill  over, to the United States, the U.S. government has been supporting  Mexico\u2019s campaign against Mexican drug cartels by implementing  bilateral security initiatives, enhancing border security programs, and  introducing initiatives to reduce the movement of drugs, money, and  weapons to and from Mexico.", "Stakeholders view the term \u201cspillover\u201d differently. Depending on the  stakeholder, the term \u201cspillover\u201d might refer only to Mexican drug cartel- related violence or be defined as a broader concept of spillover crime,  which includes both violent and nonviolent activities. Examples of such  activities include rape or murder committed in connection with cross- border or drug cartel activity; keeping smuggled aliens in stash houses  and ransoming them back to Mexico; smuggling of firearms, drugs, and  people; vandalism such as littering on smuggling routes; and destroying  private property, such as cutting fences and killing cattle. In addition,  stakeholders have varying perspectives on the existence and effects of  crime spilling over from Mexico into communities along the southwest  border. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Janet  Napolitano testified in 2009 that increases in drug cartel-related violence  in the United States were far below Mexican levels and were limited to  acts of violence between cartel members and assaults on U.S. Customs  and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP) Border Patrol agents. In 2011, she stated  that while the United States must continue to guard against spillover  effects of drug cartel-related violence in Mexico, border communities were  among the safest in America. On the other hand, some members of  Congress and officials from state governments and state and local law  enforcement agencies have publicly asserted that drug cartel-related  violent crime is spilling over from Mexico into the United States,  endangering the lives and property of Americans living in U.S. southwest  border communities. Federal law does not specifically require the  collection of data on spillover crime, but legislation has been introduced in  Congress that would require federal agencies to report on incidents of  cross-border violence or on their ability to track and quantify the level of  cross-border violence occurring along the southwest border.", "You asked us to review crime rates and assess information on spillover  crime from Mexico in communities along the U.S.-Mexico border.

We selected January 2004 as the initial date because it provided us with  data for more than 2 years prior to December 2006, when Mexican  President Felipe Calder\u00f3n took office and began a major military  offensive against Mexican drug cartels. We also analyzed UCR\u2019s National  Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data, available from January  2007 through December 2010, for the single southwest border law  enforcement agency reporting such data\u2014the sheriff\u2019s office in Yuma  County, Arizona. To assess the reliability of the UCR data, we conducted  analyses to test for irregularities in the data, reviewed FBI documentation  on how the data can and cannot be used and on the FBI\u2019s procedures for  ensuring UCR data quality, and interviewed FBI officials knowledgeable  about the data. On the basis of this assessment, we excluded some  counties from our analysis because they did not report complete crime  data to the FBI. We concluded that the data for the remaining counties  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review. In addition, to  determine what other data are systematically collected in southwest  border counties, we interviewed officials from the state and local law  enforcement agencies that are responsible for investigating and tracking  crime occurring in their jurisdictions. At the state level, we conducted  interviews with officials from the California Highway Patrol, and the  Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas Departments of Public Safety. At the  local level, we interviewed officials representing 21 of the 24 sheriffs\u2019  offices in southwest border counties and 12 large municipal police  departments in the border counties. We selected departments from each  of four states, and we selected large departments because on the basis  of our review of the UCR SRS data, in general, large departments had  more reported crimes than did smaller departments. A list of the 24  southwest border counties can be found in appendix I. In total, we  interviewed officials from 37 state and law enforcement agencies on the  southwest border.", "Further, we conducted site visits to five southwest border counties: Pima  and Santa Cruz Counties in Arizona, and Cameron, Hidalgo, and Webb  Counties in Texas. We selected these counties because they represent  diverse urban and rural environments and contain geographic features,  such as rivers and mountains, which could affect the levels and types of  crime they experience. As part of our visits, in addition to interviewing  state and local law enforcement agencies, we met with federal officials,  such as CBP agents and officers operating between and at the ports of  entry along the southwest border. The information we obtained from  these visits is not generalizable to all southwest border counties, but it  provides insights on the perspectives that law enforcement  representatives have on crime occurring in southwest border  communities.", "To describe efforts agencies have taken to track spillover crime, we  collected information, such as crime reports and documentation on  categories of data collected, from and conducted interviews with the state  and local law enforcement agencies identified above, as well as with  federal agencies that have responsibilities for combating drug cartel\u2013 related activities along the southwest border. For example, these federal  agencies include components and intelligence offices from DHS, such as  CBP and DHS\u2019s Office of Intelligence and Analysis; Department of Justice  (DOJ), such as Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the FBI; and  interagency task forces, such as the Border Enforcement Security Task  Force. We asked agencies about their efforts to track spillover crime, any  challenges they encountered in doing so, and whether they collected or  tracked other data they considered related to spillover crime and violence  on the southwest border. Specifically, we analyzed CBP data on the  number of assaults on Border Patrol agents in southwest border patrol  sectors from fiscal years 2006 through 2012, and the number of assaults  on Office of Field Operations personnel at southwest border ports of entry  for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the date ranges for which these data were  available.

(See fig 2.)", "In each fiscal year from 2006 through 2011, there were more rockings\u2014 defined as thrown rocks, for example by drug or human smugglers, at  Border Patrol agents with the intent of threatening or inflicting physical  harm\u2014than all other assaults combined in Border Patrol sectors along  the southwest border. In 2012, when the number of rockings was at a 7- year low, there were 51 fewer rockings than all other assaults. While the  total number of assaults for all sectors combined in 2012 is smaller than  in 2006, certain southwest border sectors show an increase in the  number of all assaults other than rockings in 2012 from 2006. For  example, the Tucson sector experienced 91 such assaults in 2012  compared with 76 in 2006, and the Rio Grande Valley sector experienced  77 such assaults compared with 41 in 2006. (Additional analysis of  assault trends for fiscal years 2006 through 2012 by Border Patrol sector  is presented in appendix VI.) CBP officials cited several factors that could  affect a change in the number of assaults against Border Patrol agents,  including changes in the level of illegal activity crossing the border, as  well as changes in Border Patrol presence along the border. Also, CBP  officials reported that from September 2004 through November 2012, 3  out of 22 Border Patrol agent deaths on the southwest border had a  nexus to cross-border crime, while the remaining deaths mostly resulted  from vehicular accidents or health issues.", "With respect to officers at ports of entry, CBP maintains data on physical  assaults, assaults with a vehicle, and assaults with a weapon. For the 2  fiscal years that CBP has reliable data, the data show that assaults  against officers at southwest border ports of entry declined from 37  assaults in fiscal year 2011 to 26 assaults in fiscal year 2012.", "In addition, the FBI reported that its Latin American Southwest Border  Threat Section\u2014created to focus on issues specifically related to drug  cartels\u2014began in fiscal year 2010 to classify incidents of violent crime  with links to Mexico, including kidnappings of American citizens and non- terrorism-related hostage taking occurring in or having a substantial  nexus to Mexico or Central and South America. According to the FBI,  under the new classifications, from October 2009 through September  2012, it investigated and closed five cases involving kidnappings of  American citizens and five cases involving non-terrorism-related hostage  taking. None of these cases occurred in the United States. FBI officials  cautioned that drug cartel related crimes, such as kidnappings and home  invasions, are highly underreported and are not captured in national crime  statistics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Only 1 of the 37 state and local law enforcement agencies that we  interviewed\uf8e7the Texas Department of Public Safety\uf8e7stated that it tracks  spillover crime. There are several reasons spillover crime is not more  widely measured and tracked across these agencies. First, there is no  common definition of spillover crime shared by the border law  enforcement communities, and our interviews with border sheriffs and  police officials indicated that their opinions on what types of incidents  constitute spillover crime vary. For example, the Texas Border Sheriff\u2019s  Coalition defined spillover crime as any action on one side of the border  that is the result of violence or the threat of violence that causes a  reaction on the other side of the border, such as a law enforcement  response, or an economic or social impact. The Luna County, New  Mexico, sheriff\u2019s office defined spillover crime as occurring when a person  is injured by any means by an act along the border that has a direct  nexus to Mexican drug-trafficking organizations. The Cochise County,  Arizona, sheriff\u2019s office defined spillover crime as any crime associated  with cross-border trafficking. Officials from 27 out of 37 state and local law  enforcement agencies stated that it would be at least somewhat useful to  have a common definition of spillover crime, because it would establish  types of activities that constitute spillover crime and allow agencies to  track such crime, among other uses. However, officials from 22 of those  27 agencies also stated that accomplishing such a task might be  challenging. The reasons cited included differences of opinion among  border counties about what incidents represent spillover crime and  differences in the missions and priorities of federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies. As discussed previously in this report, the Texas  Department of Public Safety and the DHS Office of Intelligence and  Analysis are leading an effort by select state and local law enforcement  agencies to propose new terms and definitions and identify metrics for  various facets of border-related crime and violence by March 2013.", "Second, no state or local law enforcement agency we interviewed in our  review systematically collects data on what might be considered to be  spillover crime in a way that can be used to analyze trends. Officials from  the Texas Department of Public Safety, the single agency that said it  tracks spillover crime, stated that the department collects data on crimes  it considers to be related to spillover, such as murders, kidnappings, and  shootings related to activities of the Mexican drug cartels. The  department manages six intelligence centers along the border that,  according to officials, rely on a variety of sources, including incident  reports from sheriffs\u2019 offices, news reports, and intelligence information  from interagency task forces, to assess which incidents can be clearly  linked to Mexico and determined to be spillover crime. However, officials  stated that spillover incidents reported by the department cannot be used  to analyze trends over time because they are not collected systematically  and may be incomplete. For example, the incident reports can vary by  sheriff\u2019s office in terms of what is reported and how incidents are  characterized. For example, we found in our interviews with Texas border  sheriffs\u2019 offices that each office may have different ways of capturing  information on incidents and may consider different incidents to be related  to spillover crime.", "While the Texas Department of Public safety is the only state or local law  enforcement agency we interviewed that reported collecting data  specifically on spillover crime, 6 out of 37 law enforcement agencies we  spoke with stated that they collect information on cross-border and drug- related activities, which could be elements of spillover crime. Specifically,", "Officials from 3 sheriffs\u2019 offices in Arizona and Texas and 1 police  department in California stated their agencies collect information on  incidents that involve aliens without lawful immigration status to track  cross-border activity. However, the officials noted that the data are too  general to determine whether a specific crime incident is attributable  to spillover from Mexico.", "Officials from the Laredo, Texas, Police Department stated that since  2003, the department has tracked incidents of drug smuggling, human  smuggling, and the types of weapons seized. According to officials,  while the data contribute to intelligence necessary to determine  whether a crime is cartel-related, the data do not contain sufficient  detail to determine whether a specific crime incident is attributable to  spillover from Mexico.", "Officials from the San Diego office of the California Highway Patrol  stated that in 2012 their field office began tracking how often they  respond to calls from CBP\u2019s Office of Field Operations to investigate  incidents at the port of entry. However, the officials noted that the data  could not be a measure for spillover crime because the incident may  not always result in a crime or an arrest and may not be related to  cartel activity or involve Mexican nationals.", "Officials from 27 out of 37 state and local law enforcement agencies  stated that it would be at least somewhat useful to collect spillover crime  data. Some of the reasons given were that the data would enhance  intelligence, identify trends, and assist the agencies in making decisions  about deploying resources. In addition, some officials said that data on  spillover crime could help agencies apply for grants. However, the  majority also expressed concerns about the burden of collecting  additional information. Specifically, officials from 22 out of 37 state and  local agencies stated that they have limited technological, financial, and  human resources to collect additional data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Law Enforcement Agencies Have Varying Concerns about Potential Effects of Violent Crime in Mexico on Border Communities", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all of the DHS and DOJ components we interviewed stated  that while they do not believe that spillover violence has been a significant  problem, they expressed concerns about the potential for it to occur in the  future because drug cartels employ increasingly violent methods to  interact with rivals and law enforcement agencies in Mexico. Threat  assessments conducted by DHS and DOJ during fiscal years 2006  through 2012 do not indicate that violence from Mexico spilled over the  southwest border. For example, the assessments indicate that violent  infighting among rival Mexican cartels has remained largely in Mexico,  and crimes such as kidnappings and home invasion robberies directed  against drug traffickers have remained largely isolated instances in U.S.  border communities. However, DHS threat assessments have reported  that the threat facing U.S. law enforcement personnel from drug- trafficking organizations has been increasing, as evidenced by more  aggressive tactics used by drug-trafficking organizations and smugglers  to confront or evade law enforcement. Examples of such tactics include  ramming or impeding police vehicles, fleeing at high speeds, and carrying  weapons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Officials from 37 state and local law enforcement agencies and four  Chambers of Commerce we interviewed expressed varying concerns  regarding the extent to which violent crime from Mexico spills into and  potentially affects their border communities. Officials in 31 of the 37 state  and local law enforcement agencies stated that they have not observed  violent crime from Mexico regularly spilling into their counties;  nonetheless, officials from 33 of the 37 agencies said they are at least  somewhat concerned about the potential for spillover crime to occur.  Officials noted that there is always potential for the high levels of violence  in Mexico, such as organized murders and kidnappings for ransom, to  spread to their border towns. A senior DEA official in the El Paso, Texas,  region testified in March 2009 that the southwest border is the principal  arrival zone for most illicit drugs smuggled into the United States and is  also the predominant staging area for the drugs\u2019 distribution throughout  the country.", "Further, state and local law enforcement officials expressed concerns  about safety threats to law enforcement officers and residents who might  encounter drug and human smugglers transiting through border  communities, and according to some officials, smugglers are increasingly  aggressive in evading capture and likely to be armed. For example, a  New Mexico sheriff stated that while there have not been any serious  injuries, drug smugglers ram police vehicles to stop a pursuit or speed  through residential neighborhoods to avoid capture. In addition, armed  cartel members on the Mexican border sometimes engage in gunfights  with rival smugglers returning from the United States. According to the  sheriff, such activities could result in vehicular accidents or shootings at  U.S. law enforcement officers. An Arizona sheriff stated that most of the  violence the office sees involves trafficker-on-trafficker violence. For  example, a crew of smugglers might steal drug or human cargo from  other smugglers to sell it themselves. In addition to the potential for  violence during the event, there is also a potential for violence because of  retaliation for the stolen goods. Officials in a California police department  stated that auto thefts have increased, and officials believe that an  increasing proportion of these thefts are related to cartel activity as cars  are stolen to transport drug loads to the final destination after being  transported over the border. Examples of some crimes that local officials  attributed to spillover from Mexico include the following:", "A border sheriff in Arizona stated that a rancher was most likely  murdered in 2010 by a smuggler.", "Officials in a Texas police department stated that they investigated a  murder in 2010 that they attributed to spillover crime. Investigators in  the case determined that the victim was a cartel member and the  perpetrator was from a rival cartel in Mexico and had crossed the  border to assassinate the rival cartel member.", "Officials in a California police department stated that a vehicle in  Mexico was engaged in a gunfight with the Mexican police and the  vehicle crossed the border into the United States.", "A sheriff in a border county in Texas stated that the property crime  rates in his county had increased in 2008 because over a series of  months, a group of smugglers from Mexico were burglarizing houses  on their way back to Mexico. They were eventually arrested and  prosecuted.", "According to state and local law enforcement officials, many crimes  associated with drug-trafficking threats are unreported, since in many  instances, both the perpetrators and the victims may be involved in  criminal activity, and the victim may not be in this country legally. Further,  the sheriff of a rural county in Texas stated that while statistics indicate  that there is little crime in his county, it may be because there are very  few law enforcement officials or residents to confront or resist smugglers  moving through the county, not because criminal activity is not  occurring. Similarly, a sheriff from another rural county in Texas stated  that he believes that an enhanced law enforcement presence in the Rio  Grande Valley may force illicit activity toward his county because it is less  populated than other counties and smugglers are less likely to be  confronted there. Moreover, according to some local law enforcement  officials, the levels of violent crime in Mexico can have effects on the  border communities that are not captured in the crime statistics. The 2011  Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center threat assessment stated  that the southwest border violence, such as kidnappings and home  invasions carried out by Mexican criminal organizations, and gang-related  violence, present the most substantial threat to public safety in Arizona.", "While 33 of 37 law enforcement agencies expressed some concern about  spillover crime, officials from 11 of the 37 agencies stated that they do not  treat spillover crime differently than they would any other crime. In  addition, an Arizona sheriff and a police official from the same county  stated that they are not more concerned about spillover crime because  their county has not experienced any incidents of kidnappings or  extortion, which could be indicators that crime has spilled over from  Mexico.", "In addition to concerns about crime and violence potentially spilling over  from Mexico, local law enforcement officials provided a number of  examples of how the violence in Mexico affects local communities:", "U.S. citizens that cross the border daily, such as for school or  employment are vulnerable to extortion or recruitment by cartels. For  example, police officials in a California border city stated that cartel  members in Mexico have come into the United States to recruit gang  members, and a sheriff in a county in New Mexico stated that in his  county, 400 or more U.S. citizens live in Mexico but attend school in  the United States. The students may be recruited or coerced to  smuggle drugs into the United States on their way to school.", "A Texas sheriff stated that a local college was forced to close after  bullets from a gunfight originating in Mexico hit the college dorm  building.", "Cartels may target public officials and law enforcement for corruption.  Specifically, we were told of cases from local law enforcement in both  New Mexico and Arizona in which public officials had been corrupted  by a Mexican cartel.", "Sheriff and police department officials in counties in Texas, Arizona,  and New Mexico stated that cartel members may reside with their  families in U.S. border communities because they are considered to  be safe havens. An officer in one police department stated a concern  that there is a potential for violent altercations in the United States  between cartel members living in their community that represent rival  Mexican cartels.", "In addition, we spoke with Chamber of Commerce officials in one Arizona  and three Texas border counties, and they all stated that they have not  seen spillover violence from Mexico, but that violence in Mexico has  nonetheless negatively affected businesses in their border communities.  Specifically, they said that violence in Mexico has resulted in a perception  that border communities are not safe and this has hindered economic  growth and tourism. For example, an official from a Chamber of  Commerce in one Texas county stated that local universities and  hospitals have difficulty recruiting students and staff. Additionally,  Chamber of Commerce officials in all three Texas counties said that  violence in Mexico and more delays and stricter searches at the border  have impeded Mexican consumers\u2019 ability to more easily cross the border  and purchase goods and services from the local U.S. businesses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Law Enforcement Agencies Have Initiatives that Target Border-related Crime, Including a Federal Contingency Plan to Address Violent Crime Spilling Over from Mexico", "paragraphs": ["At the federal level, officials from DOJ and DHS and their components  stated that they have undertaken a number of efforts, both individually  and through interagency partnerships, related to drug smuggling and  cartel activity with a focus on the southwest border; however, all but one  of these efforts do not specifically target spillover crime. For example, the  FBI created a Latin American Southwest Border Threat Section to focus  on issues specifically related to drug cartels. Also, DHS issued Border  Violence Protocols in 2006 that set out the steps that CBP and Mexican  government personnel are to follow when reporting incidents of border  violence, and further updated them in 2011 to enhance coordination  between the U.S. and Mexican agencies. Moreover, interagency task  forces provide a forum for federal, state, and local law enforcement  agencies to, among other things, share information and conduct  coordinated enforcement activities to combat drug smuggling and cartel  activity. Additional details on these and other efforts are contained in  appendix VII.", "DHS developed the Operations Plan for Southwest Border Violence in  October 2008 to address the possibility that spillover crime, such as a  significant violent and spontaneous event that results in unintended  cascading effects spilling over the border, may exceed DHS\u2019s assets to  respond in those locations. This contingency plan describes the various  roles and responsibilities that DHS components are to undertake to  coordinate an agency-wide response to a variety of potential threats of  violence that could arise along the southwest border, such as credible  threats against U.S. facilities or personnel.

According to these officials, DHS components have undertaken related planning efforts, such as establishing local-level  coordination mechanisms to increase coordination and information  sharing along the southwest border. In addition, officials at DHS\u2019s Office  of Operations Coordination and Planning stated that they do not plan to  update the Operations Plan for Southwest Border Violence at this time  because DHS has shifted to a more strategic approach to planning that  will provide the framework for all of DHS\u2019s planning efforts. The officials  could not provide additional details on what the new strategic approach  would entail because it is still in the early stages of development. To  complete its framework, DHS is awaiting approval of planning guidance  that it submitted to the President in June 2012.

(3) What concerns, if any, do  these agencies have about spillover crime?

We selected January 2004 as the initial date because it provided  us with data for more than 2 years prior to December 2006, when  Mexican President Felipe Calder\u00f3n took office and began a major military  offensive against Mexican drug cartels. We also analyzed UCR\u2019s National  Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data, available from January  2007 through December 2010, for the single southwest border law  enforcement agency reporting such data\u2014the sheriff\u2019s office in Yuma  County, Arizona. To assess the reliability of the UCR data, we conducted  analyses to test for irregularities in the data, reviewed FBI documentation  on how the data can and cannot be used and on the FBI\u2019s procedures for  ensuring UCR data quality, and interviewed FBI officials knowledgeable  about the data. On the basis of this assessment, we excluded some  counties from our analysis because they did not report complete crime  data to the FBI. We concluded that the data for the remaining counties  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review. In addition, we  reviewed crime reports and documentation on crime databases published  by the FBI, state agencies, and local law enforcement agencies in the  four southwest border states. To further determine the types of data that  are systematically collected, how these data are recorded and used in  southwest border counties, and what information these data provide on  spillover crime, we reviewed guidance documents and research reports  developed by federal agencies, such as the Department of Justice (DOJ)  and Congressional Research Service. Also, we interviewed  knowledgeable officials from a total of 37 state and local agencies on the  southwest border that are responsible for investigating and tracking crime  occurring in their jurisdictions. At the state level, we conducted interviews  with officials from the California Highway Patrol and the Arizona, New  Mexico, and Texas Departments of Public Safety.  At the local level, we  interviewed officials representing 21 of 24 sheriffs\u2019 offices in southwest  border counties (4 in Arizona, 2 in California, 3 in New Mexico, and 12 in  Texas), and 12 large municipal police departments in these border  counties (4 in Arizona, 3 in California, 1 in New Mexico, and 4 in Texas).", "We selected departments from each of four states, and we selected large  departments because according to our review of the UCRSRS data, in  general, large departments had more reported crimes than did smaller  departments. A list of the 24 southwest border counties can be found in  appendix I.", "Moreover, to obtain information on spillover crime and efforts by law  enforcement agencies along the U.S.-Mexico border to combat such  crime, we conducted site visits to five southwest border counties in  Arizona and Texas. These visits were to (1) Tucson, Pima County,  Arizona; (2) Nogales, Santa Cruz County, Arizona; (3) Brownsville,  Cameron County, Texas; (4) McAllen, Hidalgo County, Texas; and (5)  Laredo, Webb County, Texas. We selected these locations because they  represent diverse rural and urban environments, as well as have a range  of border geographic features, such as rivers, mountains, agricultural  deltas, and deserts that may pose different challenges for crossing the  U.S. border from Mexico. These factors might have an effect on the levels  and types of crime occurring in southwest border communities. As part of  our visits, we met with federal officials, such as U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP) agents and officers operating between and at the ports  of entry along the southwest border, state law enforcement officials from  the Arizona Department of Public Safety, and local law enforcement  officials, such as sheriffs in Santa Cruz and Hidalgo Counties and officials  in the Tucson and Nogales Police Departments. The information we  obtained from these visits is not generalizable to all southwest border  counties. However, the information provides valuable insights into the  types of crime information that are available to law enforcement agencies  and perspectives on crime occurring in southwest border communities.", "To address the second question, we collected information, such as crime  reports and documentation on categories of data collected, from and  conducted interviews with state and local law enforcement agencies  identified above, as well as federal agencies and interagency task forces  that have responsibilities for combating drug cartel\u2013related activities  along the southwest border. Federal agencies include Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) and DOJ headquarters and field offices,  including DHS\u2019s CBP, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),  Office of Policy, Office of Operations Coordination and Planning, and  intelligence offices, such as the Office of Intelligence and Analysis; as  well as DOJ\u2019s FBI; Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); and Bureau  of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

State and local agencies include those identified  above, as well as Arizona\u2019s Alliance for Countering Transnational  Threats, the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center, and members  of the Texas Border Sheriff\u2019s Coalition. We asked agencies about their  efforts to track spillover crime, any challenges they encountered in doing  so, and whether they collected or tracked other data they considered  related to spillover crime and violence on the southwest border.  Specifically, we analyzed CBP data on the number of assaults on Border  Patrol agents in southwest border patrol sectors from fiscal years 2006  through 2012, and the number of assaults on Office of Field Operations  personnel at southwest border ports of entry for fiscal years 2011 and  2012, the date ranges for which these data were available. To assess the  reliability of the CBP data on assaults and other crimes against agents  and personnel, we reviewed relevant documentation, such as procedures  for collecting data consistently, and interviewed CBP staff responsible for  the data. On the basis of our efforts, we determined the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report.", "To address the third question, we analyzed threat assessments by federal  agencies, covering the time period from 2004 through 2012, to determine  the extent to which these agencies identified Mexican drug cartel\u2013related  threats facing southwest border communities and law enforcement agents  in those communities. Specifically, we analyzed 4 DHS Office of  Intelligence and Analysis assessments that focused on violence along the  entire southwest border covering the time period from 2006 through 2011.  In addition, we analyzed the total of 12 Border Patrol threat assessments  and Operational Requirements-Based Budgeting Process documents  containing threat information for the Laredo, Tucson, and Rio Grande  Valley sectors: 1 assessment in sample fiscal years 2004, 2007, 2009,  and 2012 per each sector to discern any trends in crime and violence  along the southwest border over time. We selected the three Border  Patrol sectors to correspond to the locations of our site visits. We  selected these particular years because they approximate release dates  of the DHS Intelligence and Analysis assessments to help identify  potential similarities or differences in trends. To obtain additional context  on potential threats facing southwest border communities, we reviewed  several other assessments, such as National Drug Intelligence Center  assessment (2011) and an Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center  assessment (2011), and other documentation, such as congressional  reports and testimonies. To obtain perspectives on a range of concerns  regarding the existence and potential effects of spillover crime, in addition  to interviews with the officials from 37 state and local law enforcement  agencies and federal officials identified above, we interviewed officials  from Chambers of Commerce in four of the five counties we visited\u2014 Cameron, Hidalgo, Santa Cruz, and Webb Counties.
