The act defined \u201cbest practices\u201d as including the prime vendor concept and other techniques the DLA Director determines will reduce inventory levels and costs and improve the responsiveness of the logistics system to user needs. The act also requires that the schedule provide for the implementation of such practices to be completed within 3 years of enactment, or by November 2000.

Through this system, DOD manages 4.3 million types of consumable items (e.g., food, clothing, and hardware), of which about 4 million are managed by DLA. Traditionally, DLA buys consumable items in large quantities, stores them in wholesale distribution depots until they are requested by the military services, and then ships them to the service facility where the items are used. Each year, DLA spends billions of dollars to provide these services. For example, in fiscal year 1997, DLA estimated that its supply costs were $12.4 billion and that its inventory on hand was valued at $9.8 billion.", "Over the last 20 years, we have reported that DOD\u2019s inventory management practices are costly, create unnecessary inventory levels, provide poor customer service, and generate excess and obsolete inventory. For these reasons, we identified DOD inventory management as a high-risk area for fraud, waste, and abuse. On past occasions, to help address these problems, we have issued several reports at your request on leading-edge business practices used by the private sector to achieve savings and improve operations. Our reports show that certain leading-edge concepts provide inventory users with a capability to order supplies as they are needed and then deliver those items directly to the customer within hours after the order is placed. Ordering supplies only as they are needed, combined with quick logistics response times, enables companies to reduce or eliminate inventory levels, buy only the items that are currently needed, and reduce overall supply system costs. Because we believe these practices have direct applicability to DOD\u2019s operations, our reports recommended that DOD test these concepts and expand them where feasible.", "DOD agrees with the need to adopt best practices and has begun to improve its business operations. In November 1997, the Secretary of Defense issued the Defense Reform Initiative report, which called for a revolution in DOD\u2019s business affairs and identified a number of reengineering initiatives aimed at adopting modern business practices to achieve world-class standards of performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Schedule Does Not Provide Sufficient Information to Assess Best Practices Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The schedule contains one or more initiatives for each of the nine supply categories listed in the act, except for commercially available electronics, which had no initiatives.

In total, the schedule contains 73 initiatives aimed at improving DLA\u2019s inventory management operations. Many of the initiatives seek to increase DLA\u2019s reliance on the private sector to purchase, store, and distribute supplies. The initiatives contain schedule milestones that generally consist of contract award dates. For some initiatives, the schedule provides additional information such as location, geographic region, or types of items covered.", "The schedule, however, does not (1) contain information on the extent to which the initiatives cover each supply category, (2) establish key performance indicators to measure the overall impact the initiatives will have on logistics costs and efficiency of operations, and (3) provide criteria and plans for expanding or fully implementing the initiatives to cover the entire supply category.

The contracting initiatives include long-term contracting, corporate contracting, and direct vendor delivery contracts. Under a long-term contract agreement, DLA agrees to purchase items from a vendor for 1 or more years. Corporate contracting initiatives involve the consolidation of a number of different DLA requirements with the same vendor into one contract. Direct vendor delivery contracts require the vendor to deliver items directly to base-level locations, bypassing the traditional DLA warehouse and distribution operations. In some cases, these concepts are combined in one initiative. For example, one initiative for aviation items is a long-term corporate contract that includes a provision for direct delivery of items to the DOD customer.", "The 15 prime vendor initiatives are designed to transfer a portion of the traditional DOD inventory management responsibilities to suppliers. Under this concept, a single vendor (known as a prime vendor) buys inventory from a variety of suppliers and stores the inventory in its warehouse. The DOD customer orders supplies from the prime vendor using electronic ordering systems, and the prime vendor then retrieves the items from its warehouse and delivers them to the customer.", "The five electronic commerce initiatives involve the use of the Internet and electronic catalogs to provide DOD customers an improved system for ordering supplies. These initiatives provide the capability for a customer to search the numerous items available in DLA\u2019s and vendors\u2019 catalogs for the item that best suits their needs. The customers can compare similar products and prices and then place their orders directly from the catalogs.", "The nine other initiatives consist of three medical and pharmaceutical, two food, and four fuels initiatives that did not fall into the three categories discussed above.

The two prime vendor programs were fully implemented between January 1993 and November 1996. Our past work found that these two initiatives were some of the most successful DLA initiatives to date. To implement these programs, DLA established a schedule to test and evaluate the prime vendor concept and a specific schedule to expand this program to other DOD locations. These milestones provided a basis to measure DLA\u2019s progress toward full implementation. According to other information, DOD\u2019s use of prime vendors at over 200 medical facilities saved over $700 million and covered 77 percent of DLA\u2019s sales of medical supplies in fiscal year 1997.", "The three electronic catalog initiatives were for dental, optical, and laboratory supplies.
