Because of numerous concerns, the Medicare Improvements for Patient and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) terminated the CBP round 1 supplier contracts and required CMS to repeat the CBP round 1, the rebid that began in 2009. In November 2009, GAO issued the report Medicare: CMS Working to Address Problems from Round 1 of the Durable Medical Equipment Competitive Bidding Program (GAO-10-27) that documented problems in CMS's implementation of CBP round 1. This statement discusses some of the problems GAO identified and how CMS has or plans to address them in the ongoing CBP rebid bidding process, particularly (1) the bid submission information provided to suppliers, (2) the electronic bid submission system, and (3) the bid disqualification notification process. For the 2009 report, GAO reviewed data provided by CMS and relevant laws and regulations, and interviewed CMS officials. For this statement, GAO also obtained select information on how CMS addressed the CBP round 1 problems identified in GAO's report by reviewing agency documents and interviewing CMS officials in August and September 2010."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the November 2009 report on CBP round 1, GAO noted that problems with the bidding process included poor timing and lack of clarity in bid submission information and the inability to inform suppliers of missing financial documentation. Several times after the CBP round 1 bid window opened, CMS provided new bidding information and clarified other bidding information. The bid window was also extended beyond the initial deadline. These changes made it more difficult for suppliers to submit correct bids. CMS improved implementation of these steps in the bidding process for the CBP round 1 rebid. For example, for the CBP round 1 rebid, CMS provided bidding information to suppliers prior to the bid window opening, including the rebid's request-for-bid instructions, which were available to potential bidding suppliers for over 2 months before the bid window opening. CMS also provided clearer financial documentation instructions and additional financial documentation tools to guide suppliers in the CBP round 1 rebid. For example, the request-for-bid instructions included a chart that more clearly explained which documents were to be submitted by the supplier's business type, for example, a sole proprietorship. CMS also conducted a financial document review during the round 1 rebid, which informed suppliers whether their bid submission was missing required financial documents. Of the 321 suppliers that were notified they had missing documentation, only 14 did not subsequently submit the missing documents. As CMS acknowledged, suppliers had difficulty entering bidding information in the bid submission system used in CBP round 1 and its user guide was not sufficiently detailed. CMS developed a new electronic bid submission system for the CBP round 1 rebid. CMS officials told us that the new system did not have significant operational issues and only a few suppliers experienced minor problems. GAO found that CMS had not effectively notified all suppliers about the opportunity for a postbidding review process in CBP round 1. To address GAO's 2009 recommendation that the agency effectively notify all suppliers of all aspects of the CBP round 1 rebid and future rounds, including any process to review disqualifications, CMS officials stated that the agency plans to notify the losing suppliers of the disqualification reasons by sending each of these suppliers a letter that will explain the process for asking questions or expressing concerns. Officials also stated that in the course of responding to suppliers' questions or concerns, if CMS determines an error was made, it is possible that the supplier may be offered a contract. In commenting on the information presented in this testimony, CMS officials stated they appreciated GAO noting the administrative improvements to the competitive bidding process the agency made for the round 1 rebid. The officials further stated that they believe that CMS made many improvements to the CBP."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Medicare competitive bidding  program for selected durable medical equipment (DME) and certain other  items. My testimony today is focused on how the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS) is addressing bidding process problems we  identified during round 1 of the competitive bidding program\u2014conducted  from 2007 to 2008\u2014in our November 2009 report, and steps CMS has  taken to address those problems for the program\u2019s round 1 rebid bidding  process, which is currently under way. Competitively determined  Medicare payments for items and services covered under the round 1 rebid  will be effective on or after January 1, 2011.", "In 2009, Medicare spent $8.1 billion on DME, other items, and related  supplies. Since 1989, Medicare has paid for most DME through fee  schedules. Medicare payment for DME is generally equal to 80 percent of  the lesser of either the supplier\u2019s actual charge or the Medicare fee  schedule for a particular item or service. Both we and the Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Inspector General have  reported that Medicare and its beneficiaries have sometimes paid higher- than-market rates for various medical equipment and supply items. These  overpayments increase costs to both Medicare and its beneficiaries. As  we have previously stated, competitive bidding can reduce Medicare  program payments by providing an incentive for suppliers to accept lower  payment amounts for items and services to retain their ability to serve  Medicare beneficiaries and potentially increase their market share.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003, required CMS to phase in a competitive bidding program (CBP) for  DME suppliers. CMS contracted with Palmetto GBA to implement the CBP  bidding and contract award process and with Maricom to develop a Web- based electronic bid submission system. CBP round 1 was conducted in  2007 and 2008 for 10 competitive bidding areas. For the bidding, CMS  chose certain DME items in 10 product categories\u2014generally high cost  and high volume items and services\u2014that were most likely to result in  Medicare savings if competitively acquired. The round 1 suppliers  submitted bids for supplying one or more of these 10 DME product  categories in 1 or more of the 10 competitive bidding areas. There were  6,374 bids submitted by 1,010 suppliers. In March 2008, CMS began  offering contracts to winning suppliers to provide DME to Medicare  beneficiaries. The contracts between CMS and suppliers became effective  on July 1, 2008.", "Round 1\u2019s bid submission and contract award processes raised concerns  about the CBP implementation. Therefore, on July 15, 2008,  implementation of the CBP round 1 was stopped\u2014after 2 weeks\u2014by the  enactment of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act  of 2008 (MIPPA), which terminated the contracts already awarded to  suppliers, delayed the program\u2019s restart, and required CMS to repeat the  competition for CBP round 1 in 2009\u2014referred to in this statement as the  CBP round 1 rebid. MIPPA also imposed additional criteria for how CMS  should conduct later CBP rounds, including the round 1 rebid and  subsequent rounds that will expand the CBP to additional areas.", "Our November 2009 report documented round 1 implementation  problems. We found, for example, that CMS did not provide suppliers with  timely and clear bid submission information, used an inadequate  electronic bid submission system, and did not have a process to inform  bidders of missing financial documentation\u201442 percent of all submitted  bids were disqualified due to incomplete financial documentation. In our  report, we recommended that if CMS decides to review suppliers\u2019  disqualified bids during the round 1 rebid and future rounds, it should  notify all suppliers of any such process, give suppliers equal opportunity  for such reviews, and clearly indicate how suppliers can request a review.", "In October 2009, CMS began the CBP round 1 rebid process. The bid  window closed in December 2009. There were 6,215 complete bids  submitted by 1,011 bidding suppliers. On July 1, 2010, CMS announced the  competitively determined DME single payment amounts, which are the  new payment amounts that Medicare will pay for each item covered under  the CBP. These payments will replace the applicable fee schedule amounts  for the selected DME items in the competitive bidding areas. Under the  round 1 rebid, CMS estimated that compared to the 2009 Medicare fee  schedule, the volume-weighted reduction in CBP\u2019s single payment  amounts for items averaged 32 percent. Under round 1, the estimated  payment reductions compared to the 2008 Medicare fee schedule averaged  26 percent. CMS also announced on July 1, 2010, that it would begin  mailing contract offers to winning suppliers. CMS officials informed us  that 1,287 bids are included in the initial wave of contract offers. CMS  officials also stated that they plan to announce the winning suppliers that  accepted contracts in September 2010.", "In my testimony today, I will discuss problems we identified in the round 1  competitive bidding process and how CMS has or plans to address the  problems in the ongoing rebid bidding process regarding (1) providing  suppliers with bid submission information, (2) use of an electronic bid  submission system, and (3) the bid disqualification notification process.", "For our 2009 report, we reviewed data provided by CMS and Palmetto  GBA; reviewed federal laws, regulations, and policies concerning the  bidding and contract award processes; reviewed documents from the CBP  round 1 bidding process, and interviewed CMS and Palmetto GBA officials  about the CBP round 1 bid process and efforts to resolve problems that  arose. For this testimony, we also obtained information on CMS responses  to problems we identified in our 2009 report by reviewing agency  documents and interviewing CMS officials. We also reviewed the available  materials provided on the CMS and Palmetto GBA CBP Web sites and  analyzed the results from the inquiries from suppliers received by the  Palmetto GBA customer service center. We shared the information in this  statement with CMS officials. Our work was performed in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards for the 2009 report  from June 2008 through September 2009 and for this testimony from  August through September 2010. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

In  comparison with CBP round 1, CMS provided CBP round 1 rebid bidding  information to suppliers earlier, and its financial documentation  instructions were clearer and suppliers were notified of missing  documentation.

For example, CMS provided new bidding information several times after  the bid window opened, such as announcing the 10 financial measures  used to evaluate the financial viability of bidding suppliers; clarified CBP  round 1\u2019s bidding information in response to supplier confusion, such as  providing additional explanatory information concerning the request-for- bid instructions; and extended the bid window deadline. These changes in  bidding information made it more difficult for suppliers to submit correct  bids. CMS and Palmetto GBA acknowledged that during CBP round 1  suppliers did not always understand the request-for-bid instructions. The  instructions were not available to suppliers until the day the bid window  opened. During the first 2 months of the bid window, while suppliers were  preparing their bid submissions, Palmetto GBA held informational bidder  conference calls on how to submit bids and maintained audio recordings  on the CBP Web site for a limited time. Questions also were not organized  by subject matter, and while the Web site had a frequently asked questions  section, it was difficult for suppliers to determine when questions had  been added.", "CMS improved its communication with suppliers about bidding  information for the CBP round 1 rebid. For example, CMS provided  suppliers with bidding information before the bidding window opened on  October 21, 2009, so that bid window extensions were not needed. Prior  to the bid window opening, the rebid\u2019s request-for-bid instructions had  been available to potential bidding suppliers for over 2 months, since  August 3, 2009, and CMS had already held seven informational bidder  conference calls. Transcripts, audio recordings, and PowerPoint  presentations from the calls were available on the Palmetto GBA CBP Web  site throughout the round 1 rebid. CMS made two minor clarifications to  the CBP round 1 rebid instructions. First, on the day the bid window  opened, CMS provided the actual bid submission deadlines, including the  covered document review date, and provided further instructions on how  a supplier needed to approve a bid in the online bidding system and   would submit the required hard copy financial documents. Second, on  November 17, 2009, CMS clarified that the financial statements for the last  operating year that suppliers were required to submit as part of their bids  could be for either calendar or fiscal years.", "For the CBP round 1 rebid, Palmetto GBA maintained suppliers\u2019 frequently  asked questions on the CBP\u2019s Web site by topic. The questions were  provided for three topics\u2014Bidding Guidelines, Bidding Process, and  Payment Policies\u2014and dated in chronological order, unlike in CBP   round 1, so suppliers could more easily determine when new ones were  posted on the Web site. The Web site also has a \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d section to  allow suppliers to find any new CBP information, for example, information  for the suppliers that were offered contracts, such as the form to request  that business locations be added or removed from their contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unclear CBP Round 1 Financial Documentation Instructions Led to Many Bid Disqualifications, but CBP Round 1 Rebid Instructions Were Clearer", "paragraphs": ["In our 2009 report, we found that financial documentation instructions  were sometimes unclear in CBP round 1. CMS acknowledged that during  CBP round 1 many suppliers had particular difficulty complying with the  financial documentation requirements and that the statement of cash  flow\u2014described as a statement of changes in financial position\u2014was the  document most often missing. We found that CMS\u2019s CBP round 1 financial  documentation instructions did not clearly address differences among  supplier business types\u2014for example, a sole proprietorship business  versus a publicly traded national corporation\u2014and among the financial  documents needed to submit a bid for each type. Because business types  could not easily be cross-referenced to the request-for-bid instructions,  suppliers were at risk of submitting incomplete or inaccurate financial  documentation. We also found that CMS\u2019s CBP round 1 request-for-bid  instructions had inconsistent information about the requirements for the  credit report and credit score submission. For example, the bid  submission form stated that a credit rating and score\u2014rather than using  the term credit report\u2014had to be submitted. Near the end of the bid  window, Palmetto GBA then issued a \u201crequired document reminder\u201d that  all bidders had to submit both a credit report and a credit score.", "For the CBP round 1 rebid, CMS clarified financial documentation  instructions by providing additional tools to guide suppliers through the  bid submission process. The request-for-bid instructions included a  chart\u2014Required Financial Documents by Business Type\u2014that more  clearly explained which documents were to be submitted by business type.  For example, the chart specified which portions of a supplier\u2019s tax return  were required based on its business type such as a sole proprietorship.", "The chart also included a credit report column that stated bidders must  submit a \u201cCredit Report with numerical score completed within 90 days of  bid submission,\u201d and the bid instructions included the same description.  To further assist suppliers to provide the correct financial documents, the  instructions included a Required Financial Documents appendix with  sample documents and more specific explanations of the income  statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flow, revenue and expense  portion of the tax return, and the credit report, along with a Checklist of  Required Hardcopy Documents for Bid Submission.", "For the CBP round 1 rebid, CMS officials told us they notified bidding  suppliers that submitted their hard copy financial documents by the  round\u2019s covered review date of any missing documents, as required by  MIPPA. Once notified, suppliers had 10 business days to submit their  missing documentation. CMS officials told us that 791 suppliers  submitted their financial documentation by the CBP round 1 rebid covered  document review date and 321 were notified that they had missing  documentation. Fourteen suppliers did not subsequently submit the  missing documents and their bids were disqualified.

CMS officials told us that  the CBP\u2019s Program Advisory and Oversight Committee (PAOC) raised  concerns that suppliers new to a competitive bidding area, new to a DME  product category, or that reported high capacity figures would not be able  to increase reported capacity in time to meet the projected demand for the  DME items in the competitive bidding areas.", "To address the concerns, CMS officials told us that the agency added a  systematic method of reviewing suppliers\u2019 capacity and expansion plans  for the CBP round 1 rebid. CMS developed a three-step method to  determine whether a supplier new to a product category or a competitive  bidding area or an experienced supplier that reported high capacity figures  would be able to increase capacity to meet the projected demand for the  DME items. The three steps were as follows:    First, CMS determined whether the total capacity of all experienced  suppliers in the competitive bidding area reporting modest growth  projections and eligible for a competitive bidding program contract offer  could meet the projected demand for items in the contract\u2019s first year. If  the capacity from these experienced suppliers was sufficient to cover the  item demand on day one of the program, then the capacity offered by any  additional suppliers with expansion plans and eligible for a contract offer  was considered surplus capacity and no further review was conducted.", "Second, if the total capacity of the experienced suppliers identified in step  one did not meet the projected demand for the first year of the contract,  then CMS reviewed the expansion plans provided by the new and high- growth or high-volume suppliers to verify their capacity to furnish the  items. The expansion plan review involved an in-depth examination of the  supplier\u2019s financial information, specifically to verify whether the supplier  had the liquid assets and available credit needed to expand capacity. If the  verified capacity from these suppliers with expansion plans was sufficient  to meet demand, CMS determined that the suppliers eligible for a CBP  contract offer had the ability to meet demand on day one of the program.", "Third, if the results of the first two steps indicated that more suppliers  were needed to meet demand on day one of the program, CMS made more  suppliers eligible for a CBP contract offer.", "As of September 10, 2010, CMS had not disclosed how many capacity  evaluations were conducted during the CBP round 1 rebid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In CBP Round 1, CMS Awarded Some Contracts to Suppliers That Were Not Yet Licensed, but CMS Provided Directories to Inform Suppliers of State Licensure Requirements in the CBP Round 1 Rebid", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, we found that some suppliers that won CBP round 1 contracts  were not yet licensed in states where they would be operating. For the  CBP round 1 rebid, CMS further clarified the state licensure requirement,  stating that suppliers must be licensed for the product category in the  competitive bidding area in which they are bidding, and if a competitive  bidding area covers more than one state, the supplier needs to obtain  applicable licensure in all states. In order to better inform suppliers about  these licensure requirements, CMS and Palmetto GBA provided licensure  state directories for the 11 states included in the CBP round 1 rebid  competitive bidding areas. The directories, which served only as guides for  suppliers, provided a list of licenses required by each state for each  product category for suppliers with a physical location in that state.  Suppliers without a physical location in the state but that would be  providing DME items and services to Medicare beneficiaries in the state  were directed to consult the appropriate state licensing agency; contact  information for those agencies was also provided.
