INL relies on contractor support to help maintain and operate its aircraft. In 2004, GAO analysis showed that INL lagged behind other agencies in implementing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and General Services Administration (GSA) aviation fleet management principles. GAO was mandated to review INL's management and oversight of this fleet. GAO specifically examined (1) the extent INL has complied with OMB and GSA aviation fleet management guidance and (2) how INL has overseen its aviation support contracts. Since INL has undertaken initiatives to address the weaknesses GAO observed, GAO makes no recommendations. GAO will follow up to ensure that these initiatives are completed, as planned. In comments on this report, State highlighted reforms under way. State also indicated that INL conducted analyses to justify most aviation investments. GAO notes, however, that the documentation provided did not reflect the key analyses called for by OMB guidance."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Despite some improvements since 2004, INL has not yet employed a systematic process for managing its aviation fleet that adheres to OMB and GSA guidance intended to help federal programs ensure that they acquire, manage, and modernize their aircraft in a cost-effective manner. However, in October 2006, INL began a number of initiatives to improve compliance with this guidance. The guidance entails three key principles: (1) assessing a program's long-term fleet requirements, (2) acquiring the most cost-effective fleet of aircraft to meet those requirements, and (3) assessing fleet performance. INL's initiatives are intended to address weaknesses in the following three areas: (1) Long-term planning. Since 2004, INL has prepared a strategic plan and a Critical Flight Safety Program to refurbish certain aircraft and replace others to meet projected mission needs. However, this effort did not address the long-term aircraft needs of all INL aviation programs. (2) Fleet investment justifications. INL has funded multimillion dollar aircraft investments, including the acquisition of new aircraft and major overhauls of older assets, without documenting cost-benefit and life cycle cost analyses of alternatives. (3) Fleet composition assessment. INL has not reviewed the composition of its entire fleet to demonstrate that its aircraft are the most appropriate and cost-effective to meet mission requirements. INL is hampered in assessing the performance of its fleet because it does not have complete and reliable aircraft cost and usage data. INL has undertaken a study to assess the aviation fleet's overall composition, identify investment needs, and assess alternative approaches for meeting those needs. INL expects completion of this and other initiatives in 2007. Regarding contract oversight, INL has met applicable federal, agency, and contract-specific requirements for managing its aviation support contracts. In addition to direct contractor oversight, State has used quantitative measures, primarily aircraft readiness rates, to monitor and assess contractor performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 2001, Congress has appropriated about $5 billion to the  Department of State\u2019s (State) Bureau of International Narcotics and Law  Enforcement Affairs (INL) for counternarcotics, counterterrorism, and law  enforcement programs. State owns an aviation fleet-\u2013primarily to help INL  carry out its counternarcotics efforts\u2014that, as of September 1, 2006,  totaled 357 aircraft. Valued by State at over $340 million, the fleet is the  second largest among U.S. government civilian agencies and includes  aircraft in the United States and seven other countries\u2014Afghanistan,  Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Pakistan, and Peru. INL has allocated  about $2.2 billion for aviation activities during fiscal years 2002 through  2006. The aircraft are property of the U.S. government, though some are  provided to countries on a no-cost lease basis. INL uses contractor  support to help operate and maintain the aircraft, which are used in a wide  variety of counternarcotics operations, from spraying herbicides on coca  and opium poppies in Colombia and transporting the Colombian Army in  support of its operations to helping to secure the border between  Afghanistan and Pakistan. When called upon, INL aircraft may also be  used to conduct medical evacuations, search and rescue missions, and  other counternarcotics-related operations. INL acquired a significant  portion of its fleet since 2000 to support the implementation of Plan  Colombia, established by the Colombian government in 1999 to reduce the  cultivation, processing, and distribution of illegal narcotics by 50 percent  over 6 years, among other goals.", "In recent years, funding for INL\u2019s aviation fleet has been provided  primarily through the Andean Counterdrug Initiative and the International  Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement appropriations. Most of the  aircraft are managed by INL\u2019s Office of Aviation (also called the Air Wing)  headquartered at Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. However, other  aircraft are managed by INL offices (often called a Narcotics Affairs  Section or NAS) in the U.S. embassy in the countries where the aircraft are  stationed.", "In 2004, we reviewed the management of Air Wing\u2019s operations and found  that the Air Wing had not implemented several key principles of fleet  management planning, as outlined in Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) and General Services Administration (GSA) guidance. This  guidance is intended to help agencies make sound decisions in acquiring  aircraft and managing their aviation fleets. At that time, our analysis  showed that INL lagged behind other federal programs we reviewed,  particularly in terms of long-term planning and justifying acquisitions.  Also, in its report on State\u2019s fiscal years 2004 and 2005 financial  statements, State\u2019s external financial auditor noted that State had  ineffective controls over its aviation fleet and cited this shortcoming as a  material weakness. More recently, State\u2019s Office of Inspector General  reported that, due to ineffective controls in tracking and reporting on its  fleet, State underreported the value of its aircraft and parts by   $162 million. In 2005, the Senate Appropriations Committee commented  that the lack of central program management and funding for INL aviation  programs has resulted in contract cost growth, poor execution, and  inadequate financial management. The committee directed the  Comptroller General to review the management and oversight of State\u2019s  aviation fleet.", "In response to this mandate, we reviewed INL\u2019s overall management of its  aviation programs. We specifically examined (1) the extent to which INL  has managed its aviation fleet in accordance with OMB and GSA guidance  and (2) how INL has overseen aviation support contracts and whether it  did so in accordance with applicable standards.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed OMB and GSA guidance and  related federal regulations for managing aircraft and other capital asset  programs, as well as applicable federal financial and contract management  regulations and guidance. We reviewed policy, program, budget, and  financial documentation and interviewed cognizant officials at INL in  Washington, D.C. We also examined applicable documentation and  interviewed INL and contract officials about fleet operations, financial  management, and contract oversight at the Air Wing\u2019s main operating base  at Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, and at various sites in Colombia. We  chose Colombia because about two-thirds of INL\u2019s active aviation fleet is  in that country and three contractors carry out aviation programs there.  See appendix I for a more detailed description of our scope and  methodology. We conducted our review from February 2006 through  January 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["INL manages its aviation fleet in a decentralized manner.

In Colombia, it also assists the Colombian Army with  counterterrorism operations. To accomplish these missions, through its  contract with DynCorp International, the Air Wing uses an active fleet of  179 aircraft, including helicopters and fixed-wing airplanes, to undertake  aerial eradication in Colombia; support manual eradication of drug crops  in Afghanistan, Bolivia, and Peru; and enhance border security between  Afghanistan and Pakistan. Operations often take place in hostile  environments, which can place aircraft and personnel under small arms  fire. These programs are managed by the Air Wing headquarters office at  Patrick Air Force Base in Florida. As the aircraft program\u2019s contractor,  DynCorp performs major maintenance and initial pilot training at Patrick  Air Force Base and flies and maintains U.S. aircraft and trains foreign  personnel at various locations in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and  Pakistan. Training for some of the spray aircraft is also conducted at  Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, a location that helps simulate the  mountainous environment of Colombia.", "In addition, the NAS offices within the U.S. embassies in Colombia,  Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru manage a total of 98 aircraft to support a  variety of host government counternarcotics efforts, with the involvement  and oversight of the INL Office of Latin American Programs. For example,  through contracts with ARINC and Lockheed Martin, the NAS in Colombia  provides aircraft to assist the (1) Colombian Air Force in interdicting  suspicious aircraft and (2) Colombian National Police in conducting aerial  eradication and interdiction operations, humanitarian missions, and other  activities. The NAS in Mexico provides both new and older model U.S.  government-owned helicopters to Mexico\u2019s Office of Attorney General for  use in counternarcotics operations, including aerial surveillance, border  security, and training. INL also funds ARINC to assist the Government of  Mexico in maintaining these aircraft.", "INL supports a wide variety of rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. Some are  excess defense aircraft that have been refurbished, while others were  purchased for use in INL programs.

The assessment  process includes specific analyses, such as an assessment of the number  of flight hours needed to meet mission requirements over a multiyear  period and the capability of existing aircraft to meet those requirements  cost effectively. The guidance recommends that, if shortfalls in the current  mix of aircraft are identified, managers should determine the optimal mix  of aircraft to meet anticipated flight hour and mission requirements and  develop a proposed fleet acquisition or replacement plan to achieve the  desired mix of aircraft. This plan could include an anticipated schedule of  time frames for disposing of inadequate aircraft and procuring  replacements.", "In 2004, we reported that Air Wing had not engaged in long-term planning  to estimate the future, long-term mission requirements and what mix of  aircraft was best suited for these requirements. Fleet planning was  primarily short-term in nature and focused on identifying aircraft to meet  current and the next year mission requirements.", "Since 2004, INL has prepared a strategic plan and a Critical Flight Safety  Program for Air Wing operations. The Air Wing\u2019s strategic plan addresses  the goals and long-term needs of its program in terms of operations,  maintenance, logistics, safety, administrative/contract support, and  information technology and communication. While the strategic plan does  not analyze the flight hours needed to meet mission requirements, it does  specify other operational requirements, including the total area of illicit  crops to be sprayed and eradicated over a number of years. The strategic  plan, completed in April 2004, also indicates the mix of aircraft assets and  personnel necessary to meet these goals. The Air Wing\u2019s Critical Flight  Safety Program specifies how the Air Wing plans to achieve the goals in its  strategic plan with the aircraft available\u2014primarily through a combination  of aircraft overhauls and aircraft acquisitions.", "However, the Air Wing strategic plan and accompanying Critical Flight  Safety Program did not address the aircraft needs of several INL aviation- related activities. For example, the strategic plan did not estimate the  operational requirements or flight hours needed to continue supporting  the Colombian Army\u2019s operations, including protection of the Ca\u00f1o Lim\u00f3n- Cove\u00f1as pipeline. Further, the Critical Flight Safety Program did not  address the long-term aircraft needs of other INL aviation-related  programs, such as assistance to the Colombian National Police or the  Colombian Air Force\u2019s Air Bridge Denial Program, or assistance to  Mexico\u2019s Office of Attorney General. These other programs represent over  a third of INL\u2019s active aviation fleet and, in some cases, aircraft are closely  related to Air Wing operations, such as the aircraft that NAS Colombia  provided to the Colombian National Police to support aerial eradication.", "According to INL officials, INL plans to conduct an aviation fleet study in  fiscal year 2007.

Such  documents should be prepared to support acquisition of new aircraft, as  well as modernization or enhancements of aircraft already in operation.  Once these analyses are completed, aviation managers should obtain  senior management approval and then acquire needed aircraft or  commercial aviation services.", "In 2004, we reported that INL used no set criteria for Air Wing aircraft  acquisitions and could not provide any A-76 cost comparison studies or  cost-benefit analyses supporting its aircraft acquisitions. According to INL  officials, the exigent circumstances of its programs precluded preparation  of cost-benefit and other detailed analyses. INL acquired a large number of  aircraft since 2000 to support Plan Colombia and other counternarcotics  and counterterrorism efforts in Colombia, including 33 UH-1N, 25 UH-II,  and 14 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters. Some of the aircraft acquired were  surplus aircraft that were made available under a relatively short time  frame; other aircraft acquisitions were congressionally directed.", "Since 2004, INL has continued to make multimillion dollar investments in  its aviation fleet, both by acquiring new aircraft or refurbishing older  aircraft it had previously acquired, without conducting the analyses  prescribed by OMB. According to officials we spoke to at OMB, the Air  Wing, NAS Colombia, and the Office of Latin America Programs, the  bureau has never prepared OMB-required justifications, as laid out in  Circulars Nos. A-76 and A-11, for any of its aircraft investments. For  example, in fiscal year 2006, the Air Wing began implementing its Critical  Flight Safety Program, expected to cost a total of $356 million over 6  years, to upgrade and overhaul the aviation fleet used for Air Wing  operations. This investment includes refurbishing several Vietnam era OV- 10 observation airplanes and UH-1N helicopters to extend their useful life  and make them more commercially supportable and procuring new UH-60  and UH-II helicopters. However, the documentation Air Wing provided us  did not include cost-benefit analyses of alternatives or a calculation of life  cycle costs for each element of the program. Similarly, in 2004, INL began  acquiring 12 new Schweizer SAC 333 helicopters to support Mexico\u2019s  Office of Attorney General\u2019s antinarcotics efforts, at a cost of about   $15 million, without conducting the analyses called for in OMB Circular  Nos. A-76 and A-11 to justify the acquisitions.", "According to OMB and GSA officials we consulted, without the analyses  called for in OMB guidance, State cannot be reasonably certain whether  the aircraft procurements and refurbishments reflected in their budgets  are the most appropriate and economical alternatives. In particular, we  found little evidence that important cost and operational considerations  were formally taken into account when INL decided to refurbish OV-10  spray aircraft. A NAS Colombia official indicated that this was not an  appropriate investment for Colombia because, among other reasons, the  Colombian government does not have the capacity to maintain these  aircraft after U.S. support for the aerial eradication program ends. The  NAS, therefore, decided to purchase new and commercially available AT- 802 crop dusting aircraft to conduct aerial eradication in Colombia.  Representatives of DynCorp International, the contractor responsible for  maintaining both aircraft, argued that the AT-802 was more practical and  cost-effective to maintain than the OV-10. Air Wing officials considered the  OV-10 refurbishment to be more appropriate because it kept in service an  aircraft with important safety characteristics, including a dual engine  configuration and ejection seats. A formal analysis of alternatives,  including a calculation of life cycle costs, could have weighed these  considerations on a more objective basis.", "INL has recently taken steps to justify its aircraft investment decisions  better. As directed by an appropriations conference committee, INL  prepared an analysis of alternatives for the procurement of new spray  aircraft to support its aerial eradication program in Colombia. In August  2006, we shared our observations with INL about the lack of supporting  analysis for it aircraft investments. In October 2006, INL tasked a private  consulting firm with conducting analyses in accordance with OMB  Circulars Nos. A-11 and A-76 to justify an aircraft acquisition intended to  replace leased transport aircraft to support counternarcotics activities in  Afghanistan. In addition, as part of its 2007 fleet study, INL has tasked the  same consulting firm to prepare a capital asset plan and business case, in  accordance with OMB Circular No. A-11, that would identify and analyze  alternatives for filling INL\u2019s aircraft needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "INL Had Not Established Acquisition Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["OMB Circular No. A-126 requires agencies to issue internal directives and  policies for acquiring and managing aircraft.

The contract establishes  standards for several functional areas across which performance is  measured, including maintenance, logistics, operations, safety, and  training. Within these areas, State and DynCorp track 84 specific  performance metrics (such as hectares of illicit crop eradicated,  percentage of total aviation fleet available, and host nation training hours  performed) to help assess DynCorp\u2019s performance.", "In order to manage the oversight of these performance categories, State  and DynCorp use an online tracking system and database; however, this  system has limitations. The performance categories in this system, called  SeeSOR, correspond to the 84 metrics specified in the contract. The  SeeSOR system provides a quality assurance checklist for each activity  and an inspection schedule, regularly prompting State and DynCorp  managers to enter performance information. In the case of poor ratings,  the system automatically produces corrective action reports, and DynCorp  managers track these corrective actions by time and inspector. Each  corrective action issue requires a response within a specified time frame.  However, INL and DynCorp officials in Colombia told us that SeeSOR is  not a comprehensive quality assurance or contract management tool  because it does not include certain activities that DynCorp performs. For  example, force protection, which DynCorp does in Colombia, is not  incorporated into the system. Also, computer network difficulties make  regular data entry from remote locations in the field problematic. Between  November 2005 and September 2006, DynCorp conducted over 400 audits  of information in the system and found 104 issues requiring corrective  action. State and DynCorp are still fine tuning the system to improve its  ability to measure contractor performance in an environment such as  Colombia.", "Consequently, State and DynCorp use means other than the SeeSOR  system, such as personal contact, to help oversee contractor performance.  According to INL officials in Colombia, personal contact between INL and  DynCorp is the most valuable monitoring tool. INL and DynCorp personnel  talk and exchange e-mails throughout the day to identify issues that need  attention. In addition, State program managers conduct daily \u201cwalk  through\u201d inspections of facilities in Bogot\u00e1 and make unannounced site  visits to forward operating locations. The DynCorp manager in Colombia  also relies on daily oral communication with contractor staff outside of  Bogot\u00e1 to stay aware of issues in the field. Further, DynCorp provides a  detailed briefing to INL every week, which addresses performance across  all functional areas of the contract. All advisers and managers are  expected to attend, and minutes are kept of these meetings. Also, State  conducts monthly reviews of aircraft and eradication reports and formally  evaluates DynCorp\u2019s performance every 4 months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lockheed Martin", "paragraphs": ["State and Lockheed Martin began a 4-year contract in July 2006 that  implements a performance-based method for assessing contractor  performance. In the contract, Lockheed Martin and its subcontractor  work closely with the Colombian National Police to support its illicit drug  eradication and interdiction and humanitarian missions, with  responsibility for aircraft maintenance, logistics, police training, and  multiple construction projects at bases across Colombia. Under the  contract, the government task leader must hold regular status meetings,  and Lockheed Martin is required to submit monthly performance reports  containing, among other things, accomplishments and issues that arose  during the reporting period, projected future activities, and subcontractor  performance relative to agreed upon metrics. Lockheed Martin also must  implement and maintain a quality assurance system to ensure that product  and service integrity meet or exceed contract requirements. In addition,  the contract specifies specific performance standards in program  management, quality control, safety, aircraft maintenance, logistics,  support maintenance, training, and information technology. For example,  one maintenance standard specifies that the contractor sustain a 75  percent aircraft operational readiness rate.", "In Colombia, we observed that State maintained regular contact with the  contractor and the Colombian National Police to assess compliance with  contract requirements. State\u2019s oversight measures included monitoring  performance in functional areas, such as maintenance, logistics, training,  and safety. While the program manager stated that the principal  performance metric was aircraft readiness rates, State received and  reviewed daily and monthly status reports, memos, and trip reports, and  participated in a quarterly program management review covering the  functional areas above. State attends weekly maintenance meetings  between Lockheed and the Colombian Police. In addition, the contractor  also performed random site visits and fuel inspections, reporting the  findings to the NAS program manager. The NAS uses standards from the  U.S. Army Aviation Management System to produce and issue standard  operating procedures in most functional areas.", "However, the planned nationalization of this program and its heavy  involvement with and dependence on the Colombian National Police has  presented challenges to implementing an effective performance-based  contract. Personnel problems within the police force have adversely  affected the contractor\u2019s ability to meet nationalization or its aircraft  readiness rate goals. For instance, the contractor reported absentee rates  among police trainees in the logistics branch as high as 25 percent.  Further, over half of Colombian helicopter mechanics were not  sufficiently skilled to perform more than routine maintenance tasks and,  therefore, required more contractor supervision than planned. The  contractor also has little influence over personnel decisions within the  police force. The Colombian police frequently rotate their trainees to  different positions, which hampers the development of specialized skills  and the ability of the contractor to pass on responsibility and nationalize  the program. For example, the contractor logistics office reported working  with seven different Colombian officers in 4 years. In another case, a  police trainee attended a specialized and lengthy course for engine oil  analysis in the United States, only to be transferred out of maintenance  shortly after returning to Colombia. Program managers have corrected  some of these training issues and now track the training Colombian police  personnel receive to help ensure that only committed and appropriately  skilled trainees receive detailed instruction.", "Under the ARINC contract, which began in June 2004 and could extend to  4 years, State has established a performance-based system to monitor  contractor performance. Our review focused on State\u2019s assessment of  ARINC\u2019s contract performance in support of the Air Bridge Denial  Program. The objective of this program is to suppress the illicit aerial  trafficking of narcotics in Colombian airspace by tracking and forcing  down suspected traffickers. ARINC is responsible for, among other things,  maintaining seven aircraft and training Colombians to maintain these  aircraft. Reporting requirements include monthly performance reports  containing, among other things, accomplishments and issues that arose  during the reporting period, projected future activities, and performance  relative to the agreed upon metrics. In addition, the contract specifies  performance standards in operations, logistics, training, and project  management, among others.", "We found that State was in compliance with contractor oversight  requirements and that, in many cases, ARINC exceeded its reporting  requirements in the contract. State is in daily personal contact with the Air  Bridge Denial Program manager. Although the program manager told us  that he did not have the quality assurance plan required by the contract,  we found that ARINC\u2019s reporting to State included many of the quality  assurance plan requirements, such as training standards and reviews. The  NAS program manager also received and reviewed flight activity reports  on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. In addition, the program manager  participated in regular meetings to discuss the status of aircraft, training,  and operations, and conducted a semiannual review, as well as an annual  program certification.

In October 2006, INL officials  began initiating significant changes to the oversight of aviation fleet  operations, placing particular emphasis on conducting key analyses of its  fleet to help guide future investment decisions and adhere to OMB and  GSA guidance. If INL follows through, these analyses should result in a  long-term plan for aircraft investments and an assessment of the current  composition of the fleet to help ensure that it is the most cost-effective to  meet mission requirements. Current plans call for these to be completed in  2007.

We chose to focus our review primarily on operations in Colombia  because nearly two-thirds of INL\u2019s active aviation fleet is in that country,  and three contractors carry out programs there. We obtained information  on the number and distribution of aircraft from INL officials and  determined that this information was sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of this report.", "To assess how INL conducted strategic planning to identify long-term  aircraft needs, we obtained and reviewed planning documents prepared by  the bureau, including Bureau Performance Plans, the Air Wing Strategic  Planning Summary, and the documentation of the Critical Flight Safety  Program.

We reviewed INL financial management handbooks as  well as automated systems\u2019 documents. We identified and evaluated key  internal controls INL uses to ensure the completeness and accuracy of  recorded appropriated funds and the status of those funds. We assessed  INL\u2019s reconciliation procedures with requirements found in the  Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.

We acknowledge INL\u2019s efforts to address the shortcomings that GAO  and others have identified in its management of its aviation fleet  throughout the draft report and this final version. However, we note  that we began our review efforts with a formal notification to the  Secretary of State in January 2006 and met with INL and other State  officials to discuss our objectives in February 2006. At the time, INL  did not inform us of any ongoing or planned efforts to evaluate its  Office of Aviation Programs or INL\u2019s overall aviation fleet. In August  2006, we briefed INL on our preliminary findings that it had not  complied with OMB and GSA guidance in managing its aviation fleet.  The September briefing that INL presented to us addressed the issues  we had raised and laid out the reforms it would begin in October. As a  result, we concluded that recommendations for further actions were  not necessary, but that we would follow up at a later date to ensure  that INL\u2019s initiatives are completed, as planned.  2.  We do not report that INL did not conduct any analyses. Rather, we  noted in the draft report and this final version that documentation INL  provided us did not reflect the key analyses called for by OMB  guidance.  3.  In the draft report and this final version, we report that INL officials  told us that the exigent circumstances of INL\u2019s operations precluded  them from doing the detailed OMB analyses. We also noted that, in  some cases, Congress directed what aircraft to procure. Nevertheless,  once the aircraft are in the inventory, OMB guidance requires agencies  to review periodically the need for and the cost-effectiveness of the  aircraft. INL has not done this, but we noted in the draft report and this  final version that it has efforts under way to meet this requirement.  4.  In the draft report, we noted that INL\u2019s aviation operations in  Colombia often take place in hostile environments, which can place  aircraft and personnel under small arms fire. We have modified the  final report to note that aviation operations in other foreign locations  often take place in hostile environments, too.  5.  In the draft report and this final version, we point out that INL\u2019s Local  Financial Management System does not provide the standard program  cost elements needed to meet OMB requirements. We also note that  State officials responsible for designing the Global Financial  Management System were not aware of INL\u2019s cost data requirements  and are not sure the system can provide the data needed. Regarding  the Air Wing Inventory System referred to, we reported in 2004 that the  data in this system were significantly understated. We agree that, if the  system\u2019s shortcomings are corrected, it is an appropriate tool to  address GSA\u2019s reporting requirements.  6.  We agree that consolidating INL\u2019s aviation fleet under a senior aviation  management official is one way to address some of the shortcomings  GAO, State\u2019s Office of the Inspector General, and INL\u2019s internal studies  have identified. However, INL has not defined the senior aviation  management official\u2019s authority, roles, and responsibilities.
