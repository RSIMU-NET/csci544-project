To ensure punishment of traffickers and protection of victims, Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), which is subject to reauthorization in 2007. The Departments of Justice (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) lead federal investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes. As requested, this report discusses (1) key activities federal agencies have undertaken to combat human trafficking crimes, (2) federal efforts to coordinate investigations and prosecutions of these crimes, and (3) how the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) supported federally funded state and local human trafficking task forces. GAO reviewed strategies, reports, and other agency documents; analyzed trafficking data; and interviewed agency officials and task force members."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since the enactment of the TVPA in 2000, federal agencies have (1) investigated allegations of trafficking crimes, leading to 139 prosecutions;(2) provided training and implemented state and local initiatives to support investigations and prosecutions; and (3) established organizational structures, agency-level goals, plans, or strategies. For example, agencies have trained new and current personnel on investigating and prosecuting trafficking in persons crimes through their agency training academies and centers, provided Web-based training, and developed and disseminated guidance on case pursuance. Agencies have also sponsored outreach and training to state and local law enforcement, nongovernmental organizations, and the general public through a toll-free complaint line, newsletters, national conferences, and model legislation. Finally, some agencies have established special units or plans for carrying out their antitrafficking duties. Federal agencies have coordinated across agencies on investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes on a case-by-case basis, determined by individual case needs, and established relationships among law enforcement officials across agencies. For example, several federal agencies worked together to resolve a landmark trafficking case involving over 250 victims. However, DOJ and DHS officials have identified the need to advance and expand U.S. efforts to combat trafficking through more collaborative and proactive strategies to identify trafficking victims. Prior GAO work on interagency collaboration has shown that a strategic framework that includes, among other things, a common outcome, mutually reinforcing strategies, and compatible polices and procedures to operate across agency boundaries can help enhance and sustain collaboration among federal agencies dealing with issues that are national in scope and cross agency jurisdictions. To support U.S. efforts to investigate trafficking in persons, BJA has awarded grants of up to $450,000 to establish 42 state and local human trafficking law enforcement task forces. BJA has funded the development of a train-the-trainer curriculum and a national conference on human trafficking and taken further steps to respond to task force technical assistance needs. Nevertheless, task force members from the seven task forces we contacted and DOJ officials identified continued and additional assistance needs. BJA does not have a technical assistance plan for its human trafficking task force grant program. Prior GAO work has shown the need for agencies that administer grants or funding to state and local entities to implement a plan to focus technical assistance on areas of greatest need. BJA officials said they were preparing a plan to provide additional and proactive technical assistance to the task forces, but as of June 2007 had not received the necessary approvals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Human trafficking is a transnational crime whose victims include men,  women, and children and may involve violations of labor, immigration,  antislavery, and other criminal laws. Victims of trafficking are bought,  sold, sometimes transported across national boundaries, and forced to  work in legal or illegal situations, including the sex industry, sweatshops,  domestic service, and agriculture, among others. What usually  distinguishes trafficking from crimes such as alien smuggling or other  labor law violations is the trafficker\u2019s use of force, fraud, or coercion to  compel these victims into, or hold them in, the employment situation.  Despite international acknowledgment of the trafficking problem as a  human rights violation, estimates of the number of victims remain  questionable because of methodological weaknesses, gaps in data, and  numerical discrepancies. Since the mid-1990s, the United States has  played a leading role in putting trafficking in persons on the international  community\u2019s agenda and pursued trafficking crimes within the United  States. By 2000, various U.S. policymakers had determined that existing  U.S. statutes scattered enforcement authority across the government and  did not adequately protect trafficking victims, deter trafficking, and bring  traffickers to justice.", "As a result, in October 2000, Congress passed the Trafficking Victims  Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA) to ensure just and effective punishment of  traffickers and protection of victims. Among other things, the TVPA made  it illegal to obtain or maintain persons for commercial sexual activity,  using force, fraud, or coercion for those 18 or over (but proof of force,  fraud, or coercion is not required for those under 18), and to use certain  kinds of force or coercion to provide or obtain persons for any labor or  services (e.g., work in farms, factories, and households). The act also  updated and supplemented existing involuntary servitude statutes used to  prosecute trafficking crimes, enhanced the penalties for trafficking crimes,  and provided a range of new protections and assistance for victims of  trafficking. Congress reauthorized the act in 2003 and 2005, and it is  subject to reauthorization in 2007.", "Nevertheless, pursuing trafficking in persons crimes continues to present  special challenges to federal investigators and prosecutors. Since the  primary eyewitness to and evidence of the crime is typically the trafficking  victim, the first step in pursuing these crimes is usually to identify victims.  Yet these victims are often hidden from view, employed in legal or illegal  enterprises, do not view themselves as victims, or are considered to be  criminals or accessories to crimes (e.g., prostitutes or smuggled aliens)  subject to incarceration or deportation. A nongovernmental organization,  average citizens, or even state and local law enforcement working in the  community may be the first point of contact for a trafficking victim, rather  than federal law enforcement.", "Moreover, trafficking in persons cases are difficult to pursue because they  are multifaceted, complex, and resource intensive. Federal agencies have  to determine whether those identified as potential victims have in fact  been trafficked and then secure their cooperation in order to pursue the  investigation and prosecution of the traffickers. Victims may be reluctant  to testify because of trauma, fear, loyalty to the trafficker, or distrust of  law enforcement. Moreover, a single case may involve one or hundreds of  victims, requiring housing, food, and other services from federal agencies;  diverse offenses, such as violent crime, labor exploitation, sex crimes,  alien smuggling, organized crime, and financial crimes; and collection of  significant evidence from overseas.", "Accordingly, investigating and prosecuting trafficking crimes requires  collaboration among multiple components of the Departments of Justice  (DOJ) and Homeland Security (DHS) with responsibilities for investigating  and prosecuting trafficking crimes. Identifying trafficking and victims can  also involve collaboration between DOJ and DHS agencies and  components of the Departments of Labor (DOL) and State (DOS) that may  uncover information relevant to the pursuit of trafficking crimes in the  course of carrying out their missions. Collaboration is also needed  between federal agencies and state and local law enforcement and  nongovernmental organizations. Recognizing the need to leverage these  resources to identify victims and support federal efforts to pursue  traffickers, DOJ\u2019s Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), working with the  Office for Victims of Crime (OVC), implemented a competitive grant  program in 2004 to fund human trafficking law enforcement task forces  composed of state and local law enforcement agencies, field offices of  federal agencies, and victim and social service organizations with the  support of the local U.S. Attorney. As of fiscal year 2006, BJA had funded  42 task forces across the country.", "As requested, to ascertain the status of U.S. efforts to investigate and  prosecute trafficking crimes, this report discusses (1) key activities federal  agencies have undertaken to combat trafficking in persons crimes, (2)  federal efforts to coordinate investigations and prosecutions of trafficking  in persons crimes and whether these efforts might be enhanced, and (3)  how BJA supported federally funded state and local human trafficking  task forces and whether these efforts might be improved. This review is  part of a larger body of work we have conducted on U.S. efforts to combat  trafficking in persons, here and abroad. A companion report that examines  U.S. and multilateral efforts to combat human trafficking overseas was  also issued today.", "To determine key activities federal agencies have undertaken to combat  trafficking in persons crimes, we reviewed agency reports describing these  activities and strategies and memorandums applicable to federal efforts to  address these crimes. We interviewed officials from DOJ, including the  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Civil Rights Division/Criminal  Section (CRT/CS), Criminal Division/Child Exploitation and Obscenity  Section (CEOS), and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys; DHS U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services (CIS); DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Division; DOS\u2019s Bureau  of Diplomatic Security and Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in  Persons; and the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC). From  the FBI, ICE, CRT/CS, and CEOS, we obtained and analyzed relevant data  on the cases investigated and prosecuted, including numbers of cases,  defendants charged, and convictions, as well as, where possible, estimates  of the resources used to do so. We discussed the sources of these data  with federal agency officials to determine that these data were sufficiently  reliable to show trends in agencies\u2019 activities undertaken to investigate  and prosecute trafficking crimes.", "To determine what efforts federal agencies have undertaken to coordinate  investigations and prosecutions of trafficking in persons crimes and  whether these efforts might be enhanced, we reviewed pertinent  documents, such as agency reports, strategies, and memorandums to field  offices, which described or directed agency and interagency coordination  on trafficking activities. We interviewed officials from DOJ headquarters,  including FBI, CRT/CS, CEOS, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys;  ICE and CIS; DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Division; DOS\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic  Security and Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons; and  HSTC. We also interviewed field personnel from FBI, ICE, DOL, and  selected U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices. In addition, we used relevant GAO reports  on enhancing interagency collaboration as criteria.", "To assess how BJA has supported federally funded state and local human  trafficking task forces and whether these efforts might be improved, we  analyzed relevant documents and grant reports from BJA, including grant  solicitations, performance reports, and Web site information; met with  BJA, OVC, and CRT/CS officials to discuss the documents and technical  assistance to the task forces; made site visits to three task forces; and  conducted telephone interviews with key participants from four other task  forces. The task forces contacted were judgmentally selected based on the  length of time funded (fiscal year 2004); different levels of success, based  on BJA performance measures (e.g., number of identified potential  trafficking victims); and focus (e.g., trafficking for labor, sex, or both). We  interviewed key task force participants (e.g., Assistant U.S. Attorneys,  local and federal law enforcement, and representatives of  nongovernmental organizations) from the seven task forces. Although this  approach does not allow for generalizing, it provided additional  information on steps federal agencies took to support state and local  human trafficking task forces. In addition, we reviewed relevant GAO  reports on federal agencies\u2019 administration of grants or funding to state  and local entities.", "We conducted our work from June 2006 through June 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I  presents more details about the scope and methodology of our work."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Congress passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to combat  trafficking in persons. As the centerpiece for U.S. antitrafficking efforts,  the TVPA advanced a three-pronged victim-centered approach\u2014 prevention of trafficking, protection and assistance for victims of  trafficking, and prosecution and punishment of traffickers. Among its  provisions, the TVPA addressed identified gaps in existing law and  enhanced the tools available to pursue these crimes. Specifically, the act  criminalized the obtaining or maintaining of persons for commercial  sexual activity, using force, fraud, or coercion for those 18 or over (but not  for those under 18), and to use certain kinds of force or coercion to  provide or obtain persons for any labor or services (e.g., work in farms,  factories, and households). It also included nonviolent coercion and  threats of harm to third persons in federal involuntary servitude laws;  made attempted trafficking crimes punishable; criminalized the holding of  actual or purported identity documents in the course of committing, or  with the intent to commit, any trafficking crime; and increased the  maximum penalty for slavery and involuntary servitude offenses from 10  to 20 years or to a life sentence if the offense involved factors like death,  kidnapping, or aggravated sexual abuse. In addition, the TVPA required  restitution for victims of trafficking and forfeiture of traffickers\u2019 assets and  provided legal status and special benefits to aliens certified as trafficking  victims in the United States who are willing to assist law enforcement  efforts against traffickers. (App. II identifies specific statutory provisions  relevant to investigating and prosecuting trafficking in persons crimes.)", "Responsibilities for pursuing trafficking crimes fall to multiple federal  agencies, including the FBI and ICE, which investigate these crimes;  CRT/CS, CEOS, and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices, which prosecute traffickers;  and other agencies within DHS and DOJ and components of DOL and DOS  that support U.S. efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking in  persons. Figure 1 depicts these key agencies and their respective  responsibilities related to the investigation and prosecution of trafficking  in persons crimes.", "In addition, to coordinate the implementation of the TVPA, the act  directed the President to establish an Interagency Task Force to Monitor  and Combat Trafficking in Persons and authorized the Secretary of State  to create the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons to  provide assistance to the task force. In February 2002, the President issued  an executive order creating this cabinet-level task force and then in  December issued National Security Presidential Directive 22, which  identified trafficking in persons as an important national security issue  and directed federal agencies to strengthen their collective efforts,  capabilities, and coordination to support the goal of abolishing human  trafficking. Subsequently, the 2003 TVPA reauthorization statutorily  established the Senior Policy Operating Group (SPOG) to address  interagency policy, program, and planning issues regarding the TVPA\u2019s  implementation. In addition, HSTC, which is staffed by detailees from  DHS, DOJ, DOS, and the intelligence community, among other places,  collects and disseminates intelligence information to build a  comprehensive picture of human trafficking.", "Pursuing trafficking investigations and prosecutions also needs the  support of state and local law enforcement, who may be in the best  position to find trafficking victims because of their familiarity with their  respective jurisdictions, and nongovernmental organizations, from whom  victims may more readily seek assistance. To leverage these resources to  support federal efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons,  DOJ designed, developed, and instituted a task force approach that it  presented during the first National Training Conference on Human  Trafficking: Rescuing Women and Children from Slavery, held in Tampa,  Florida, in July 2004. DOJ invited 21 teams of 20 federal, state, and local  law enforcement and nongovernmental service providers from  communities that it believed to have potential trafficking problems to  attend the conference. After the conference, the teams were expected to  work together on human trafficking in their respective communities. To  implement the approach, BJA, the DOJ component responsible for  supporting local, state, and tribal efforts to achieve safer communities,  developed and implemented a human trafficking law enforcement task  force competitive grant program. These grants were to be awarded to state  or local police agencies that work with the local U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office,  federal law enforcement entities, and nongovernmental organizations that  may come into contact with victims of trafficking. In addition, in spring  2003, the FBI\u2019s Crimes Against Children Unit, DOJ\u2019s Child Exploitation and  Obscenity Section, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children launched the Innocence Lost National Initiative in 14 U.S. cities  where the FBI field offices had identified a high incidence of trafficking of  U.S. children for commercial sex.", "As trafficking in persons is a transnational crime, federal agencies may  need to obtain information and assistance directly from individual foreign  governments and through international law enforcement organizations in  order to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons cases in the  United States. Multilateral and extradition treaties provide the authority  for U.S. investigative and prosecutorial agencies to request information  and assistance on criminal cases, including trafficking in persons, from  approximately 175 individual foreign governments. Working through ICE  and FBI personnel stationed at U.S. embassies, U.S. investigative and  prosecutorial agencies have obtained a broad spectrum of assistance from  individual foreign governments and with such assistance have successfully  prosecuted traffickers. This assistance has included obtaining  documentary evidence and corroborating witness testimony, protecting  U.S. trafficking victims\u2019 family members in a foreign country,  apprehending fugitive traffickers, and extraditing defendants. In addition,  U.S. agencies may obtain information through the International Criminal  Police Organization, Interpol, which serves as a conduit for a cooperative  exchange of information on criminal activities from its 186 member  countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Undertaken Key Activities to Combat Trafficking in Persons Crimes", "paragraphs": ["Subsequent to the enactment of the TVPA, federal agencies reported 139  prosecutions and hundreds of investigations of trafficking for  commercial sex or labor as of June 2007.

Trafficking crimes and their  victims are hidden and not readily identifiable. Traffickers may be charged  or convicted of other than trafficking crimes (e.g., kidnapping,  immigration violations, or money laundering) for strategic or technical  reasons. Also, limitations of agency data systems, which are primarily case  management systems, may not allow for the extraction of trafficking data  per se. In addition, availability of individual agencies\u2019 data may be limited  by factors pertinent to that agency; for example, ICE was only established  in 2003. Moreover, agency data are not comparable across agencies nor  can data on investigations be linked to data on prosecutions. As a result of  these limitations, however, the actual number of investigations and  prosecutions that have led to the incapacitation of traffickers may be  greater than the numbers that have been reported by federal agencies.", "CRT/CS reported 139 prosecutions from fiscal year 2001 to June 14, 2007,  as compared with 19 cases for fiscal years 1995 to 2000. These cases  included 39 defined by CRT/CS as labor trafficking and 100 as trafficking  for commercial sexual activity. According to CRT/CS officials, the number  of prosecutions varies in any given year, because of differences in the  complexity of the cases. (See app. IV for illustrations of the complexity of  cases.). FBI and ICE provided data on numbers of trafficking cases  opened. The FBI\u2019s Civil Rights Unit reported opening a total of 751  trafficking in persons cases between fiscal year 2001 and April 5, 2007.  However, these data do not include investigations involving trafficking  that are classified as other types of crime, for example, alien smuggling  cases that also involve trafficking in persons. ICE reported opening a total  of 899 trafficking in persons cases, for fiscal year 2005 through May 31,  2007. Both FBI and ICE data may include cases involving investigations  handled jointly by the two agencies. In addition, as part of the Innocence  Lost National Initiative, the FBI\u2019s Crimes Against Children Unit reported  327 cases opened on trafficking of U.S. children for commercial sex  between fiscal year 2004 and June 5, 2007.

This seminar is given multiple times each  year.", "In addition, to help identify victims of trafficking and support federal  efforts to pursue trafficking investigations, agencies have used a variety of  means to extend outreach and training to state and local law enforcement,  nongovernmental organizations, and the general public. ICE developed  laminated wallet-size cards, in five languages, identifying the differences  between human smuggling and human trafficking as well as red flag  indicators for human trafficking and also developed a police roll  call/muster DVD describing human trafficking. CRT/CS publishes a  newsletter on trafficking, available on the DOJ Web site, and in  collaboration with other federal agencies and DOJ components, prepared  and published the Report on Activities to Combat Trafficking: Fiscal  Years 2001-2005. DOJ\u2019s Office of Legal Policy prepares the Attorney  General\u2019s annual report to Congress on U.S. efforts to combat trafficking,  as required by the TVPA of 2003, and the annual assessment of those  efforts. DOJ also established, and subsequently permanently funded, a toll- free Trafficking in Persons and Worker Exploitation Complaint Line in  February 2000 to provide a means for victims, witnesses, and others to  report potential trafficking matters to law enforcement, get information,  and obtain referrals to services in their area. In 2004 and 2006, federal  agencies sponsored and participated in national conferences on human  trafficking in Tampa, Florida, and New Orleans, Louisiana, respectively.  In 2006, CRT/CS, with the Attorney General, produced the film Give Us  Freedom: Liberty and Justice for Victims of Modern Day Slavery.", "To further U.S. investigations and prosecutions of trafficking in persons  crimes, federal agencies have also fostered antitrafficking efforts at the  state and local levels. For example, federal agencies have sought to engage  state and local law enforcement and nongovernmental organizations by  funding the establishment of state and local trafficking in persons task  forces that bring together local law enforcement, federal law enforcement,  a U.S. Attorney, and nongovernmental victim service providers. In  addition, to expand antitrafficking law enforcement authority and promote  a uniform national legal strategy to combat human trafficking, DOJ  developed a model state law, available on the DOJ Web site. According to  DOJ, at the time of its initial dissemination in 2004, 4 states\u2014Texas,  Florida, Missouri, and Washington\u2014had laws against trafficking in  persons.

In doing so, each of  these agencies has defined its responsibilities for pursuing trafficking  crimes in accordance with its broader agency mission.", "Both ICE and CRT/CS have established specialized units focused on  trafficking in persons.

On January 31, 2007, the Attorney General and the  Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division announced the  formation of a special Human Trafficking Prosecution (HTP) Unit within  CRT/CS. According to CRT/CS officials, the unit is to continue to play a  role in coordinating intra-DOJ and interagency trafficking efforts (e.g.,  with ICE); develop new strategies to increase human trafficking  investigations and prosecutions throughout the nation; enhance DOJ\u2019s  investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes by pursuing cases  that are multijurisdictional or involve financial crimes; and also continue  to engage in training, technical assistance, and outreach initiatives to  federal, state, and local law enforcement and nongovernmental  organizations.", "The primary investigative agencies for trafficking in persons have laid out  goals and activities for combating this crime. The top goal of ICE\u2019s  trafficking in persons efforts\u2014to disrupt and dismantle criminal  organizations involved in trafficking, including intelligence gathering on  these organizations\u2014is aligned with DHS strategic goals of assessing  vulnerabilities and mitigating threats to the homeland. In addition, ICE\u2019s  trafficking goals of seizing assets of criminal organizations and rescuing  and protecting victims of trafficking follow ICE\u2019s top goal. The FBI\u2019s  Strategic Plan 2004-2009 identifies investigations of trafficking in persons  crimes as a rising priority under its responsibility to enforce civil rights  protections.

ICE  TIPS emphasizes outreach and education on ICE\u2019s role in trafficking  investigations and ability to issue Continued Presence, a mechanism for  authorizing victims without legal immigration status to remain in the  United States; collaborations with other law enforcement entities and  nongovernmental service providers, including task force participation; and  performance evaluation to focus and refine ICE\u2019s efforts. In May 2007,  additional guidance from the ICE Office of Investigations and the ICE  Office of International Affairs was sent to SACs and ICE personnel  assigned to U.S. embassies overseas.

Coordination of investigations and prosecutions has  usually occurred as determined by the needs of the individual cases and  personal relationships established between law enforcement officials  across agencies. However, DOJ and DHS officials acknowledged the need  to expand the scope of their efforts to investigate and prosecute  trafficking crimes by, for example, undertaking proactive measures to  identify trafficking victims and multijurisdictional and international  trafficking in persons investigations and prosecutions. Pursuing such  efforts requires more strategic collaboration among agencies, since no one  agency can carry out these efforts alone. Our prior work has shown that a  strategic framework that would include, at a minimum, a common  outcome and mutually reinforcing strategies; agreed-on roles and  responsibilities; and compatible polices, procedures, and other means to  operate across agency boundaries can help agencies enhance and expand  collaboration on issues that are national in scope and cross agency  jurisdictions. However, the mechanisms that are currently in place to  facilitate interagency cooperation on human trafficking do not address the  greater collaboration needed for the expanded level of effort to investigate  and prosecute trafficking crimes. Establishing such a strategic framework  to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons crimes, as developed by  federal agencies to address the unique challenges posed by these crimes,  could help federal agencies enhance and sustain the collaboration needed  to expand their efforts to combat trafficking crimes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Coordinated Trafficking Efforts on a Case-by-Case Basis", "paragraphs": ["According to DOJ and DHS officials, in practice, agency coordination of  investigations and prosecutions of trafficking in persons has occurred on a  case-by-case basis. CRT/CS, CEOS, ICE, and FBI officials acknowledged  that investigating and prosecuting trafficking in persons crimes made it  necessary for federal agencies to work with one another and with state  and local law enforcement, who were often the first ones to discover  possible evidence of trafficking, and with nongovernmental organizations  that provided assistance to the victims. Federal officials emphasized that  they knew whom to call; for example, the victim-witness coordinators in  ICE and CRT/CS know each other; ICE and FBI investigators knew the  names of prosecutors in CRT/CS.", "ICE and FBI officials explained that they sometimes worked joint  investigations or investigated different aspects of a case. For example, in  one case, while ICE agents rescued the victims in one location, the FBI  was investigating related brothel operations in other cities. Through their  detailees to the HSTC, ICE and FBI may determine whether the two  agencies may be working on a related case. Agents in the field may also  contact their counterparts at other agencies to ascertain whether they are  working on a similar case. DOL Wage and Hour Division officials told us  that if they identified a potential trafficking situation, they would notify  the FBI and the respective U.S. Attorney and the FBI might take over  responsibility for the case, as DOL\u2019s Wage and Hour Division does not  carry out criminal investigations related to trafficking in persons. In  addition, victim witness coordinators across DOJ and DHS are in regular  contact with each other to ensure victim care and services from the point  of victim identification through investigation and prosecution.", "Investigative and prosecutorial agencies also work with nongovernmental  agencies. For example, ICE officials said that they shared information with  nongovernmental organization interviewers who helped the investigators  determine which potential trafficking victims were actual victims and  which were \u201cvictim enforcers\u201d who were swept up in the raid but worked  for the traffickers. CRT/CS and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices prosecute the cases  developed by the investigative agencies. In addition, under the auspices of  the Innocence Lost National Initiative, FBI investigators from its Crimes  Against Children Unit, the National Center for Missing and Exploited  Children, and CEOS prosecutors have joined forces with state and local  law enforcement through the establishment of formal or ad hoc task  forces in 23 cities across the country, as a grassroots operation to work on  cases of trafficking of U.S. children for commercial sex.", "Two noteworthy trafficking cases illustrate the breadth and diversity of  coordination and cooperation that occurs in pursuit of these crimes. For  example, the prosecution of Kil Soo Lee brought together FBI  investigators, DOL investigators from the Wage and Hour Division and the  Occupational and Safety and Health Administration, CRT/CS prosecutors,  and some nongovernmental organizations and resulted in the largest  trafficking case brought to date. In a separate case, Gerardo Flores  Carreto and Josue Flores Carreto were each sentenced to 50 years in  prison in a case involving coordination among ICE, DOJ, international  nongovernmental organizations, as well as the Mexican government. (See  app. IV.)", "In addition to interacting as needs emerge, officials told us that various  law enforcement procedures and protocols are in place to foster  coordination. Upon initiating a trafficking in persons investigation, ICE  and the FBI notify the local U.S. Attorney to determine if enough evidence  exists to pursue a federal trafficking in persons prosecution. Moreover,  U.S. Attorneys are required to report civil rights cases, including  trafficking in persons cases, to CRT/CS, which then determines whether to  accept the U.S. Attorney\u2019s staffing recommendation. In addition, DHS,  DOJ, and the Department of Health and Human Services signed a  memorandum of understanding that lays out the basic responsibilities and  functions of the departments as they relate to the certification of victims\u2019  eligibility for certain federal benefits.", "Federal agencies have also developed tools to facilitate interagency  coordination and even coordination with state and local law enforcement  and nongovernmental organizations in trafficking cases, usually on a case- by-case basis.

DOJ and DHS senior officials identified the need to  expand the scope of efforts, including taking proactive measures to  identify trafficking victims (e.g., expanding outreach to additional law  enforcement agencies and nongovernmental organizations) and pursuing  multijurisdictional and international trafficking in persons investigations  and prosecutions. These efforts require more strategic collaboration  among agencies, since no one agency has the authority to carry out these  efforts alone. However, the current coordinating mechanisms and National  Security Presidential Directive 22 do not address the greater collaboration  needed for this level of expanded effort, and individual agency plans only  address individual agency efforts\u2014none of which is linked to a common  governmentwide outcome to address the investigation and prosecution of  trafficking crimes. Additionally, differing perceptions among agencies  exist on leadership and roles and responsibilities surrounding some of  these expanded efforts.", "As our previous work has shown, a strategic framework that includes  agencies working together toward a common outcome with mutually  reinforcing strategies, agreed-on roles and responsibilities, and compatible  policies and procedures can help enhance and sustain collaboration  among federal agencies dealing with issues, such as trafficking in persons,  that are national in scope and cross agency jurisdictions. In light of the  unique challenges posed by trafficking in persons investigations and  prosecutions, we acknowledge that a framework to address the  investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes needs to be flexible  and incorporate different types of collaborative mechanisms. The agencies  involved would determine the specifics of the elements enumerated above,  any additional elements to be included in the framework, and the  structures for developing and implementing such a framework."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies Identified Need for Expanded Approaches", "paragraphs": ["DOJ and DHS officials acknowledged the need to expand the scope of U.S.  efforts to combat trafficking crimes by developing proactive approaches to  identify trafficking victims (e.g., expanding outreach to non-law  enforcement agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and other law  enforcement agencies), pursuing multijurisdictional and even international  trafficking in persons investigations and prosecutions, and establishing  mechanisms for consistent communications and information sharing  among agencies.", "Because trafficking victims are hidden and difficult to find, but are also the  primary source of evidence of trafficking crimes, agency officials  underscored the need to develop proactive approaches to identify  trafficking victims in order to increase investigations and prosecutions.  While current efforts to pursue trafficking crimes have drawn on the  support of other federal agencies that do not have specific law  enforcement functions or have benefited from the collaboration between  law enforcement and nongovernmental organizations, officials expressed  the desire to expand these efforts. For example, CRT/CS officials told us  that they would like to prosecute more labor trafficking cases, but these  situations were difficult to identify. While CRT/CS has worked with DOL\u2019s  Wage and Hour Division on trafficking cases, such as the Kil Soo Lee  prosecution, they hoped to work with DOL to proactively identify potential  trafficking situations, possibly during Wage and Hour\u2019s self-initiated  investigations of low-wage work sites. However, DOL officials said that to  do so, the agencies would need to develop an approach that included  regional planning and further training of DOL\u2019s program managers.  This  level of collaboration and planning could benefit from mutually reinforcing  strategies or a joint strategy to identify additional victims of labor  trafficking.", "In addition, the main goal of ICE\u2019s outreach efforts to state and local law  enforcement, nongovernmental organizations, and foreign partners is  identifying victims. While there are several jurisdictions across the country  that are currently combating trafficking crimes in their communities, DOJ  and DHS officials recognized the need to expand their outreach and  training efforts to other law enforcement and non-law enforcement  entities to identify victims and increase the number of investigations and  prosecutions.  Currently, coordination among agencies on training and  outreach is largely episodic. However, developing collaborative outreach  and training strategies to incorporate state and local law enforcement,  nongovernmental organizations, and foreign partners, among others, could  allow agencies to expand their efforts while making the best use of  agencies\u2019 resources.", "DOJ officials also told us that they hoped to expand federal antitrafficking  efforts by pursuing multijurisdictional and international investigations and  prosecutions. For example, CRT/CS officials told us that they were striving  to enhance investigations and prosecutions of significant trafficking in  persons and slavery cases, such as multijurisdictional cases and those  involving financial crimes. To do so, CRT/CS has engaged in training  activities for federal prosecutors across the country to institutionalize  ways to combat trafficking and allow CRT/CS attorneys to focus on  multijurisdictional cases. However, CRT/CS has also been actively  involved in the training of investigators, task forces, and foreign officials,  as well as carrying out their responsibilities to prosecute trafficking cases.  Folding CRT/CS\u2019s training and outreach efforts into a broader and more  collaborative training and outreach strategy could disperse responsibility  for training to other federal partners who are also engaging in training and  outreach efforts.", "The DOJ officials identified the need to establish mechanisms for  consistent communication and information sharing. While FBI officials  said that case-by-case coordination between some field offices on  individual trafficking cases was good, they said that there was also a lack  of consistency in information sharing and communication among field  offices. DOJ officials also cited the need to maintain information in a  central repository to enhance tracking of the movements of traffickers and  victims. For example, CEOS identified the lack of such a repository of  information on trafficking and an institutionalized policy on information  sharing as factors that can inhibit trafficking investigations. Working  collaboratively with counterparts in the field and across agencies at the  national level to establish mechanisms for consistent communication and  information sharing could be incorporated into a strategic framework.   Additionally, FBI and ICE officials pointed to the need to pursue  information about trafficking organizations back to their country of origin  and identify trafficking patterns in order to enhance efforts to dismantle  trafficking organizations. However, HSTC officials told us that the  intelligence community is not collecting as much information on  trafficking as it is on other issues, such as human smuggling. HSTC  officials also said that if HSTC could increase its analytical capability, it  would be able to expand its current collection and dissemination of  intelligence information on trafficking to develop more products and in so  doing provide a more valuable resource to law enforcement and the  intelligence community, among others. CRT/CS officials told us they are  working with the FBI to obtain information that would help identify  trafficking networks. With intelligence information from traditional  intelligence sources being limited, agencies could work toward achieving  their goal of tracking trafficking patterns and dismantling trafficking  organizations by establishing collaborative practices to obtain needed  information to support proactive investigations of trafficking crimes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expanded Approaches Can Be Linked to a Common Outcome with Mutually Reinforcing Strategies", "paragraphs": ["A strategic framework could promote a collaborative effort to define and  articulate a common federal outcome for investigations and prosecutions  of trafficking crimes. Agencies have identified agency-level goals and  proactive approaches to expand their current efforts to combat trafficking  crimes, but none of these approaches is linked to a governmentwide  outcome defined by the key federal agencies that investigate and  prosecute trafficking crimes.  Our previous work on effective interagency  collaboration has demonstrated that having a clearly defined  governmentwide outcome could help align specific goals across agencies.", "While National Security Presidential Directive 22 instructed federal  agencies to develop and promulgate plans to implement the directive,  agencies primarily developed lists of activities that indicated individual  agency efforts, and the plans, taken together, did not cut across agency  boundaries and lead toward a common governmentwide outcome. As we  have illustrated in our work related to national strategies to combat  terrorism, a governmentwide outcome could hinge on an ideal \u201cend-state\u201d  followed by a logical hierarchy of major goals, subordinate objectives, and  specific activities to achieve results. Gathering intelligence on traffickers,  dismantling trafficking rings, increasing prosecutions, and rescuing  victims can be activities linked to broader objectives to achieve a common  outcome for investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes, but at  this time, agencies have not collectively articulated what that outcome  might be. The scope of U.S. governmentwide efforts to investigate and  prosecute trafficking crimes can be linked to a common outcome to  provide an accountability framework.", "Our prior work has shown that without a clearly defined outcome, it may  be difficult to overcome significant differences in agency missions,  cultures, and established ways of doing business. For example, pursuing  trafficking investigations and prosecutions involves collaboration between  law enforcement and nongovernmental organizations that typically do not  work together. Identifying a unified federal outcome for investigations and  prosecutions of trafficking crimes could help align the goals and sustain  the support of these agencies and organizations, thereby enhancing  investigations and prosecutions.", "Our work has shown that after identifying a common outcome,  collaborating agencies need to establish strategies that work in concert  with those of their partners or are joint in nature. Such strategies help in  aligning the partner agencies\u2019 activities, core processes, and resources to  accomplish the common outcome. Some individual agencies have  developed their own strategies to combat trafficking and implement the  proactive approaches to expand current activities, but strategies have not  been linked to a common governmentwide outcome for investigations and  prosecutions of trafficking crimes. Since no single agency is undertaking  these initiatives alone, mutually reinforcing strategies could help agencies  better align their activities and resources to accomplish a common  outcome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Roles and Responsibilities Can Be Clearly Defined through a Strategic Framework", "paragraphs": ["As federal agencies expand their approaches to investigating and  prosecuting trafficking crimes, a strategic framework could assist in  clarifying respective roles and responsibilities.

Nonetheless, existing interagency collaborative mechanisms are not  positioned to support the greater collaboration needed to coordinate  expanded U.S. efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons.  The Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking, the  SPOG, and SPOG working groups facilitate governmentwide policy on  human trafficking.  However, operational coordination on investigations  and prosecutions of trafficking in persons rests with criminal justice  personnel and currently occurs on a case-by-case basis. HSTC is an  information clearinghouse and facilitates information sharing among  investigative and prosecutorial agencies working on trafficking. HSTC is  also available to assist agencies to avoid duplication of efforts by querying  an array of participating agency databases to determine if more than one  agency has an ongoing interest or open investigation on a specific target.  The Trafficking in Persons and Worker Exploitation Task Force was  involved in both policy and operations, but at the time of our review, DOL  told us it understood that the task force was no longer functioning, and  CRT/CS officials said they were in the process of reinvigorating DOJ\u2019s  relationship with DOL on this issue.", "Furthermore, developing a strategic framework could help reconcile  differing perceptions of who is in charge in coordinating antitrafficking  investigations and prosecutions. Specifically, CRT/CS and investigative  agencies perceived the interagency leadership role in pursuing trafficking  crimes differently. CRT/CS officials told us that its newly formed Human  Trafficking Prosecution Unit was positioned to take the leadership role in  coordinating trafficking efforts across the federal agencies because  investigative agencies historically work with CRT/CS prosecutors to  complete cases. While FBI officials acknowledged CRT/CS as the leader  on trafficking in persons, they also said that leadership needs to cut across  agencies, since no one agency carries out trafficking cases alone. ICE  officials said that agencies are all equal partners in the effort to combat  trafficking and that while CRT/CS may take the lead on prosecutions, the  investigative agencies each take the lead on their own investigations, or  work jointly on joint investigations, until they are handed to prosecutors.  ICE officials also did not perceive the need for leadership beyond the  SPOG for U.S. policy on trafficking, but acknowledged that the SPOG did  not have oversight for investigations and prosecutions because of law  enforcement sensitive matters. ICE officials suggested that should a  problem with investigations and prosecutions arise, the SPOG could  create a subcommittee to deal with these issues.  However, according to  DOJ officials, because investigative and prosecutorial agencies are  governed at the operational level by confidentiality rules (e.g., grand jury  secrecy) and limitations on sharing law enforcement sensitive information,  the SPOG or its working groups were not appropriate vehicles for leading  collaborative operational efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking in  persons.

According to BJA officials, technical assistance  is available to human trafficking task forces, but BJA did not receive any  specific funds to support its technical assistance to the human trafficking  law enforcement task forces. BJA reported using $1,433,000 of its general  funds to finance the development of a train-the-trainer curriculum on  human trafficking, deliver training sessions using the curriculum, and fund  the national conference on human trafficking held in New Orleans in  October 2006.", "The train-the-trainer curriculum, prepared by the Institute for  Intergovernmental Research to promote law enforcement awareness of  human trafficking in the United States, was completed in October 2004.

They  acknowledged that there would always be a need for basic training on  trafficking issues, as new task forces were formed, existing task forces  reached out to new participants, and individuals participating in the task  forces changed over time. In addition, to enhance the capacity of the task  forces to support investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes,  they identified the need for advanced training on such topics as seizing  and forfeiting traffickers\u2019 assets, techniques to facilitate law enforcement  and nongovernmental organizations working together to interview  trafficking victims, and techniques for interviewing child victims of sex  trafficking. To expand their ability to identify more trafficking victims,  DOJ officials and some task forces we contacted pointed to the need for  training of other agency personnel, such as other law enforcement,  hospital workers, and social services personnel, who in the course of their  jobs might come into contact with trafficking victims. They also indicated  that it was sometimes necessary to tailor training and technical assistance  to specific populations. For example, training could be focused on  potentially vulnerable populations within the community where a task  force was located (e.g., farm labor, restaurant workers, domestic service  workers, alien victims, and U.S. children trafficked for commercial sex) or  trafficking populations that have typically been more difficult to find,  specifically victims of labor trafficking.", "By requiring each task force grantee to lay out a strategy to raise public  awareness of trafficking, identify more victims, and establish protocols  among government agencies and service providers, BJA demonstrated its  awareness of the need for the task forces to have a mechanism to  coordinate activities and operations in order to achieve program goals.  Task force members we interviewed provided examples of the challenges  they had confronted in addressing the various elements of their task force  strategy. For example, some task force members said that after 2 years of  BJA funding they were still trying to iron out protocols covering roles and  responsibilities; experiencing tensions among key players on the task  force, including nongovernmental organizations; or relying on informal  contacts based on who knew whom or pre-established relationships  among task force members (e.g., local law enforcement and FBI) rather  than on positions or protocols. Members from one task force we  interviewed even held different opinions regarding its protocols. The task  force leader attributed the task force\u2019s success to its informal protocols.  By contrast, another task force member told us that the protocols, which  had not been developed in consultation with task force members, were  merely guidelines and led to victims falling through the cracks because of  the lack of standard services. Examples of types of possible technical  assistance needs suggested by the task forces we contacted included (1)  ways to improve communication and sharing information/intelligence  between and among entities, including e-mail lists, a secure Web site, and  training bulletins; (2) standardized protocols that outline roles and  responsibilities of each member agency, which the task forces can adapt  for their own jurisdictions; (3) help in strategizing; (4) regional and  national meetings that bring smaller groups of task forces together; (5)  interpreters/cultural assistance; and (6) safe and secure housing for  victims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Assistance Plan Could Enhance BJA\u2019s Support to Human Trafficking Task Forces", "paragraphs": ["BJA does not have a technical assistance plan for its human trafficking  grant program.

DOJ and DHS officials emphasized the  importance of the task forces to the overall U.S. effort to investigate and  prosecute trafficking in persons. Working within communities, task force  members are usually best situated to identify trafficking victims and  crimes. Representatives of some of the task forces we contacted were not  aware of BJA\u2019s capacity to respond to technical assistance needs.

BJA reported that it collated  and analyzed the performance data it received, would make routine calls  to the particular task force to help resolve the performance issues, or  obtain additional information to assist a task force in addressing a  problem. However, systematically assessing task force reports on BJA  performance measures could help BJA to identify common problem areas  in collecting and reporting performance data.

This information could be used to determine common and  emerging technical assistance or training needs, approaches for meeting  those needs, and how best to provide that assistance. As part of its plan,  BJA could also develop other means and mechanisms for providing  technical assistance to the task forces effectively and efficiently. For  example, as suggested by some of the task force members we contacted, a  secure Web site could provide a means for task forces to share best  practices, readily obtain samples of protocols or other documents, or ask  for peer-to-peer assistance from other task forces. BJA could also use the  Web site to disseminate information to the task forces.", "BJA\u2019s plan might also include a component for assessing the quality of its  technical assistance. To ensure that the technical assistance and training  provided to the task forces meet their needs, BJA might request  information from the task forces on technical assistance and training  provided to them, including evaluations of that assistance. Such  information could help BJA demonstrate what it has done to support the  task forces and the effectiveness of those efforts in meeting task force  needs. This information could also be used to ascertain necessary  modifications of or changes to technical assistance to better meet task  force needs.", "To facilitate BJA\u2019s technical assistance to the task forces, the plan might  identify available technical assistance and training resources from a  variety of sources.

While such training  and technical assistance are currently provided on a case-by-case basis,  within the context of a plan, BJA could more systematically galvanize  these resources, incorporate them into its overall approach to meeting the  task forces\u2019 needs, and assess their impact on task force efforts.  Information on task force training needs could also be used to help BJA,  working with other federal agencies, to plan the content and format of the  legislatively mandated 2007 and 2008 national trafficking conferences so  that it meets the range of training and technical assistance needs for  experienced task forces as well as new task forces."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have made strides in several areas to combat trafficking  crimes and to coordinate their efforts on a case-by-case basis. This  approach has generally led to an increase in the number of investigations  and prosecutions since the passage of the TVPA in 2000.  However, as  agencies look ahead to broadening their efforts while still maintaining  coordination on individual cases, strategic planning will be necessary to  ensure agency resources are being expended with the greatest return on  investment. Defining a common governmentwide outcome for  investigations and prosecutions of trafficking crimes, reconciling roles and  responsibilities, and ensuring consistent communication and information  sharing are vital to the investigation and prosecution of trafficking crimes.  Yet no such outcome has been collaboratively defined by the agencies,  perceptions of leadership differ among agencies, and policies are not in  place to ensure consistent communication and information sharing.  Furthermore, to sustain a coordinated victim-centered approach to  combating trafficking, agencies must continue to educate and engage their  own personnel, as well as supporting partners in the effort to combat this  crime, such as state and local law enforcement, nongovernmental  organizations, non-law enforcement agencies, and citizens. As our prior  work on multi-agency collaboration has shown, a strategic framework that  includes elements such as defining a common outcome, establishing  mutually reinforcing or joint strategies, and agreeing on roles and  responsibilities, among others, is particularly useful in addressing  problems that are national in scope and involve multiple agencies with  varying jurisdictions. Such an approach allows for the necessary flexibility  and incorporation of different types of collaborative mechanisms to  address the complexities of and unique challenges posed by such  problems. Working in a more strategic fashion, agencies could build on  their current cooperative relationships to establish a strategic focal point,  ensure consistency of communication and partnerships, and sustain and  expand a coordinated effort to investigate and prosecute trafficking in  persons crimes.", "BJA\u2019s competitive grant program has funded state and local law  enforcement human trafficking task forces to support U.S. efforts to  identify trafficking victims and investigate and prosecute trafficking  crimes. Given its mission to support state and local law enforcement, BJA  has provided some training and technical assistance to the human  trafficking task forces, sometimes through coordinated efforts with other  agencies. However, the task forces we interviewed identified challenges  they faced in implementing BJA\u2019s strategic planning requirements and  carrying out their responsibilities, especially in identifying potential  victims and establishing partnerships with key players. Our previous work  on federal agencies\u2019 administration of grants or funding to state and local  entities shows the importance of implementing a technical assistance plan  that focuses the training and technical assistance efforts by agencies that  administer grant funding. In the absence of such a plan, BJA may find it  difficult to target technical assistance to the task forces most in need and  ensure that task forces receive the technical assistance needed to meet the  strategic planning requirements and performance measures outlined in the  human trafficking task force grant solicitation. Implementing such a plan  will help BJA focus its efforts, enabling BJA to better ensure that its efforts  meet the needs of the task forces, achieve the objectives of the program,  enhance collaboration across levels of government and between  government and nongovernmental entities, and ultimately support U.S.  efforts to investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that the U.S. government maximizes its ability to enforce  laws governing trafficking in persons, we recommend that the Attorney  General and the Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the  Secretaries of Labor, State, and other agency heads deemed appropriate,  develop and implement a strategic framework to coordinate U.S. efforts to  investigate and prosecute trafficking in persons.

In response to the report\u2019s discussion of interagency  coordination and strategizing, DHS noted that ICE regularly conducted  strategic planning with its partners, particularly in the field; worked with  federally funded state and local trafficking task forces; and contributed to  annual trafficking reports prepared by DOJ. Moreover, DHS maintained  that interagency coordination through the SPOG ensured that trafficking  policies and guidelines were carried out, and therefore ICE believed that a  governmentwide framework or strategy was not needed.", "Our report acknowledged that the SPOG and its working groups help to  facilitate coordination of governmentwide policy on human trafficking.

For  example, DHS noted that mutual goal setting might be possible so long as  the goals contained objectives that specifically addressed unique agency  capabilities in combating trafficking. DHS also noted that any framework  would also need to recognize that agencies\u2019 roles in a particular case  would vary by available resources, local priorities, and the nature of the  case and investigation. Agency resources for policy efforts and initiating  any recommendations that arose from the framework would also be  critical.

We obtained examples of training materials used to train  investigative agents and to conduct outreach and attended the national  human trafficking conference in New Orleans in October 2006. From the  FBI, ICE, CRT/CS, and CEOS, we obtained and analyzed relevant data on  the cases investigated and prosecuted, including numbers of cases,  defendants charged, and convictions, as well as, where possible, estimates  of the resources used to do so. We discussed the sources of these data  with federal agency officials to determine that these data were sufficiently  reliable to show trends in agencies\u2019 activities undertaken to investigate  and prosecute trafficking crimes. We did not seek data prior to the passage  of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000 for investigative agencies  since the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security  transferred some human trafficking investigative duties from DOJ\u2019s legacy  Immigration and Naturalization Service to DHS\u2019s Immigration and  Customs Enforcement.", "To determine what efforts federal agencies have undertaken to coordinate  investigations and prosecutions of trafficking in persons crimes and  whether these efforts might be enhanced, we reviewed pertinent  documents, such as agency reports, strategies, and memorandums to field  offices.

From this group, we tried to  include task forces located in various U.S. geographic regions, and with a  primary focus on either sex trafficking, labor trafficking, or both sex and  labor. To ensure that we included task forces of varying performance  levels, we asked officials from BJA and CRT/CS for recommendations on  task forces that were performing well. In addition to these  recommendations, we also used BJA performance measures such as  number of victims found and the number of continued presence visas  provided to make our selections. As a part of our site visits or through  telephone interviews, we interviewed the task force leader, the Assistant  U.S. Attorney (who may or may not the leader), the primary local law  enforcement contact, the dominant nongovernmental organization  participant, and FBI and ICE representatives on the task force. BJA was  not able to provide us with a list of task force participants, but a  nongovernmental organization, Polaris Project, affiliated with the  Washington, D.C., human trafficking task force, had networked with all the  BJA-funded task forces at the federally sponsored human trafficking  conference in New Orleans in October 2006, and provided us with a list  identifying the \u201ckey players.\u201d From this list, we developed our list of  interviewees based on our inclusion criteria.

However, various U.S. policymakers determined that  existing U.S. statutes did not take into account some characteristics of  contemporary trafficking in persons and, therefore, did not adequately  protect trafficking victims, deter trafficking, and bring traffickers to  justice. These statutes did not always treat trafficked persons as victims.  Involuntary servitude was restricted to cases of physical abuse\u2014force,  threats of force, or threats of legal coercion, as opposed to the  psychological coercion often used by today\u2019s traffickers. While the  modern concept of trafficking in persons focused on compelled service,  under the Mann Act trafficking was perceived as interstate transportation  for prostitution. Moreover, these statutes scattered enforcement authority  across the government and resulted in different case outcomes, depending  on the charges brought or which agency learned of the allegations of  abuse.", "The TVPA addressed limitations in existing law that made it difficult to  prosecute traffickers, as well as adding new crimes and enhancing the  penalties.

Because trafficking in persons is a hidden crime and  victims are hesitant to come forward, it is difficult to estimate the extent  of trafficking in persons crimes. Moreover, because prosecutors may  charge traffickers with other crimes (e.g., kidnapping, the Mann Act,  immigration violations, or money laundering) for strategic or tactical  reasons, data on the number of trafficking in persons investigations and  prosecutions do not provide a complete picture of the number of  traffickers who have been thwarted. The data systems agencies use are  primarily case management systems, which may not be able to extract  trafficking data if trafficking was not listed as a charge.

The workers believed the fees to be legitimate  payment in exchange for new jobs possibly leading to a better life. Instead,  they lived, ate, and slept in barracks on the factory compound, surrounded  by fences that remained locked and guarded during working hours. Lee  and his associates seized passports\u2014threatening the workers with  deportation, bankruptcy, severe financial hardship to family members  back home, and false arrest\u2014and withheld food and pay.", "In March 1999, workers asked to be paid for several months\u2019 labor. Kil Soo  Lee refused to pay them, and when the workers protested, he locked them  inside of the Daewoosa compound and refused to provide them with food.  Several workers climbed over the fence at night and contacted local  residents to complain and seek food. Upon finding out that workers had  left the compound, Kil Soo Lee notified the American Samoan police that  the workers were causing a disturbance and had the police arrest three of  the female workers who tried to leave the company grounds. The workers  were unable to speak English or Samoan, and thus were unable to  communicate the true version of events to the police. Attempting to  communicate with the outside world, another worker threw a handwritten  note from the window of the company car after visiting jailed coworkers.  This note was found and passed on to the U.S. Department of Labor,  which investigated allegations that Kil Soo Lee had withheld the workers\u2019  pay. Because of the investigation, DOL required Lee to make restitution to  the affected employees. Following additional complaints and allegations  that Lee was requiring workers to kick back the back wage payments, DOL  again investigated.

The  Occupational Safety and Health Administration of DOL then arrived to  conduct inspections of the Daewoosa facility from November to February  2001, citing violations of workplace safety noted from earlier  investigations concluded in June 1999. In March 2001, FBI agents and  CRT/CS prosecutors traveled to American Samoa to investigate. They  conducted interviews, surveyed the factory, and seized records,  computers, and other evidence. Kil Soo Lee was then arrested on March  23, 2001. He and four other defendants were indicted in August of that year  on 22 charges of subjecting workers to involuntary servitude. The trial  began in October 2002 and lasted 4 months.", "During prosecution, the nature of the crime and the cultural and linguistic  backgrounds of the workers posed challenges for the Civil Rights Division.  Attorneys had to prove that the workers\u2014now witnesses in the trial\u2014 were victims rather than simply violators of labor and immigration laws.  Lee had already had some of them deported, while others scattered to 20  states around the country after being given temporary immigration status  to testify. During the pretrial preparations and the trial, more than 200  victims had to be housed and fed, while the sick and injured required  medical care. Because the victims had limited or no English facility  (languages spoken included Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Samoan),  interpreters had to be provided. Agents and attorneys also had to gain the  victims\u2019 trust, overcoming their fears of law enforcement and authority,  which Kil Soo Lee and the other defendants had earlier exploited. Finally,  the victims needed to be assured that no harm would come from the  proceedings either to them or their families back home and that they had  done nothing to draw shame or fear of exposure upon themselves.", "In August 2001, two of the American Samoan guards entered guilty pleas  to participating in the conspiracy to violate the civil rights of the garment  workers and were later sentenced to 70 and 51 months in prison. Two  codefendants were acquitted on all charges. In February 2002, Kil Soo Lee  was convicted of conspiracy to violate the civil rights of the workers, 11  counts of involuntary servitude, 1 count of extortion, and 1 count of  money laundering. Lee, who was in his mid-50s, was sentenced in June  2005 to 40 years in prison, which at that time was the highest sentence  handed down in a trafficking/slavery case that did not result in death, and  ordered to pay restitution of $1,826,087.94.", "On April 16, 2002, the High Court of American Samoa in a separate  consolidated civil case also ordered Daewoosa Samoa, Ltd. to pay $3.5  million in back wages to the workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "United States v. Carreto", "paragraphs": ["The Carreto case came to the U.S. government\u2019s attention on a tip from  Mexican authorities that a victim was believed to have been held and  forced into prostitution. An investigation led agents to locations where a  number of young women and their traffickers were arrested. The  defendants were members or associates of an extended family whose  principal business was reaping the profits from compelling young Mexican  women into prostitution through force, fraud, and coercion. The  defendants, who often lured the women into romantic relationships, used  deception, psychological manipulation, and false promises, along with  physical beatings and rapes, to overcome the will of the victims, compel  them into prostitution, and force them to turn over virtually all the  proceeds to the defendants.", "During the investigation of this case, ICE and DOJ coordinated with  international nongovernmental organizations, the Mexican government,  and Mexican attorneys to remove the victims\u2019 children from the custody of  the Carreto family, thereby removing one of the last means of control the  Carreto family had exerted over the victims. The investigation revealed  extensive sex trafficking activity between Mexico and the United States,  prompting initiatives to coordinate multijurisdictional, multi-agency  investigations.", "On November 16, 2004, a federal grand jury returned a 27-count  superseding indictment charging Josue Flores Carreto, Gerardo Flores  Carreto, Daniel Perez Alonso, Eliu Carreto Fernandez, Consuelo Carreto  Valencia, and Maria de los Angeles Velasquez Reyes with victimizing nine  young Mexican women. The indictment charged the six defendants with  counts of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking, sex trafficking, attempted  sex trafficking, forced labor, violation of the Mann Act, conspiracy to  import aliens for immoral purpose, and alien smuggling. Two additional  defendants, Edith Mosquera de Flores and Eloy Carreto Reyes were  charged separately by complaint.", "On April 5, 2005, on the morning trial in this case was to begin, Gerardo  Flores Carreto, Josue Flores Carreto, and Daniel Perez Alonso pled guilty  to all charges in the 27-count indictment. On April 27, 2006, Gerardo Flores  Carreto and Josue Flores Carreto were each sentenced to 50 years in  prison. Daniel Perez Alonso was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Edith  Flores had previously been sentenced to 16 months. On June 1, 2006, Eliu  Carreto Fernandez was sentenced to 80 months in prison. Eloy Carreto  Reyes is still pending sentencing.", "On January 19, 2007, the Mexican government extradited defendant  Consuelo Carreto Valencia to the United States, along with 14 other  criminal defendants, in an extradition that Attorney General Gonzales  lauded as unprecedented in its scope and importance. Consuelo Carreto  Valencia, the mother of two of the lead defendants, is charged with  conspiring with the other defendants to compel the victims into forced  prostitution. An additional defendant, Maria de los Angeles Reyes, remains  in Mexico, where she has previously been arrested on related charges.
