Among the topics examined in this second report, GAO reviewed: (1) federal rules or regulations relating to OLA and the resolution of financial institutions, including living wills; and (2) status of efforts to improve coordination on international resolutions, data collection efforts, and the outcomes of financial institutions that were in the bankruptcy process.", "To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agencies\u0092 draft and final rules related to OLA and comment letters submitted.

Regulators continue to address a number of issues related to FDIC\u0092s new authority, including how creditors will ensure that they receive no less than they would under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation; how certain assets and liabilities would be treated in a new company created by FDIC under OLA; and what role the Securities Investor Protection Corporation would play in the resolution of a broker-dealer under OLA. Regulatory officials reported that they were continuing to draft rules to clarify how OLA would be used. FDIC and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve) also have issued final rules requiring certain financial companies to file resolution plans or \u0093living wills\u0094 that must detail how companies would resolve their operations through an orderly bankruptcy. Regulators told GAO that the plans also would help FDIC plan for the exercise of its resolution authority, including OLA.

This additional information could help regulators in resolving internationally active financial companies. Data to identify financial institutions filing for bankruptcy protection as well as their outcomes are limited. Since neither FDIC nor federal judicial agencies have a database that tracks financial companies in bankruptcy, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) and the Federal Judicial Center have begun a new effort to track financial company bankruptcies, but reported court data are untested for this purpose. Several large financial institution bankruptcies are still in progress. Two of the largest financial company bankruptcies, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Lehman Brothers) and Washington Mutual, Inc.\u0097both of which filed in September 2008\u0097recently had their reorganization plans confirmed by creditors and approved by the courts. However, these cases are not yet fully resolved. In the Lehman Brothers case, international litigation could take several years to resolve. The October 2011 bankruptcy of MF Global Holdings Ltd., a holding company with a securities and commodities broker, has raised concerns about how commodity customers are treated under a liquidation regime and also involves international litigation over customer property.

FDIC as receiver has authority to enforce contracts guaranteed  by the financial company even though the counterparty has the  contractual right to terminate or accelerate the contract based on the  insolvency of the financial company. FDIC must transfer the guarantee  and all related assets to a bridge financial company or third party or  provide adequate protection for the obligations.

According to  Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy examiner, Barclays was interested in acquiring  Lehman prior to Lehman\u2019s bankruptcy and did purchase certain assets of  Lehman\u2019s following bankruptcy.

In addition, FDIC officials told us that the use of an LEI  should help regulators in resolving a financial company during the OLA  process because its adoption would allow large, systemically important  financial companies to identify their many component entities, which  generally are organized along business rather than legal lines.

MF  Global\u2019s stock price declined during 2011, falling from about $8 a share at  the start of the year to below $4 in early October and below $2 by late  October. According to the SIPA Trustee, MF Global\u2019s exposure to  European debt and poor earnings reports led to credit downgrades and  increased demands for collateral from MF Global\u2019s counterparties. This in  turn led to an increased loss of confidence in MF Global as customers  began to close their accounts and withdraw funds.", "According to CFTC, the failure of the MF Global commodity broker (MF  Global Inc.) is unprecedented in the size and scope of missing customer  funds. Ordinarily, the designated self-regulatory organization, in  coordination with CFTC, would have arranged for the sale of a failed  commodity broker to another commodity broker, but in the case of MF  Global Inc., the missing customer funds and possible fraud prevented this  from occurring, according to CFTC officials. These officials said they  increased their involvement in the MF Global case after the company was  downgraded by credit rating agencies on October 27, 2011. Despite  repeated inquiries, MF Global Inc. was not able to provide supporting  records for its calculations of segregated customer accounts. Because  CFTC lacks authority to put the commodity broker into bankruptcy, when  customer money was found missing, SEC and CFTC determined that a  SIPC-led bankruptcy was the appropriate course of action to protect  customer accounts and assets.", "The MF Global bankruptcy has highlighted issues related to resolving an  international broker-dealer and commodity broker and the effect on  customer payments. According to SIPC officials, for the securities estate,  the SIPA Trustee is using SIPA, and for the commodities estate, the  Trustee is applying subchapter IV of Chapter 7 of the Code to the extent  consistent with SIPA, as well as applicable commodities law. While a  SIPA proceeding and the bankruptcy process for a commodity broker are  similar, there are important differences. Under the bankruptcy process for  a commodity broker, to the extent that the debtor\u2019s general estate is  insufficient to pay for the estate\u2019s administrative expenses, these  expenses are paid from customer property ahead of the claims of  customers. However, under the SIPA process, customer property is used  to pay customers, and is available to pay estate expenses only if all  customers have been satisfied in full. These differences could have a  distinct effect on the funds available to customers, depending on the  amount of the administrative expenses being paid compared to the  amount of the general estate and the amount of the customer claims. In  addition, SIPC may advance up to $500,000 for each customer holding  securities (and a maximum of $250,000 for customers holding cash) while  the liquidation is ongoing, which enables the trustee to provide some  relief to securities customers relatively quickly. SIPC has no authority to  make advances to satisfy commodities claims and the liquidation process  for a commodity broker has no such provision. In MF Global, more than  30,000 commodity customer claims were filed compared with  approximately 300 securities customer claims.", "Because different customer estates are available to securities and  commodity customers, each type of customer is receiving a different  recovery percentage. CFTC officials told us they have been working to  identify customer property for these estates, and SIPC officials told us the  CFTC has closely cooperated with the SIPA Trustee.  However, SIPC  officials said the CFTC\u2019s regulations that implement bankruptcies for  commodity brokers have been cumbersome to follow. In addition,  according to SIPC officials, the SIPA Trustee\u2019s authority to conduct bulk  transfers from the insolvent commodity broker-dealer to other broker- dealers is vague.", "According to the SIPA Trustee, a large volume of transactions occurred in  the final week of MF Global\u2019s operations. The SIPA Trustee\u2019s report  stated that the company\u2019s information technology system could not  handle this increased volume, leading to transactions that were not  recorded or recorded incorrectly. The report estimated that \u201cfail  transactions\u201d (in which a counterparty fails to deliver cash or securities)  were five times the normal volume in the final week. Following the  bankruptcy filing, the SIPA Trustee conducted an investigation examining  840 cash transactions in excess of $10 million that totaled $327 billion  and 20,000 cash transfers below $10 million that totaled $9 billion. In  addition the SIPA Trustee has been examining securities transactions  valued at more than $100 billion. The SIPA Trustee has sought to  connect cash transfers from counterparties to the transfers of securities  from MF Global to locate more customer funds.", "The resolution of MF Global Inc. also has been hampered by differences  in laws of various jurisdictions and the location of foreign assets.  According to the SIPA Trustee, differences in insolvency laws and a lack  of legal precedent have contributed to significant gaps in commodity  customer protection between the United States and foreign jurisdictions.  SIPC officials and the SIPA Trustee said customers who had accounts for  trading on domestic exchanges and customers who had accounts to take  physical delivery of commodities received an 80 percent return on their  account from the first interim distribution; however, the customers with  accounts for trading on foreign exchanges will receive only a 10 percent  return from this distribution. The officials explained that most of the  property for customers on foreign exchanges is in the United Kingdom  and according to the SIPA Trustee, these assets are now under the  control of foreign bankruptcy trustees, similar to other international  bankruptcies. The SIPA Trustee said that recovery of foreign assets was  uncertain and would take time, adding that these issues were usually the  last to be resolved and only after litigation. At a June 1, 2012, hearing, a  target date of April 9, 2013, was set by the U.K. court.", "The recent bankruptcy cases involving large complex financial institutions  illustrate the potential challenges FDIC will have in an OLA proceeding,  including resolving a securities and commodity broker, a company with  significant international presence, and cases involving complex litigation.  As described previously, MF Global customer property may be located in  other countries, complicating the trustee\u2019s efforts to obtain it. The trustee  for Lehman\u2019s broker-dealer has been involved in litigation with one of  Lehman\u2019s foreign affiliates for several years. Because OLA will only apply  to domestic entities, international coordination and voluntary cooperation  with foreign regulators will be essential for the resolution of a global  company. As discussed earlier, FDIC and other regulators have been  taking steps to improve international coordination of the resolution of  large, systemically important financial institutions but challenges remain.  Regulators have yet to clarify the roles and responsibilities of FDIC and  SIPC during the liquidation of a broker-dealer under OLA, including the  treatment of securities customers, commodity customers, and general  creditors. On May 3, 2012, FDIC conducted an exercise with SEC and  CFTC simulating a hypothetical failure of a systemically important  financial institution with both a securities broker and commodity broker to  better understand gaps in the OLA process and assist in their rulemaking  process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to AOUSC, CFTC, Departments of  Justice and the Treasury, FDIC, Federal Judicial Center, Federal  Reserve, National Association of Insurance Commissioners, SEC, and  SIPC for review and comment.

District  Court) has taken in response to the judicial review provision of Orderly  Liquidation Authority (OLA), including any revisions to Local Civil Rule 85;  (2) federal rules or regulations relating to OLA and efforts to improve  international coordination, including living wills, in resolving financial  companies; and (3) data collection efforts and the outcomes of financial  institutions that were in the bankruptcy process.", "Generally to address our objectives, we reviewed the Dodd-Frank Wall  Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) of 2010  and its rulemaking requirements. We also conducted interviews with  officials at the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC);  Commodity Futures Trading Commission; Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC); Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  (Federal Reserve); Federal Judicial Center; Securities and Exchange  Commission; Securities Investor Protection Corporation; Department of  the Treasury (Treasury); and the U.S. District Court for the District of  Columbia (D.C. District Court). We reviewed relevant literature and  reports issued since our last report, including those written by AOUSC  and the Federal Reserve in response to mandates in the Dodd-Frank Act.", "Specifically to address the first objective on actions the D.C. District Court  took in response to the judicial review provision of the OLA, we monitored  the website for the D.C. District Court for changes in Local Civil Rule 85.  We interviewed the Chief Judge and other officials from the court to  discuss how the rule would be implemented in case of a petition under  OLA and the changes made to the rule in response to comments from  FDIC and Treasury. We also discussed these changes with officials from  FDIC and Treasury to obtain their views on the amended rule and how  they expected the rule to be implemented.", "To address the second objective on federal regulations relating to OLA  and the resolution of financial institutions, we searched the Federal  Register and monitored the websites of FDIC and the Federal Reserve to  determine if relevant rules related to FDIC\u2019s authority under Title II and  resolution planning had been issued. We also monitored the development  of other related rules, including the Federal Reserve\u2019s rule related to the  definition of nonbank financial companies and the Financial Stability  Oversight Council\u2019s designation of systemically important financial  institutions. We reviewed proposed, interim final, and final rules under  these authorities; they are presented in appendix II. We reviewed  comment letters on the rules, testimonies by regulatory officials,  roundtable discussions held by FDIC, legal opinions and law firm client  updates, and seminars conducted by law firms on FDIC\u2019s new authority  under Title II. We reviewed updates from the Financial Stability Board on  international coordination of related resolution and recovery planning and  monitored the websites of the Financial Stability Board and Treasury\u2019s  Office of Financial Research for developments on the Legal Entity  Identifier. We also participated in financial industry presentations on the  development and challenges of adoption of the Legal Entity Identifier.", "To address the third objective on data collection and the status of  financial institutions in the bankruptcy process, we spoke to officials from  AOUSC, the Federal Judicial Center, and the Trustee Program at the  Department of Justice to learn more about potential sources of financial  company bankruptcy data. However, as discussed in our report, we found  that no single source for financial company bankruptcy data is available.  To provide some background information on the number of bankruptcies  of large financial institutions from January 1, 2010, through December 31,  2011, we used data (as we did for last year\u2019s report) on Chapter 11  megacases collected by AOUSC and compared these cases with  bankruptcy data from New Generations Research, Inc. New Generations,  Inc., is a private company that takes data from U.S. bankruptcy filings and  augments it with industry-specific data, including the type of industry of  the debtor. We spoke with federal officials familiar with New Generations,  Inc., and they consider it to be reliable for tracking bankruptcy cases. We  also spoke to representatives from New Generations, Inc. regarding their  data collection and reliability methods. We concluded that the data were  reliable for tracking bankruptcy cases. AOUSC provided lead case data  on megacases (involving assets of more than $100 million and more than  1,000 creditors) that included date and location of filing and some  information on how closed cases were concluded (such as by sale,  liquidation, or reorganization). By matching data on bankruptcies of  financial institutions from New Generations with the AOUSC-provided  megacase data, we were able to provide some context on the number of  Chapter 11 megacases that represented financial institutions. We decided  the data were sufficiently reliable for that purpose because there was a  reasonable match between cases in the two data sets. As with our  previous report, AOUSC provided only data on Chapter 11 cases and not  Chapter 7. According to AOUSC officials, virtually all megacases were  originally filed as Chapter 11 cases.", "In addition to our general tracking of financial institution bankruptcies, we  continued to monitor two major financial company bankruptcies\u2014Lehman  Brothers Holdings, Inc. and Washington Mutual, Inc.\u2014on which we  reported as case studies in 2011. We also began monitoring a new  major financial company bankruptcy, MF Global Holdings, Inc., that filed  for Chapter 11 protection in October 2011. For each of these cases, we  reviewed court documents such as court orders, trustee reports, and  reorganization plans. We also interviewed federal officials on their  involvement in these cases. We reviewed these data to provide illustrative  examples of some of the challenges and complexities of financial  company megacases; for example, challenges in resolving an  internationally active company or cases involving complex legal issues.  We verified information about these cases with federal officials. We  concluded that the information in these sources was sufficiently reliable  for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2011 to July 2012, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
