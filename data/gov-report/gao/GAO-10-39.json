For selected professional and management support contracts, GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent to which DOD considered the risks of contractors closely supporting inherently governmental functions at key decision points, (2) how DOD implemented performance-based practices, (3) the extent to which DOD designated trained surveillance personnel, and (4) whether a new review process may improve DOD's management of such contracts. GAO reviewed federal regulations, agency policies and guidance, and analyzed seven acquisitions approved from 2004 to 2007 and 64 related task orders for services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD policies do not require assessments of the risks associated with contractors closely supporting inherently governmental functions as part of its management reviews of acquisition strategies nor when task orders are issued for professional and management services. Such risks include the potential loss of government control over and accountability for mission-related policy and program decisions. Though all seven acquisitions and more than 75 percent of the task orders GAO reviewed provided for such services, GAO found no evidence that these risks were among those considered in the documentation reviewed. DOD guidance issued after these acquisitions were approved requires that consideration be given to using civilian personnel rather than contractors when the activities closely support inherently governmental functions. This guidance, however, does not require DOD personnel to consider and document risks posed when contractors perform these activities. Further, DOD personnel were unaware of the need to provide enhanced oversight when contracting for such services. DOD faces challenges in defining requirements and outcome-based measures when acquiring professional and management services. DOD personnel generally expressed task order requirements in terms of a broad range of activities that contractors may perform, but used standards and measures that were not always well-suited to assess outcomes. DOD made more use of objective measures to assess cost and schedule performance, but generally relied on subjective measures to assess the quality of the contractors' work. For example, DOD often measured quality based on the number of complaints lodged against the contractor, which provided little detail into how desired outcomes were achieved. DOD also missed opportunities to include objective measures that may have been better suited to assess outcomes. DOD officials stated that developing outcome-based, objective measures is challenging, but noted that initiatives are under way to better utilize such approaches. DOD has made progress in ensuring that trained surveillance personnel are assigned to monitor contract performance. Surveillance personnel were assigned to all 64 of the task orders GAO reviewed, and all but 3 had received required training. GAO identified, however, 3 instances of surveillance personnel who were not assigned before the contractor began work on a task order and 20 instances of personnel who did not receive training prior to beginning surveillance duties. In September 2008, DOD implemented a new peer review process that is tasked to address, among other issues, contractors closely supporting inherently governmental functions, the use of performance-based practices, and contractor surveillance. As of October 2009, four pre-award reviews and one post-award review of professional and management support contracts have been conducted and it is too early to tell whether such reviews will encourage DOD personnel to address these issues across the range of DOD's services contracts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is the federal government\u2019s largest  purchaser of contractor-provided services, obligating more than $200  billion on services contracts in fiscal year 2008.

Collectively, such issues  continue to place DOD at high risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement and result in DOD contract management being on our  high-risk list.", "In response to your interest in whether DOD\u2019s policies and actions to  improve the management of services contracts addressed issues affecting  professional and management support contracts, we examined (1) the  extent to which DOD considered the risks associated with contractors  closely supporting inherently governmental functions at key acquisition  decision points; (2) how DOD was implementing performance-based  acquisition practices, such as identifying requirements in terms of  expected and measurable outcomes; (3) the extent to which DOD  designated trained surveillance personnel; and (4) whether recent actions  to implement a peer review process may improve DOD\u2019s management and  use of such contracts.", "To assess the extent to which DOD\u2019s management reviews and policies  addressed the risks associated with contractors closely supporting  inherently governmental functions at key acquisition points, we reviewed  DOD\u2019s May 2002 and October 2006 guidance that established its processes  for reviewing and approving proposed acquisitions to obtain contractor  support. To assess how these risks were addressed during reviews of  specific services acquisitions, we reviewed a DOD-provided list of 102  services acquisitions approved by the Air Force, Army, or Navy from fiscal  years 2004 through 2007. Using contract data from the Federal  Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation, we determined that 32 of  these acquisitions, with almost $15 billion in total combined obligations  from fiscal years 2004 through 2008, included contracts for the purchase of  professional, administrative, and management support. From these 32  acquisitions, we selected 7 for our review based on the percentage of total  obligations that went towards professional, administrative, and  management support services; the specific types of services acquired; and  the military department responsible for the acquisition. We also  determined that the military departments obligated over $4.3 billion on  1,874 task orders from these 7 acquisitions from fiscal years 2004 through  2008. We randomly selected and reviewed 64 task orders that had  obligations of $500,000 or more and were issued during fiscal years 2004  through 2007 from these acquisitions to assess how such risks were  addressed prior to DOD\u2019s decision to award a contract or issue a task  order for professional and management support contracts. We did not  review acquisitions approved after fiscal year 2007 since our analysis  indicated that it was often a year or more from the time that the  acquisition strategy was approved to the time when task orders were  actually issued. We reviewed the acquisition strategy, base contract, task  order, statements of work, and other documentation supporting the need  to acquire contract support and any risk assessments prepared. We also  interviewed officials who managed these acquisitions to obtain  information on why these services were purchased, the risks that were  considered, and any steps taken for enhanced contractor oversight.", "We assessed the reliability of the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next  Generation to identify acquisitions and to select task orders that were  within the scope of our review by verifying (1) the contract and task order  identification numbers, (2) the contract award date, (3) that the task  orders associated with the acquisitions were for professional and  management support services, and (4) that the task orders had obligations  exceeding $500,000. On the basis of this assessment, we determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review.", "To assess how DOD was implementing performance-based acquisitions  practices on professional and management support contracts, we  reviewed Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requirements and DOD  guidance on developing performance work statements and specifically on  how to identify contract requirements in terms of expected and  measurable outcomes.

Over that same time period, DOD\u2019s obligations on  professional, administrative, and management support contracts nearly  tripled from $14.2 billion to $42 billion.

Additionally, the  Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005  required, among other things, that prior to entering into a contract for  performance of acquisition functions that closely support inherently  governmental functions, DOD must ensure that its personnel cannot  reasonably be made available to perform these activities, that appropriate  DOD personnel supervise contractor performance and perform all  inherently governmental functions, and that DOD address any potential  organizational conflict of interest of the contractor when performing these  tasks.

For example, 63 percent  of the task orders that assessed the contractor\u2019s cost performance  principally used objective performance measures, while two-thirds of the  task orders that assessed the quality of the contractor\u2019s performance  principally used subjective measures.", "We found that the objective performance measures yielded better  information on how well the contractor met desired cost and schedule  contract outcomes than subjective measures. For example, the objective  performance standards in one task order required the contractor to remain  within projected costs and perform tasks within schedule 97 percent of the  time. In this instance, the surveillance personnel maintained a database of  the contractor\u2019s cost and periodically contacted customers to identify if  the contractor\u2019s work was completed on time. The other task orders that  included cost and schedule performance standards were assessed  subjectively, based on the number of complaints lodged against the  contractor. According to task order documentation and surveillance  personnel we spoke with, a customer complaint is generated when a  contractor fails to meet performance requirements. Ten of these task  orders required the contractor to provide accurate cost forecasts and  accomplish tasks with minimum delay to program mission objectives.  None of these task orders, however, identified what would constitute a  level of performance that would result in a valid customer complaint.", "Contractor performance documentation we reviewed for these task orders  indicated that DOD assessed the contractor as having met performance  requirements, but provided little to no information on what the contractor  accomplished.", "Both the subjective and objective performance measures used to assess  the quality of the contractors\u2019 services provided little insight into the  outcomes of the contractors\u2019 work. DOD personnel relied on subjective  measures to assess the quality of contractor services provided in 40 of the  64 task orders we reviewed. For example, 30 of these tasks orders directed  surveillance personnel to assess quality based on the number of customer  complaints a contractor received. Surveillance personnel we spoke with  indicated that they regularly contacted government customers to inquire  about their overall satisfaction with the contractor\u2019s performance. Some  surveillance personnel explained that it was difficult to determine if the  contractor met or exceeded performance standards because guidance on  making these determinations was not available. Consequently, they  generally documented the contractor\u2019s performance as acceptable if the  customer said they were satisfied with the contractor\u2019s performance. We  found that when the contractor\u2019s performance was rated as meeting  requirements, surveillance personnel documented little detail about the  quality of the contractor\u2019s work because such descriptions were often  required only when the contractor either exceeded or did not meet  expectations. In another 10 task orders involving the purchase of  engineering, technical, business, and acquisition support services, such as  helping to identify the program office\u2019s contracting requirements and  assisting with developing requests for proposals and statements of work to  fill those requirements, quality performance standards required the  contractor to complete task order activities with little rework and with  few minor and no significant problems at least 80 percent of the time.  According to the documentation we reviewed, surveillance personnel  indicated they periodically sampled the contractor\u2019s work to verify the  percentage that was redone and often rated the quality of the work as  exceptional because little rework was reported.", "On four task orders for translation services in Afghanistan, Cuba, and  other areas, DOD personnel did not attempt to measure the quality of the  contractor\u2019s services. In these cases, the task orders\u2019 requirements  included that the contractor deploy translators in response to mission  requirements. The corresponding performance standard required the  contractor to meet staffing requirements no less than 95 percent of the  time, which was measured and documented by surveillance personnel.  The task orders, however, did not include a performance objective for  obtaining high-quality translation services. Contracting and program  officials explained that they did not try to measure the quality of the  translations provided because DOD lacks the personnel with translation  skills necessary to make such an assessment. These officials stated that  ensuring qualified personnel are provided in a timely manner is the best  alternative to determining if the translations provided are of high quality.", "The military departments may have missed opportunities to include and  use objective performance measures that were better suited to assess  contract outcomes in several of the task orders we reviewed. In part, this  occurred because DOD personnel used the general performance measures  that were established in the base contract rather than develop measures  that were tailored for the specific work required in the task orders in more  than 80 percent of the task orders we reviewed. Consequently, in each of  the following examples, the quality of the contractor\u2019s performance was  measured based on the number of validated complaints submitted by  government personnel.", "Four task orders issued for acquisition, financial management,  contracting, and administrative support required contractors to  indicate at the end of each contract year at least two lessons learned,  best practices, or improvements it made to the government\u2019s processes  in areas including acquisition and program management. The  requirements did not, however, identify at the outset of the task order  the type or extent of the improvements that DOD desired, such as  reductions in the time required to complete activities or costs savings.", "In a $1.8 million task order for information and project management  support, the contractor was required to identify and reduce the  government\u2019s unliquidated obligations by 25 percent in 6 months and  by 50 percent in a year when measured against an identified baseline.  Nevertheless, the task order did not include any performance  measures that were directly related to whether the contractor met the  reduction targets. The official responsible for assessing the  contractor\u2019s performance noted, however, that he considered the  contractor\u2019s efforts to reduce unliquidated obligations when he  assessed the contractor\u2019s performance.", "In four other task orders for acquisition and information management  support, the contractor was required to review technical proposals and  validate prices submitted by other contractors and make  recommendations on the acceptance or rejection of these proposals as  part of the support it provided to the program office\u2019s pre-award  activities. The task orders, however, did not include objective  performance measures to assess the contractor\u2019s performance, such as  whether the contracting officer returned the contractor\u2019s work to  correct deficiencies or whether the reviews resulted in reducing the  government\u2019s costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Officials Identified Challenges in Developing Objective, Outcome- Oriented Measures", "paragraphs": ["Our previous work at the Department of Homeland Security noted that  defining outcome-oriented requirements and measurable performance  standards may be challenging for professional and management support  services.

They stated that these task  orders encompassed a range of activities which, while not inherently  governmental, would typically be performed by federal employees.  Consequently, officials stated the performance work statements needed to  be written broadly to provide the flexibility to obtain specific support as  needed and that contractors were often viewed as simply augmenting the  government\u2019s workforce. Further, these officials noted that it was often  not practical to measure the work contractors performed and that  subjective measures, such as the number of customer complaints received,  are frequently used as an alternative to assess whether the contractor met  the government\u2019s requirements.

DAU  plans to launch a Web site in January 2010 that includes templates derived  from these examples for contracting and program officials across DOD to  tailor to their own needs. Additionally, this official noted that since  January 2009, DAU has offered a 4-day services acquisition workshop  tailored to individual acquisitions developed by program offices across  DOD. According to the DAU official, the workshop brings together key  acquisition personnel, from contracting officers to customers, to support  the development of new acquisition strategies before they are reviewed by  the military departments.

Surveillance personnel are  required to be qualified by training and designated in writing. In response  to our and inspector general reports on continued shortcomings in DOD\u2019s  contract surveillance practices, DOD issued guidance on December 6,  2006, requiring that surveillance personnel be properly trained and  designated before contract performance begins, and that properly trained  surveillance personnel are identified on active contracts for services.", "At the time of our review, trained surveillance personnel were designated  to all 64 task orders. DOD personnel responsible for five of the seven  acquisitions we reviewed, however, did not maintain documentation on all  surveillance personnel assigned over the task orders\u2019 entire period of  performance. DOD officials stated that in some cases additional personnel  may have been designated to the task orders, and that some personnel  may have received surveillance training on a date earlier than was  indicated in the contract files, but were unable to provide documentation.", "In most cases, DOD was able to provide documentation of the first person  designated to conduct surveillance and the person assigned at the time of  our review. On the basis of this information, we found that surveillance  personnel were designated after contract performance began on 3 of the  37 task orders awarded after the issuance of the December 2006  guidance. In 1 of these 3 cases, the person was designated more than 90  days after performance began on the task order.", "We also found that 61 of the 64 surveillance personnel designated on the  task orders we reviewed had received training. For 1 of the 3 instances  where personnel were not trained, a program official explained that the  person was recently assigned and had been notified of the training  requirements, but had not completed the training. In the 2 other instances,  DOD officials were not able to identify a reason for the lack of training.  For the 61 task orders with trained personnel assigned, 20 personnel had  not received training prior to beginning their assignments. Furthermore, in  3 of these cases, surveillance personnel did not receive the required  training until at least a year after they were assigned to monitor a  contractor\u2019s performance.", "The training that surveillance personnel received varied across and within  the military departments, ranging in duration from 2 hours to 1 week, and  included, among other things, reviewing training slides, completing an on- line course offered through DAU\u2019s Web site, and completing an in-class  course tailored by the program office responsible for the acquisition.  There are no DOD-wide requirements for the content of surveillance  training and personnel we spoke with provided mixed feedback on how  well their training prepared them to conduct surveillance. Surveillance  personnel noted that training provided an adequate basis for conducting  their duties, but did not always provide enough instruction on how to  effectively oversee contractors, especially for those who had little to no  previous experience with assessing contractor performance. Several  personnel stated that the most useful information that training provided  was the contact information for personnel in the contracting offices that  surveillance personnel could speak with if they had questions. DPAP  officials acknowledged that the type and content of the training  surveillance personnel receive varied and indicated that DOD is  considering a certification system for these personnel that may include  both training and experience requirements.", "Surveillance personnel identified a number of challenges that may affect  their surveillance duties, such as numerous contractors to oversee in  multiple locations and surveillance responsibilities being secondary to  primary duties. For example, on one task order for translation services in  Afghanistan, surveillance personnel were each responsible for monitoring  over 1,000 contractors dispersed throughout the country. An official who  oversaw this task order stated the ratio of surveillance personnel to  contractors was so large that it affected the government\u2019s ability to assess  contractor performance. For a task order for translation services in  Cuba, the contracting officer\u2019s letter of designation to the contracting  officer\u2019s representative stressed the importance of on-site surve illance.  Nevertheless, we found that there was an 8-month period during which  surveillance personnel were absent from the site of contractor  performance. Despite the absence of on-site surveillance personnel,  contracting officials determined that the contractor should receive the full  award fee based upon performance reports submitted before and after this  8-month period. Several personnel from other commands we visited told  us they did not have sufficient time to focus on their surveillance  responsibilities in addition to their primary duties.

In response, the Director of DPAP issued  memorandums in September 2008 outlining pre- and post-award peer  reviews and in February 2009 detailing criteria for the peer reviews for  services acquisitions with estimated values of $1 billion or more,  consistent with the threshold for reviewing proposed services  acquisitions. To do so, DOD convenes peer review teams that consist of  senior contracting leaders from across DOD as well as legal counsel to  work closely with the offices responsible for developing acquisition  strategies. This policy also required the military departments to establish  their own procedures to conduct peer reviews for service acquisitions  valued at less than $1 billion. As of October 2009, DPAP conducted 48 pre- award peer reviews on 31 different proposed supplies and services  acquisitions. DPAP also conducted three post-award reviews on approved  and ongoing services acquisitions, which included a review of task order  documents. Of the 51 reviews conducted by DPAP, four pre-award reviews  and one post-award review were conducted on three different professional  and management support services acquisitions.", "The peer review process differs from DOD\u2019s management reviews in a  number of areas that may provide opportunities for the department to  address key aspects of managing and overseeing professional and  management support contracts. Whereas the premise of the management  review is to assess and approve proposed acquisition strategies, the peer  reviews are conducted after strategies have been approved and are  intended to be advisory in nature. Peer reviews are designed to help:  ensure that contracting officers across DOD implement policy and  regulations in a consistent and appropriate manner;  improve the quality of DOD\u2019s contracting processes; and  facilitate cross-sharing of best practices and lessons learned.", "Currently, a peer review team summarizes the results of its review in a  memorandum provided to both the contracting office responsible for the  acquisition and DPAP. According to DPAP officials, DOD is still  determining how to share best practices and lessons learned from these  reviews with the department\u2019s acquisition community.", "While both the peer reviews and the management reviews contain pre- award components, the multiple phases of the peer reviews provide DOD  the opportunity to address additional issues and examine documents not  available during the management review (see fig. 1). For example, the pre- award management review of proposed services acquisitions occurs  before performance work statements and quality assurance surveillance  plans are developed. As a result, the management reviews do not include  an assessment of how performance-based practices are implemented and  whether proper contractor surveillance is conducted. Further, as  previously noted, DOD\u2019s management review guidance does not require  department personnel to identify whether the services to be provided  closely support inherently governmental functions or how the risks  associated with contractors providing such services will be addressed. In  contrast, the pre-award peer reviews occur later in the acquisition cycle  and include the review of additional documents that may provide  reviewers an opportunity to recommend improvements to performance  work statements and surveillance plans.", "Additionally, the peer review process provides for a post-award phase for  services that expands upon the management review requirements. The  post-award peer review has eight metrics that provide criteria that  reviewers use to evaluate ongoing acquisitions in terms of how contractor  performance is assessed, including the use of objective criteria; whether  surveillance personnel are appropriately staffed; and the extent of reliance  on contractors to perform tasks closely associated with inherently  government functions. Table 5 shows the various areas of focus of the  peer reviews.", "Our review of the summary memoranda for the five peer reviews  conducted on professional and management support contracts found that  while the memoranda generally focused on business aspects, some  memoranda made recommendations related to performance-based  approaches and surveillance issues specific to the individual acquisition.  For example, a pre-award peer review team recommended that the  contracting office work with DAU to develop performance-based  statements of work. The peer review team for the one post-award review  recommended that the program office identify objective performance  measures and present them to the contractor. Another pre-award peer  review team recommended that the contracting office appoint surveillance  personnel prior to the award of a contract. None of the memoranda we  reviewed noted issues with contractors closely supporting inherently  governmental functions. DOD officials stated that these issues were  discussed, but that none appeared to warrant inclusion in the memoranda.", "While DPAP has completed peer reviews on 34 individual supplies and  services acquisitions since September 2008, developing an approach that  will lead to the achievement of the peer review\u2019s objectives enterprisewide  may prove challenging given the nature and volume of service contract  activity. Nearly 1,900 task orders were issued under the seven professional  and management support services acquisitions we reviewed, all of which  required a contractor to perform multiple and varying tasks. Furthermore,  we identified thousands of individual task orders associated with the  professional and management support services acquisition strategies  approved by the military departments from fiscal years 2004 through 2007,  all of which require management and oversight by the department. These  numbers are even greater when looking at all services acquisition  strategies approved by the military departments in that same time period  (see table 6)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s reliance upon contractor-provided professional, administrative, and  management services to support its missions makes effective management  and oversight of these contracts critical. Certain activities such as budget  preparation, acquisition planning, and policy development can create risks  that the government needs to consider and effectively manage. Of key  concern is the loss of government control over and accountability for  policy and program decisions. Nevertheless, DOD\u2019s policies do not require  that DOD personnel include an assessment of these risks when their  proposals for contractor support are submitted for approval under DOD\u2019s  management review process. While recent legislation and DOD\u2019s  implementing guidance require that DOD consider whether to continue the  use of contractors for critical services, including conducting a cost  analysis if the situation warrants, these determinations and analyses are  largely disconnected from the acquisition review process. Consequently,  senior DOD leadership does not have the benefit of such analyses when  making strategic decisions on obtaining long-term, high-dollar-value  professional and management support.", "Similarly, key decisions at the transactional level\u2014 such as to award a  contract or to issue a task order\u2014are made with the recognition that DOD  is dependent on contractors to support its missions and operations.  Despite this dependency, DOD officials generally did not consider whether  contractors may be unduly or inappropriately influencing government  decision making. Further, while these services were often acquired  through performance-based approaches, such efforts were hindered by  DOD\u2019s use of broad statements of work and the use of performance  measures established in the base contract rather than attempting to  measure the specific services being provided under the task order. Within  DOD\u2019s acquisition community, there is widespread recognition that  developing outcome-oriented measures is particularly difficult for  professional and management support contracts. DOD has efforts under  way to help develop better outcome-oriented measures for professional  and management support contracts, but it is too soon to know whether  this effort will prove successful. Perhaps the most critical tool in assessing  contractor performance is having properly trained personnel in sufficient  numbers to effectively monitor contractor performance. While  improvements were evident, lapses in designating such personnel, in  particular during the initial stages of the contract, continue to expose DOD  to an increased risk of poor contractor performance.", "DOD consideration, at both the strategic and transactional levels, of the  risks of using contractors to closely support inherently governmental  functions can help improve the context for successful professional and  management support outcomes. DOD\u2019s peer review process is beginning  to assess this issue just prior to and then after contract award, but with  only a handful of reviews performed on such contracts, it is too early to  gauge whether the process will be successful in encouraging DOD  personnel to address these issues across the range of DOD\u2019s services  contracts. Having similar information provided at a level of detail  appropriate for when senior DOD and military department leadership  review proposed acquisition strategies would inform decision makers and  engender more proactive consideration earlier in the acquisition cycle. As  DOD gets closer to awarding contracts or issuing task orders for specific  services, risks move from potential to the more tangible. Reducing the  possibility that DOD would enter into a contractual arrangement that  exposes it to unintentional and undesired consequences requires that DOD  personnel consider\u2014based on the facts and circumstances of a particular  acquisition\u2014whether such risks are present and, if so, how best to  mitigate them.

We also reviewed guidance  issued by DOD in May 2002 and October 2006, as well as DOD Instruction  5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System, reissued in  December 2008, which collectively established DOD\u2019s management review  processes to identify the risks that should be considered during these  reviews. Further, we reviewed Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter  93-1, Management and Oversight of Service Contracting and Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requirements for the management and  oversight of contractors that closely support inherently governmental  functions. We also reviewed DOD Instruction 1100.22, Guidance for  Determining Workforce Mix and DOD\u2019s May 2009 in-sourcing guidance,  In-Sourcing Contracted Services\u2014Implementation Guidance, to  determine how personnel should consider and document the risks of  contractors performing activities that closely support inherently  governmental functions and assess the appropriate mix of DOD civilian,  military, and contractor personnel.

We  obtained information from the military departments on the contracts that  had been awarded after these 102 strategies had been approved. Using this  information and data derived from the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013 Next Generation, we determined that the military departments had  awarded 361 contracts and issued 13,650 task orders from these 102  acquisitions during fiscal years 2004 through 2007. We then identified  product service codes associated with these contracts and used the  Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next Generation to determine the  number of contract actions and obligations for professional and  management support services. We found that 32 of these acquisitions, with  almost $15 billion in total combined obligations from fiscal years 2004  through 2008, included contracts for professional and management  support. From these 32 acquisitions, we selected 7 acquisitions based on  such factors as the percentage of obligations that were made for  professional and management support services, the specific types of  services acquired, and the agency awarding the contract. The 7  acquisitions we selected had over $4.3 billion in total combined obligations  from fiscal years 2004 through 2008 (see table 7 for more information on  these acquisitions).", "The seven acquisition strategies we reviewed were approved under DOD\u2019s  May 2002 acquisition of services policy, which required the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to review  acquisitions with an expected value of over $2 billion and for each of the  DOD components, which includes the military departments, to review  those acquisitions that were under that threshold. None of the acquisition  strategies we selected were approved after DOD issued its October 2006  acquisition of services policy, which lowered the dollar thresholds for  management reviews. The substance of the management reviews remained  largely unchanged, incorporating a few additional, specific, acquisition  strategy requirements, such as the inclusion of any required waivers and  top-level discussion of source selection processes that were not significant  to the objectives of our review.", "To assess how such risks were addressed at the contract or task order  level, we used data from the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next  Generation to determine the number of task orders that had obligations of  $500,000 or more that were issued from fiscal years 2004 through 2007  from each of these seven acquisitions. From that list, we randomly select  10 task orders for each acquisition, with the exception of the INSCOM  Linguistics Part 2 acquisition for which we selected all four task orders  that had been issued as of September 2007 that exceeded this threshold.  Overall, we selected 64 task orders, which ranged from $530,000 to        $227 million in obligations, for review. We did not review acquisitions  approved after fiscal year 2007 since our analysis indicated that it was  often a year or more from the time that the acquisition strategy was  approved to the time when task orders were actually issued. For each of  the task orders, we reviewed the acquisition strategy, base contract, task  orders, statements of work, and other documentation supporting the need  to acquire contract support and any risk assessments prepared. We also  interviewed program and contracting officials who managed these  acquisitions to obtain information concerning why these services were  contracted for, the risks that were considered, and any additional steps  that had been taken to enhance oversight of the contractors.", "We assessed the reliability of the Federal Procurement Data System\u2013Next  Generation to identify acquisitions and to select task orders that were  within the scope of our review by verifying (1) the contract and task order  identification numbers; (2) the contract award date; (3) that the task  orders associated with the acquisitions were for professional and  management support services; and (4) that the task orders had obligations  exceeding $500,000.
