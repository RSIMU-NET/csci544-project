For example, fintech robo-advisers offer low cost investment advice provided solely by algorithms instead of humans. Fintech products pose similar risks as traditional products, but their risks may not always be sufficiently addressed by existing laws and regulations. Also, regulators and others noted that fintech activities create data security and privacy concerns and could potentially impact overall financial stability as fintech grows. The extent to which fintech firms are subject to federal oversight of their compliance with applicable laws varies. Securities regulators can oversee fintech investment advisers in the same ways as traditional investment advisers. Federal regulators may review some activities of fintech lenders or payment firms as part of overseeing risks arising from these firms' partnerships with banks or credit unions. In other cases, state regulators primarily oversee fintech firms, but federal regulators could take enforcement actions. Regulators have published consumer complaints against fintech firms, but indications of widespread consumer harm appear limited. The U.S. regulatory structure poses challenges to fintech firms. With numerous regulators, fintech firms noted that identifying the applicable laws and how their activities will be regulated can be difficult. Although regulators have issued some guidance, fintech payment and lending firms say complying with fragmented state requirements is costly and time-consuming. Regulators are collaborating in various ways, including engaging in discussions on financial protections for customers that may experience harm when their accounts are aggregated by a fintech firm and unauthorized transactions occur. Market participants disagree over reimbursement for such consumers, and key regulators are reluctant to act prematurely. Given their mandated consumer protection missions, regulators could act collaboratively to better ensure that consumers avoid financial harm and continue to benefit from these services. GAO has identified leading practices for interagency collaboration, including defining agency roles and responsibilities and defining outcomes. Implementing these practices could increase the effectiveness of regulators' efforts to help resolve this conflict.", "Regulators abroad have taken various approaches to encourage fintech innovation. These include establishing innovation offices to help fintech firms understand applicable regulations and foster regulatory interactions. Some use \u201cregulatory sandboxes\u201d that allow fintech firms to offer products on a limited scale and provide valuable knowledge about products and risks to both firms and regulators. Regulators abroad also established various mechanisms to coordinate with other agencies on financial innovation. While some U.S. regulators have taken similar steps, others have not due to concerns of favoring certain competitors or perceived lack of authority. While these constraints may limit regulators' ability to take such steps, considering these approaches could result in better interactions between U.S. regulators and fintech firms and help regulators increase their understanding of fintech products. This would be consistent with GAO's framework calling for regulatory systems to be flexible and forward looking to help regulators adapt to market innovations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making numerous recommendations related to improving interagency coordination on fintech, addressing competing concerns on financial account aggregation, and evaluating whether it would be feasible and beneficial to adopt regulatory approaches similar to those undertaken by regulators in jurisdictions outside of the United States.

They can also access these  services outside of standard business hours. In addition, the ability to  see information from all of their financial accounts together in a single  dashboard provided by an account aggregator is more convenient  than reviewing information from each account on separate  statements.", "Lower cost: Innovations in payments, including the use of DLT, could  reduce the cost of payments for consumers. For example, one fintech  firm uses DLT to reduce the operational and liquidity costs traditionally  incurred with some international payments. Some fintech providers  do not charge fees for payments, so consumers save by avoiding  paying for checks or incurring automated teller machine fees. In  addition, because fintech providers often do not have overhead costs  associated with physical locations and use automation instead of  relying on large staffs to provide services, they may be able to pass  these cost savings on to consumers. For example, according to a  Treasury report, automated loan processing, underwriting, and  servicing may allow fintech lenders to offer lower rates or fees on their  loans because they have to hire fewer loan officers. Similarly,  automation in robo-advising could allow consumers to obtain  investment advice at a lower cost than if they obtained services from a  firm that relied more heavily upon human advisers.", "Increased financial inclusion: Using alternative data may allow  fintech lenders to offer loans to consumers whose traditional credit  history may have been insufficient for banks to extend them credit.  CFPB officials stated that using alternative data\u2014including bill  payment history as a proxy for debt repayment\u2014could expand  responsible access to credit, particularly to some consumers who are  among the estimated 45 million people who lack traditional credit  scores. Similarly, a study by FDIC staff noted that fintech accounts  may also enable consumers whose traditional accounts are closed  due to lack of profitability for the provider or other reasons to continue  to have access to financial services. Also, robo-advising services  can make investment advice more accessible to consumers who  cannot meet account minimums at traditional advisers by offering  lower account minimums.", "Faster services: Automation may reduce transaction times for  services like loan approval or investment advice. Stored payment data  in fintech providers\u2019 mobile wallets may reduce transaction time for  online purchases because consumers do not need to reenter billing  information. Further, such data may reduce transaction time for in- store purchases because transactions using contactless payments  are faster than transactions using card readers and cash. Peer-to- peer payments made via mobile wallets may transfer money faster  than checks. Also, using DLT may greatly reduce settlement times for  currency, derivatives, and securities transactions by improving  processes or reducing the number of entities involved in a transaction.  For example, one firm is using DLT to reduce settlement for securities  from 2 days to the same day.", "Improved security: While credit and debit transactions have  traditionally transmitted sensitive information that can be hacked and  used to make fraudulent transfers, fintech providers\u2019 mobile wallets  generally replace this sensitive information with randomly generated  numbers that mitigate the risk that transaction information can be  used fraudulently (tokenization), according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s  Mobile Payments Industry Workgroup. Similarly, while lost or stolen  credit and debit cards can be used to make fraudulent payments, a  lost or stolen mobile device can have security features that protect a  mobile wallet from unauthorized use. For example, according to FTC,  mobile device features such as device passwords, fingerprint readers,  and face recognition software can help protect consumer accounts  from unauthorized access. Additionally, FCC notes in a consumer  guide that consumers\u2019 ability to disable their mobile devices remotely  can help prevent fraudulent use of a consumer\u2019s fintech provider  accounts if their mobile devices have been lost or stolen.

In addition, FCC and FTC have issued tips for consumers  and firms publicizing practices that help avoid cramming.", "Consumers also face the risk their funds could be lost due to the failure of  their payment provider. Although consumers with funds in a bank account  have protection from this risk through federal deposit insurance up to  $250,000, consumers with funds in a mobile wallet may not be similarly  protected. To address this risk, some fintech firms deposit consumers\u2019  mobile wallet balances into an FDIC-insured bank or savings association,  resulting in the funds being insured by FDIC up to the applicable deposit  insurance limit in the event of the failure of the bank or savings  association. Other fintech firms voluntarily disclose to consumers in their  terms and conditions that any mobile wallet balances they hold are not FDIC insured. However, according to the Conference of State Bank  Supervisors (CSBS), 49 states have laws that require fintech firms  engaged in money transmission or stored value to self-insure through  bonding, holding investments against funds held or transmitted, and  meeting minimum net worth requirements.", "Further, consumers face the risk that their mobile wallet balances will not  be accessible in a timely manner. Under the Expedited Funds Availability  Act, banks are required to make customers\u2019 deposited funds available to  them within prescribed time frames. For example, banks are typically  required to make funds a customer receives through an electronic  transfer available by the next business day. However, as nonbanks,  fintech firms are not subject to this act\u2019s requirements and therefore do  not have to make mobile wallet balances available under the same time  frames. For example, one fintech firm we interviewed told us that most  transfers from mobile wallets to bank accounts make funds available by  the next business day, but certain circumstances, such as suspicious  account activity, may cause the firm to delay transfers a few days.  Another fintech firm we interviewed told us that transfer amounts are  limited based on anti-money laundering requirements. However, fintech  firms we spoke with voluntarily disclose the availability of funds and any  limits on access in the terms and conditions provided to customers when  they create their accounts. However, FTC recently settled with a fintech  payment provider for delays in fund accessibility experienced by its  users.  In its complaint, FTC charged that the firm had failed to disclose  that these funds could be frozen or removed based on the results of the  firm\u2019s review of the underlying transaction.

However, the Equal  Credit Opportunity Act requires lenders, including fintech lenders, that  deny credit to applicants to disclose the specific reasons for denial.

In  addition, advisers could make inaccurate or inappropriate economic  assumptions, perhaps due to a failure to factor in changing economic  conditions, which could result in flawed investment recommendations.

As a result, according to FDIC staff, consumers  could face losses if they store their virtual currencies with a mobile wallet  firm that goes out of business unless the firm offers private insurance.  Further, if consumers store their virtual currency on their own and  misplace or forget their account access information, they may lose access  to their funds. Unlike bank accounts for which users can reset passwords  or usernames, some wallets do not offer a way to reset such information.  To help consumers address these risks, federal agencies and state  regulators have issued documents publicizing practices that may help  consumers use virtual currency more safely.", "Tokens\u2014which may also function similarly to a security\u2014could pose  some unique risks to investors, and some investor protections may not be  available. Token sales, sometimes known as initial coin offerings or ICOs,  are being used by firms to raise capital from investors and may pose  investor risks, including fraud and theft. For example, one firm allegedly  promised investors it would invest its token sale earnings in real estate,  but instead allegedly defrauded investors of their investments. Fraud  and theft are risks of other securities offerings, and investors receive  protections from these risks under the Securities Act of 1933 and the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for token sales that meet SEC\u2019s  definition of a security. However, these protections do not apply to  investors who participate in token sales that do not meet the definition of  a security. In December 2017, SEC issued a cease-and-desist order to  one firm for failure to register their token sale with SEC. In addition,  SEC has reported that an investor\u2019s ability to recover funds may be  limited if key parties to token sales are located overseas or operating  unlawfully. To help investors address these risks, SEC and FINRA have  issued documents publicizing risks of token sale investment.", "Tokens traded on a platform may also be considered commodities and  may pose investor risks including fraud and theft. Platforms that facilitate  leveraged, margined, or financed trading of tokens may be subject to a  requirement to register with the CFTC. To help investors understand  tokens, CFTC has issued a report publicizing potential risks of virtual  currencies and clarifying cases in which investors may be at risk because  CFTC does not have oversight authority. For example, virtual currency  and token exchanges that conduct certain spot or cash market  transactions but do not use leverage, margin, or financing are not  required to follow all of the rules that regulated exchanges are required to  follow.", "DLT applications may pose other unknown risks compared to the  technologies and processes they replace, given that the technology is in  the early stages of development. For example, CFTC and the Federal  Reserve have identified cybersecurity and operational risks as potential  risks of DLT. FDIC officials said that finality of a transaction under a DLT  settlement may potentially raise legal challenges. Also, applications of  DLT that depend on consensus for validating transactions are vulnerable  to a \u201c51 percent attack,\u201d which could defraud consumers by revising their  transactions or sending fraudulent payments.

In addition, one market observer we interviewed told  us that hackers may target these new fintech firms before their security  systems are mature.", "However, according to literature we reviewed and fintech firms and  market observers we interviewed, some fintech firms have adopted  technologies or practices designed to mitigate security risks. For  example, new fintech firms can use the latest information technology  systems to secure their products instead of having to update older  systems. Additionally, as discussed above, some fintech firms use new  techniques and leverage mobile device features to enhance data security,  and one fintech firm said that it also uses technology that contacts clients  if a data breach issue arises. Like traditional financial institutions, rules  and guidelines implementing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)  generally require fintech firms to secure customer information. In  addition, some regulators have issued guidance to consumers publicizing  practices that help avoid security problems when using fintech products.  Regulators have also issued guidance to businesses including fintech  firms that recommends that they adopt policies and procedures that  address the prevention and detection of, and response to, cybersecurity  threats. For example, the New York State Department of Financial  Services requires regulated entities to meet cybersecurity requirements  outlined in regulation.", "Some fintech firms may also pose privacy concerns because they may  collect more consumer data than traditional firms. For example, fintech  lenders that use alternative data in underwriting may have sensitive  information about consumers\u2019 educational background, mobile phone  payments, or other data. One fintech firm we spoke with requires  consumers to provide additional data, such as what a payment is for, in  order to make peer-to-peer payments. Some data aggregators may hold  consumer data without disclosing what rights consumers have to delete  the data or prevent the data from being shared with other parties. A leak  of these or other data held by fintech firms may expose characteristics  that people view as sensitive. GLBA generally requires fintech firms and  traditional financial institutions to safeguard nonpublic personal  information about customers. According to literature we reviewed and  fintech firms and market observers we interviewed, as with data security,  some fintech firms use new technologies or mobile device features to  mitigate data privacy risks.

For example, in 2015, the  Financial Action Task Force (FATF) reported that new payment methods  pose an emerging terrorist finance vulnerability because users can  access these methods from anywhere in the world and it is difficult for  enforcement agencies to identify the beneficiary. However, FATF found  that the extent to which terrorist groups actually exploit these  technologies is unclear and said that enforcement agencies should  monitor these risks for developments. Further, FATF has stated that  fintech innovations provide an opportunity to bring anti-money laundering  efforts into the 21st century by reducing dependency on cash and  informal systems and making it easier for authorities to detect and follow  illicit financial flows. Relevant laws that prohibit financial crimes apply to  fintech products. For example, the Bank Secrecy Act (which established  reporting, recordkeeping, and other anti-money laundering requirements)  and economic sanctions programs (which create economic penalties in  support of U.S. policy priorities) apply to all financial firms that transmit  money regardless of whether they use traditional or fintech products.", "Finally, market observers have questioned whether fintech activities could  create risks to overall financial stability, but many have said such risks are  relatively minimal due to fintech firms\u2019 small market presence. While  direct or indirect linkages between large financial institutions could lead  financial problems at one firm to create similar problems for other firms  that can undermine financial stability, studies by regulators in various  countries and international organizations found that fintech firms have not  generally reached a level of interconnectedness where their financial  distress would threaten the stability of other financial system  participants. For example, the Bank for International Settlements and  the Financial Stability Board reported that in 2015 fintech accounted for 2  percent of new credit in the United States. Additionally, after assessing  virtual currencies, the European Central Bank concluded in a November  2017 report that virtual currencies were not a threat to financial stability  due to their limited connection with the real economy, their low volume  traded, and the lack of wide user acceptance.", "However, the Financial Stability Board and other market observers have  noted that fintech firms could potentially affect financial stability in both  positive and negative ways as the activities and firms evolve. For  example, fintech firms could help decentralize and diversify the financial  services market, and they could diversify exposure to risk by increasing  access to financial services for consumers and small businesses. On the  other hand, providers could potentially also increase risks to financial  stability. For example, robo-advisers could amplify swings in asset prices  if their risk models rely on similar algorithms, making the portfolio  allocation methods of robo-advisers more highly correlated than those of  traditional advisers, although according to the Financial Stability  Oversight Council, this risk could also arise if traditional advisers follow  similar allocation strategies. Similarly, according to the Financial Stability  Board, fintech lenders could potentially amplify swings in credit availability  if the investors that fund many marketplace lending products are more  willing to fund loans during market upturns or less willing to fund loans  during market downturns.

For  example, some fintech payments firms and fintech lenders have chosen  to partner with nationally chartered and state-chartered banks, which  allows them to operate nationwide without having to obtain individual  state licenses. Also, two fintech lenders have applied for an Industrial  Loan Corporation (ILC) charter, an FDIC-supervised state banking  charter, which commercial firms other than regulated financial institutions  can obtain in certain states to operate nationally. Such ILCs would also  be overseen by FDIC if they obtain FDIC deposit insurance.", "In addition, in December 2016, OCC announced its intent to consider  applications for special-purpose national bank charters from fintech firms  such as lenders, which would allow such firms to operate nationally under  a single national bank charter if finalized. However, OCC officials we  interviewed told us that this special-purpose national bank charter is on  hold because they are still reviewing whether to go forward with the  proposal, and CSBS has filed a lawsuit against OCC challenging the  fintech charter. Some fintech lending firms and an industry association  representing payments firms have expressed interest in applying for this  special charter, but other stakeholders we interviewed told us that the  proposed fintech charter may not be a good option for small fintech firms  if the capital requirements are the same as those for banks.", "In addition, state regulators are taking steps to make it easier for fintech  firms seeking to operate across multiple states. For example, CSBS staff  we interviewed told us that states leverage the Nationwide Multistate  Licensing System\u2014which enables firms to submit one application with  information that fulfills most of the licensing requirements of each state  that participates in this system. Staff from CSBS, some fintech firms,  and an industry observer we interviewed said that although the multistate  licensing system has reduced administrative requirements somewhat,  firms still have to make additional filings to address certain requirements  unique to some states. In February 2018, seven state regulators also  agreed to standardize key elements of the MSB licensing process and  mutually accept licensing findings. Additionally, in 2013, state  regulators established the Multi-State MSB Examination Taskforce, which  coordinates and facilitates multistate supervision of MSBs.  CSBS staff  told us that multistate exams have made the state MSB exam process  more efficient for state regulators and MSBs.", "In May 2017, the CSBS also announced they would be expanding efforts  to modernize state regulation of fintech firms. For example, under this  initiative, officials we interviewed told us they plan to redesign their multistate licensing system to provide a more  streamlined licensing process for new applicants and shift state  resources to higher-risk cases by 2018; plan to harmonize multistate supervision by establishing model  approaches to key aspects of nonbank supervision, making  examinations more uniform, identifying and reporting violations at the  national level, and creating a common technology platform for  examinations by 2019; and have formed a fintech industry advisory panel\u2014with sub-groups on  payments, lending, and banking\u2014to identify licensing and regulatory  challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges with Interagency Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Although a few fintech market participants and observers we interviewed  told us that they thought regulatory collaboration on fintech was sufficient,  the majority of market participants and observers we interviewed who  commented on interagency collaboration said that it could generally be  improved. Some also cited additional areas in which better interagency  collaboration could facilitate innovation:", "Use of alternative data and modeling in fintech lending. Fintech  lenders may face challenges because agencies with authorities  related to consumer protection and fair lending have not issued  guidance on the use of alternative data and modeling. For example,  one fintech lender we interviewed told us that they discussed using  alternative data to assess creditworthiness with FDIC and FTC, but  they do not understand what each agency might consider to be an  unfair, deceptive, or abusive practice because the agencies have not  coordinated positions. Staff we interviewed from two consulting firms  that advise on fintech told us that lack of clarity or coordination on fair  lending and use of alternative data and modeling creates uncertainty  for fintech lenders. This has led some fintech lenders to forgo use of  alternative data for underwriting purposes since they do not know if it  will produce outcomes that violate fair lending laws and regulations.  However, FDIC staff told us that FDIC applies the same standards as  FTC in determining whether an act or practice is unfair or deceptive  and that existing guidance on fair lending applies broadly to traditional  and nontraditional modeling techniques and data sources.", "OCC special-purpose national bank charter. A few market  participants and observers we interviewed told us that fintech  payment providers and lenders may face challenges because OCC  has not sufficiently coordinated with the Federal Reserve and FDIC on  OCC\u2019s special-purpose national bank charter. Despite OCC  discussion with the Federal Reserve, the charter proposal does not  specify whether recipients could access the Federal Reserve  payments system. Federal Reserve officials have said that the  Federal Reserve will likely not take any policy positions or make any  legal interpretations about the proposed charter until OCC finalizes  the charter\u2019s terms and a firm applies for a charter. Officials have said  that this is their position because the potential policy and legal  interpretation issues that could arise related to membership and  access to Federal Reserve services will require a case-by-case, fact- specific inquiry unique to any firm that moves forward with an  application. One fintech lender we interviewed told us that obtaining  consistent and complete information from OCC and the Federal  Reserve on the specific rights this charter would grant a fintech lender  had been challenging, and that this lack of consistency and clarity  could discourage fintech firms from applying for the charter. However,  OCC staff we interviewed told us that the charter is not yet final and  that they facilitate communication between fintech firms that are  interested in the special charter and the Federal Reserve. Also, OCC  staff said that they briefed FDIC staff on the special charter, but will  coordinate further if appropriate.", "Differing regulatory interpretation of consumer protection  requirements. As discussed above, fintech firms may be subject to  CFPB oversight and limited federal financial regulatory oversight if  they also partner with financial institutions. In addition, FTC and CFPB  can also take enforcement actions against fintech firms not registered  or chartered as a bank for violations of any federal consumer  protection laws they enforce. Fintech firms we spoke with said that  this can cause challenges because firms are concerned that  regulators may have different interpretations of what conduct might  merit consumer protection enforcement actions, and a research and  consulting firm we interviewed that works with fintech start-ups told us  that this is one of the industry\u2019s biggest challenges. Similarly, the  potential for differing regulatory interpretation may limit the  effectiveness of agency efforts to innovate. For example, fintech firms  can apply for a CFPB No Action Letter, which is intended to reduce  regulatory uncertainty for financial products or services that promise  substantial consumer benefit but face uncertainty regarding consumer  protection requirements. However, some entities we spoke with said  that few firms have applied, in part because a letter provided by CFPB  may not preclude prudential regulators or FTC from taking  enforcement actions in cases where they have jurisdiction.", "Although stakeholders indicated that agencies could improve interagency  collaboration on other fintech issues, federal agencies said that they  already collaborate through a variety of informal and formal channels at  the domestic and international levels. Domestically, in addition to informal  discussions and participation in fintech events hosted by other agencies,  some agencies have coordinated examinations of third-party service  providers and enforcement actions. For example, in 2014 and 2015,  CFPB, FCC, FTC, and state regulators coordinated on enforcement  actions related to unauthorized mobile carrier billing charges. Also, U.S.  agencies have had informal discussions regarding fintech with their  foreign counterparts. For example, Treasury staff have discussed  regulations designed to counter money laundering and terrorist financing  with officials from countries such as France and the United Kingdom. In  addition, federal agencies have begun to collaborate on fintech regulatory  issues through formal interagency working groups that are primarily  concerned with other financial regulatory issues. For example, at the  domestic level, U.S. prudential regulators have discussed issues related  to potential risks of fintech lending and DLT through the Financial Stability  Oversight Council. At the international level, the Federal Reserve  represents the United States at the Bank for International Settlements,  which has published papers on fintech topics including payments, fintech  lending, and DLT. For more information on these efforts and others, see  appendix II.", "Further, federal agencies said that they have recently organized the  following interagency collaborative groups dedicated to fintech, as  detailed in appendix II:  In March 2017, the Federal Reserve convened the Interagency  Fintech Discussion Forum, an informal group which meets  approximately every 4 to 6 weeks and aims to facilitate information  sharing among consumer compliance staff from the federal banking  regulators on fintech consumer protection issues and supervisory  outcomes. Discussion topics have included account aggregation,  alternative data and modeling techniques, and third-party oversight.", "In 2016, Treasury created the Interagency Working Group on  Marketplace Lending, which was active over the course of fiscal year  2016, meeting 3 times. This group shared information among  industry participants and public interest groups, and discussed issues  from a Treasury report on benefits and risks associated with online  marketplace lending.", "In 2010, the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Boston created  the Mobile Payments Industry Workgroup to facilitate discussions  among industry stakeholders about how a successful mobile  payments system could evolve in the United States. This group also  functions as an interagency collaboration mechanism through biennial  meetings between industry stakeholders and relevant regulators that  update industry on regulatory concerns, identify potential regulatory  gaps, and educate regulators on mobile payment technologies.", "However, we found that these groups do not include all relevant  participants. For example, NCUA was not included in the Interagency  Fintech Discussion Forum or the Interagency Working Group on  Marketplace Lending, and FCC has not participated in the biennial  regulator meetings of the Mobile Payments Industry Workgroup since  2012. Federal Reserve staff said that they did not include NCUA in the  Interagency Fintech Discussion Forum because NCUA is not a bank  regulator. Treasury staff noted that staff who could explain why NCUA  had not been invited to participate in the Interagency Working Group on  Marketplace Lending were no longer with the agency. Similarly, FCC staff  could not recall why they had not participated in recent biennial regulator  meetings of the Mobile Payments Industry Workgroup.", "However, NCUA has experiences and perspectives that would make it a  relevant participant in the Interagency Fintech Discussion Forum, and  NCUA officials said that they would participate in these interagency  efforts if invited. NCUA would be a relevant participant because, although  it does not oversee banks, it oversees credit unions that have entered into  partnerships with fintech lenders and virtual currency exchanges, and  could enter into partnerships with other fintech firms. Similar to fintech  partnerships with banks, these partnerships could create risks related to  safety and soundness and consumer protection. Further, NCUA\u2019s 2018\u2013 2022 draft strategic plan includes fintech as a key risk to the credit union  system because fintech could provide a competitive challenge to credit  unions or take advantage of differences in how credit unions and fintech  firms are regulated, among other things.", "Likewise, as Federal Reserve staff have acknowledged, FCC could be a  relevant participant in biennial regulators meetings of the Mobile  Payments Industry Workgroup because FCC could share valuable insight  on regulatory concerns related to mobile device security with other  regulators and industry participants. Specifically, FCC has facilitated and  encouraged industry efforts to improve security of mobile devices, on  which consumers make fintech payments, and has conducted related  consumer education efforts. FCC staff said they would consider  participating in future biennial regulator meetings of the Mobile Payments  Industry Workgroup if the topics discussed aligned with FCC\u2019s work on  mobile device security.", "Our past work has identified key practices relating to collaborative  mechanisms among agencies that increase their effectiveness, such as  including participants with the appropriate knowledge, skills, and  abilities. In addition, these key practices also state that an interagency  group should continue to reach out to potential participants who may have  a shared interest in order to ensure that opportunities for achieving  outcomes are not missed.", "However, we found that interagency collaborative efforts dedicated to  fintech issues were not fully leveraging relevant agency expertise. Lack of  NCUA participation in the Interagency Fintech Discussion Forum may  preclude NCUA and the other participating agencies from sharing  information that could be useful in efforts to oversee the risks that fintech  poses to their regulated institutions. Similarly, lack of FCC participation in  the biennial regulators meetings of the Mobile Payments Industry  Workgroup could preclude industry participants from receiving updates on  FCC regulatory concerns related to mobile device security and could  preclude FCC from learning about new risks that fintech payments  products pose to mobile device security.", "Furthermore, OCC and international bodies have identified fintech as an  area where collaboration among agencies can be helpful. For example,  OCC has stated that collaboration among supervisors can promote a  common understanding and consistent application of laws, regulations,  and guidance through steps such as establishing regular channels of  communication. At the international level, the Bank for International  Settlements has recommended that bank supervisors in jurisdictions  where responsibilities related to fintech are fragmented among a number  of regulators with overlapping authorities should collaborate with other  relevant agencies to develop standards and regulatory oversight for  fintech, as appropriate. Similarly, the Financial Stability Board has  suggested that responsible agencies further open lines of communication  to address cross-cutting fintech issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Disagreements on Aggregation of Consumer Financial Account Information Create the Need for Stronger Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Among other consumer protection issues related to financial account  aggregation, market participants do not agree about whether consumers  using account aggregators will be reimbursed if they experience  fraudulent losses in their financial accounts. While some account  aggregators negotiate contracts with the financial institutions that hold the  consumer accounts that are being aggregated, other account aggregators  have no relationship with the financial institutions holding the consumer  accounts that they access on behalf of those consumers. Officials from at  least one large bank have made public statements that they may not  reimburse losses from consumer accounts if the consumer provided his  or her account credentials to an account aggregator and fraudulent  activity subsequently occurs in the consumer\u2019s account. In contrast, some  account aggregators and consumer protection groups have argued that  consumer protection law establishes that banks retain the obligation to  reimburse losses due to transactions not authorized by the consumers.", "To date, CFPB and the Federal Reserve have taken varying public  positions on this disagreement among market participants, and some  regulators told us that they have held related discussions with market  participants and observers. In October 2017, CFPB issued principles for  consumer-authorized financial data sharing and aggregation that stated  that consumers should have reasonable and practical means to dispute  and resolve instances of unauthorized transactions. However, CFPB\u2019s  principles are not binding and federal financial regulators have not issued  guidance or rules to clarify this issue. As previously mentioned, CFPB  also issued a request for information studying these topics to various  industry members, observers, and consumers in November 2016. A  member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has  publicly stated that industry stakeholders will need to come to agreement  on which party bears responsibility for unauthorized transactions. Also,  Federal Reserve staff told us that some financial institutions and account  aggregators are negotiating contractual arrangements that could address  this issue on a case-by-case basis. In addition, staff from FDIC, the  Federal Reserve, and OCC said that they have discussed related issues  with market participants and observers.", "The financial regulators have recently begun to hold collaborative  information sharing discussions on consumer compliance issues  surrounding financial account aggregation, but this collaboration has not  resulted in any coordinated public outcomes on the issues. In May 2017,  the federal financial regulators\u2014CFPB, the Federal Reserve, FDIC,  NCUA, and OCC\u2014and representatives of state financial regulators began  to share information on account aggregation and related consumer  compliance issues through the Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council (FFIEC) Task Force on Supervision and the FFIEC Task Force  on Consumer Compliance. The regulators are collaborating through  FFIEC because they acknowledge that account aggregation issues cross  agency jurisdictions. According to participating agency officials, FFIEC  discussions have covered responsibilities for consumer reimbursement  due to fraudulent charges and access to consumer data, generated an  internal paper on consumer compliance issues, and previewed CFPB\u2019s  principles for consumer-authorized financial data sharing and aggregation  prior to publication. However, as of November 2017, these efforts have  not generated public outcomes to guide market participants.", "The federal financial regulators\u2019 missions include ensuring that  consumers are protected. CFPB\u2019s primary mission is to protect  consumers in the financial marketplace, including ensuring that markets  for consumer financial products and services operate transparently and  efficiently to facilitate access and innovation. Similarly, according to their  mission and vision statements, the banking and credit union regulators  help protect consumer rights by supervising financial institutions to help  ensure compliance with consumer protections.", "However, some of the regulators told us that they have not taken more  steps to resolve the disagreements surrounding financial account  aggregation because they are concerned over acting too quickly. For  example, Federal Reserve staff we interviewed told us that premature  regulatory action could be detrimental to the negotiations between  individual financial institutions and financial account aggregators.  Similarly, OCC staff we interviewed told us that OCC staff does not  recommend publishing guidance or rules while the account aggregation  industry is evolving because regulation should not constantly change.  Nonetheless, the financial regulators could take additional steps to  address these issues without prematurely issuing rules or regulations.  Further, the FFIEC IT Examination Handbook on e-Banking\u2019s appendix  on aggregation services, which the financial regulators use in their  examinations of banks, indicates that the financial regulators have been  aware since at least 2003 that regulatory requirements related to  consumer protection responsibilities of financial account aggregators are  not clear.", "Incorporating leading practices on collaboration could strengthen the  efforts that regulators are making to address financial account  aggregation issues. As discussed previously, our prior work has  developed interagency collaboration principles that make efforts among  agencies more likely to be effective. These principles find that  collaborative efforts should define the short-term and long-term outcomes  that the collaboration is seeking to achieve and clarify the roles and  responsibilities of the participating agencies, among other things.  Although banking regulators and CFPB have discussed issues related to  account aggregation within FFIEC, these discussions have not yet  defined outcomes or produced any public outcomes to help guide fintech  firms and traditional financial institutions which could help lead to market- based solutions, or defined agency roles and responsibilities. In addition,  market participants, CSBS staff, and a member of the Board of Governors  of the Federal Reserve System have said that additional collaboration on  financial account aggregation issues\u2014including reimbursement for  unauthorized transactions\u2014would be beneficial. Similarly, in its 2017  annual report, the Financial Stability Oversight Council encouraged  financial regulators to monitor how fintech products affect consumers and  regulated entities and to coordinate regulatory approaches, as  appropriate.", "Acting collaboratively to help address consumer compliance issues  related to financial account aggregation could help financial regulators  better meet their consumer protection missions. Improved collaboration  could help regulators and market participants resolve disagreements over  account aggregation and related consumer compliance issues more  quickly and in a manner that balances the competing interests involved.  Taking steps now, while the discussion on financial account aggregation  is in its relatively early stages, could help federal regulators better  address these needs over the long term. Until regulators coordinate and  assist the industry in clarifying and balancing the valid interests on both  sides, consumers could have to choose between facing potential losses  or not using what they may find to be an otherwise valuable financial  service, and fintech firms providing useful services to consumers will face  barriers to providing their offerings more broadly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges Involving Fintech Partnerships with Banks", "paragraphs": ["Partnerships between fintech firms and financial institutions are  increasingly common because such partnerships offer benefits to both  parties involved. According to literature we reviewed and market  participants and observers we interviewed, the benefits to banks can  include the ability to meet consumer demand by providing their customers  with access to innovative products that provide good user experiences  without having to dedicate extensive internal time or resources. Market  observers and Federal Reserve staff we interviewed told us that this  benefit may be particularly important for small banks and credit unions,  which have fewer staff and fewer financial resources for research and  development. Similarly, the benefits to fintech firms can include access to  banking services and networks, customer acquisition, and assistance with  regulatory compliance. Some fintech firms enter contractual agreements  to partner with banks through white-labeling, a type of partnership where  the bank markets the fintech firm\u2019s product as its own when soliciting  customers. Other fintech firms enter contractual partnerships with banks  as stand-alone third-party relationships. For example, some fintech  lenders make loans to customers and partner with a bank that originates  or purchases loans sourced through the fintech lender.", "However, because banks are liable for risks posed by third parties as  discussed above, fintech firms may face delays in entering into  partnerships with banks. Financial regulators have issued guidance on  risk management for financial institutions\u2019 relationships with third  parties. Among other things, this guidance explains that financial  institutions are expected to conduct proper due diligence in selecting  partners and to monitor the activities conducted by third parties for  compliance with relevant laws, rules, and regulations, considering areas  such as consumer protection, anti-money laundering/counter-terrorist  financing, and security and privacy requirements. Banks, fintech firms,  and market observers we interviewed told us that banks may interpret this  guidance conservatively. Large banks may also spend significant time  conducting due diligence on the practices and controls in place at the  fintech firms seeking to partner with them in order to prevent unnecessary  compliance or operational risks, while a banking association told us that  small banks with fewer resources to dedicate to due diligence may be  unwilling to risk partnering with fintech firms. Banks, fintech firms, and  market observers we interviewed told us that bank due diligence can also  lead to lengthy delays in establishing partnerships, which can put fintech  firms at risk of going out of business if they do not have sufficient funding  and are not able to access new customers through a bank partner.

However, some initiatives may not be appropriate for the U.S.  regulatory structure. For example, adopting certain initiatives could raise  concerns about U.S. agencies picking winners, in which firms that  participate in these programs may be better positioned to succeed than  other firms.

Further, one fintech firm noted that when they were able to  identify their regulators, they had difficulty finding a point of contact at the  regulators. Officials from three regulators that we interviewed also noted  that they had been contacted by fintech firms that were confused about  their regulatory status and did not fall under the agency\u2019s regulatory  authority, but were subject to oversight by other regulators.", "Regulators in the U.S. and abroad have taken steps to better facilitate  interactions with fintech firms, including by establishing innovation offices  with dedicated staff to serve as a front door for start-up firms or  innovators to find information on regulation and to contact the agency.  These innovation offices generally maintain a webpage hosted on the  agencies\u2019 websites, a dedicated e-mail address, or dedicated staff.  Through these innovation offices, some agencies offer services including  office hours during which regulatory staff are available to meet and  provide informal guidance. For example, CFPB officials said that, as of  August 2017, they had met with approximately 115 companies in four  such events in New York and San Francisco, under the agency\u2019s Project  Catalyst. Similarly, OCC officials noted that through their Office of  Innovation, they have been able to answer regulatory questions for  fintech firms and connect firms to relevant OCC offices. Since the launch  of LabCFTC, CFTC\u2019s innovation office, in May 2017, CFTC officials have  met with more than 100 entities through office hour sessions in New York,  Chicago, and Washington, D.C.", "In addition to office hours, several regulators have held fintech events  through their innovation offices. For example, FTC has held three fintech  forum events comprising panel discussions with industry experts,  covering topics such as marketplace lending and distributed ledger  technology. Several regulators have also issued publications on various  fintech topics, which are posted to the dedicated webpages for those  agencies with innovation offices.", "Some regulators from other jurisdictions also facilitated regular interaction  with firms through their innovation offices. For example, through its  Innovation Hub, the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) Financial Conduct Authority  offers informal regulatory guidance to individual firms directly and through  posted publications; operates its regulatory sandbox, described below;  and engages with industry participants through various events. Similarly,  through a program called Looking Glass, the Monetary Authority of  Singapore offers fintech firms training and consultation on regulation and  provides a space for fintech firms to give product demonstrations to  regulators and banks. Regulators and fintech firms we interviewed abroad  said that these innovation offices have helped firms better understand  their regulatory obligations and help regulators identify and address risks  early. For example, representatives of a robo-adviser firm we interviewed  in Hong Kong said that their interactions with the Hong Kong Securities  and Futures Commission\u2019s innovation office\u2014known as the Fintech  Contact Point\u2014made identifying and obtaining guidance from the  appropriate regulatory officials easier, which helped the firm more  efficiently develop a product compliant with applicable regulations.", "Some fintech firms and industry observers stated that U.S. regulators\u2019  innovation offices have helped fintech firms by offering a point of contact  for new entrants in the industry. Additionally, in a 2009 report, we created  a framework that identified characteristics of an effective financial  regulatory system. One of the characteristics was that regulators  should oversee new products as they come onto the market to take action  as needed to protect consumers and investors, without unnecessarily  hindering innovation. Figure 5 summarizes efforts that we reviewed by  regulators in the U.S. and abroad to implement initiatives to improve  interactions with fintech firms.", "However, FDIC and NCUA have not established innovation offices for  various reasons. For example, FDIC staff said that, although the agency  has not formally evaluated establishing an innovation office, they have  met with fintech firms to discuss deposit insurance applications.  Associated with the deposit application process, the agency has  established central points of contact for all interested parties, not only  fintech firms. NCUA said that its lack of legal authority over third-party  service providers limited the usefulness of an innovation office, since  fintech providers are often third-party service providers. However, by not  dedicating specific staff, as occurs with the establishment of an innovation  office, these regulators could be less able to interact with fintech firms in  their sectors and fintech firms that partner with their regulated entities.  Other regulators who, similar to FDIC and NCUA, generally do not directly  oversee third-party providers, though they may have such authority, have  noted benefits from establishing innovation offices. For example, OCC,  which has a similar mission to these two regulators, has formed such an  office and OCC staff said that the agency has benefited by learning about  industry trends involving fintech and by improving interactions with fintech  firms and banks. Similarly, Federal Reserve officials we interviewed said  that efforts through its innovation office have helped staff better  understand fintech issues and have particularly helped its examiners  better understand banks that partner with fintech companies.

Based on interviews  with regulators and firms abroad and a literature review, initiatives that we  studied include regulatory sandboxes, proofs-of-concepts, innovation  competitions or awards, and agency-led accelerators. Regulatory  sandboxes that we studied were agency-led programs that allow firms to  test innovative products; services; business models; or delivery  mechanisms in a live environment, subject to agreed-upon testing  parameters. The proofs of concept that we reviewed were similar to  sandboxes, but for these programs regulators issued a request for  proposals to industry to develop a product that is conceptual; that is, an  idea for a product that is not yet on the market. In the fintech competitions  that we studied, regulators invited firms to develop solutions to problem  statements drafted by agencies or financial institutions. Accelerators that  we reviewed provided funding; access to regulators and mentors;  connections to outside funding sources; potential clients; and working  space to fintech firms and start-ups.", "One approach regulators abroad were using to learn about fintech  activities was regulatory sandboxes. While a few U.S. regulators have  undertaken efforts that are similar to regulatory sandboxes, most have  not. Two regulators that we interviewed stated that tools already exist,  such as the comment process, to fulfill the role of a sandbox by helping  them better understand innovation and assist in the development of rules  and guidance. However, other U.S. regulators said that creating  regulatory sandboxes by using tools such as No Action Letters could  benefit regulators and firms. Based on our analysis of selected  jurisdictions\u2019 efforts, regulatory sandbox programs generally may include  the following elements:  firms apply to participate;  firms and regulators agree on the parameters of how products or  services will be tested, such as the number of consumers or  transactions included in the test, the required product disclosures, or  the time frame of the test;  firms secure the appropriate licenses, if applicable; and  firms and regulators interact regularly.", "In some cases, the sandbox may include limited regulatory relief. For  example, UK regulators we interviewed noted that they can waive or  modify a rule, issue a \u201cno enforcement action\u201d letter, or provide a  restricted license for a firm participating in the sandbox. However, these  tools are used on a case-by-case basis for the duration of the sandbox  test, are not used for every participating firm, and would not limit any  consumer protections. Further, UK regulators we interviewed said that  while waiving or modifying rules is possible, they are only used on an  exceptional basis. Similarly, Singapore regulators said that they can relax  specific legal and regulatory requirements, such as capital requirements,  on a case-by-case basis for firms while they are participating in the  sandbox. Also, Hong Kong regulators allow firms to operate without full  regulatory compliance for the limited product offerings within the sandbox.  Similar to UK and Singapore regulators, Hong Kong regulators we  interviewed said that they have put safeguards in place to protect  consumers from and manage the risk of the regulatory relief. For a more  detailed description of the Hong Kong, Singapore, and UK sandboxes,  see appendix III.", "Regulators and market participants we interviewed abroad said that these  fintech sandboxes have helped regulators better understand products and  more effectively determine appropriate regulatory approaches while  limiting the risk that the failure of a fintech firm could pose to consumers.  Some participating firms we interviewed told us they benefited by being  able to test products with customers, make changes to their business  model, and understand how their products would be regulated. Moreover,  two participating firms and a regulator we interviewed said that firms are  able to introduce their products to the market more quickly because they  are able to test their products in the market while becoming compliant  with laws and regulations. One fintech firm that participated in the UK  sandbox pointed out that the UK regulators better understood their firm\u2019s  technology and business model because of interactions in the sandbox.  For example, although the company and regulatory officials had  previously disagreed on whether the firm\u2019s product needed to be  regulated, after gaining a better understanding of the company\u2019s business  model through interactions in the sandbox, the regulatory officials agreed  that the product did not require regulatory oversight. Similarly, Singapore  regulators we interviewed noted that their sandbox provides them a  hands-on approach to learning about new technologies and how the  technologies align with regulatory requirements.", "Some U.S. regulators have programs that share some characteristics with  sandboxes. As shown in figure 6, CFPB, SEC, and CFTC have issued No  Action Letters in which agency staff state that they do not intend to  recommend certain regulatory action against the firms if they offer the  products in the way described in a request letter to the regulator. The  issuance of such letters could assist fintech firms in cases in which the  applicability of existing regulations to their product is unclear. However,  similar to sandboxes abroad, CFPB officials stated that No Action Letters  do not provide safe harbor for companies taking actions that are clearly  not allowed under U.S. consumer regulations. As of March 6, 2018, CFPB  had issued one No Action Letter to Upstart Network, a company that uses  alternative data to assess creditworthiness and underwrite loans.

As of March 6, 2018, CFPB had not issued  any trial disclosure waivers.", "Through its Project Catalyst, CFPB has also established a research pilot  program where it collaborates with firms that are testing innovative  products to understand consumer use and policy implications of  innovative products.

The proofs of concept that  we studied are similar to sandboxes in that the regulator has regular  interaction with the company to better understand the product or  technology, but the product is not introduced into the market during the  proof of concept period. For example, the Bank of England, through its  Accelerator program, uses proofs of concept to have firms develop  technology that can help the agency improve its operations, according to  agency officials. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, which, among other  things, regulates banks in its jurisdiction, uses proofs of concept to allow  industry participants to develop products that are conceptual and not  ready for market implementation. A firm we interviewed that participated  in a proof of concept with Hong Kong Monetary Authority said that it  offered the regulator the opportunity to gain a working understanding of  the technology, while providing a test environment for the company to  tailor the technology to adhere to regulatory requirements.", "CFTC officials noted that they are exploring the ability to conduct proofs  of concept through LabCFTC. CFTC officials noted that the agency would  be well positioned to conduct proofs of concept because they already  collect large amounts of market data that could potentially be leveraged  for such projects.

Fintech products often pose risks to those of  traditional financial products, although in some cases fintech products  pose additional risks. While existing consumer protection and other laws  apply to some fintech products and services, in some cases fintech  transactions may not be covered by such protections. The extent to which  the activities of fintech providers are subject to routine federal oversight  varies, but fintech firms not overseen by a federal body generally are  subject to oversight by state regulators. While limited evidence of  widespread problems has surfaced to date, as the prevalence of fintech  products grows, risks posed by segments of the industry that regulators  do not routinely examine could correspondingly grow. Therefore, efforts  regulators by regulators to monitor developments and risks posed by  these firms and their financial innovations remains a sound approach.", "With fintech products spanning across financial sectors and jurisdictions  of the numerous U.S. regulatory bodies, many parties have called for  improved regulatory coordination. While regulators have taken steps to  collaborate, opportunities remain to improve collaboration in line with  GAO\u2019s leading practices. For example, the Interagency Fintech  Discussion Forum and the biennial meetings of the Federal Reserve  Mobile Payments Industry Workgroup do not include NCUA and FCC,  respectively, agencies that could add valuable perspectives. Without  these agencies, these efforts are not fully leveraging relevant agency  expertise, and NCUA and FCC may be precluded from learning about  risks that are relevant to their authorities.", "Among other consumer protection issues related to financial account  aggregation, market participants do not agree about whether consumers  using account aggregators will be reimbursed if they experience  fraudulent losses in their financial accounts. Until regulators coordinate  and assist the industry in clarifying and balancing the valid interests of  consumers, financial account aggregators, and financial institutions,  consumers could have to choose between facing potential losses or not  using what they may find to be an otherwise valuable financial service.  Although regulators have been reluctant to act too quickly in light of  related industry efforts, they could increase collaboration to address key  issues such as consumer reimbursement for unauthorized transactions.  Aligning ongoing collaborative efforts with leading practices could help  regulators and market participants resolve disagreements over financial  account aggregation and related consumer compliance issues more  quickly and in a manner that balances the competing interests involved.", "With our past work finding that an effective financial regulatory system  needs to be flexible and forward looking to allow regulators to more  readily adapt and oversee new products, U.S. regulators could potentially  improve their oversight of innovative fintech activities by considering  adoption of some of the efforts already being successfully used by  regulators abroad. While constraints may limit the ability or willingness of  regulators to fully adopt these practices, opportunities exist to assess  ways to tailor them to the U.S. context. Some U.S. regulators have  established innovation offices that can help fintech providers more easily  obtain needed information from relevant regulators; however, FDIC and  NCUA have not established such offices, which could help facilitate these  regulators\u2019 interactions with fintech firms and with the entities they  regulate. Also, initiatives such as regulatory sandboxes or proofs-of- concept that provide fintech firms the opportunity to operate and share  information with appropriate regulators have helped regulators abroad  educate their staff and thereby improve their oversight capacities.  However, the Federal Reserve, CFTC, FDIC, NCUA, and SEC have not  initiated such programs due to concerns about favoring certain  competitors over others or that they may not have the authority to initiate  these programs.

FCA has stated that its sandbox has  (1) reduced the time and cost of getting innovative ideas to market; (2)  facilitated access to finance for innovators; (3) enabled products to be  tested and introduced to the market; and (4) helped the agency build  appropriate consumer protection safeguards into new products and  services. The characteristics of the FCA sandbox, according to the  agency, are listed below.", "Eligible Participants: Currently regulated firms as well as  unregulated firms.", "Eligibility Criteria: Firms submit an application outlining how they  meet the eligibility criteria for testing, which are (1) carrying out or  supporting financial services business in the UK; (2) genuinely  innovative; (3) identifiable consumer benefit; (4) need for sandbox  testing; and (5) ready to test.", "Testing Parameters: If a firm is unauthorized it must obtain  authorization or restricted authorization prior to participation in the  sandbox. Prior to participating in the sandbox a firm must design, and  obtain agreement on, the parameters of the sandbox test, including  the duration; customer selection; customer safeguards; disclosures;  data; and testing plans.", "FCA has four ways that it can help firms operate more easily in its  sandbox. First, it can provide restricted authorizations that are a tailored  authorization process for firms accepted into the sandbox. Any  authorization or registration is restricted to allow firms to test only their  ideas as agreed upon with agency staff, which is intended to make the  process easier for firms to meet requirements and reduce the cost and  time to initiate the test, according to the agency. Second, FCA provides  individual guidance to firms in the sandbox that are unclear on how the  agency\u2019s rules apply, whereby FCA will interpret the regulatory  requirements in the context of the firm\u2019s specific test. Third, in some  cases, FCA may be able to waive or modify an unduly burdensome rule  for the purposes of the sandbox test, but it cannot waive national or  international laws. Finally, FCA can issue no enforcement action letters in  cases where they cannot issue individual guidance or waivers but they  believe regulatory relief is justified for the circumstances of the sandbox.  According to the agency, no enforcement action letters are offered only  during the duration of the sandbox test to firms that keep to the agreed- upon testing parameters and that treat customers fairly. Also, no  enforcement action letters only apply to FCA disciplinary action and do  not limit any liabilities to consumers. Officials we interviewed noted that  rule waivers and no enforcement action letters are rarely used tools. As of  January 2018, FCA had received more than 200 sandbox applications.  Eighteen firms had successfully graduated from the first cohort, 24 firms  were preparing to test in the second cohort, and 18 other firms were  accepted to test in the third cohort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s Regulatory Sandbox", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that when lack of clarity over whether a new financial service  complies with legal and regulatory requirements could cause some  financial institutions or start-ups to choose not to implement an  innovation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s (MAS) purpose in  establishing its sandbox was to encourage such experimentation so that  promising innovations could be tested in the market and have a chance  for wider adoption, according to the agency.

However, they emphasized that their  sandbox is not intended and cannot be used as a means to circumvent  legal and regulatory requirements. MAS staff determines the specific legal  and regulatory requirements that they may be willing to relax on a case- by-case basis. According to MAS, some of the regulatory requirements  that could be relaxed included maintenance of certain levels of financial  soundness, solvency, capital adequacy, and credit ratings as well as  licensing fees, board composition requirements, and management  experience requirements, among others. However, MAS has also laid out  some requirements that it will not consider relaxing, including those  regarding consumer information confidentiality, anti-money laundering,  and countering terrorist financing. MAS officials said that all firms in the  sandbox will receive some form of regulatory relaxation. As of November  2017, MAS had received more than 30 sandbox applications.
