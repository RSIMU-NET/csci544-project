Enrollees received a broader range of services from DOD than in the past, when they got care only when space was available in DOD facilities. Officials also noted that providing more comprehensive care to seniors helped sharpen the skills of military clinical staff, which contributed to their readiness for supporting combat or other military missions.

As nonenrollees, Medicare-eligibles had access to care at military treatment facilities (MTF) only to the extent that space not utilized by TRICARE\u2019s enrolled population was available. By law, DOD could not receive payments from Medicare and was not responsible for providing the full range of benefits to Medicare-eligibles. Recently, the situation has changed.", "In 1997, Congress authorized the DOD Medicare subvention demonstration for a 3-year period. Under this demonstration, DOD formed Medicare managed care organizations that enrolled and served Medicare-eligible military retirees at six sites. The DOD Medicare plan, which was called TRICARE Senior Prime, combined TRICARE with Medicare benefits and requirements. The demonstration also authorized DOD to receive payment from Medicare if certain conditions were met. Senior Prime gave enrollees the same priority for military care as younger retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime, with minimal out-of-pocket costs. With TRICARE Prime as its foundation, Senior Prime illustrated issues that arose in bringing older retirees into DOD managed care. A major change in health care arrangements for Medicare-eligible retirees from the uniformed services will take place October 1, 2001. Under provisions of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, these retirees will become eligible for TRICARE and will be able to use their Medicare benefit within TRICARE. The new program is commonly termed TRICARE For Life. Experience under Senior Prime illustrated some issues that TRICARE might face in serving Medicare beneficiaries.", "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), which established the demonstration, also directed us to evaluate it during its initially authorized 3-year period. Our evaluation covers three key areas: effects on beneficiaries in terms of access and quality of care; the feasibility of the demonstration and the difficulties in implementing it; and costs to Medicare and DOD. We have issued several interim reports, including a report on implementation issues during the demonstration\u2019s start-up phase, and will issue further reports\u2014including a final report on the demonstration\u2014later this year.", "This interim report focuses on implementation of the demonstration once its start-up phase was completed. Our objectives are to describe (1) the status of the demonstration after roughly 2 years of operation, (2) its effect on enrollees, sites, and providers, and (3) challenges encountered in managing Senior Prime. To do so, we visited each of the demonstration sites and interviewed military and contractor officials. We reviewed site documents and examined legislation, agency policies, and other reports concerning Medicare and the military health system. We interviewed health care and contracting officials at DOD headquarters, and spoke with Medicare officials. We also reviewed performance information available to managers at the sites but did not analyze or verify the underlying data.

An additional 1.5 million retirees (including dependents) aged 65 and older could receive limited health care. DOD delivers care through about 600 MTFs worldwide. TRICARE covers a broad range of outpatient and inpatient services, including home health, hospice, and skilled nursing facility care. Services not available at an MTF are purchased through a network of civilian specialists and hospitals. TRICARE includes a managed care option, TRICARE Prime, which offers care at the MTF augmented by the civilian network. TRICARE Prime enrollees, including all active duty members of the armed services, have priority for care at the MTFs. There is also a fee-for-service option called TRICARE Standard that offers a broader choice of civilian providers, and a preferred provider option called TRICARE Extra. These options offer generally similar benefits but differ considerably in the nature and amount of costs to beneficiaries. Pharmacy services are available at most MTFs for all TRICARE eligibles as well as for retirees on Medicare. MTF pharmacy services are free-of-charge but limited to the medications carried at each MTF.", "TRICARE is managed at multiple levels. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs sets TRICARE policy \u2013 which governs both MTF and civilian care \u2013 and establishes regulations in coordination with the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Responsibility for policy execution is delegated to the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) but is shared with the military Surgeons General, who are responsible for implementing TRICARE policies within their respective services. TMA performs programwide support functions, such as managing TRICARE\u2019s information technology and data systems, preparing the budget and managing the accounts. In addition, TMA selects, directs and pays managed care support contractors, who maintain the private provider network and perform many services assisting beneficiaries and supporting management. In each TRICARE region within the United States, MTF and contractor activities are coordinated by a lead agent, usually the commander of the region\u2019s largest MTF. At the MTF level, MTF commanders report to the Surgeon General of their respective service, who allocates part of the service\u2019s appropriated funds to each MTF.

They also can pay a monthly premium to join Part B, which covers physician and outpatient services as well as those home health services not covered under Part A. Traditional Medicare allows beneficiaries to choose any provider that accepts Medicare payment and requires beneficiaries to pay for part of their care as well as for any services not covered by Medicare. To help meet these costs, some beneficiaries purchase supplemental \u201cMedigap\u201d policies from private insurers. Beneficiaries can choose from up to 10 standard policies. The less expensive cover Medicare deductibles and coinsurance, while the more expensive policies offer broader coverage, including prescription drugs. The alternative to traditional Medicare, Medicare+Choice, offers beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care or other private health plans.

In addition, retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime could \u201cage in\u201d to Senior Prime upon reaching age 65, even if the cap had been reached. Beneficiaries enrolled in the program paid the Medicare Part B premium but no additional premium to DOD. Senior Prime enrollees received the same priority for care at the MTFs as younger retirees enrolled in TRICARE Prime.

HCFA calculated capitation rates for the demonstration areas, discounted from what Medicare would pay private managed care plans in the same area.

At these smaller facilities, much of the specialty care is provided by the civilian network. At the Dover site, the MTF is a clinic that offers only outpatient services, thus requiring all inpatient and specialty care to be obtained at another MTF or purchased from the civilian network.

In fact, the majority of those eligible to age-in did so. All but one MTF enrolled more age-ins than expected, and by December 2000 age-ins accounted for about one-fifth of overall Senior Prime enrollment. (See table 2.) This increased concern among MTF officials about MTFs\u2019 capacity to accommodate future growth, especially at sites that had reached their enrollment caps early in the demonstration.

Senior Prime also augmented its network to provide services such as skilled nursing facility care that DOD did not provide to seniors under space-available care.", "Site officials said that providing a broad range of primary and specialty care to seniors also benefited MTF clinical staff. Providing a broader set of services to seniors exposed staff to a wider range of conditions than seen under space-available care for seniors or among younger patients. At smaller MTFs, Senior Prime offered clinicians more experience providing inpatient care. MTF providers also reported that they were more satisfied because they could be assured that follow-up and other services would be available when needed.", "Site officials also identified ways in which seniors\u2019 care contributed specific skills that are important for medical readiness. For example, surgeons need practice in joint and vascular surgery, and intensive care teams need to learn how to work together under pressure. Seniors\u2019 joint and circulatory problems and the conditions that put them in intensive care are not the same as would be experienced on the battlefield but, site officials explained, treating such conditions keeps staff familiar with relevant medical procedures. Experience with the elderly can also be directly relevant to peacekeeping and humanitarian missions, where staff may deal with chronically ill or older individuals. Officials at one medical center, however, noted that despite these benefits, they were seeing fewer seniors overall because they were providing more comprehensive services to Senior Prime enrollees and offering less space-available care to nonenrolled seniors. These officials noted that, in some specialties, this smaller pool of seniors did not provide as many of the complex cases that are important for readiness training.", "Site officials found little evidence that, at its current small scale, Senior Prime had affected TRICARE Prime enrollees\u2019 satisfaction or access to care. Even where enrollment met the cap, Senior Prime remained a small portion of each MTF\u2019s enrolled population. By late 2000, the demonstration accounted for 9 percent of the enrolled population, although it reached 16 percent at two MTFs.

Implementing requirements, such as Medicare+Choice appeals and grievance rules, suggested improvements for similar TRICARE processes, and several sites planned to implement parts of the Medicare procedures in TRICARE Prime. Similarly, the quality improvement studies undertaken for Medicare+Choice revealed opportunities for improving patient care that site officials said could be applied to the TRICARE Prime population.", "Working with HCFA also brought MTF officials into contact with private Medicare+Choice plans, practices, and data. Staff at two sites met regularly with private Medicare+Choice plan representatives and said that they found it useful to discuss Medicare+Choice issues with them and HCFA staff. Participation in Senior Prime also led sites to compare their performance with that of private plans.

While Senior Prime enrollees generally had good access to care and sites managed to provide the full range of services, sites had difficulty in arranging some resources that were particularly critical for seniors.", "Maintaining adequate staff at MTFs is an ongoing challenge because of routine turnover, military deployments, and readiness training. In the demonstration, replacement staff needed due to routine turnover did not always arrive when they were needed, sometimes reporting months after the previous staff had left. Staff deployments and readiness training also led to gaps in provider availability, although this varied among MTFs. Some MTFs experienced mostly short-term deployments during the demonstration, while others contributed staff for assignments lasting several months. The resources deployed ranged from individual staff members, including specialists important for senior care, to an entire operating room team. Some of the larger MTFs were also responsible for filling positions at other MTFs that were short-staffed, increasing the pressure on staff resources at those sites.", "Sites took several steps to mitigate the effect of military staff absences on patient care. Some absences could be unpredictable, but sites often had advance notice and could plan to minimize interruptions. For short-term training absences, at least one MTF was able to adjust schedules so that not all members of a particular team were away at once. For temporary assignments, MTFs could sometimes send specialists rather than primary care providers, thereby minimizing the impact on primary care management. To cover for absent Senior Prime primary care managers, some MTFs used other primary care team members or specialists to fill in, some arranged for civilian providers to fill in temporarily, and one was able to arrange for a temporary replacement from another MTF. For specialty care, larger MTFs generally had more staff to cover short-term gaps, but smaller MTFs with few providers in a specialty had to rely more on network providers.", "Obtaining staff for the longer term was more problematic. First, DOD procedures for assigning staff to MTFs are not generally geared to making needed adjustments quickly. MTFs sometimes could not meet their authorized staffing levels because no one was available. Second, when MTFs tried to hire civilian personnel, their ability to do so was generally dependent on the local market, and several reported that recruiting civilians to fill certain positions was difficult. Although another option, TRICARE\u2019s \u201cresource sharing\u201d program, allows MTFs to use civilian staff provided by the managed care support contractors to deliver care with the MTFs, only a few MTFs were using resource sharing providers to treat Senior Prime enrollees. At the time of our visits, site officials did not share a common understanding of when resource sharing could be used within Senior Prime.", "Despite managed care support contractors\u2019 recruiting on an ongoing basis to ensure network adequacy, several sites had problems securing local providers for their network and had to send patients outside the network for care. Pulmonology, dermatology, and rheumatology were areas in which more than one site encountered problems. Also, site officials reported that some providers were reluctant to contract with Senior Prime. For example, some did not want to accept the contracted payment rate, which was lower than the out-of-network rate they could otherwise receive.", "Officials noted that network development was generally more difficult for TRICARE in rural areas, where the supply of specialty providers is limited. Rural sites were able to build networks that met most of their referral needs, although their networks sometimes had only one or two providers in certain specialties. Seniors who were enrolled at more rural MTFs at times had to travel significant distances to reach certain specialist providers. However, in some areas longer travel times were common.

In particular, sites had to find ways to coordinate those services that the military health system has not traditionally provided to seniors as well as to resolve issues common to TRICARE of integrating MTF and network data.", "Most MTFs encountered problems in coordinating care to Senior Prime enrollees, especially when they were in a skilled nursing facility or nursing home.", "A central issue for the sites was the provision of case management services by nurses or social workers. Senior Prime required a shift in focus for case management, from managing primarily catastrophic cases in a younger population to coordinating chronic medical care for an older population. This included support in assisting families and patients in transitioning from the MTF to an institutional setting or to home. Particularly for older patients, case managers are often pivotal in coordinating care. Officials at five MTFs reported having added case managers for Senior Prime or changed the case manager\u2019s role.

This issue was complicated by the fact that MTF physicians are typically not licensed to practice medicine in the state where the MTF is located. As a result, they cannot be given medical privileges at the local health care facilities. Most sites used the institutional staff or network physicians to see the admitted Senior Prime patients and relied on the managed care support contractor\u2019s case managers to communicate with the patient\u2019s MTF physician.", "For patients who were in skilled nursing facilities or rehabilitation facilities or receiving most of their care from network physicians, sites had to decide who would provide needed lab tests and routine appointments\u2014 the MTF or the network physicians. Some of the larger sites elected to return Senior Prime patients admitted at local institutional facilities to the MTF for lab tests ordered by the network physician or for routine clinic appointments. This practice could help ensure that medical information, such as the results of a lab test ordered by a network physician, was shared between the MTF physician and the network physician. However, transporting patients back and forth is not always feasible, cost-effective, or convenient for the patient, and one MTF reported it was considering other options.", "In managing patient care, MTF primary care physicians faced two additional difficulties in bridging the gap between network and military care. First, they needed to ensure that patients followed through on referrals\u2014making and keeping their appointments with network providers. TRICARE appointment and referral procedures did not necessarily record this information, which required good communication with providers outside the MTF. Second, MTFs needed to ensure that clinical results of referrals were shared with the patient\u2019s primary care physician. One site, observing that the referral process needed improvement, established centers to coordinate referrals. The centers\u2019 staff created a database to track the status of referrals, so that they could inform primary care physicians when patients had not made or kept their referral appointments. The staff also monitored whether primary care physicians had received the clinical results.", "Integration of data on MTF care with data on network care was a problem for overall management of Senior Prime as well as for physicians\u2019 management of their individual patients\u2019 care. Different data systems were involved\u2014one for network care, maintained by the managed care support contractor, and one for MTF care, maintained by DOD.

This hindered the sites\u2019 obtaining such information routinely.", "Both the sites and DOD are undertaking initiatives to improve the integration of data from different sources. For example, DOD now maintains three separate pharmacy data systems \u2013one for prescriptions filled at an MTF, one for prescriptions filled through DOD\u2019s national mail order pharmacy, and one for those filled at network pharmacies. DOD has begun implementing a pharmacy data transaction system, which will create an integrated record of all prescriptions received by TRICARE beneficiaries.

Negotiating contract changes has been a longstanding problem for DOD in managing TRICARE. The problem was more acute for the demonstration because a significant number of additional contract modifications had to be negotiated specific to subvention.", "Shortly after Senior Prime\u2019s startup, HCFA began implementation of Medicare+Choice, which resulted in far-reaching changes in Medicare regulations. These changes, which were released over more than a year, required Medicare+Choice plans to implement new practices and procedures\u2014generally, within 90 days of receiving the changes. Many of these changes affected contractor-performed activities including enrollment, reporting, and network contracting. Senior Prime involved six \u201cchange orders\u201d\u2014modifications to the TRICARE managed care support contracts\u2014to set up the demonstration and make it conform to the evolving Medicare+Choice rules.", "Handling these changes was cumbersome in several ways, detailed in figure 1, and highlighted how ill-suited the contract change order process was to making changes expeditiously. The problems encountered in Senior Prime were typical of TRICARE change orders generally, except for the delay in requesting proposals, which reflected the special circumstances of the demonstration.", "This system had several disadvantages. First, delays in the process meant that Medicare+Choice requirements went into effect before TMA could authorize contractors to implement them. In order to achieve the demonstration\u2019s timely compliance with Medicare+Choice requirements, lead agent staff wanted contractors to move forward without a formal change order\u2014which they sometimes did\u2014although TMA contracting officials cautioned against this practice. Second, lack of timely payment was a major concern at the managed care support corporate level. Third, the fact that contractors had already incurred actual costs may have put DOD at a disadvantage when negotiating change orders. Finally, TMA was authorizing changes without knowing what they would actually cost. Unsettled change orders could represent a significant future liability for the Defense Health Program if they are settled at higher amounts than DOD estimated.", "The backlog in processing contract changes and the practice of implementing changes before their costs were negotiated have long been problems for TRICARE. Efforts initiated in 1997 to remedy the problem were not successful. In July 2000, TMA began an effort to negotiate and pay for all of its outstanding change orders. This effort eliminated most of the backlog, but the $900 million cost of the settlements contributed to a shortfall in funding for the Defense Health Program for fiscal year 2001. TMA has instituted a new process that requires costs to be negotiated and settled before changes are implemented, but evidence of the effectiveness of this process is not yet available."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Senior Prime, while demonstrating that DOD can operate a Medicare+Choice plan, also illustrated the complexities of offering managed care within the military health system. Some lessons from the demonstration apply to military managed care generally. These include the difficulties of linking MTFs with network care and the importance of re- engineering the previous managed care support contract change order process. Other lessons apply specifically to military managed care for seniors. These include the importance of accurately estimating MTFs\u2019 capacity for enrolling seniors, especially given the potential for age-ins; the need to provide seniors with more complex care, including case management and post-acute care; and the value of contacts with HCFA and private Medicare+Choice plans. Much of Senior Prime\u2019s experience in providing care to seniors may be applicable to the new TRICARE For Life program. DOD officials may be able to draw on lessons learned from Senior Prime as they define the new program\u2019s options for seniors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["DOD and HCFA provided written comments on a draft of this report, which are reprinted in appendixes I and II.
