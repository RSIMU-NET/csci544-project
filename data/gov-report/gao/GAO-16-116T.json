These can come from insiders, criminals, terrorists, or other hostile sources and may employ a variety of techniques or exploits, such as denial-of-service attacks and malicious software. By exploiting vulnerabilities in information and communications technologies supporting port operations, cyber-attacks can potentially disrupt the flow of commerce, endanger public safety, and facilitate the theft of valuable cargo.", "In its June 2014 report, GAO determined that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other stakeholders had taken limited steps to address cybersecurity in the maritime environment. Specifically:", "DHS's Coast Guard had not included cyber-related risks in its biennial assessment of risks to the maritime environment, as called for by federal policy. Specifically, the inputs into the 2012 risk assessment did not include cyber-related threats and vulnerabilities. Officials stated that they planned to address this gap in the 2014 revision of the assessment. However, when GAO recently reviewed the updated risk assessment, it noted that the assessments did not identify vulnerabilities of cyber-related assets, although it identified some cyber threats and their potential impacts.", "The Coast Guard also did not address cyber-related risks in its guidance for developing port area and port facility security plans. As a result, port and facility security plans that GAO reviewed generally did not include cyber threats or vulnerabilities. While Coast Guard officials noted that they planned to update the security plan guidance to include cyber-related elements, without a comprehensive risk assessment for the maritime environment, the plans may not address all relevant cyber-threats and vulnerabilities.", "The Coast Guard had helped to establish information-sharing mechanisms called for by federal policy, including a sector coordinating council, made up of private-sector stakeholders, and a government coordinating council, with representation from relevant federal agencies. However, these bodies shared cybersecurity-related information to a limited extent, and the sector coordinating council was disbanded in 2011. Thus, maritime stakeholders lacked a national-level forum for information sharing and coordination.", "DHS's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified enhancing cybersecurity capabilities as a priority for its port security grant program, which is to defray the costs of implementing security measures. However, FEMA's grant review process was not informed by Coast Guard cybersecurity subject matter expertise or a comprehensive assessment of cyber-related risks for the port environment. Consequently, there was an increased risk that grants were not allocated to projects that would most effectively enhance security at the nation's ports.", "GAO concluded that until DHS and other stakeholders take additional steps to address cybersecurity in the maritime environment\u2014particularly by conducting a comprehensive risk assessment that includes cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts\u2014their efforts to help secure the maritime environment may be hindered. This in turn could increase the risk of a cyber-based disruption with potentially serious consequences."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its June 2014 report on port cybersecurity, GAO recommended that the Coast Guard include cyber-risks in its updated risk assessment for the maritime environment, address cyber-risks in its guidance for port security plans, and consider reestablishing the sector coordinating council.

As you know, maritime ports  are an essential part of the United States\u2019 transportation critical  infrastructure. They are an economic engine that handles more than $1.3  trillion in cargo each year. A major disruption in the maritime  transportation system could have a significant impact on global shipping,  international trade, and the global economy, as well as posing risks to  public safety. This risk is heightened by ports\u2019 dependence on computer- reliant information and communication systems that may be vulnerable to  cyber threats from various actors with malicious intent. Because of the  increasing prevalence of cyber threats, since 1997 we have designated  federal information security as a government-wide high-risk area, and in  2003 we expanded this to include the protection of systems supporting  our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.", "In my statement today, I will summarize the results of a report we issued  in June 2014 on the extent to which the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) and other stakeholders have addressed cybersecurity in  the maritime port environment. Specifically, I will discuss (1) cyber- related threats facing the maritime port environment and (2) steps DHS  and other stakeholders have taken to address cyber risks in the maritime  environment, as well as provide updates on actions DHS has taken to  implement recommendations we made in our report. More detailed  information on our objective, scope, and methodology for that work can  be found in the issued report.", "The work on which this testimony is based was conducted in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

A wide variety of  goods travels through these ports each day\u2014including automobiles,  grain, and millions of cargo containers. While no two ports are exactly  alike, many share certain characteristics such as their size, proximity to a  metropolitan area, the volume of cargo they process, and connections to  complex transportation networks. These characteristics can make them  vulnerable to physical security threats.", "Moreover, entities within the maritime port environment are vulnerable to  cyber-based threats because they rely on various types of information  and communications technologies to manage the movement of cargo  throughout the ports. These technologies include  terminal operating systems, which are information systems used to,  among other things, control container movements and storage; industrial control systems, which facilitate the movement of goods  using conveyor belts or pipelines to structures such as refineries,  processing plants, and storage tanks; business operations systems, such as e-mail and file servers,  enterprise resources planning systems, networking equipment,  phones, and fax machines, which support the business operations of  the terminal; and access control and monitoring systems, such as camera surveillance  systems and electronically enabled physical access control devices,  which support a port\u2019s physical security and protect sensitive areas.", "All of these systems are potentially vulnerable to cyber-based attacks and  other threats, which could disrupt operations at a port."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Policies and Laws Establish Requirements and Responsibilities for Protecting Maritime Critical Infrastructure", "paragraphs": ["While port owners and operators are responsible for the cybersecurity of  their operations, federal agencies have specific roles and responsibilities  for supporting these efforts. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan  (NIPP) establishes a risk management framework to address the risks  posed by cyber, human, and physical elements of critical infrastructure. It  details the roles and responsibilities of DHS in protecting the nation\u2019s  critical infrastructures; identifies agencies that have lead responsibility for  coordinating with federally designated critical infrastructure sectors  (maritime is a component of one of these sectors\u2014the transportation  sector); and specifies how other federal, state, regional, local, tribal,  territorial, and private-sector stakeholders should use risk management  principles to prioritize protection activities within and across sectors.", "The NIPP establishes a framework for operating and sharing information  across and between federal and nonfederal stakeholders within each  sector. These coordination activities are carried out through sector  coordinating councils and government coordinating councils. Further,  under the NIPP, each critical infrastructure sector is to develop a sector- specific plan that details the application of the NIPP risk management  framework to the sector. As the sector-specific agency for the maritime  mode of the transportation sector, the Coast Guard is to coordinate  protective programs and resilience strategies for the maritime  environment.", "Further, Executive Order 13636, issued in February 2013, calls for  various actions to improve the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure.  These include developing a cybersecurity framework; increasing the  volume, timeliness, and quality of cyber threat information shared with the  U.S. private sector; considering prioritized actions within each sector to  promote cybersecurity; and identifying critical infrastructure for which a  cyber incident could have a catastrophic impact.", "More recently, the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 further  refined public-private collaboration on critical infrastructure cybersecurity  by authorizing the National Institute of Standards and Technology to  facilitate and support the development of a voluntary set of standards,  guidelines, methodologies, and procedures to cost-effectively reduce  cyber risks to critical infrastructure.", "In addition to these cyber-related policies and law, there are laws and  regulations governing maritime security. One of the primary laws is the  Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) which, along with  its implementing regulations developed by the Coast Guard, requires a  wide range of security improvements for the nation\u2019s ports, waterways,  and coastal areas. DHS is the lead agency for implementing the act\u2019s  provisions, and DHS component agencies, including the Coast Guard and  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), have specific  responsibilities for implementing the act.", "To carry out its responsibilities for the security of geographic areas  around ports, the Coast Guard has designated a captain of the port within  each of 43 geographically defined port areas. The captain of the port is  responsible for overseeing the development of the security plans within  each of these port areas. In addition, maritime security committees, made  up of key stakeholders, are to identify critical port infrastructure and risks  to the port areas, develop mitigation strategies for these risks, and  communicate appropriate security information to port stakeholders. As  part of their duties, these committees are to assist the Coast Guard in  developing port area maritime security plans. The Coast Guard is to  develop a risk-based security assessment during the development of the  port area maritime security plans that considers, among other things,  radio and telecommunications systems, including computer systems and  networks that may, if damaged, pose a risk to people, infrastructure, or  operations within the port.", "In addition, under MTSA, owners and operators of individual port facilities  are required to develop facility security plans to prepare certain maritime  facilities, such as container terminals and chemical processing plants, for  deterring a transportation security incident. The implementing regulations  for these facility security plans require written security assessment reports  to be included with the plans that, among other things, contain an  analysis that considers measures to protect radio and  telecommunications equipment, including computer systems and  networks.", "MTSA also codified the Port Security Grant Program, which is to help  defray the costs of implementing security measures at domestic ports.  Port areas use funding from this program to improve port-wide risk  management, enhance maritime domain awareness, and improve port  recovery and resilience efforts through developing security plans,  purchasing security equipment, and providing security training to  employees.

Risks to cyber-based assets can originate from  unintentional or intentional threats. Unintentional threats can be caused  by, among other things, natural disasters, defective computer or network  equipment, software coding errors, and careless or poorly trained  employees. Intentional threats include both targeted and untargeted  attacks from a variety of sources, including criminal groups, hackers,  disgruntled insiders, foreign nations engaged in espionage and  information warfare, and terrorists.", "These adversaries vary in terms of their capabilities, willingness to act,  and motives, which can include seeking monetary gain or pursuing a  political, economic, or military advantage. For example, adversaries  possessing sophisticated levels of expertise and significant resources to  pursue their objectives\u2014sometimes referred to as \u201cadvanced persistent  threats\u201d\u2014pose increasing risks. They make use of various techniques\u2014  or exploits\u2014that may adversely affect federal information, computers,  software, networks, and operations, such as a denial of service, which  prevents or impairs the authorized use of networks, systems, or  applications.", "Reported incidents highlight the impact that cyber attacks could have on  the maritime environment, and researchers have identified security  vulnerabilities in systems aboard cargo vessels, such as global  positioning systems and systems for viewing digital nautical charts, as  well as on servers running on systems at various ports.", "In some cases, these vulnerabilities have reportedly allowed hackers to  target ships and terminal systems. Such attacks can send ships off  course or redirect shipping containers from their intended destinations.  For example, according to Europol\u2019s European Cybercrime Center, a  cyber incident was reported in 2013 (and corroborated by the FBI) in  which malicious software was installed on a computer at a foreign port.  The reported goal of the attack was to track the movement of shipping  containers for smuggling purposes.

As called for by the  NIPP, the Coast Guard completes this assessment on a biennial basis,  and it is to provide a description of the types of threats the Coast Guard  expects to encounter within its areas of responsibility, such as ensuring  the security of port facilities, over the next 5 to 8 years. The assessment  is to be informed by numerous inputs, such as historical incident and  performance data, the views of subject matter experts, and risk models,  including the Maritime Security Risk Analysis Model, which is a tool that  assesses risk in terms of threat, vulnerability, and consequences.", "However, we found that while the 2012 assessment contained information  regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and the mitigation of potential risks in  the maritime environment, none of the information addressed cyber- related risks or provided a thorough assessment of cyber-related threats,  vulnerabilities, and potential consequences. Coast Guard officials  attributed this gap to limited efforts to develop inputs related to cyber  threats to inform the risk assessment. For example, the Maritime Security  Risk Analysis Model did not contain information related to cyber threats.  The officials noted that they planned to address this deficiency in the next  iteration of the assessment, which was to be completed by September  2014, but did not provide details on how cybersecurity would be  specifically addressed.", "We therefore recommended that DHS direct the Coast Guard to ensure  that the next iteration of the maritime risk assessment include cyber- related threats, vulnerabilities, and potential consequences. DHS  concurred with our recommendation, and the September 2014 version of  the National Maritime Strategic Risk Assessment identifies cyber attacks  as a threat vector for the maritime environment and assigns some impact  values to these threats. However, the assessment does not identify  vulnerabilities of cyber-related assets. Without fully addressing threats,  vulnerabilities, and consequences of cyber incidents in its assessment,  the Coast Guard and its sector partners will continue to be hindered in  their ability to appropriately plan and allocate resources for protecting  maritime-related critical infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maritime Security Plans\u2019 Consideration of Cybersecurity Was Limited", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in June 2014, maritime security plans required by MTSA  did not fully address cyber-related threats, vulnerabilities, and other  considerations. Specifically, three area maritime security plans we  reviewed from three high-risk port areas contained very limited, if any,  information about cyber-threats and mitigation activities. For example, the  three plans included information about the types of information and  communications technology systems that would be used to communicate  security information to prevent, manage, and respond to a transportation  security incident; the types of information considered to be sensitive  security information; and how to securely handle such information. They  did not, however, identify or address any other potential cyber-related  threats directed at or vulnerabilities in these systems or include  cybersecurity measures that port-area stakeholders should take to  prevent, manage, and respond to cyber-related threats and  vulnerabilities.", "Similarly, nine facility security plans from the nonfederal organizations we  met with during our 2014 review generally had very limited cybersecurity  information. For example, two of the plans had generic references to  potential cyber threats, but did not have any specific information on  assets that were potentially vulnerable or associated mitigation strategies.  Officials representing the Coast Guard and nonfederal entities  acknowledged that their facility security plans at the time generally did not  contain cybersecurity information.", "Coast Guard officials and other stakeholders stated that the area and  facility-level security plans did not adequately address cybersecurity  because the guidance for developing the plans did not require a cyber  component. Officials further stated that guidance for the next iterations of  the plans, which were to be developed in 2014, addressed cybersecurity.  However, in the absence of a maritime risk environment that addressed  cyber risk, we questioned whether the revised plans would appropriately  address the cyber-related threats and vulnerabilities affecting the  maritime environment.", "Accordingly, we recommended that DHS direct the Coast Guard to use  the results of the next maritime risk assessment to inform guidance for  incorporating cybersecurity considerations for port area and facility  security plans. While DHS concurred with this recommendation, as noted  above, the revised maritime risk assessment does not address  vulnerabilities of systems supporting maritime port operations, and thus is  limited as a tool for informing maritime cybersecurity planning.

For example,  the Maritime Modal Government Coordinating Council was established to  enable interagency coordination on maritime security issues, and  members included representatives from DHS, as well as the Departments  of Commerce, Defense, Justice, and Transportation. Meetings of this  council discussed implications for the maritime mode of the President\u2019s  executive order on improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity, among  other topics.", "In addition, the Maritime Modal Sector Coordinating Council, consisting of  owners, operators, and associations from within the sector, was  established in 2007 to enable coordination and information sharing.  However, this council disbanded in March 2011 and was no longer active,  when we conducted our 2014 review. Coast Guard officials stated that  maritime stakeholders had viewed the sector coordinating council as  duplicative of other bodies, such as area maritime security committees,  and thus there was little interest in reconstituting the council.", "In our June 2014 report, we noted that in the absence of a sector  coordinating council, the maritime mode lacked a body to facilitate  national-level information sharing and coordination of security-related  information. By contrast, maritime security committees are focused on  specific geographic areas.", "We therefore recommended that DHS direct the Coast Guard to work with  maritime stakeholders to determine if the sector coordinating council  should be reestablished. DHS concurred with this recommendation, but  has yet to take action on this. The absence of a national-level sector  coordinating council increases that risk that critical infrastructure owners  and operators will be unable to effectively share information concerning  cyber threats and strategies to mitigate risks arising from them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Port Security Grant Program Did Not Take Key Steps to Effectively Address Cyber Risks", "paragraphs": ["In 2013 and 2014 FEMA identified enhancing cybersecurity capabilities  as a funding priority for its Port Security Grant Program and provided  guidance to grant applicants regarding the types of cybersecurity-related  proposals eligible for funding. However, in our June 2014 report we noted  that the agency\u2019s national review panel had not consulted with  cybersecurity-related subject matter experts to inform its review of cyber- related grant proposals. This was partly because FEMA had downsized  the expert panel that reviewed grants. In addition, because the Coast  Guard\u2019s maritime risk assessment did not include cyber-related threats,  grant applicants and reviewers were not able to use the results of such an  assessment to inform grant proposals, project review, and risk-based  funding decisions.", "Accordingly, we recommended that DHS direct FEMA to (1) develop  procedures for grant proposal reviewers, at both the national and field  level, to consult with cybersecurity subject matter experts from the Coast  Guard when making funding decisions and (2) use information on cyber- related threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences identified in the revised  maritime risk assessment to inform funding guidance for grant applicants  and reviewers.", "Regarding the first recommendation, FEMA officials told us that since our  2014 review, they have consulted with the Coast Guard\u2019s Cyber  Command on high-dollar value cyber projects and that Cyber Command  officials sat on the review panel for one day to review several other cyber  projects. FEMA officials also provided examples of recent field review  guidance sent to the captains of the port, including instructions to contact  Coast Guard officials if they have any questions about the review  process. However, FEMA did not provide written procedures at either the  national level or the port area level for ensuring that grant reviews are  informed by the appropriate level of cybersecurity expertise. FEMA  officials stated the fiscal year 2016 Port Security Grant Program guidance  will include specific instructions for both the field review and national  review as part of the cyber project review.", "With respect to the second recommendation, since the Coast Guard\u2019s  2014 maritime risk assessment does not include information about cyber  vulnerabilities, as discussed above, the risk assessment would be of  limited value to FEMA in informing its guidance for grant applicants and  reviewers. As a result, we continue to be concerned that port security  grants may not be allocated to projects that will best contribute to the  cybersecurity of the maritime environment.", "In summary, protecting the nation\u2019s ports from cyber-based threats is of  increasing importance, not only because of the prevalence of such  threats, but because of the ports\u2019 role as conduits of over a trillion dollars  in cargo each year. Ports provide a tempting target for criminals seeking  monetary gain, and successful attacks could potentially wreak havoc on  the national economy. The increasing dependence of port activities on  computerized information and communications systems makes them  vulnerable to many of the same threats facing other cyber-reliant critical  infrastructures, and federal agencies play a key role by working with port  facility owners and operators to secure the maritime environment. While  DHS, through the Coast Guard and FEMA, has taken steps to address  cyber threats in this environment, they have been limited and more  remains to be done to ensure that federal and nonfederal stakeholders  are working together effectively to mitigate cyber-based threats to the  ports. Until DHS fully implements our recommendations, the nation\u2019s  maritime ports will remain susceptible to cyber risks.", "Chairman Miller, Ranking Member Vela, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
