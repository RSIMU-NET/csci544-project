Subsequently, selected executive branch agencies decided to use six broad factors--country readiness, economic/commercial benefit, benefits to the broader trade liberalization strategy, compatibility with U.S. interests, congressional/private-sector support, and U.S. government resource constraints. These decisions are not mechanical, and the factors cited most often regarding the selected FTA partners primarily reflect U.S. trade strategy, foreign policy, and foreign economic development goals. The interagency process for selecting FTA partners now involves four interagency groups that use decision papers to assess potential FTA partners and make recommendations that eventually go to the president. This new process is more systematic and inclusive than the process previously used. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) reports that it routinely considers the Congress's views in making selections. Decisions about FTA partners are made with little systematic data or planning regarding trade-offs with other trade priorities, even though FTAs are resource intensive. USTR staff and travel funds are heavily committed to FTAs, and USTR relies on specialists at other agencies as well. As more FTAs are contemplated, existing mechanisms may prove inadequate to the task of aggressively pursuing a bilateral FTA agenda while remaining engaged in regional and multilateral forums."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Free trade agreements (FTA) have recently been the subject of much  attention as the United States undertakes negotiations with multiple  negotiating partners.

Because FTA negotiations call upon  many experts from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) and  other agencies, they are resource intensive.  The recent collapse of the  World Trade Organization (WTO) trade talks at a September 2003 meeting  in Cancun, Mexico, is expected to make FTAs a more important vehicle for  accomplishing U.S. trade goals.", "As a result of this increase in the number of FTAs and their growing  importance to U.S. trade policy, you asked us to review how potential FTA  partners are selected.

The TPA legislation sets forth U.S. trade negotiating objectives that apply to negotiating FTAs.   However, the TPA legislation does not impose any specific criteria on the  President for choosing FTA partners, except that the President must take  into account the extent to which the negotiating partner has implemented  or has accelerated implementation of its WTO obligations.", "Other trade legislation encourages pursuit of FTA negotiations.  For  example, in the 2000 African Growth and Opportunity Act, the Congress  declared that FTAs should be negotiated with interested sub-Saharan  African countries.  Furthermore, in the United States-Caribbean Basin  Trade Partnership Act, the Congress declared that it was the policy of the  United States to seek the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary  countries in the FTAA or another FTA, with the goal of achieving full  participation in any such agreement by 2005.", "USTR, the President\u2019s principal trade policy advisor and coordinator, has  the lead responsibility for the formulation and coordination of trade policy;  the negotiation of trade agreements, including FTAs; and the enforcement  of trade agreements.  Under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, President  John F. Kennedy established an interagency trade policy organization to be  chaired by USTR to assist with these and other trade responsibilities.   Currently, this organization consists of three tiers of committees, which  from the lowest tier to the highest tier are the Trade Policy Staff Committee  (TPSC), the Trade Policy Review Group (TPRG), and the National Security  Council/National Economic Council (NSC/NEC).  Within this framework,  USTR coordinates with Commerce, Agriculture, State, and Treasury and  other U.S. agencies as issues needing their expertise arise.", "The United States currently has five FTAs with six nations: Israel (1985),  Canada (1989), Mexico (1994), Jordan (2001), Singapore (2003), and Chile  (2003).  The United States has already begun negotiating four more  bilateral or subregional FTAs with Central America, the Southern Africa  Customs Union (SACU), Australia, and Morocco.  USTR has announced  that it plans to negotiate FTAs with the Dominican Republic; Bahrain;  Panama; and the Andean countries of Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and  Bolivia.  In addition, in October 2003, the President announced the U.S.\u2019s  intent to negotiate an FTA with Thailand.  Other countries are under  consideration as FTA partners.

The Trade Representative highlighted  the views of labor and environmental groups as important components  of FTA selections because these views affect prospects of congressional  passage.", "Cooperation in security and foreign policy.  The Trade Representative  considers the extent to which potential partners are willing to support  U.S. security and foreign policy objectives.

This FTA negotiation represents the greatest immediate  commercial benefit of any single ongoing FTA, with 1.2 percent of total  U.S. trade in 2002.  A U.S.-Australia FTA would add to the regional  distribution of FTAs for the United States and would strengthen U.S. ties  to a valued ally.  The increased U.S. access to Australia\u2019s market would  likely increase trade in goods and services, enhance employment  opportunities, and encourage additional two-way investment.", "Bahrain. Although Bahrain represents a small share of U.S. trade, an  FTA with this U.S. ally and moderate Muslim nation would support U.S.  security and political goals by fostering prosperity in the region.  As a  stepping-stone to an eventual Middle East Free Trade Area, Bahrain  could become the hub of a subregional block of countries with closer  trading relationships with the United States.  An FTA with Bahrain might  be completed relatively quickly due to Bahrain\u2019s reform-minded outlook.", "Central American Free Trade Agreement. The commercial benefit of an  FTA with five Central American countries would be 0.95 percent of total  U.S. trade.  In the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act,  the Congress declared that it was the policy of the United States to seek  the participation of Caribbean Basin beneficiary countries in the FTAA  or another FTA, with the goal of achieving full participation in any such  agreement by 2005.  CAFTA would provide regional balance among  FTAs and add to the momentum for the hemispherewide FTAA, a major  U.S. trade priority.  It would also help lock in and broaden reforms such  as anticorruption and government accountability measures, support  economic integration within the region, and enable the United States to  increase exports and gain U.S. access to more affordable goods.", "Dominican Republic.  If the Dominican Republic is added to the overall  CAFTA region, it would bring the CAFTA trade from 0.95 percent to 1.32  percent of total U.S. trade in 2002, slightly more than that of Australia.   The Dominican Republic had strong support in the Congress for its  addition to the CAFTA negotiations, in part because excluding it from  CAFTA could lead to adverse economic consequences in the Dominican  Republic.  However, according to a key participant in the discussion, the  decision to add the Dominican Republic also included careful  consideration of U.S. concerns about its protection of intellectual  property rights and its status as one of the worst offenders on human  trafficking.", "Morocco.  Although a U.S.-Morocco FTA would have minimal trade  benefit to the United States, one USTR official stated that this FTA  would further the administration\u2019s goal of promoting openness,  tolerance, and economic growth across the volatile Middle East.   Morocco, a moderate Muslim country, also signaled its readiness to  enter into a comprehensive FTA by demonstrating its willingness to  liberalize its economy and make domestic reforms.", "Southern Africa Customs Union.  Responding to congressional  guidance in the 2000 African Growth and Opportunity Act, USTR  inititated FTA negotiations with SACU in November 2002.  This FTA  contributes to the U.S.\u2019s desire for regional balance among FTAs, creates  an opportunity for the United States to build trade capacity in the  region, and strengthens SACU\u2019s role as a negotiating partner in other  trade forums, such as the WTO.

This process, called \u201cdocking,\u201d means  that negotiators will not have to spend time renegotiating every area.  For  example, USTR officials stated that the Dominican Republic will be  integrated into the U.S.-CAFTA FTA and that only market access issues  should require separate, detailed negotiations.  Although CAFTA will  require 1 year to complete, USTR expects that docking the Dominican  Republic onto the agreement will take considerably less time.  USTR is also  considering how to integrate separate FTAs as it works toward a U.S.- Middle East Free Trade Area.", "USTR is taking other measures to save resources.  For example, USTR  officials noted that they regularly combine various missions in one trip  abroad and that they use extensive teleconferencing.  In addition, USTR  officials reported that they have cut costs by holding meetings in a central  location and conducting negotiations in English when possible to avoid  interpretation expenses.  USTR is also improving its system for tracking  TPA requirements for each FTA.  To facilitate interagency collaboration,  USTR developed a negotiations calendar listing the various bilateral,  regional, and multilateral negotiating rounds so that negotiators may better  identify competing demands.", "Finally, concerns that the FTA agenda would continue to be busy led to  resource constraints\u2019 inclusion as a factor used for FTA partner selection  during the interagency process.

We reported in 2002 that valid and reliable data are critical to assessing an  agency\u2019s workforce requirements and to heighten an agency\u2019s ability to  manage risk by allowing managers to (1) spotlight areas for attention  before crises develop and (2) identify opportunities for enhancing agency  results.  In 2003, we also noted the importance of considering human  capital challenges by relying on valid and current data and reported that the  absence of such data can seriously undermine efforts to respond to current  and emerging challenges.  USTR has indicated that it is developing a new  system for tracking spending according to different trade priorities,  including FTAs, but this system is not yet operational.  In addition, although  staff time is a major resource devoted to FTAs, USTR officials informed us  that they have no plans to track the time staff spend working on FTAs.", "The importance of systematic data and planning can be seen in the  constraint imposed by limited numbers of functional experts, who focus on  areas such as intellectual property rights, agriculture, and market access.   These experts are often needed to support multiple, concurrent  negotiations.  However, the offices in which these staff work at USTR  average only eight people each, so they often represent a limiting factor to  completing FTA negotiations.", "USTR officials reported that they make many resource management  decisions informally on an ongoing basis, in addition to those decisions  based on advance planning that took into account the U.S.\u2019s various trade  priorities.  For example, although regional assistant U.S. trade  representatives provide staff and travel estimates as part of the annual  budget cycle, they frequently bring specific resource requests to USTR  management throughout the year.  USTR officials, who must mediate  among these often competing priorities, told us that they looked at several  factors\u2014for example, negotiating deadlines and the need for specific  expertise\u2014to make these resource decisions.  If there were competing  demands for staffing for the Morocco and SACU negotiations, for example,  USTR management might consider that the need would be more pressing  for the Morocco negotiator because of that negotiation\u2019s shorter deadline  for completion (e.g., the end of 2003 versus the end of 2004 for SACU).  If  USTR managers identify a lack of available staff to cover certain issues,  they then turn to other agencies to supplement their own staff.  This  informal, reactive approach may no longer be adequate to meet the needs  of increasing numbers of negotiations, particularly if the U.S.\u2019s trade  strategy shifts to an emphasis on bilateral agreements in the wake of the  failed Cancun ministerial of the WTO.

Our  recommendation focuses on setting priorities among the multilateral,  hemispheric, and FTA negotiations that take into account available staff.  It  also calls for coordinating those staff allocations with other agencies  whose resources USTR routinely calls upon during the course of  negotiations.  Resource management fundamentally involves taking a given  (and limited) amount of resources and deploying (allocating) it over  program objectives aligned with the agency\u2019s overall priorities.  This  approach frees managers to focus on its core program, not on continually  reacting to the daily fluctuations of resource needs.", "The resources that USTR requested in fiscal year 2004 appear to have been  justified based on its needs for completing the ongoing four FTAs  (Australia, Morocco, CAFTA, and SACU).

This increasing workload with its related demand for  staff and travel can be better managed with (1) the collection of data to  help managers understand what resources are linked to accomplishing  agency objectives and (2) the use of these data in advance planning for  future resource allocation, which can help USTR managers coordinate with  other agencies whose own resources are affected by USTR negotiations.   The Trade Representative listed several steps that USTR has taken to  address its resource limitations.

An FTA would enable the United States and the  CAFTA countries to have reciprocal tariff levels and would remove the  requirement that Caribbean Basin Initiative preferences be reviewed every  year.

With the announcement of three new FTA negotiations\u2014the  Dominican Republic, the Andean countries, and Panama\u2014in Latin  America alone, it is not clear how USTR will be able to meet its new  and ongoing negotiating demands in a timely fashion.  We have noted in  this report that one factor that constrains negotiations is a limited  number of regional and functional specialists.  To address these  challenges, USTR would do well to develop a resource strategy across  its entire negotiating agenda that is based on solid data and planning.  3. While we appreciate USTR\u2019s efforts in pursuing intensive trade  negotiations in an often unpredictable international environment, this  situation makes it all the more important to make staffing and resource  decisions based on valid and reliable data and planning.  Relying on  informal, ad hoc decision making increases risk and reduces the chance  that the agency will accomplish its goals.  The human capital model that  we developed calls for organizations, regardless of size, to use solid  data to determine the current and future human capital required to  support their mission and goals.", "4.", "Just like other federal agencies, USTR is responsible for standard  accountability procedures to manage its program and federal funds.", "Our recommendation calls for a result\u2014not specific procedures or  output measures.  Since its own and other agencies\u2019 expert staff are the  most substantial resources for FTA negotiations, improving upon the  present lack of systematic data would better position USTR and other  agencies to make decisions that involve staffing trade-offs among  competing priorities.  In addition, travel is an important resource  component and must be programmed in advance.  While we recognize  and encourage the steps that USTR has already taken to make  improvements, we note that these efforts are already recognized in this  report and are not sufficient to address our concerns for forward  planning."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgment", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Martin De Alteriis, Francisco Enriquez,  Bradley Hunt, Rona Mendelsohn, Juan Tapia-Videla, Timothy Wedding, and  Eve Weisberg made major contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional  responsibilities and to help improve the performance and accountability of the  federal government for the American people.
