GAO was asked to assess IRS's 2010 filing season performance in relation to its goals and prior years' performance processing individual tax returns, answering telephones, and delivering Web and face-to-face services. To conduct the analysis, GAO analyzed data and documents from IRS, interviewed IRS officials, observed IRS operations, and interviewed tax industry experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS dealt with a number of challenges this filing season, including significant tax law changes, such as the Making Work Pay credit, and corresponding changes in taxpayer behavior. IRS balanced its resources across its filing season activities with improvements in some areas but fluctuations in others. Return processing: Electronic filing, which reduces costs to IRS, increased about 3 percent, to 71 percent of all individual returns. However, IRS experienced delays in issuing millions of refunds, which IRS officials attributed primarily to correcting taxpayer errors associated with the Making Work Pay credit and conducting additional automated checks. Telephone service: Compared to 2009, the percentage of callers seeking live assistance who received it improved in 2010 and the accuracy of answers remained high, at over 90 percent. However, the average wait time increased. Further, IRS's annual goal for providing caller assistance was lower than any of the preceding 5 years. However, IRS lacks a standard for what constitutes good customer telephone service that could be compared to its annual goals. Such a standard would make the gap between the annual goals and the standard more transparent. IRS is using a tool called Contact Analytics to better understand the reasons why taxpayers call. However, IRS has not assessed the costs and benefits of storing recorded calls for longer than the current 45 day period for use in Contact Analytics, and GAO identified gaps in the process IRS uses to solicit input on call topics from frontline IRS staff. Such input could be used to identify issues for further research using Contact Analytics. IRS's customer service staff also responds to taxpayer correspondence. IRS received about 20 million pieces of correspondence in 2010, but it does not have a performance measure that addresses the timeliness of taxpayer correspondence, a key agency objective. By not having such a performance measure, IRS managers may have a less informed basis for balancing resources across telephone and correspondence services. Web site: Visits to IRS's Web site increased and IRS is taking steps to improve content management before introducing a new Web site in 2012. Face-to-face: In 2010, taxpayer visits to IRS's walk-in sites and sites operated by volunteers remained about the same as in 2009. IRS's program to provide refunds on debit cards at certain volunteer sites, targeting taxpayers without bank accounts, received little use in 2010. IRS's evaluation of the program did not include taxpayers or volunteers. By not including these stakeholders, IRS risks not learning the real reasons for low participation. GAO's five recommendations to IRS are to establish a customer service telephone standard, assess the costs and benefits of storing recorded calls beyond 45 days, solicit information on call trends from employees, develop a performance measure for the timeliness of taxpayer correspondence, and involve key stakeholders in its evaluation of its debit card program. IRS disagreed with developing a customer service standard, not wanting to revise its measurement of phone service. However, a standard would allow IRS to communicate to Congress what it believes constitutes good service. IRS also disagreed with assessing the costs and benefits of storing calls beyond 45 days. GAO's report suggests that further analysis could show whether the benefits of doing so currently exceed the costs. IRS generally agreed with the other three recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Every tax filing season is a large-scale and critical undertaking during  which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) interacts with tens of millions of  taxpayers by processing tax returns, correcting errors on returns, issuing  refunds, answering telephone calls, and providing other services to  taxpayers, both face-to-face and online.

IRS cannot accept electronically filed  returns directly from taxpayers. Rather, IRS-authorized e-file providers  transmit returns to IRS electronically. Return transmitters send electronic  return data directly to IRS using either the MeF or the legacy e-file  system. The MeF system is intended to accept or reject individual tax returns faster than the legacy system. In addition, if the return is rejected,  the MeF system should provide better information regarding why the  return was rejected. s  The MeF system is also intended to allow taxpayer to attach portable document format (PDF) files to their tax returns, which will be useful in instances where taxpayers are required to submit  additional documentation, such as for the FTHBC. Finally, MeF serves a single point of submission for federal and state tax return information. I is planning to fully implement the MeF system in time for the 2012 filin g  season, and retire the legacy e-file system in October 2012.", "As in the last few filing seasons, in 2010, IRS administered complex tax  law changes, including the MWP and Residential Energy Property  Credits\u2014part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009  (ARRA)\u2014and the FTHBC.", "The refundable MWP tax credit provides up to $400 for working  individuals and up to $800 for married taxpayers filing joint returns.  Individuals who received Social Security, Railroad Retirement, or  Veteran\u2019s benefits received a $250 Economic Recovery Payment in 2009,  which reduced the amount of the MWP credit they were eligible to receive.", "The Residential Energy Property Credit increases the existing credit rate  to 30 percent of cost up to a maximum credit of $1,500 for homeowners  who make certain energy efficient improvements to existing homes.", "As we have previously reported, since 2008, Congress has enacted three  versions of the FTHBC to help stimulate the housing market by providing  first-time homebuyers and some long-term homeowners with a refundable  tax credit to assist with the purchase of a home.", "Appendix II summarizes key tax law changes that affected recent filing  seasons.", "Part of IRS\u2019s filing season work involves correcting errors on tax returns,  which can benefit both IRS and taxpayers. Correcting errors before issuing  refunds allows IRS to avoid costly and burdensome audits and taxpayers  may receive larger refunds or be made aware of additional taxes owed  before being required to pay interest and penalties.", "For example, IRS used math error authority (MEA) to identify and correct  errors with the FTHBC. MEA allows IRS to identify calculation errors and  check for obvious noncompliance, such as claims above income and credit  limits. These automated and relatively low-cost (compared to audits) math  error checks increase the likelihood of IRS collecting the correct amount  of tax owed. Congress must grant IRS specific authority to use MEA for  purposes beyond computational errors. We previously recommended that  Congress broaden IRS\u2019s MEA with appropriate safeguards to prevent its  misuse.", "In addition to processing tax returns, IRS also provides tax law and  account assistance, limited return preparation, tax forms and publications,  and outreach and education, primarily through its telephone services, Web  site, and, to a much lesser extent, through face-to-face assistance. For  example, IRS staff provides assistance at 401 walk-in sites where  taxpayers can receive basic tax law assistance, receive assistance with  their accounts, and have returns prepared by IRS if their annual income is  $49,000 or less. IRS also has volunteer partners that staff over 12,000  volunteer sites, which help serve traditionally underserved taxpayer  segments, including elderly, low-income, and taxpayers with limited  English proficiency.

For example,  for fiscal year 2009, IRS reported that it costs 19 cents to process an e-filed  return compared to $3.29 for a paper return.", "Table 1 also shows that IRS issued about 2 percent fewer refunds in 2010  compared to 2009, with the average refund amount being about $2,915.

In 2012, IRS plans to establish and use  the new CADE 2 database in conjunction with their legacy system for daily  processing of individual taxpayer accounts. Current CADE processes  returns about 1 to 8 days faster than the legacy system, and at present,  only taxpayers whose accounts have been moved to that system get this  benefit (i.e., about 30 percent of all individual returns). Although IRS once  intended for current CADE to replace the legacy system, this is no longer  the case. Rather, beginning in the 2012 filing season, IRS plans to  introduce daily processing for most returns using the legacy system and  the new CADE 2 database. At that time, IRS officials expect that the  majority of individual taxpayers will receive the benefit of faster refunds in  addition to other benefits.", "Although IRS began using MeF to accept individual returns for the first  time in 2010, the system was underutilized. Return transmitters  submitted about 7 percent of the total number of returns that IRS officials  projected the MeF system could accept. IRS officials cited several  reasons for lack of use of the MeF system, including that it is unproven  compared to the current legacy e-file system. They also noted that the  legacy e-file system had a lower rejection rate than MeF and return  transmitters may have stopped using MeF after encountering performance  problems. In interviews with GAO and in a survey conducted by the  Electronic Tax Administration Advisory Committee, a group of  stakeholders that offers suggestions about current or proposed electronic  tax administration policies, industry stakeholders who are major users of  electronic filing cited MeF system \u201cinstability\u201d (system down-time, time- outs, slow servers, and delayed acknowledgments) as a major reason for  low use of the MeF system.", "For the 2011 filing season, IRS officials expect that the MeF system will be  capable of accepting up to about 85 million individual returns. However,  IRS officials acknowledged that until IRS overcomes the performance and  stability issues experienced in 2010, transmitters are likely to continue to  send Form 1040 returns to the legacy electronic filing system. Transmitters  may still be reluctant to switch to MeF until the system is proven to be  stable, and their participation is still voluntary until the legacy system is  turned off in 2012. To ensure that issues with the stability of the system do  not persist in 2011, IRS officials are testing the MeF system in preparation  for next year.

Appendix III describes in more detail the large number of returns sent to  ERS this filing season.", "Correcting returns benefited either taxpayers or IRS. For example, IRS  corrected millions of MWP errors in favor of taxpayers, meaning taxpayers  received larger refunds (or had a lower balance due) than they anticipated  when they filed their return. In addition, applying filters for pre-refund  examinations allowed IRS to prevent millions of dollars from being issued  for ineligible FTHBC claims. Although applying these filters often results  in IRS identifying incorrect refunds, we have previously reported that in  some cases the filters applied were not sufficient to stop incorrect refunds  from being sent to taxpayers.", "In part due to these complications, IRS\u2019s timeliness in issuing refunds  declined by 3 percentage points, marking its lowest level since at least  2005. According to our calculations, this translates to about 3.3 million  more refunds being delayed through August 2010 compared to last year.  Delays in providing refunds adversely affect taxpayers because it takes  longer for them to receive their refunds and contributes to taxpayer calls  about the status of their refunds. In addition, IRS paid significantly more  interest on those refunds than in previous years, which imposed additional  costs to the federal government. For example, IRS paid about $12.6 million  in refund interest through August 2010, about $8 million more than in  2009. On the other hand, rapid processing of refunds without proper  checks can lead to erroneous refund payments which can be costly to the  federal government.

IRS officials said that IRS is taking  actions to address elements of these management control gaps such as  development of new Web content management guidance and usability  review guidance, which are expected to be in place by January 2011.", "Ensuring effective management control for its Web site is especially  important in light of IRS\u2019s planned improvements. From January 1 through  April 15, 2010, IRS\u2019s 2010 taxpayer satisfaction survey results found that 73  percent of surveyed visitors to www.irs.gov reported that they obtained  the information or services they were seeking, the same level as in 2009,  but a 5 percent decrease compared to 2007. In response, IRS is taking  steps to improve its Web site, including investing $320 million over 10  years to introduce a new site by the 2013 filing season. This $320 million is  being used for Web operations, including a Web site help desk,  development of interactive Web applications, and program management of  IRS\u2019s Web site and registered user and employee sites. According to IRS  officials, the new Web site should provide IRS with a strengthened  technical infrastructure that would allow for easier updates on the site and  new automated features."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accuracy at IRS\u2019s Walk-In Sites Improved, but IRS\u2019s Evaluation of the Debit Card Program at Volunteer Sites Is Missing Stakeholder Input", "paragraphs": ["Through April 30, 2010, IRS received 2.8 million taxpayer contacts at its  401 IRS walk-in sites, about the same as last year. To increase taxpayer  access to assistance, IRS piloted extended Saturday and evening hours in  16 IRS walk-in sites, held five Saturday open house events during the fiscal  year, and expanded a pilot project to place IRS walk-in site employees in  volunteer tax preparation sites to provide assistance with accounts and  tax law questions. From January 1 through April 15, 2010, IRS employees  worked with approximately 5,300 taxpayers at 27 volunteer sites.  According to IRS officials, they plan to continue the programs in 2011.", "As of April 30, 2010, the accuracy of accounts and tax law assistance  provided at IRS walk-in sites continued to improve, as table 7 shows. IRS  officials attribute this increased accuracy to the continued use of the  Interactive Tax Law Assistant which guides assistors through a series of  questions to provide accurate and consistent responses to taxpayers\u2019  questions. Further, IRS introduced a new return preparation assistance  accuracy measure, which assesses the extent to which IRS staff prepares  accurate returns.", "According to IRS officials, IRS partnered with community-based  organizations that ran 12,326 volunteer sites, staffed with 87,602  volunteers in 2010. Through April 25, 2010, volunteers prepared 2.9 million  tax returns, about the same as last year. Return preparation accuracy by  volunteers increased compared to 2009. For 2010, volunteers achieved an  85 percent accuracy rate for return preparation compared to 78 percent  last year. According to IRS officials, this increase resulted from IRS\u2019s new  requirement that volunteers use an IRS-approved intake sheet, expanded  training of volunteers, and increased IRS monitoring visits. For more detail  on the number of contacts at walk-in and volunteer sites, see appendix VI.", "IRS is expanding its program to support its volunteer partners as they  work with taxpayers to promote financial education and asset building.  One initiative of this program is to assist taxpayers who may not have an  account at a bank, savings and loan, credit union, or other financial  institution, to receive their refund through direct deposit on a debit card  issued by one of IRS\u2019s national bank partners. IRS anticipates that these  efforts may result in reduced taxpayer use of refund anticipation loans by  providing taxpayers with a low-cost or no-cost refund option for receiving  refunds quickly. In 2010, the program, which already had a low  participation rate, drew far fewer taxpayers than in 2009, despite  increasing the number of sites offering the cards from 15 in 2009 to 20 in  2010. Less than 3 percent of taxpayers eligible for the program elected to  receive their refund on a debit card compared to 2009 when 8 percent of  eligible taxpayers participated in the program.", "According to IRS officials, poor program participation is in part due to the  challenge of appropriately marketing the program to taxpayers. However,  other factors may have contributed, including having a limited number of  volunteers available to administer the program at volunteer sites and  additional training requirements for volunteers distributing the cards. IRS  included its partner bank institutions in its evaluation of the program\u2019s  2010 performance, but the evaluation did not include other key  stakeholders, such as taxpayers or partners from volunteer sites where the  program was implemented. By not including these other key stakeholders,  IRS may not have fully identified the causes of the program\u2019s poor  participation rate. As we have previously reported, according to the  American Evaluation Association\u2019s Guiding Principles for Evaluators,  evaluations should include relevant perspectives and interests of the full  range of stakeholders. IRS plans to continue to facilitate the program and  is carrying out a study and pilot test to improve marketing of the debit  card at volunteer sites. However, without an understanding informed by  multiple stakeholder perspectives on reasons why taxpayer participation  in the program was low, including reasons outside of the manner in which  the program was marketed, IRS risks missing opportunities to increase  participation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The filing season is a large-scale, complex effort that requires IRS to  balance resources across processing returns (including some pre-refund  compliance verification) and providing assistance to taxpayers via  telephones, mail, walk-in sites and IRS\u2019s Web site. Although IRS dealt with  a number of challenges this filing season, its performance improved in  some areas and IRS met some goals. Efficiency gains realized from  continued growth in electronic filing contributed to IRS\u2019s performance.", "However, the combined effects of recent tax law changes and changes in  taxpayer behavior can be seen in the fluctuations in IRS\u2019s performance\u2014 not just this year, but in previous years as well. During 2010, IRS\u2019s  performance in issuing timely refunds decreased\u2014a result, in part, of  correcting millions of taxpayer errors to the benefit of taxpayers and the  federal government. In addition, telephone service, although better than  last year, remained below 2005 through 2007 levels and IRS continues to  have a significant amount of overage taxpayer correspondence. IRS  management faces trade-offs in determining how to best allocate  resources among these priorities. For example, when IRS dedicates more  resources to providing quality telephone service, fewer resources are  available to respond to paper correspondence and vice versa.", "Opportunities exist for IRS to improve the information available to make  decisions between competing priorities and to gain efficiencies.  Establishing a customer service standard for telephone service would  provide Congress with better information on the resources needed for IRS  to deliver better telephone service. Further leveraging the use of powerful  tools already in IRS\u2019s arsenal\u2014namely its own staff and data contained in  Contact Analytics\u2014should help IRS gain efficiencies. For example,  assessing the costs and benefits of storing recorded calls for longer than  the current 45-day period could help IRS use Contact Analytics to better  determine why taxpayers call. Further, establishing a performance  measure for the timeliness of its taxpayer correspondence should help IRS  better manage its full range of interactions with taxpayers. Involving all  key stakeholders in reviews of important initiatives, such as expanding the  effort to provide refunds on debit cards, will lead to a more complete  understanding of why such initiatives are or are not working."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To gain efficiencies and improve taxpayer service, the Commissioner of  Internal Revenue should direct the appropriate officials to:  1.  Based on the quality of service provided by comparable organizations  and on what matters most to the customer, determine a customer  service telephone standard, and the resources required to achieve this  standard based on input from Congress and other stakeholders;  2.  Use the existing process of regular team meetings with frontline  telephone assistors to solicit information on call trends and other  potential improvements to phone service and to supplement issues  identified using Contact Analytics;  3.  Assess business units\u2019 needs for holding Contact Analytics calls  beyond 45 days and store calls for this period or document that the  costs of doing so exceed the benefits;  4.  Establish a performance measure for taxpayer correspondence that  includes providing timely service to taxpayers; and  5.

He disagreed with two  recommendations.", "The Deputy Commissioner agreed with the recommendation to use the  existing process of regular team meetings with frontline telephone  assistors to solicit information on call trends and other potential  improvements to phone service and Contact Analytics. He also agreed  with the recommendation to develop a performance measure for taxpayer  correspondence that includes providing timely service to taxpayers.  Further, in response to the  recommendation that IRS establish an  evaluation plan for the debit card program that includes taxpayers,  volunteer site partners, and other stakeholders and assesses the reasons  for program participation rates, he described steps IRS plans to take to  assess the debit card program participation rates.", "The Deputy Commissioner disagreed with the recommendation that IRS  develop a customer service telephone standard, stating that he does not  believe that IRS needs to revise its current process to measure telephone  service at this time as it currently develops its telephone plans after  consideration of many factors. Such factors include historical call demand  and the types and anticipated lengths of calls. However, a customer  service telephone standard would serve as a means of communicating to  Congress and others what IRS believes would constitute good customer  service. Having such a standard would make the gap between the standard  and annual performance goals more transparent. We recognize that IRS  may not be able to achieve the standard because of factors such as  unexpected call volume and competing resources. The intent is to  highlight for Congress and others the gap between good service and what  IRS is able to attain. In addition, developing such a standard would put IRS  in compliance with Office of Management and Budget guidance that  requires agencies to develop customer service standards. Accordingly, we  believe this recommendation remains valid.", "Finally, the Deputy Commissioner disagreed with the recommendation  that IRS assess its business units\u2019 needs for holding Contact Analytics calls  beyond 45 days and store calls for this period or document that the costs  of doing so exceed the benefits. He stressed that IRS\u2019s Contact Recording  System is used to store calls and the Contact Analytics system is used to  analyze some calls, noting that IRS is confident that storing calls beyond  45 days would not be a low-cost effort. However, IRS officials responsible  for recording and storing calls told us that IRS developed its policy on how  long to store data, including calls available through Contact Analytics,  several years ago.  As we note in our report, IRS officials acknowledged  that they have not surveyed business units as to whether they need to  store the calls for a longer period or analyzed whether the benefits of  doing so would exceed the costs. Further, we identified an example during  our review in which IRS needed to use more time-consuming processes to  analyze calls because the calls were not available beyond 45 days for use  by Contact Analytics. Contact Analytics should allow IRS to better  understand the reasons taxpayers call. Because further analysis could  demonstrate whether the benefits of storing calls for a longer period  currently exceed the costs, we believe this recommendation remains valid.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
