As of January 2002, 98 percent of public housing agency plans for fiscal year 2000 had been submitted and approved. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) had mixed views about the fiscal year 2000 plan process and its value. The field locations that responded to GAO's survey reported that their review of fiscal year 2000 plans was hampered by several factors, including difficulty in transmitting data between public housing agencies and HUD. Most field locations responded that public housing agencies are implementing their plans but acknowledged that there may be some problems, particularly in fulfilling requirements related to resident participation in the process. The eight public housing agencies GAO visited had differing views on the usefulness of the planning process, the level of resources required to prepare the plans, the sufficiency of HUD's guidance on completing the plans, and the difficulty of meeting the resident participation requirement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, commonly  referred to as the Public Housing Reform Act (P.L. 105-276), was major  legislation designed to improve the quality of public housing and the lives  of public housing residents.  The act included over 80 provisions that  revised key requirements related to the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD\u2019s) low-rent housing and tenant-based Section 8  housing assistance programs.  The act also gave public housing agencies  more flexibility and discretion in using funds to address the needs of low- income families and encouraged resident involvement in housing  management.", "In an effort to ensure that public housing agencies remained accountable to  HUD while exercising these new flexibilities, Section 511 of the act created  a new requirement. Beginning in fiscal year 2000, housing agencies  managing low-rent or tenant-based Section 8 units have been required to  develop and submit five-year and annual plans.  Agencies were required to  obtain resident participation in developing these plans.  The five-year plan  is to describe the public housing agency\u2019s mission and long-range goals,  while the annual plan is to identify objectives and strategies for achieving  these goals and to detail the agency\u2019s policies and procedures.  The annual  plan also serves as an application to HUD for some grant funding for  agencies with low-rent units.  Since housing agencies that administer  tenant-based Section 8 units only do not receive this type of funding, they  do not use the plan as a grant application.  Once a public housing agency  has submitted its plans to HUD, HUD must review the plans to ensure that  they contain the appropriate information, and either approve them or  disapprove them,  and notify the public housing agency of deficiencies in  the plans that need to be addressed before the plans can be approved.", "Section 511 also required us to audit and review a sample of these public  housing agencies plans to provide an overview of how the process has  worked so far.  As agreed with your offices, to fulfill this requirement  within the required deadline we determined: (1) the status of public  housing agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2000 plans, (2) HUD\u2019s experiences with the  fiscal year 2000 plan process and opinions concerning the value of the  plans, and (3) selected public housing agencies\u2019 experiences with and  opinions regarding the fiscal year 2000 plan process.  We examined HUD\u2019s  experiences to provide information on the universe of plans filed, as well as  HUD\u2019s perspective on the process, while selected housing agencies\u2019  experiences were examined for insight into agencies\u2019 perspectives on the  planning process.  In January 2002, in fulfillment of the act\u2019s requirement,  we briefed your offices on our key findings.  We have enclosed the slides  from that briefing in appendix I.  Also, as you requested at our briefing, we  are providing information on the status of the fiscal year 2001 plans and any  significant changes in the plan review process.", "To determine the status of fiscal year 2000 plans, we analyzed information  from HUD\u2019s databases and interviewed HUD officials.  In examining HUD\u2019s  experiences with the plan process, we surveyed HUD\u2019s 43 Public and  Indian Housing field offices and 2 troubled agency recovery centers  (hereafter referred to as field locations).  These field locations were  responsible for reviewing and approving submitted plans.  Ninety-six  percent of these locations responded to our survey.", "To gather detailed information on selected public housing agencies\u2019  experiences with the process, we visited eight agencies that we selected  based on factors including size and geographic location, as shown in table 1."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended, Congress  created the federal public housing program to assist communities in  providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwellings for low-income families.   Today, more than 4,100 public housing agencies provide housing for low- income households.  Over 3,100 agencies operate low-rent or a  combination of low-rent and tenant-based Section 8 units, and about 1,000  provide housing through tenant-based Section 8 units only.  Public housing  agencies are typically municipal, county, or state agencies created under  state law to develop and manage public housing units for low-income  families.  Housing agencies that participate in the low-rent program  contract with HUD to provide housing in exchange for federal grants and  subsidies.  HUD provides funding to agencies to operate and repair low- rent units through the Operating Fund and the Capital Fund.  The Operating  Fund provides annual subsidies to housing agencies to make up the  difference between the amount they collect in rent and the cost of  operating the units.  The Capital Fund provides grants to public housing  agencies for the major repair and modernization of the units.", "Under the tenant-based Section 8 program, eligible households select their  own units in the private housing market and receive subsidies to cover part  of the rent.  Public housing agencies that participate in the tenant-based  Section 8 program enter into contracts with HUD and receive HUD funds to  provide rent subsidies to the owners of private housing on behalf of the  assisted households.", "Fiscal year 2000 was the first year that public housing agencies were  required to submit a five-year plan and an annual plan.  This requirement  only applies to public housing agencies that receive HUD funds to provide  housing under the low-rent or tenant-based Section 8 programs.  The five- year plan describes the agency\u2019s mission and its long-range goals and  objectives for achieving its mission over the subsequent 5 years.  The  annual plan details the agency\u2019s immediate objectives and strategies for  achieving these goals, as well as the agency\u2019s policies and procedures.  For  agencies that manage low-rent units, the annual plan also serves as the  application for the capital fund and public housing drug elimination grant  programs.  HUD distributes these grants on a formula basis.", "The Public Housing Reform Act sets forth requirements governing the  submission, review, and approval of agency plans.  Plans must be submitted  to HUD 75 days before the start of the agency\u2019s fiscal year.  In addition, the  plans are to be developed by the public housing agency in consultation with  a resident advisory board and be consistent with other HUD-required  community planning documents.  Public housing agencies are also required  to hold a public hearing on the plans and to address comments received  during the hearing before submitting the plans to HUD.  HUD, in turn, must  review submitted plans to determine that they contain the information  required by the act, agree with information from other data sources  available to HUD such as community planning documents, and comply  with other applicable laws.  HUD must issue a written notice either  approving or disapproving the plans within 75 days of its receipt of the  plans.

Of the housing agencies that should  have had approved plans but did not, 76 provide housing through tenant- based Section 8 units only.  The remaining 13 manage low-rent units only or  a combination of low-rent and tenant-based Section 8 units.", "HUD is considering sanctions against all public housing agencies that do  not have approved fiscal year 2000 agency plans.  Since agencies that  manage low-rent units use the annual plan as the application for their  capital fund and public housing drug elimination formula grants, HUD does  not plan to release the fiscal year 2000 formula grants to agencies without  approved plans.  Although these grant funds have been committed to the  agencies based on the formula allocation, the funds have not been released  to agencies without approved fiscal year 2000 plans and are not available  for those agencies\u2019 use.  According to a HUD official, any agency that  manages low-rent units and did not submit its annual plan to HUD by  September 30, 2001, may lose its capital fund and public housing drug  elimination program formula grants for fiscal year 2000.  Fourteen public  housing agencies may lose about $2.6 million in fiscal year 2000 capital  fund grants and one of these agencies may also lose a $39,426 public  housing drug elimination program grant.", "HUD is considering a similar sanction for those public housing agencies  that administer only tenant-based Section 8 units and do not have approved  fiscal year 2000 plans.  While tenant-based Section 8-only agencies make up  24 percent of all housing agencies, they represent 85 percent of agencies  without approved plans.  For these agencies, HUD could withhold a portion  of the administrative fees these public housing agencies receive for  managing the tenant-based Section 8 program.  In addition, HUD requires  these public housing agencies to have approved fiscal year 2000 plans to be  eligible for additional Section 8 vouchers in fiscal year 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Field Locations Had Mixed Views Regarding the Fiscal Year 2000 Review Process but Believe Plans Have Value and Are Generally Being Implemented", "paragraphs": ["The majority of HUD field locations reported that they experienced some  problems with the fiscal year 2000 plan review process but were able to  complete almost all reviews.

Respondents also reported that HUD-provided guidance on the plan  process was less than adequate.  One respondent reported that  headquarters guidance at the beginning of the process was not very good  and was delayed in getting to the field locations, while another reported  that changing rules made it difficult to know what the housing agencies  should do and what the field locations should look for in reviewing plans.", "Changes that have been made for the 2001 plan process suggest that  lessons learned and experience gained during the first year resulted in  some improvements, but it is too early to determine whether these changes  have fully resolved the problems.  For example, several respondents  reported that technical data transmission and conversion problems were  less frequent for fiscal year 2001.  They also reported that HUD  headquarters had streamlined guidance and provided it in a timelier  manner.  HUD headquarters officials also cited several initiatives  undertaken as a result of lessons learned during the first year, including  developing a database to better track agency plan information, hiring a new  contractor to manage the database, and providing consolidated guidance in  the form of a desk guide to assist housing agencies and field locations.", "Respondents reported that, for fiscal year 2000, almost half of the plans  reviewed had to be resubmitted by the housing agencies because of  deficiencies.  The majority of field locations said that deficiencies requiring  correction and resubmission commonly occurred in the plans\u2019 sections  documenting capital improvement needs, the housing needs of the  community, and the fulfillment of resident participation requirements.   Among the problems with capital improvement sections were the omission  or incompleteness of required documentation, such as plans for the use of  the agency\u2019s capital funds.  Regarding the sections on determining housing  needs, some agencies submitted data sources on housing availability that  were unclear or conflicted with other local planning documents.

Specifically, about 70 percent of  respondents thought the plans were important in setting operational  priorities for agencies that maintain low-rent units, while only 40 percent  thought they were important in setting operational priorities for agencies  with tenant-based Section 8 units only.  One respondent commented that  operating a tenant-based Section 8 program has substantially different  planning needs than operating a low-rent housing program.  According to  this respondent, because tenant-based Section 8 units are located in  privately-owned housing, there is no \u201cphysical asset\u201d for the tenant-based  Section 8 agency to maintain, and other problems with being a landlord or  owner are not present.

Four had positive experiences,  two did not, and two had no comment.  One of the larger agencies told us  that the first year of the plan process was useful because it forced the  agency to review and update its policies.  This agency also uses the plan as  a training aid for newly hired staff and believes the plan is useful as a  vehicle for obtaining resident input.  The other larger agency said that the  plan is useful in the agency\u2019s strategic planning.  In contrast, the two small  agencies we visited reported that they did not find the process useful:  One  said that it took time away from the staff\u2019s essential day-to-day operational  duties.  The other said it perceived no value in the plan process.", "Although the amount and type of resources that agencies devoted to the  plan process for fiscal year 2000 varied, seven of the eight public housing  agencies we visited told us they used additional staff or resources in  developing their fiscal year 2000 plans.  Three of the eight used consultants  to develop their plans.  One extra-large agency hired an additional staff  person specifically to coordinate development of its fiscal year 2000 plans.   In contrast to the other seven public housing agencies we visited, a  medium-sized agency told us that it did not spend significantly more staff  time or additional resources preparing the plans because most of the  required updating of operational policies had been completed earlier.", "All eight housing agencies we visited expressed some frustration with the  quantity or quality of HUD guidance for the first year, particularly regarding  the agency plan template that HUD provided electronically to serve as a  guide to developing and formatting the agency plans.  Although each of the  eight agencies had some negative feelings about the template, some  balanced their comments with positive remarks.  For example, one extra- large agency told us that the template provided guidance for formatting the  plan submission.  A large agency we visited told us that the template was  sufficiently easy to use and added that, in its opinion, HUD had improved  the template for fiscal year 2001.  On the other hand, one of the small  agencies told us that the template does not give individual housing agencies  the flexibility to describe unusual situations relating to local needs.  In  addition, one of the medium-sized agencies told us that the template was  not user friendly.", "Agencies also had mixed experiences with the resident participation  requirement for the fiscal year 2000 plan.  For example, one extra-large  public housing agency, with a widely dispersed housing inventory and  several different types of resident populations, had a positive experience.   Staff at this agency said that the resident participation requirement brought  together a cross-section of residents that would otherwise not have met  and provided these residents with an appreciation of the competing needs  of resident populations and the commensurate difficulty the housing  agency faced in meeting those needs.
