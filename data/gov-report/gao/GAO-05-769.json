But as nations faced increasing financial strains, many governments decided to shift the responsibility to an independent air navigation service provider (ANSP) that operates as a business. As of March 2005, 38 nations worldwide had commercialized their air navigation services, fundamentally shifting the operational and financial responsibility for providing these services from the national government to an independent commercial authority. GAO selected five ANSPs--in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom--to develop, as requested, a descriptive analysis of commercialized ANSPs that illustrated similarities and differences in ownership, length of experience with commercialization, and size and scope of operations. This report addresses the following questions: (1) What are common characteristics of commercialized ANSPs in selected foreign countries? (2) What do available data show about how the safety, cost, and efficiency of air navigation services have changed since commercialization? (3) What are some key lessons learned about the commercialization of air navigation services?"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The five commercialized ANSPs that GAO selected have a number of common characteristics: All five have the safe movement of aircraft as their primary goal and are subject to some external safety regulation. All five operate as businesses, making and carrying out their own strategic, operational, and financial decisions. As businesses, all five are self-financing, assessing fees on users of air navigation services (e.g., major commercial air carriers; regional air carriers; and, in some cases, general aviation operators) and, as necessary, borrowing funds from capital markets. Finally, all five are largely monopoly providers of air navigation services and undergo some form of constraint in setting prices, such as economic review or procedural guidelines. Available data from the five ANSPs indicate that since commercialization, the safety of air navigation services has remained the same or improved; each ANSP has taken steps to control costs; and each ANSP has reportedly lowered costs and improved efficiency through investments in new technologies and equipment. Despite concerns about the possibility that commercialization could potentially compromise safety, data from all five indicate that safety has not eroded. For example, data from New Zealand and Canada show fewer incidents involving loss of separation (the required distance between aircraft). All five ANSPs have taken steps to control their operating costs, whether by eliminating some administrative positions or by consolidating facilities. All five ANSPs have also invested in new technologies and equipment, which the ANSPs say have lowered their costs by increasing controllers' productivity and produced operating efficiencies, such as fewer or shorter delays. However, the ANSPs have also increased fees for general aviation operators. GAO's research points to a number of lessons. For example, commercialized ANSPs must be prepared to mitigate the effects of an industry downturn, whether through reserves, higher fees, cost-cutting, or other measures. Involving stakeholders in modernizing (i.e., upgrading or replacing) ANSP facilities and equipment can benefit both the ANSP and the stakeholders. Special measures may be needed to protect service to small or remote communities. Finally, when a government sells an ANSP's assets, appropriate valuation is necessary to protect taxpayers' interests."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1987, 38 nations have commercialized their air navigation services,  fundamentally shifting the responsibility for providing these services from  the national government to an independent air navigation service provider  (ANSP) that operates as a business and is designed as a performance-based  organization. In the past, governments worldwide owned, operated, and  regulated air navigation services, viewing them as a governmental function.  But as nations were faced with increasing congestion, outdated equipment  and facilities, and financial strains, many governments reevaluated their  structures for providing air navigation services. Some nations decided that  shifting the responsibility for operating and, in some cases, owning the  services to an independent commercial authority could produce  efficiencies that would benefit both users and the government. In general,  the responsibility for regulating the safety of the services is independent of  the ANSP and is still considered a governmental function.", "You asked that we develop a descriptive analysis of selected foreign  countries\u2019 commercialized, performance-based air navigation service  organizations. To do so, we asked the following research questions:  What are common characteristics of commercialized ANSPs in selected  foreign countries?", "What do available data show about how the safety, cost, and efficiency  of air navigation services have changed since commercialization?", "What are some key lessons learned about the commercialization of air  navigation services?", "To address these questions, we reviewed the characteristics and  performance of five commercialized ANSPs, which we selected as  illustrative of similarities and differences in ownership, length of  experience with commercialization, and size and scope of operations.  These ANSPs\u2014Australia\u2019s Airservices Australia; Canada\u2019s NAV CANADA;  Germany\u2019s Deutsche Flugsicherung GmbH (DFS); New Zealand\u2019s Airways  Corporation of New Zealand, Ltd.; and the United Kingdom\u2019s (UK) National  Air Traffic Services, Ltd. (NATS)\u2014were commercialized between 1987 and  2001 and have been operating since then as performance-based  organizations. Because we selected these ANSPs to illustrate certain  characteristics, our results cannot be generalized to all commercialized  ANSPs.", "A performance-based organization develops strategies, goals, and  measures and gathers and reports data to demonstrate its performance.  The five ANSPs that we reviewed have been gathering and reporting data  since commercialization, but their predecessor organizations did not  necessarily gather or publicly report comparable data. Consequently,  assessments of each ANSP\u2019s performance since commercialization are  possible, but comparisons of performance before and after  commercialization are generally not feasible. Additionally, opportunities  for comparing performance across commercialized ANSPs are limited to  the extent that the ANSPs define their measures of safety, cost, and  performance differently. We determined that the financial and safety data  from each country were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. For  additional information on our scope and methodology, see appendix I. We  performed our work in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards from August 2004 through July 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Before commercialization, air navigation services under government  control faced increasing strains. Many were underfunded, as evidenced by  freezes on air traffic controllers\u2019 wages and insufficient funds to replace  aging technologies. Technology replacement programs often cost more,  took longer, and delivered less than promised, and stakeholders  complained about performance and customer service. In some instances,  the country as a whole faced widespread fiscal problems and the  commercialization of air navigation services was simply part of a larger  movement to reform government enterprises. For instance, the New  Zealand government established 14 state-owned enterprises in 1987,  including air navigation services, rail services, and postal services. The  government also reformed electricity as a state-owned enterprise in 1994  and telecommunications in 2004.", "Although fiscal problems often drove the commercialization of air  navigation services, commercialization was generally intended not only to  relieve the government of a fiscal responsibility but also to free the ANSP  from some governmental constraints. According to the International Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO), a commercialized ANSP, whether wholly or  partly owned by the government or fully privatized, should function as an  autonomous body and, compared with a government organization, should  have greater freedom from the government in conducting its financial  affairs and developing infrastructure funding. In addition, it should be self- financing, subject to the usual business taxes, and required to seek a return  on capital. According to ICAO, the government should still regulate the  safety of the ANSP\u2019s operations, but the ANSP should be encouraged to be  as competitive, efficient, and cost-effective as any other commercial  business.", "In the five countries whose air navigation services we reviewed, the ANSP  continued to provide nationwide services after commercialization and,  with limited exceptions, remained the sole provider of air navigation  services. Table 1 summarizes information on the size and scope of the five  ANSPs in our review.", "Each ANSP generally offers en route, approach control, and terminal (or  aerodrome control) air traffic services. Although definitions of these terms  may vary slightly among ANSPs, the terms generally signify the same broad  functions. Specifically, en route services guide an aircraft while it is  operating at cruising elevations and outside terminal airspace. Approach  control services apply during departure\u2014immediately after the aircraft has  taken off and while it is climbing from the origination airport\u2014and during  arrival\u2014when the aircraft is descending to the destination airport toward  the end of the flight. Terminal or aerodrome control services are provided  while the aircraft is close to the airport from which it is arriving or  departing. However, in some countries, the ANSP may not be the sole  provider of approach control and terminal services. All but Germany\u2019s DFS  also offer oceanic air navigation services. All five ANSPs are responsible  for providing air navigation services to both civil and military aviation. In  addition, the ANSPs may offer other air navigation-related services, such as  meteorological, training, and consulting services, and charge for these  services.", "The five commercialized ANSPs are affiliated with one or more  international aviation-related organizations. The governments of all five  ANPS are members of ICAO and, therefore, all five ANSPs adhere to ICAO  principles. All five ANSPS are also members of the Civil Air Navigation  Services Organization (CANSO), a voluntary international trade  organization whose mission is to represent the interests of commercialized  ANSPs. In addition, the UK and Germany are members of EUROCONTROL,  a European organization responsible for regulating the safety of air  navigation, monitoring the performance of air traffic management systems,  and developing a seamless air traffic management system in Europe.  EUROCONTROL is mandated to develop implementing rules for the  European Union\u2019s \u201cSingle European Sky\u201d initiative, a legislative package  approved by the European Parliament in January 2004. One of these  implementing rules specifies that each member state is to develop an  independent safety and economic regulatory authority to oversee its ANSP.", "The UK established such an authority before commercialization, and  Germany is planning to develop one."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Common Characteristics of the Five Selected Commercialized ANSPs", "paragraphs": ["The five commercialized ANSPs that we reviewed have a number of  common characteristics: First, all focus on safely moving aircraft.

In some instances, government policy requires that the  ANSP consider safety in any and all decisions affecting operations and  service. For example, according to DFS officials, German legislation  requires DFS to observe ICAO\u2019s standards and recommended safety  practices, as well as adhere to the objectives and policies of international  organizations in which the German government participates, such as  EUROCONTROL. Similarly, in Canada, legislation requires NAV CANADA  to maintain a fixed level of safe operations. According to Transport Canada,  the safety regulator, the Minister of Transport has the authority to direct  NAV CANADA to maintain or increase levels of service in the interest of  safety. Although NAV CANADA can alter operations in accordance with  business principles, it must demonstrate that the changes meet the  required level of safety through an aeronautical risk assessment.", "All five ANSPs are subject to external safety regulation. A separate  authority conducts safety regulation and issues relevant certificates or  licenses to air traffic controllers and technicians. In New Zealand, for  example, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is an independent regulatory  authority that, among other things, establishes civil aviation safety and  security standards and monitors adherence to those standards. CAA carries  out accident and incident investigations and uses information from these  investigations to establish an industrywide safety picture and develop  safety initiatives ranging from educational campaigns to increased  monitoring and regulatory action. In Australia, the Civil Aviation Safety  Authority regulates and promotes aviation safety, and the Australian  Transport Safety Bureau investigates aircraft accidents, incidents, and  safety deficiencies within the aviation system, according to Airservices  Australia. In Canada, NAV CANADA and the government, through  Transport Canada, share responsibility for the safety of the national civil air  navigation system. Under a performance-based approach to safety  regulation, known as the relations management approach, Transport  Canada, as the regulator, establishes the requirements in law and  standards, and NAV CANADA, as the operator, must demonstrate  compliance by measuring and reporting on program results. Transport  Canada, among other things, conducts audits, adjudicates safety issues  raised by stakeholders, and licenses air traffic controllers.", "All five selected ANSPs have also established formal safety programs. For  example, DFS and NATS apply a systematic Safety Management System,  in accordance with EUROCONTROL\u2019s safety requirements, to all of their  operational activities. This system forms the basis for risk assessment,  safety assurance, safety control, and safety monitoring through standards  that comply with national and international obligations. DFS\u2019s Safety  Management System was also certified by the German Ministry of  Transport in 2004. Similarly, Airservices Australia employs a systemic  Safety Management System that complies with national and international  requirements. To promote safety, the system requires activities such as  operational risk assessments, surveillance, audits, and incident  investigations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although the Degree of Government Ownership Varies, the Five Commercialized ANSPs Operate as Businesses, Making Their Own Decisions and Generating Their Own Revenue", "paragraphs": ["The five commercialized ANSPs vary in the extent to which they are owned  by the government\u2014wholly, partially, or not at all.

The UK\u2019s NATS is a public-private partnership  (i.e., a cooperative venture between the public and private sectors that is  designed to meet defined public needs) with the risks and rewards divided  between both parties. The government holds the largest share of NATS (49  percent), and the remaining shares are divided among a consortium of  seven UK airlines (42 percent), NATS staff (5 percent), and a private airport  company (4 percent). By 2006, Germany plans to change the ownership of  DFS, selling 74.9 percent of its equity to private investors and reorganizing  it as a public-private partnership, along the lines followed in the UK. NAV  CANADA is a nonshare capital, private corporation\u2014that is, it has  \u201cmembers\u201d instead of shareholders. The corporation has 4 members  representing government, airlines, noncommercial users, and the unions.  These 4 members appoint 10 of the 15 board directors: 4 are appointed by  the airline industry, 3 by the government, 2 by employees such as air traffic  controllers and engineers, and 1 by general and business aviation. These 10  directors appoint another 4 based on expertise and the chief executive  officer.", "Before commercialization, members of the two ANSPs that are not wholly  owned by their government, NATS and NAV CANADA, \u201cpurchased\u201d some  or all of the ANSP assets from the government. Although the UK  government retained the largest share of NATS, the second-largest owner,  the consortium of seven UK airlines known as \u201cThe Airline Group,\u201d  provided approximately $1.4 billion, according to information from the  National Audit Office, including about $112.2 million from the group\u2019s own  resources and the remainder from a loan taken out with a consortium led by four major banks. The group used this sum to acquire NATS and meet  associated transaction costs, leaving cash assets of approximately $6.0  million in the business. In total, the government received an estimated $1.3  billion in cash proceeds from the transaction. NAV CANADA purchased  all of the ANSP assets from the Canadian government. Instead of going  through a formal competitive bidding process, it negotiated a selling price  with the government, and purchased the air navigation system in 1996 for  about $1.5 billion, using a $2.9 billion line of credit provided by a syndicate  of banks at the time of the purchase.

A supervisory board oversees policy making and  operations and, when applicable, has fiduciary responsibilities to  shareholders. The members of this board may represent key stakeholders,  such as the airlines, employees, general aviation, and the national  government. For example, in the UK, government appointees, the airlines,  and BAA (the airport consortium) are represented on NATS\u2019s board of  directors, while in Germany, DFS employees, government ministries, and  the private sector are represented on a supervisory board. As in a  corporation, an executive officer implements the ANSP board\u2019s policies  and is, in turn, accountable to the board. Individual business units within  the ANSP report to the chief executive officer and are directly responsible  for various aspects of the ANSP\u2019s day-to-day operations. For example,  Airservices Australia is structured around three market-oriented business  groups\u2014the Air Traffic Management, Airport Services, and Infrastructure  Support Services groups. A Corporate Services group and a small Head  Office support and lead the business groups. The managers of these five  groups form the Executive Committee and work with the chief executive  officer to advise the board as well as carry out the board\u2019s policies.", "While the supervisory board and its executive officers have decision- making responsibility, stakeholders\u2014including employees, the airlines,  general aviation operators, airports, the government, the public, and  others\u2014may be involved in and provide input to their ANSP through a  variety of mechanisms. For example, DFS has developed a Customer  Relationship Management System to organize hearings for customers and  involve them in working groups. This approach to involving stakeholders is  consistent with a Single European Sky directive that member states  establish a mechanism for consulting with stakeholders. In Australia, the  aviation community (i.e., the airports, airlines, safety authorities, and  others) participates in Airservices\u2019 strategic investment decision-making  process through the Australian Strategic Air Traffic Management Group. In  Canada, NAV CANADA\u2019s stakeholders (i.e., associations, unions, and  airports, including international and U.S. representatives) are involved in  the NAV CANADA Advisory Committee, which provides a vehicle for  stakeholders who are not on the board of directors to raise issues and  concerns with NAV CANADA.", "As commercial organizations, the ANSPs follow corporate practices. Each  ANSP has established performance measures and gathers and reports  financial and other performance data. Each ANSP also publishes an annual  report, which makes financial information available to the public to ensure  transparency. Financial statements are typically subject to audits by  independent third parties to ensure that adequate accounting records have  been maintained, and that internal controls have prevented or detected any  fraud and error in the accounting policies and estimates.

Before  commercialization, governments funded air navigation services through  annual appropriations.", "Since commercialization, each ANSP collects and manages its own  revenues, charging fees for services. The air navigation service fees are  based on ICAO\u2019s cost recovery principles, which call for recovering the  ANSP\u2019s operating costs. Despite some variation across ANSPs, the fees  are generally as follows:  The air navigation fees cover operating and capital costs associated with  both en route and approach control services. These charges are based  on a weight-distance formula. If applicable, ANSPs also levy charges  for oceanic control.", "The ANSPs may also charge for terminal-related services. However, not  all ANSPs are the sole providers of terminal services. In the UK and  Germany, for example, private firms may provide terminal services.  These terminal charges are distinct from the landing fees typically  charged by airports, which are usually weight-based.", "The ANSPs may charge general aviation operators a flat fee for services  or additional fees in particular circumstances, rather than charging the  weight-distance fees typically assessed to larger air carriers.", "The ANSPs may also exempt charges for some services. According to  ICAO policies, the ANSPs may choose to recover less than the full costs  of some services in recognition of local, regional, or national benefits.  For example, in Canada, aircraft or flights dedicated to search and  rescue, air ambulance operations, and firefighting services are all  exempt from air navigation service charges.", "The five ANSPs vary in their treatment of any operating profits or losses. If  an ANSP generates revenues from charges in excess of its costs (i.e.,  operating profits), it may rebate them to the users, lower the charges for  the next year, pay some form of dividend to shareholders, or retain the  revenues in reserve to protect against future losses. If costs exceed  revenues, ANSPs use different strategies to meet those shortfalls. For  example, NAV CANADA established a \u201crate stabilization fund,\u201d which it  used to store revenues when the aviation industry was healthy. The fund  could then be used to cover costs and keep rates stabilized when the  industry was ailing. The fund was capitalized by operating profits earned  before September 11, 2001, but depleted during the economic downturn  caused by the events of September 11 and the Severe Acute Respiratory  Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003.", "To pay for capital projects, the five ANSPs can either use current operating  revenues or borrow funds. Before commercialization, the ANSPs relied on  annual appropriations for capital projects; now, all five can borrow funds  through access to debt financing and private capital. For example, NAV  CANADA obtains all of its financing in the public debt markets. NAV  CANADA has a borrowing capacity of about $2.4 billion, of which $1.8  billion is currently drawn. In Germany, DFS mainly finances its capital  expenditures by drawing on a capital market program, which issues short-,  medium-, or long-term notes (i.e., debt issuance and commercial paper),  each amounting to approximately $546.4 million for a total of almost $1.1  billion, to private investors in the market. DFS can also draw on an annual  credit line of around $175.9 million from its bank."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The ANSPs Generate Revenues from Other Services", "paragraphs": ["The ANSPs may also charge fees, as applicable, for other services, such as  aeronautical information, consulting, and training.

In 2003, DFS\u2019s consulting  service generated revenue of about $2.8 million. In the UK, NATS competes  with other service providers to provide terminal services at UK airports. In  addition, NATS, like DFS, consults and offers training for other ANSPs  worldwide in implementing safety management systems, solving airspace  capacity problems, and commercializing ANSPs. From this business unit,  NATS generated profits of about $11.7 million in 2003 and about $14.8  million in 2004.", "Besides offering air navigation services in its own country, an ANSP may  provide services and technology to other regions of the world to generate  revenue. For example, Airservices Australia manages the upper airspace in  the Solomon Islands. NAV CANADA recently signed a contract with NATS  to install the Extended Computer Display System (EXCDS) in three  London-area airports, Stansted, Gatwick, and Heathrow, as well as to  provide NATS with its oceanic system.

Airservices must notify the commission  whenever it wants to raise fees. The commission then evaluates  Airservices\u2019 pricing proposal and decides to accept or reject the price  change. If the commission rejects the proposed price, it can set a lower  price. ACCC rejected one of two proposals by Airservices for a  temporary fee increase to address the revenue losses that followed  September 11 and the SARS outbreak, as well as the collapse of  Australia\u2019s second largest airline. ACCC accepted Airservices\u2019 first  proposal for a temporary fee increase for a year following the  September 11 and SARS outbreak. However, ACCC rejected Airservices\u2019  second proposed fee increase. The airline industry had objected to the  second set of proposed increases, citing a need for longer term price  certainty. The ACCC ultimately decided that a longer term arrangement  should be considered. ACCC directed Airservices to focus on 5-year  pricing plans to encourage long-term planning, emphasizing that the  robustness of the airlines should be taken into account when a price is  set.", "The Canadian Transportation Agency (CTA) reviews the price-setting  process against an established set of statutory principles.

After subtracting the cost of  capital ($4.4 million), the resulting EVA was approximately $3.9 million.

According to NATS, after placing this new center in  service, it reduced its staff costs by nearly $20.1 million and its costs for  services and materials by about $18.5 million between 2002 and 2003.

This  system replaced conventional radar screens with more advanced computer  screens that display data from a range of sources, including ground-based  surveillance equipment and satellite-linked navigational equipment on  aircraft, among others. TAAATS replaced handwritten, paper flight  progress strips with screen-based information that is updated  automatically. DFS is also eliminating systems that depend on paper strips  and expects productivity gains and cost savings to follow. In New Zealand,  according to the union that represents air traffic controllers, individual  controllers are now able to handle much more flight activity because of  improved technology.", "Besides improving productivity, modernization\u2014together with airspace  redesign\u2014has produced operational efficiencies, including fewer and  shorter delays, according to the ANSPs.

For example, Airways Corporation of New  Zealand deployed its new oceanic system, FANS1, in less than a year.

NATS purchased its oceanic system and automated  tower/terminal control system from NAV CANADA. To achieve further  purchasing efficiencies, some commercialized European ANSPs have  developed an alliance to procure systems.

Airservices Australia, for example, reported lower unit costs resulting from  the increases in controllers\u2019 productivity that followed the introduction of  TAAATS. NAV CANADA estimates that it is saving the airlines  approximately $80.3 million annually in reduced aircraft operating costs.  According to NAV CANADA, the airlines are now paying 20 percent less in  user fees than they formerly paid in ticket taxes when the government  provided air navigation services. In Germany, Lufthansa stated that  except in business years 2001 through 2003, the airline paid less in user fees  than it paid during the initial commercialization of Germany\u2019s air navigation  service in 1993. According to Airways Corporation of New Zealand, it  reduced en route charges by 22 percent in 1995 and by another 13 percent  since 1997, resulting in an overall reduction of more than 30 percent.", "For general aviation operators, however, commercialization has sometimes  meant an increase in fees. Before commercialization, many only paid taxes  on fuel. Some countries, such as Canada and New Zealand, have tried to  make the fees affordable for small operators by charging a flat fee. NAV  CANADA, for instance, charges general aviation operators a flat annual fee  of $58. According to the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association\u2013New  Zealand, Airways Corporation of New Zealand charges general aviation  operators a fee of $68 for 50 landings. In addition, Airways eliminated the  en route charge for light aircraft.", "Some governments have provided for air navigation services at small,  remote general aviation and regional airports, viewing such services as a  public good. Australia, for instance, subsidizes service to some regional  areas under the Location-Specific Tower Subsidy Program and, according  to Transport Canada, NAV CANADA is legislatively required to maintain  service to remote locations in the northern region.

The following paragraphs summarize these lessons."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Commercialized ANSPs Must Be Prepared to Mitigate the Effects of an Industry Downturn", "paragraphs": ["Because commercialized ANSPs rely primarily on user fees to cover their  costs, an industry downturn presents a fundamental financial risk for such  ANSPs that they must be prepared to mitigate, whether through a reserve  fund, cost-cutting measures, user fee increases, additional borrowing,  restructuring, or some combination of these or other options that will be  sufficient to offset the decline in air traffic and the concomitant decline in  revenue. The industry downturn that began in about 2000 and intensified  after the events of September 11, 2001, and the SARS outbreak of 2003  brought this lesson home to at least four of the five commercialized ANSPs  we selected for review. After commercialization and before the downturn,  these four\u2014Airservices, DFS, NATS, and NAV CANADA\u2014had been able to  cover their costs through user fees and borrowing. However, during the  downturn, they had to take additional steps to address the revenue losses.  NATS, with the greatest debt load, was the most vulnerable, but even NAV  CANADA, with a multimillion-dollar contingency fund, eventually had to  take extraordinary measures.", "Besides being burdened with debt, NATS was vulnerable to the industry  downturns because nearly all of its costs (95 percent) were fixed, limiting  its ability to cut costs, and its revenues depended heavily on North  American air traffic. Specifically, North American flights accounted for 14  percent of its flights and 44 percent of its revenues. When transatlantic  traffic declined after September 11, NATS\u2019s revenues declined 15 percent.  To avoid insolvency, NATS first obtained an estimated $104.2 million in  short-term loan credit from its lending banks and then refinanced, bringing  in a new equity partner (BAA, plc). However, the combination of lost  business and increased debt threatened NATS with insolvency in early  2002, leading it to implement operational cost savings, obtain a temporary  loan credit, refinance its debts, renegotiate prices for users through a new  regulatory structure, and obtain additional funds from the government and  private shareholders.", "Under its new regulatory structure, NATS now has a system in place to  mitigate the effects of an industry downturn through automatic price  increases that are triggered by reductions in air traffic. These price  increases go into effect when traffic falls below a benchmark level, limiting  NATS\u2019s revenue loss to 50 percent of the revenue that would have been  generated if the benchmark level of traffic had been reached. If traffic falls  below this 50 percent benchmark, as it might in a severe crisis, NATS\u2019s  revenue loss is limited to 20 percent of the projected revenue. In effect, this  automatic trigger mechanism spreads the risk of traffic downturns between  NATS and its airline customers. Without this trigger, the prices set by CAA,  the economic regulatory body, would remain fixed until the next regularly  scheduled review when prices may be adjusted, upward or downward, and  benchmark levels set.", "In Germany, DFS also lost revenue during the industry downturn, but to a  lesser degree. DFS reported a loss of more than $36.4 million in 2001, when  air traffic declined by 0.9 percent over the previous year. In 2002, it  sustained a loss of more than $23.2 million, when air traffic levels fell 2.9  percent below 2001 levels. To address these deficits, DFS modified  investments, canceled projects, and ultimately raised fees, thereby  increasing financial pressures on the airlines. However, when air traffic  increased again in 2003, DFS recorded an operating profit of more than  $87.4 million and reduced its 2005 fees for en route services by 19.5 percent  and for approach control services by 28 percent. DFS has begun to  consider the benefits of a reserve fund, but German legislation governing  air navigation service charges must be changed before DFS can develop  such a reserve.", "Before September 11, NAV CANADA banked up to $66.3 million in its rate  stabilization fund to protect against future losses. However, with the  industry downturn, this fund was quickly exhausted and, after the SARS  outbreak in 2003, the fund reached a cumulative deficit of about $96.9  million. To maintain operations, NAV CANADA cut costs and raised its  service fees, consulting with users as required. By the end of 2004, it  reduced the deficit to approximately $26.0 million, according to its 2004  annual report. However, as aviation industry representatives have noted,  the fee increases had the inadvertent effect of disrupting the business  cycles of air carriers, which faced the same difficult economic  circumstances. Moreover, because NAV CANADA\u2019s price-setting process is  limited only by statutory charging principles, NAV CANADA was able to  raise its fees unilaterally, without having to negotiate increases with  representatives of the airlines or other interests. Its board approved the fee  increases to balance revenues and expenses as required by legislation.

According to Airways, if the airlines say they do not  want to make a particular investment and the investment adds no value for  the customer, Airways will not spend the money.

Providing air  navigation services for such communities may not be commercially viable  because it typically generates less revenue than providing services for  larger communities. Even though the minimum cost of an air navigation  service is the same, regardless of the location, the cost per plane is often  higher at small or remote locations because the cost of the service is spread  among fewer operators, usually with smaller planes.", "In the past and in some countries today, the ANSPs charged the same fee  for air navigation services at every airport, regardless of its size or location.  Under this arrangement, called network pricing, services at heavily used  airports subsidize services at small or remote airports. However, two of our  five ANSPs, Airservices Australia and Airways Corporation of New  Zealand, have adopted an alternative pricing scheme, called location- specific pricing, under which the fee for some service matches the cost of  providing that service to a specific location. Once this scheme is fully  implemented, formerly subsidized air navigation services to small or  remote locations may likely cost more. If an airline decides that it does not  want to pay the increased fees, it may discontinue service to the location.  However, air service may be the only means of public transportation to  some small or remote locations. Continuing to provide air navigation  services to small or remote locations may require special efforts to balance  community needs and business interests.", "Airservices Australia has reported that it plans to phase in location-specific  pricing to ease the transition from network pricing. According to  Airservices, it will increase charges over the next 5 years at general  aviation and regional airports and the increased charges have been  approved by the regulator. Although the increases will be gradual, the plan  has raised concerns about further price increases and any future need to  close or reduce services at these locations. Some fear that needed air  services to remote bush locations will be lost, while others fear that  secondary services, such as flight school training, which are typically  provided at smaller airports, will be affected.", "The impact of location-specific pricing on remote communities and small  operators is difficult to predict. Costs may go up, but charges may not  necessarily be prohibitive. When legislation calls for service to remote  communities, an ANSP may ultimately be forced to take a financial loss if it  is not able to fully recover its costs. Airservices Australia is seeking to  control costs at some locations by deploying new lower cost technologies  to serve remote communities.

NAV  CANADA reported, however, that both it and Transport Canada disagreed  with the OAG\u2019s estimate and its underlying assumptions. In a study of the  NATS reorganization, the National Audit Office found that the UK  government raised some $1.3 billion from the sale of the ANSP to a  consortium of seven UK-based airlines.
