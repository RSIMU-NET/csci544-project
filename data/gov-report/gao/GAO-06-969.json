To allocate most EQIP funds, NRCS uses a general financial assistance formula that consists of 31 factors, including such measures as acres of cropland, miles of impaired rivers and streams, and acres of specialty cropland. However, this formula has several weaknesses. In particular, while the 31 factors in the financial assistance formula and the weights associated with each factor give the formula an appearance of precision, NRCS does not have a specific, documented rationale for (1) why it included each factor in the formula, (2) how it assigns and adjusts the weight for each factor, and (3) how each factor contributes to accomplishing the program's purpose of optimizing environmental benefits. Factors and weights are important because a small adjustment can shift the amount of funding allocated to each state on the basis of that factor and, ultimately, the amount of money each state receives. For example, in 2006, a 1 percent increase in the weight of any factor would have resulted in $6.5 million more allocated on the basis of that factor and a reduction of 1 percent in money allocated for other factors. In addition to weaknesses in documenting the design of the formula, some data NRCS uses in the formula to make financial decisions are questionable or outdated. For example, the formula does not use the most recent data available for 6 of the 31 factors, including commercial fertilizers applied to cropland. As a result, any recent changes in a state's agricultural or environmental status are not reflected in the funding for these factors. During the course of GAO's review, NRCS announced plans to reassess its EQIP financial assistance formula. NRCS recently developed a set of long-term, outcome-based performance measures to assess changes to the environment resulting from EQIP practices. The agency is also in the process of developing computer models and other data collection methods that will allow it to assess these measures. Thus, over time, NRCS should ultimately have more complete information on which to gauge program performance and better direct EQIP funds to areas of the country that need the most improvement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Approximately two-thirds of the continental U.S.\u2019s land area is used as  range, forest, crop, or pasture land.

If not properly managed, however, agricultural  production on these lands can damage the environment and the nation\u2019s  natural resources, as when routine agricultural activities produce  sediment, fertilizer runoff, and animal waste that can impair the nation\u2019s  waterways. Improper management of natural resources can also reduce the  productive capacity of agricultural land; for example, excessive soil  erosion may lead to soil lacking in nutrients.

Managed by NRCS, EQIP is a voluntary  program established in 1996 that currently provides about $1 billion  annually in cost-share and incentive payments to farmers and ranchers in  all 50 states, as well as U.S. territories, whose production practices may put  soil, water, air, and related natural resources at risk for environmental  damage. The program provides funds to help implement conservation  practices, such as planting vegetation along rivers and streams\u2014known as  riparian buffers\u2014to prevent sediment and other materials from polluting  the waters, and constructing waste storage facilities to reduce the level of  nutrients from livestock production that enter neighboring bodies of water.

However, if not properly managed, agricultural activities can impair  the nation\u2019s water, air, and soil; disrupt habitat for endangered species; and  constrain groundwater resources. For example, sediment produced during  routine agricultural activities may run off the land and reach surface  waters, including rivers and lakes. Sediment can destroy or degrade aquatic  habitat and can further impair water quality by transporting into area  waters both the pesticides applied to cropland and the nutrients found in  fertilizers and animal waste. These and other water quality issues are of  concern in a number of U.S. agriculture-producing regions, including the  Midwest and along the Mississippi River. Agriculture is also a major user of  groundwater and surface water, which has led to water resource concerns  across the country, particularly in the West. In 2000, irrigation accounted  for 65 percent of the nation\u2019s consumption of fresh water. Agricultural  production can also impair air quality, when wind carries eroded soil,  odors, and smoke, and may lead to the loss of wetlands, which provide  wildlife habitat, filter pollutants, retain sediment, and moderate hydrologic  extremes.", "EQIP is one of a number of USDA conservation programs designed to  mitigate agriculture\u2019s potentially negative environmental effects. EQIP  provides cost-share funds and incentive payments for land used for  agricultural production and supports around 190 conservation practices,  including constructing facilities to temporarily store animal waste; planting  rows of trees or shrubs to reduce wind erosion and provide food for  wildlife; and planning the amount, form, placement, and timing of the  application of plant nutrients. EQIP is designed to fund conservation  practices in a manner that helps the program achieve the following national  priorities identified by NRCS:  reducing nonpoint source pollution (nutrients, sediment, pesticides, or  excess salinity), groundwater contamination, and pollution from point  sources (such as concentrated animal feeding operations);   conserving groundwater and surface water resources;   reducing emissions that contribute to air quality impairment;   reducing soil erosion from unacceptable levels on agricultural land; and   promoting at-risk species habitat conservation.", "The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 created  EQIP by combining four existing conservation programs into a single  program. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, the farm  bill, reauthorized EQIP and increased its authorized funding from about  $200 million in 1997 to current levels of over $1 billion. The 2002 act  required that at least 60 percent of EQIP funds be made available for  conservation practices relating to livestock production. In addition, it  authorized EQIP funds for specific conservation purposes\u2014(1) funds for  producers to install water conservation practices to improve groundwater  and surface water conservation (the Ground and Surface Water  Conservation component of EQIP) and (2) funds for water conservation practices in the Klamath Basin located on the California/Oregon border  (the Klamath Basin component of EQIP).", "Annually, NRCS headquarters officials determine the amount of funding  each state receives, while state and local NRCS officials decide what  conservation practices to fund in their state and local communities. The  total amount of EQIP funding a state receives can be derived by adding  together that state\u2019s funding for all categories. Table 1 describes the  different categories of funding that states received for fiscal year 2006 and  NRCS\u2019s process for allocating that funding.", "As the table shows, each category of EQIP funding is allocated to the states  using a different process. For the general financial assistance formula, the  availability of natural resources accounts for approximately half of the  funds allocated, and the presence of environmental concerns or problems  accounts for the remainder. Table 2 shows the factors and weights used in  the financial assistance formula for fiscal year 2006.", "In fiscal year 2006, approximately $652 million was divided among the  states through the general financial assistance formula. For example,  according to the formula, EQIP funding for nonirrigated cropland  (accounting for 3.2 percent of financial assistance) totaled $20.9 million.  The state with the most acres of nonirrigated cropland received $1.7  million of the funds associated with this factor, and the state with the  fewest acres of nonirrigated cropland received approximately $1,100. A  state\u2019s total allocation is composed of the funds it receives for each of the  31 factors.", "Although about 65 percent of EQIP funds are provided through the general  financial assistance formula, other categories of funding can have a  significant effect on the total amount of funds an individual state receives.  For example, 35 percent of Utah\u2019s fiscal year 2006 allocation was from  general financial assistance. The largest category of EQIP funds Utah  received\u201438 percent\u2014was Colorado Salinity funds.

The original EQIP formula was created  in 1997 by an interagency task force that modified the formula created for a  different conservation program\u2014the Conservation Technical Assistance  Program. The task force added and deleted factors and adjusted factor  weights so that the EQIP formula better corresponded to the Federal  Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996\u2019s requirement that 50  percent of funds be targeted at funding livestock-related practices.", "Since the creation of the financial assistance formula, NRCS has  periodically modified factors and weights to emphasize different program  elements and national priorities, most recently in fiscal year 2004 following  the passage of the 2002 Farm Security and Rural Investment Act.  Furthermore, NRCS officials stated that they meet annually to review the  allocation of funds to states. However, throughout this process, NRCS has  not documented the basis for its decisions to modify factors and weights or  documented how changes to its formula achieve the program\u2019s purpose of  optimizing environmental benefits. Thus, it is not always clear whether the  formula factors and weights guide funds to the states as effectively as  possible. For example, it is unclear why NRCS includes a factor in the  formula that addresses the waste management costs of small animal  feeding operations but not a factor that addresses such costs for large  operations\u2014large operations can also damage the environment and are  eligible for EQIP funding. By not including the costs of the larger  operations in its financial assistance formula, some states may not be  receiving funds to address their specific environmental concerns. In  addition, NRCS has not demonstrated that it has the most appropriate  water quality factors in its formula. For example, the formula includes a  factor addressing river and stream impairment but no factor for impaired  lakes and other bodies of water. Moreover, it is not certain whether the  impaired rivers and streams factor results in funds being awarded on the  basis of general water quality concerns or water pollution specifically  caused by agricultural production. As a result, it was not certain whether  the formula allocates funds as effectively as possible to states with water  quality concerns arising from agricultural production.", "While the factors in the EQIP general financial assistance formula  determine what resource and environmental characteristics are considered  when allocating funds, the weights associated with these factors directly  affect how much total funding is provided for each factor and, thus, the  amount of money each state receives. Factors and weights are key to  ensuring states with the greatest environmental problems receive funding  to address these problems. Small differences in the weights of the factors  can shift the amount of financial assistance directed at a particular  resource concern and, ultimately, the amount of money provided to a state.  In 2006, if the weight of any of the 31 factors had increased by 1 percent,  $6.5 million would have been allocated on the basis of that factor at the  expense of one or more other factors. Such a shift could impact the amount  of financial assistance received by each state. For example, a 1 percent  increase in the weight of the specialty cropland factor with a corresponding  decrease of 1 percent in the American Indian tribal land factor could result  in large changes to the distribution of EQIP general financial assistance.  According to our analysis, the state benefiting the most from such a change  would receive $2.6 million more (a 7.2 percent increase in that state\u2019s level  of general financial assistance) and the state benefiting least from such a  change would lose $2.7 million (a 13.5 percent decrease in that state\u2019s level  of general financial assistance). The potential for the weights to  significantly affect the amount of funding a state receives underscores the  importance of having a well-founded rationale for assigning them. To date,  NRCS has not documented its rationale for choosing the weights.", "Some stakeholders we spoke with questioned NRCS\u2019s assignment of  weights to certain factors in the financial assistance formula because they  did not believe NRCS\u2019s formula adequately reflected the states\u2019  environmental priorities. For example, NRCS\u2019s general financial assistance  formula allocates 6.3 percent of EQIP funds to the states based on factors  specifically associated with animal feeding operations. However, states  spent more of their EQIP financial assistance on related practices, which  suggests that the weights in the financial assistance formula may not reflect  states\u2019 priorities. In fiscal year 2005, states spent a total of 11 percent of  EQIP financial assistance, or $91.1 million, on one such practice\u2014the  construction of waste storage facilities for animal feeding operations. (App.  VI outlines the practices funded in fiscal year 2005, including other  practices to control pollution from animal feeding operations.)  More  generally, other stakeholders said that, as the program develops, NRCS  should give additional weight to factors related to the presence of  environmental concerns in a state and place less emphasis on factors  related to natural resources in a state. They believed this reassignment of  weights would better ensure that states contending with the most  significant environmental problems receive the most funding. Currently,  factors related to the presence of environmental concerns account for  approximately half of the total funding, while factors relating to the  availability of natural resources account for the remainder. Factors related  to the availability of natural resources provide states that have significant  amounts of a particular type of land\u2014such as grazing land or cropland\u2014 with more funds, regardless of whether that land is impaired.", "Although NRCS has stated that it meets annually to review its allocation of  funds to states, officials told us they had not conducted any statistical  analysis to examine the influence of factors on funding outcomes.  Statistical analyses can provide information on how the factors in the  allocation formula have affected the distribution of funds, thereby providing information to improve program implementation. To better  understand the effect of the factors on the allocations to states, we used  two types of statistical analysis to assess the effects of the EQIP financial  assistance formula on state funding:  (1) regression analysis to show which  factors are the most influential in determining funding levels and (2) factor  analysis to understand how factors can be grouped and identified with  program priorities.", "Our regression analysis for the fiscal year 2006 funding allocation shows  that the factors that were the most important in explaining the distribution  of general financial assistance to states were acres of fair and poor  rangeland, acres of nonfederal grazing lands, livestock animal units, acres  of irrigated cropland, acres of American Indian tribal lands, and wind  erosion above T. This analysis suggests that regions of the country with  these types of characteristics are more likely to benefit from the current  formula. On the other hand, a few factors, such as acres of forestlands,  potential for pesticide and nitrogen leaching, and air quality nonattainment  areas were not significantly related to the allocation, indicating that they  had little or no impact on the formula.", "Our factor analysis, which groups the data into a smaller number of  categories that actually drive the formula, found that the largest grouping  with the greatest amount of correlation, included acres of nonfederal  grazing land, acres of fair and poor rangeland, livestock animal units, and  wind erosion above T\u2014all indicative of dryland agriculture and livestock  feeding and ranching. These results correspond with those of our  regression analysis and help to show how the current national allocation  formula prioritizes money to states. A complete explanation of both  analyses is included in appendix III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Assistance Formula Relies on Some Questionable and Outdated Data", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in the financial assistance formula are compounded by NRCS\u2019s  use of questionable and outdated data. Accurate data are key to ensuring  that funds are distributed to states as intended. However, we identified  several methodological weaknesses in the data sources:  (1) data that were  used more than once in the formula, (2) data sources whose accuracy  could not be verified, and (3) data that was not as recent as possible.", "First, 5 of the 29 data sources behind the factors in the financial assistance  formula were used more than once, potentially causing NRCS to  overemphasize some environmental concerns at the expense of others.  Specifically:    NRCS uses the same data to estimate pesticide and nitrogen runoff and  phosphorous runoff in its formula. According to NRCS, because data  measuring the potential for phosphorous runoff were unavailable, it  substituted data measuring the potential for pesticide and nitrogen  runoff. The agency did so believing that similar characteristics cause  both types of runoff. However, an NRCS official responsible for deriving  the runoff and leaching indicators commented that the substitution of  one type of runoff data for another was problematic because the  mechanisms through which pesticides and nitrogen are transported off- site to cause environmental problems are different from those of  phosphorous. A 2006 NRCS cropland report estimates that the intensity  of nitrogen and phosphorous losses may differ geographically. For  example, nitrogen dissolved in surface water runoff in the upper  Midwest accounts for 28 percent of the national total, while  phosphorous dissolved in surface water runoff in the same region  accounts for 45 percent of the national total. This difference in the effect  of these two pollutants in the same region raises questions about the  appropriateness of substituting one type of data for the other. Until  adequate data are available for a given factor, it may not be appropriate  to include that factor in the general financial assistance formula.", "NRCS\u2019s formula uses nonirrigated cropland, federal grazing land,  nonfederal grazing land, and forestland once for estimating acreage and  then again for estimating carbon sequestration. According to NRCS,  the agency did not have good source data to measure potential areas  where management practices could improve levels of carbon  sequestration so it substituted these other data sources. While we could  not fully assess the soundness of NRCS\u2019s estimate of carbon  sequestration, some academic stakeholders we spoke with questioned  whether NRCS had estimated carbon sequestration as effectively as  possible and noted that alternate data sources were available. In  discussing these alternate sources with NRCS, the EQIP Manager said  the agency had not previously considered using these sources for the  EQIP formula, but that they could prove relevant.", "Using the same data for multiple factors may result in factors being  indirectly weighted higher than intended. For example, the effective weight  of the pesticide nitrogen runoff factor is 5.6 percent\u2014the sum of the  original pesticide nitrogen runoff weight (1.7 percent) and the phosphorous  runoff weight (3.9 percent). Using data created for one factor for a second  factor also makes the formula less transparent and potentially less reliable  for allocating state funding.", "Second, NRCS could not confirm the source of data used in 10 factors in  the formula; as such, we could not determine the accuracy of the data,  verify how NRCS generated the data, or fully understand the basis on  which the agency allocates funding. Specifically, we could not confirm the  source of data for acres of federal grazing land, livestock animal units,  animal waste generation, acres of cropland eroding above T, acres of  forestlands eroding above T, ratio of animal units to cropland, miles of  impaired rivers and streams, ratio of commercial fertilizers to cropland,  riparian areas, and coastal zone land. For example, we could not verify  how data for the livestock animal units and animal waste factors were  generated, and NRCS said it had not retained documentation of how the  data for these factors were calculated. As a result, it was uncertain whether  NRCS had chosen the most appropriate data as its basis for allocating  funds to states with pollution problems from livestock and animal waste or  whether the data were accurately calculated. EQIP officials told us that, in  most cases, the data sources had been chosen and incorporated into the  formula before they were involved with EQIP and that documentation had  not been kept to identify how data sources were used.", "In addition, for one factor\u2014 the number of limited resource producers in a  state\u2014we found that the data did not measure what its factor name  indicated. NRCS defines a limited resource producer as one who had, for  the last 2 years, (1) farm sales not more than $100,000 and (2) a household  income at or below the poverty level, or less than 50 percent of the county  median household income. However, the data NRCS uses in the general  financial assistance formula only captures farms with low sales, which  does not necessarily indicate whether producers on those farms have  limited means. As a result, NRCS may not be directing funds to states  having farmers with the most limited resources. A description of each  factor in the fiscal year 2006 general financial assistance formula can be  found in appendix II.", "Third, NRCS does not use the most current data for six factors in the  formula\u2014livestock animal units, animal waste generation, number of  limited resource producers, miles of impaired rivers and streams, ratio of  livestock animal units to cropland, and ratio of commercial fertilizers to  cropland. According to NRCS, the source of data on the ratio of  commercial fertilizers to cropland was a 1995 report by the Association of  American Plant Food Control Officials; we found a 2005 version of the  same report with more current data. In other cases, we identified more  current, alternate sources of data. For example, the formula currently uses  1996 EPA data for its waste management capital cost factor but could use  2003 NRCS data that estimates waste management costs. Not using  recent data raises questions about whether the formula allocates funds to  areas of the country that currently have the greatest environmental needs,  because recent changes in a state\u2019s agricultural or environmental status  may not be reflected. According to our analysis, by using more current data  for the number of limited resource producers factor, one state would have  received approximately $151,000 more in fiscal year 2006 (a 0.2 percent  increase in that state\u2019s general financial assistance), and another state  would have received approximately $138,000 less (a 1.3 percent decrease in  that state\u2019s general financial assistance). Because we were unable to  determine how NRCS used the data for developing the remaining five  factors, we could not determine what impact using more current data for  those factors would have on financial assistance provided to states.  According to NRCS, the alternate sources we identified appeared to be  acceptable for use in the formula, and the agency is in the process of  updating the formula\u2019s livestock data.", "In addition to these six factors, data used to measure acres of riparian  areas, fair and poor rangeland, and forestland eroding above T are about 20  years old and will likely become more inappropriate over time.", "When we brought our concerns to NRCS\u2019s attention, officials agreed that  the formula, including weights and data sources, needed to be reexamined.  NRCS subsequently announced plans to issue a request for proposal  soliciting comments and suggested revisions to NRCS\u2019s formulas for  allocating conservation funds, including the EQIP financial assistance  formula. In addition, according to NRCS\u2019s EQIP Manager, the agency is in  the process of consolidating the data used in the financial assistance  formulas for its conservation programs into a single database.

Many of the eigenvalues were close  to zero, indicating a serious problem with multicollinearity.

This procedure generates a set of latent variables,  called principal components\u2014uncorrelated linear transformations of the  original variables. At this stage, even though the new variables are not  collinear, the same magnitude of variance is retained. Therefore, the  elimination of small principal components reduces the total variance and  substantially improves the diagnostic capability of the model. In order to  eliminate these small principal components, various selection procedures  are used. Following Fekedulegn (2002), we chose the cumulative  eigenvalue product rule, which keeps the first principal components whose  combined product is greater than 1.00 (Guiot et al., 1982).

However,  this procedure will usually leave some principal components that are not  statistically significant. Therefore, to further eliminate the nonsignificant  principal components, we used the SAS stepwise regression procedure.   Specifically, we eliminated \u201cr\u201d principal components in the analysis, which  consisted of the (1) number eliminated using the eigenvalue product rule  and (2) number eliminated from the stepwise regression.
