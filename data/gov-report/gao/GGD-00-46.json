Although legislative changes were not made at that time, work in this area continued among the agencies. Following the group\u2019s reactivation in 1994, it proposed legislative changes to the Bankruptcy Code that would clarify the validity of netting certain foreign currency transactions. A similar proposal was subsequently enacted into law. \u201c(1) clarify the treatment of certain financial contracts (i.e., securities contracts, commodity contracts, forward contracts,[] repurchase agreements,[] and swap agreements[]) upon the insolvency of one of the counterparties to a transaction and (2) recognize certain netting arrangements in order to reduce the risk that the failure of one entity to pay its obligations will cause other firms to fail to meet their obligations.\u201d", "The Proposal also clarified that cross-product close-out netting would be permitted under law.

LTCM\u2019s near- collapse raised concerns at the Federal Reserve and among its creditors and counterparties that the rapid liquidation of LTCM\u2019s trading positions and related positions of other market participants might pose a significant threat to already unsettled global financial markets.

The report included recommendations for improvements in several areas, such as more frequent and meaningful public disclosure, regulatory encouragement of improved private sector risk-management practices, regulatory promotion of risk-sensitive approaches to capital adequacy, congressional expansion of risk-assessment rules, resolution of bankruptcy issues, and regulatory encouragement of compliance with international standards by offshore financial centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Working Group Was Asked to Report on Y2K Preparedness", "paragraphs": ["In May 1999, the Ranking Minority Member of the House Committee on Commerce asked the group to report on progress made on issues raised in our April 1999 report on Y2K  preparedness within the financial markets.In September 1999, the Working Group issued a response to this request.Specifically, the group outlined work completed on (1) coordination of actions and information among regulators and other organizations during the date change period; (2) promotion of additional Y2K readiness disclosure by foreign organizations; (3) development of strategies to communicate the readiness of the financial sector to alleviate the public\u2019s concerns; and (4) identification of significant changes, if any, in the conditions reported in our April 1999 report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Working Group Was Asked to Report on OTC Derivatives", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned earlier, the Working Group was revitalized, in part, because of concerns raised about risks posed by the rapid growth of the OTC derivatives market. In 1994, following the release of our report on OTC derivatives, Congress asked the Working Group to respond to issues raised in the report. In July 1994, it issued a response and agreed to continue to discuss the issues concerning OTC derivatives. In 1998, the discussion on how to address OTC derivatives oversight continued; however, CFTC\u2019s chairperson became dissatisfied with the Working Group\u2019s progress and CFTC issued a concept release on OTC derivatives oversight as an alternative mechanism for discussion about its stance on this issue.

Consequently, SEC, the Federal Reserve, and Treasury issued a joint statement expressing deep concerns with the stance taken in the concept paper. Additionally, they drafted proposed legislation to limit temporarily CFTC\u2019s rulemaking on swaps. Similar legislation was subsequently passed, and in 1998, the Working Group was asked to study OTC derivatives oversight.

In 1998, agenda items for biweekly Steering Committee meetings included decimalization of stock price quotes, Y2K initiatives, proposed revisions to the Bankruptcy Code, and circuit breakers. The 1999 agendas we reviewed were dominated by ongoing work on hedge funds and OTC derivatives oversight reports. According to agency officials, these biweekly meetings also have resulted in greater coordination among the regulators outside of the Working Group. For example, they said that a presentation at one of the Steering Committee meetings by SEC\u2019s Chief Accountant on SEC\u2019s soon-to-be released position on loan loss reserves resulted in separate discussions on the issue outside of the Working Group. The discussion was referred to the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, which held meetings with accountants from various financial regulators to discuss their differing positions on the issue. The regulators subsequently issued a joint statement \u201cto better ensure the consistent application of loan loss accounting policy and to improve the transparency of financial statements.\u201d", "Agency officials described the Steering Committee\u2019s discussions as \u201cpolicy-oriented.\u201d They added that although some of their activities result in tangible products, such as reports and legislative proposals, other issues are discussed on a regular basis. For example, agency officials said that they use the biweekly meetings to inform others about recent or proposed regulatory actions. In addition, some officials noted that the meetings also provide a forum to discuss upcoming hearings and share testimonies. In addition to the periodic principal meetings and biweekly Steering Committee meetings, the Working Group provides a forum to address intermarket events as they unfold.  For example, agency officials said that when Barings failed in 1995, the Working Group provided a forum to share information about the unfolding crisis.", "Although officials generally described the Steering Committee\u2019s biweekly discussions as policy oriented, they said that they generally did not use these meetings as a forum to coordinate regulatory oversight activities of its members\u2019 agencies. Rather, they said the meetings provided a forum to alert other regulators of current events at the various agencies. For example, agency officials said that these biweekly meetings were not used to debate the merits of proposed rulemaking. Instead, agency officials often used the meetings to inform one another of agency action shortly before or after public announcements were made. When asked whether the Steering Committee was ever used as a forum to discuss potential regulatory concerns about an individual financial institution (prior to a crisis), officials said that it generally had not been used in that manner but that it could be used as such a vehicle in the future. The regulatory officials also pointed out that coordination and information sharing between the staffs of regulators occurred bilaterally and multilaterally on a \u201ccase-by- case\u201d basis.", "In recent years, because of the blurring of traditional lines that separate the businesses of banks and securities and futures firms, it is more important than ever for regulators to assess information that cuts across these lines. We addressed this issue in our report on the regulatory issues raised by LTCM and recommended that federal financial regulators develop better ways to coordinate the assessment of risks that cross traditional regulatory and industry boundaries. The agencies commented that the Working Group already functions this way. However, the Working Group was established in response to a crisis and, as the need has arisen, has continued to function as such. That is, activities generally have been focused on responding to market events and developing policies to improve the functioning of markets. Generally, it has not functioned as a group for coordinating regulatory oversight, although it has discussed information sharing among agencies. The Working Group\u2019s activities generally have not included such matters as routine surveillance of risks that cross markets or of sharing information that is specific enough to help identify potential crises.

For example, in the mid 1990s both the Federal Reserve and FDIC separately began to explore potential changes to the Bankruptcy Code to update laws to reflect changes in the market and better suit modern financial contracts.  A series of meetings among various regulators led to the issue becoming a matter for consideration by the Working Group. FDIC, one of the nonmember participants in the Working Group, led the work on this issue and assisted in drafting the legislative proposal that suggested changes to the Bankruptcy Code to address netting certain financial products.

For example, following the near-failure of LTCM, some Members of Congress and others questioned the degree of coordination and cooperation that existed within the group prior to the development of the potential crisis. Various proposals have been made to provide a statutory basis for the Working Group, in the belief that such a basis could ensure its continuity, make it more accountable to Congress, and improve its effectiveness.", "Although such proposals to provide a statutory basis for the Working Group could help ensure greater continuity and improved accountability, their impact on effectiveness could depend upon how certain issues were resolved. First, establishing the Working Group in statute and providing it with a mission would likely lead to a more formal structure than that of the current Working Group, with its informal structure and mission as articulated in the 1994 Bentsen letter.  A more formal structure and more clearly articulated congressionally defined mission could provide the basis for a more focused approach to interagency coordination. However, members of the Steering Committee expressed concerns that a more formal structure could have the effect of limiting the Working Group\u2019s ability to achieve its current level of coordination, because it could lead to more bureaucracy.  They believe its current structure is adequate to achieve a set of modest but realistic coordination goals.", "Second, if Congress were to articulate a mission, mission requirements likely would have staff and budgetary implications. There is likely to be a correlation between the expansiveness of the mission and the resource commitment such a mission would entail.  For example, certain improvements to coordination, such as greater information sharing of counterparty risk exposures across markets, could potentially be achieved with little or no additional staff or specified budget.  However, more formal monitoring and sharing of routine company-level information aimed at identifying potential systemic risks could require full-time staff and other budgetary resources.", "A third issue related to providing a statutory basis for the Working Group is the Working Group\u2019s lack of authority. Currently, it has no authority to bind members to its decisions or positions. Its members serve in their capacities as heads of agencies, and three of the agencies are led by commissions or a board; and thus Working Group decisions or recommendations must be approved by the respective commissions or board of the members before they can be acted upon. Formalizing the group would have little effect on addressing this issue unless legislation provided a mechanism for making decisions binding. For example, if the group\u2019s membership were expanded to include the entire commissions and board, they may be more likely to adopt the group\u2019s decisions.

Other issues were considered by SEC and/or CFTC and the securities and futures exchanges that they regulate, but they were not pursued because implementing them was determined not to be feasible or practicable. For example, according to SEC officials, some of these issues, such as price limits on individual stocks, were the result of academic articles and were considered and rejected by the agencies and exchanges. Some issues, such as \u201cestablishment of separate trading of index baskets of stock,\u201d were attempted and withdrawn due to lack of investor interest.
