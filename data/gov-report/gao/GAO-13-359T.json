These  impacts pose significant financial risks for the federal government, which  owns extensive infrastructure, insures property through federal flood and  crop insurance programs, provides technical assistance to state and local  governments, and provides emergency aid in response to natural  disasters. However, the federal government is not well positioned to  address this fiscal exposure, partly because of the complex, cross-cutting  nature of the issue.

In particular, the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), which administers the NFIP, was not been authorized to  account for long-term erosion when updating flood maps used to set  premium rates for the NFIP, increasing the likelihood that premiums  would not cover future losses. We suggested that Congress consider  authorizing the NFIP to account for long-term flood erosion in its flood  maps, and the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012  requires FEMA to use information on topography, coastal erosion  areas, changing lake levels, future changes in sea levels, and  intensity of hurricanes in updating its flood maps. While these  provisions respond to our suggestion to Congress, their ultimate  effectiveness will depend on their implementation by FEMA. It is too  early to evaluate such efforts, but we plan to examine the NFIP in the  near future.", "Technical assistance to state and local governments. The federal  government invests billions of dollars annually in infrastructure  projects that state and local governments prioritize and supervise.  These projects have large up front capital investments and long lead  times that require decisions about how to address climate change to  be made well before its potential effects are discernable. We reported  in October 2009 that insufficient site-specific data\u2014such as local  temperature and precipitation projections\u2014make it hard for state and  local officials to justify the current costs of adaptation efforts for  potentially less certain future benefits. We recommended that the  appropriate entities within the Executive Office of the President  develop a strategic plan for adaptation that, among other things,  identifies mechanisms to increase the capacity of federal, state, and  local agencies to incorporate information about current and potential  climate change impacts into government decision making.", "USGCRP\u2019s 2012-2021 strategic plan for climate change science,  released in April 2012, recognizes this need by identifying enhanced  information management and sharing as a key objective, and  USGCRP is undertaking several actions designed to better coordinate  use and application of federal climate science. We have ongoing work  related to these issues. In addition, gaps in satellite coverage, which  could occur as soon as 2014, are expected to affect the continuity of  climate and space weather measurements important to developing  the information needed by state and local officials. According to  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration program officials, a  satellite data gap would result in less accurate and timely weather  forecasts and warnings of extreme events\u2014such as hurricanes, storm  surges and floods. We have concluded that the potential gap in  weather satellite data is a high-risk area and added it to the High Risk  List this year as well.", "Disaster aid. In the event of a major disaster, federal funding for  response and recovery comes from the Disaster Relief Fund  managed by FEMA and disaster aid programs of other participating  federal agencies. The federal government does not budget for these  costs and runs the risk of facing a large fiscal exposure at any time.  We reported in September 2012 that disaster declarations have  increased over recent decades to a record of 98 in fiscal year 2011  compared with 65 in 2004. Over that period, FEMA obligated more  than $80 billion in federal assistance for disasters. We found that  FEMA has had difficulty implementing longstanding plans to assess  national preparedness capabilities and that FEMA\u2019s indicator for  determining whether to recommend that a jurisdiction receive disaster  assistance does not accurately reflect the ability of state and local  governments to respond to disasters. In September 2012, we  recommended, among other things, that FEMA develop a  methodology to more accurately assess a jurisdiction\u2019s capability to  respond to and recover from a disaster without federal assistance.

Polar-orbiting satellites constantly  circle the earth in an almost north-south orbit providing global coverage of  environmental conditions that affect the weather and climate. As the earth  rotates beneath it, each polar-orbiting satellite views the entire earth\u2019s  surface twice a day. In contrast, geostationary satellites maintain a fixed  position relative to the earth from a high-level orbit of about 22,300 miles  in space. Used in combination with ground, sea, and airborne observing  systems, both types of satellites have become an indispensable part of  monitoring and forecasting weather and climate. For example, polar- orbiting satellites provide the data that go into numerical weather  prediction models, which are a primary tool for forecasting weather days  in advance\u2014including forecasting the path and intensity of hurricanes  and tropical storms. Geostationary satellites provide frequently-updated  graphical images that are used to identify current weather patterns and  provide short-term warnings.", "For more than 40 years, the United States has operated two separate  operational polar-orbiting meteorological satellites systems: the Polar- orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite series, which is managed by  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\u2014a component  of the Department of Commerce; and the Defense Meteorological  Satellite Program (DMSP), which is managed by the Air Force. The  government also relies on data from a European satellite program, called  the Meteorological Operational (MetOp) satellite series. These satellites  are positioned so that they cross the equator in the early morning,  midmorning, and early afternoon in order to obtain regular updates  throughout the day.", "With the expectation that combining the two separate U.S. polar satellite  programs would result in sizable cost savings, a May 1994 Presidential  Decision Directive required NOAA and DOD to converge the two  programs into a single new satellite acquisition, which became the  National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System  (NPOESS). However, in the years that followed, NPOESS encountered  significant technical challenges in sensor development and experienced  program cost growth and schedule delays, in part due to problems in the  program\u2019s management structure. After several restructurings and  recurring challenges, in February 2010, the Executive Office of the  President\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy announced that  NOAA and DOD would no longer jointly procure NPOESS; instead, each  agency would plan and acquire its own satellite system. Specifically,  NOAA, with support from the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), would be responsible for the afternoon orbit, and  DOD would be responsible for the early morning orbit. The U.S.  partnership with the European satellite agency for data from the  midmorning orbit would continue as planned.", "Subsequently, NOAA initiated its replacement program, the Joint Polar  Satellite System (JPSS). JPSS consists of a demonstration satellite\u2014 called the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP)\u2014launched in  October 2011; two satellites, with at least five instruments planned for  each, to be launched by March 2017 and December 2022, respectively;  two stand-alone satellites to accommodate three additional instruments;  and ground systems for the entire program. The program is currently  estimated to cost $12.9 billion. In June 2012, we reported that NOAA and  NASA made progress in establishing the JPSS program and in launching  and operating the demonstration satellite, but noted that program officials  expect there to be a gap in satellite observations before the first JPSS  satellite is launched.", "Specifically, NOAA officials anticipate a gap in the afternoon orbit from 18  to 24 months between the time that NPP reaches the end of its lifespan  and when the first JPSS satellite is fully ready for operational use. We  identified other scenarios where the gap could last from 17 to 53 months.  For example, the gap would be 17 months if NPP lasts 5 years until  October 2016 and JPSS is launched as planned in March 2017 and  undergoes a 12-month on-orbit checkout before it is fully operational.  Alternatively, if NPP lasts only 3 years\u2014which NASA engineers consider  possible due to poor workmanship in the fabrication of the instruments\u2014 and JPSS launches 1 year later than currently planned, the gap in  satellite observations could reach 53 months.", "After NPOESS was disbanded, DOD also began planning its own follow- on polar satellite program. However, it halted work in early 2012, since it  still has two legacy DMSP satellites in storage that will be launched as  needed to maintain observations in the early morning orbit. The agency  currently plans to launch its two remaining satellites in 2014 and 2020.  Moreover, DOD is working to identify alternatives to meet its future  environmental satellite requirements. However, in June 2012, we reported  that there is a possibility of satellite data gaps in DOD\u2019s early morning  orbit. The two remaining DMSP satellites may not work as intended  because they were built in the late 1990s and will be quite old by the time  they are launched. If the satellites do not perform as expected, a data gap  in the early morning orbit could occur as early as 2014.", "Satellite data gaps in the morning or afternoon polar orbits would lead to  less accurate and timely weather forecasting; as a result, advanced  warning of extreme events would be affected. Such extreme events could  include hurricanes, storm surges, and floods. For example, the National  Weather Service performed case studies to demonstrate how its  forecasts would have been affected if there were no polar satellite data in  the afternoon orbit, and noted that its forecasts for the \u201cSnowmaggedon\u201d  winter storm that hit the Mid-Atlantic coast in February 2010 would have  predicted a less intense storm further east, with about half of the  precipitation at 3, 4, and 5 days before the event. Specifically, the models  would have under-forecasted the amount of snow by at least 10 inches.  Similarly, a European weather organization recently reported that  NOAA\u2019s forecasts of Superstorm Sandy\u2019s track could have been  hundreds of miles off without polar-orbiting satellites: rather than  identifying the New Jersey landfall within 30 miles 4 days before landfall,  the models would have shown the storm remaining at sea.", "In June 2012, we reported that while NOAA officials communicated  publicly and often about the risk of a polar satellite data gap, the agency  had not established plans to mitigate the gap. At the time, NOAA officials  stated that the agency would continue to use existing satellites as long as  they provide data and that there were no viable alternatives to the JPSS  program. However, our report noted that a more comprehensive  mitigation plan was essential since it is possible that other governmental,  commercial, or foreign satellites could supplement the polar satellite data.  For example, other nations continue to launch polar-orbiting weather  satellites to acquire data such as sea surface temperatures, sea surface  winds, and water vapor. Also, over the next few years, NASA plans to  launch satellites that will collect information on precipitation and soil  moisture. Because it could take time to adapt ground systems to receive,  process, and disseminate an alternative satellite\u2019s data, we noted that any  delays in establishing mitigation plans could leave the agency little time to  leverage its alternatives. We recommended that NOAA establish  mitigation plans for pending satellite gaps in the afternoon orbit as well as  potential gaps in the early morning orbit.", "In September 2012, the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and  Atmosphere (who is also the NOAA Administrator) reported that NOAA  had several actions under way to address polar satellite data gaps,  including (1) an investigation on how to maximize the life of the  demonstration satellite, (2) an investigation on how to accelerate the  development of the second JPSS satellite, and (3) the development of a  mitigation plan to address potential data gaps until the first JPSS satellite  becomes operational. The Under Secretary also directed NOAA\u2019s  Assistant Secretary to, by mid-October 2012, establish a contract to  conduct an enterprise-wide examination of contingency options and to  develop a written, descriptive, end-to-end plan that considers the entire  flow of data from possible alternative sensors through data assimilation  and on to forecast model performance. In October 2012, NOAA issued a  mitigation plan for a potential gap in the afternoon orbit, between the  current polar satellite and the first JPSS satellite. The plan identifies and  prioritizes options for obtaining critical observations, including alternative  satellite data sources and improvements to data assimilation in models. It  also lists technical, programmatic, and management steps needed to  implement these options.", "However, these plans are only the beginning. The agency must make  difficult decisions on which steps it will implement to ensure that its  mitigation plans are viable when needed. For example, NOAA must make  decisions about (1) whether and how to extend support for legacy satellite  systems so that their data might be available if needed, (2) how much  time and resources to invest in improving satellite models so that they  assimilate data from alternative sources, (3) whether to pursue  international agreements for access to additional satellite systems and  how best to resolve any security issues with the foreign data, (4) when  and how to test the value and integration of alternative data sources, and  (5) how these preliminary mitigation plans will be integrated with the  agency\u2019s broader end-to-end plans for sustaining weather forecasting  capabilities. NOAA must also identify time frames for when these  decisions will be made. We have ongoing work assessing NOAA\u2019s efforts  to limit and mitigate potential polar satellite data gaps.", "Geostationary environmental satellites transmit frequently updated  images of the weather currently affecting the United States to every  national weather forecast office in the country. These are the satellite  images that the public often sees on television news programs. NOAA  plans to have its $10.9 billion Geostationary Operational Environmental  Satellite-R (GOES-R) series replace the current fleet of geostationary  satellites, which will begin to reach the end of their useful lives in 2015.  The GOES-R program has undergone a series of changes since 2006  and now consists of four geostationary satellites and a ground system.  However, problems with instrument and ground system development  caused a 19-month delay in completing the program\u2019s preliminary design  review, which occurred in February 2012. In June 2012, we reported that  GOES-R schedules were not fully reliable and that they could contribute  to delays in satellite launch dates. Program officials acknowledged that  the likelihood of meeting the October 2015 launch date was 48 percent.", "While NOAA\u2019s policy is to have two operational satellites and one backup  satellite in orbit at all times, continued delays in the launch of the first  GOES-R satellite could lead to a gap in satellite coverage. This policy  proved useful in December 2008 and again in September 2012 when the  agency experienced problems with one of its operational satellites, but  was able to move its backup satellite into place until the problems were  resolved. However, beginning in April 2015, NOAA expects to have only  two operational satellites and no backup satellite in orbit until GOES-R is  launched and completes an estimated 6-month post-launch test period.  As a result, there could be a year or more gap during which time a  backup satellite would not be available. If NOAA were to experience a  problem with either of its operational satellites before GOES-R is in orbit  and operational, it would need to rely on older satellites that are beyond  their expected operational lives and may not be fully functional. Any  further delays in the launch of the first satellite in the GOES-R program  would likely increase the risk of a gap in satellite coverage.", "In September 2010, we reported that NOAA had not established  adequate continuity plans for its geostationary satellites. Specifically, in  the event of a satellite failure, with no backup available, NOAA planned to  reduce its operations to a single satellite and if available, rely on a  satellite from a foreign nation. However, the agency did not have plans  that included processes, procedures, and resources needed to transition  to a single or a foreign satellite. Without such plans, there would be an  increased risk that users would lose access to critical data. We  recommended that NOAA develop and document continuity plans for the  operation of geostationary satellites that included implementation  procedures, resources, staff roles, and timetables needed to transition to  a single satellite, a foreign satellite, or other solution. In September 2011,  NOAA developed an initial continuity plan that generally includes these  elements. Specifically, NOAA\u2019s plan identified steps it would take in  transitioning to a single or foreign satellite; the amount of time this  transition would take; roles of product area leads; and resources such as  imaging product schedules, disk imagery frequency, and staff to execute  the changes. In December 2012, NOAA issued an updated plan that  provides additional contingency scenarios.", "However, it is not evident that critical steps have been implemented,  including simulating continuity situations and working with the user  community to account for differences in products under different  continuity scenarios. These steps are critical for NOAA to move  forward in documenting the processes it will take to implement its  contingency plans. Once these activities are completed, NOAA should  update its contingency plan to provide more details on its contingency  scenarios, associated time frames, and any preventative actions it is  taking to minimize the possibility of a gap. We have ongoing work  assessing NOAA\u2019s actions to ensure that its plans are viable and that  continuity procedures are in place and have been tested.

Further, failure to effectively address DHS\u2019s management  and mission risks could have serious consequences for U.S. national and  economic security.

The overriding tenet has  consistently remained the department\u2019s ability to build a single, cohesive  and effective department that is greater than the sum of its parts\u2014a goal  that requires effective collaboration and integration of its various  components and management functions. In 2007, in reporting on DHS\u2019s  progress since its creation, as well as in our 2009 high risk update, we  noted that DHS had made more progress in implementing its range of  missions than in its management functions, and that continued work was  needed to address an array of programmatic and management  challenges.", "DHS\u2019s initial focus on mission implementation was understandable given  the critical homeland security needs facing the nation after the  department\u2019s establishment, and the challenges posed by its creation,  integration and transformation. As DHS continued to mature, and as we  reported in our assessment of DHS\u2019s progress and challenges 10 years  after 9/11, we found that the department implemented key homeland  security operations and achieved important goals in many areas to create  and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential. However, we also  identified that more work remained for DHS to address weaknesses in its  operational and implementation efforts, and to strengthen the efficiency  and effectiveness of those efforts. We further reported that continuing  weaknesses in DHS\u2019s management functions had been a key theme  impacting the department\u2019s implementation efforts. Recognizing DHS\u2019s  progress in transformation and mission implementation, our 2011 high  risk update focused on the continued need to strengthen DHS\u2019s  management functions (acquisition, information technology, financial  management, and human capital) and integrate those functions within  and across the department, as well as the impact of these challenges on  the department\u2019s ability to effectively and efficiently carry out its missions.", "While challenges remain for DHS to address across its range of missions,  the department has made considerable progress in transforming its  original component agencies into a single cabinet-level department and  positioning itself to achieve its full potential. Important strides have also  been made in strengthening the department\u2019s management functions and  in integrating those functions across the department, particularly in recent  years. For example, DHS has chartered eight Centers of Excellence to  enhance component acquisition capabilities, defined and begun to  implement a vision for a tiered governance structure intended to improve  its information technology program and portfolio management, obtained a  qualified audit opinion on its fiscal year 2012 financial statements, and  issued a workforce strategy and a revised Workforce Planning Guide to  help the department address its human capital challenges and plan for its  workforce needs.", "However, DHS still has considerable work ahead in many areas. For  example, in September 2012, we reported that most of DHS\u2019s major  acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take longer to  deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than promised. We  identified 42 programs that experienced cost growth or schedule slips, or  both, with 16 of the programs\u2019 costs increasing from a total of $19.7 billion  in 2008 to $52.2 billion in 2011\u2014an aggregate increase of 166 percent.  Further, while DHS has defined and begun to implement a vision for a  tiered governance structure to improve information technology (IT)  management, we reported in July 2012 that the governance structure  covers less than 20 percent (about 16 of 80) of DHS\u2019s major IT  investments and 3 of its 13 portfolios. DHS has also been unable to  obtain an audit opinion on its internal controls over financial reporting, and  needs to obtain and sustain unqualified audit opinions for at least two  consecutive years on the department-wide financial statements. Finally,  federal surveys have consistently found that DHS employees are less  satisfied with their jobs than the government-wide average. Key to  addressing the department\u2019s management challenges is DHS  demonstrating the ability to achieve sustained progress across the 31  actions and outcomes we identified as needed to address the high-risk  designation, to which DHS agreed.
