EDA awarded the grants in accordance with the review and selection process outlined in the CTAA federal funding opportunity--the program's grant application announcement. More than half of the grants were for construction projects, such as building roads and installing broadband fiber for industrial parks. Although EDA was able to adapt standard procedures already in place for its other grant programs, EDA officials cited some CTAA-specific challenges: first, the effort required to set up the new program for CTAA grants; second, a relatively limited time for the outreach and application process; and third, the development of a list of eligible communities for outreach, which proved to be a complex undertaking.", "EDA regional staff said that they monitor the grants using tools such as periodic progress and financial reports. GAO's review of a nonprobability sample of 12 of the 36 CTAA grant files found no gaps in the regional offices' collection of required reports. Many of the projects will not be completed until after 2013, but grantees with construction projects are required to report on certain EDA performance measures 3, 6, and 9 years after the award. Thus, in 2013, those grantees will be required to report measures relating to jobs created, jobs retained, and level of new private investment. The grantees will submit final nineyear project reports in 2019 that will help the agency determine whether the projects met their goals.", "GAO's review of how the CTAA program compared with other EDA grant programs shows that although the CTAA grants targeted trade-impacted communities, some grantees might have been eligible for other EDA grant programs. EDA officials identified two other programs that target economically distressed communities--EDA's Economic Adjustment Assistance (EAA) and Public Works programs--that may have been able to provide assistance to CTAA communities. GAO found that, through CTAA grants, EDA assisted some trade-impacted communities that may not have qualified for EDA's other community grant programs due to differences in eligibility and cost-share requirements. However, EDA officials provided some specific examples of CTAA grantees that may have qualified for the EAA or Public Works programs.

The increase in imports and the  ongoing trade liberalization have resulted in the loss of certain U.S. jobs, as  companies that cannot compete with lower priced imports have closed or  relocated to lower wage countries. The federal government has recognized  that, although the benefits of free trade are widely dispersed across the  economy, worker dislocation can have an adverse effect on communities.  The Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009 (TGAAA),  passed as part of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act in  February 2009, reauthorized and amended trade adjustment assistance  (TAA) programs that assist trade-impacted workers, farmers and  fishermen, firms, community colleges, and communities. The TGAAA  reestablished the TAA for Communities programs, including the  Community Trade Adjustment Assistance (CTAA) program and two other  programs. In late June 2009, Congress appropriated $40 million in funding  for the CTAA program. For fiscal year 2010, the Department of  Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration (EDA) awarded $36.8  million in CTAA grants to 36 communities to develop a strategic plan to  help the community adjust to trade impacts and to promote economic  diversification or to implement programs and projects as part of a strategic  plan.

As part of  our file review, we developed an instrument to determine whether EDA\u2019s  process met the requirements outlined in the CTAA federal funding  opportunity\u2014the program\u2019s grant application announcement. We  interviewed EDA officials at headquarters in Washington, D.C., and in the  six regional offices, and we conducted a site visit to the Philadelphia  Regional Office to gain an understanding of its CTAA grant solicitation  and selection processes. To identify the mechanisms that EDA  established to monitor the grants and evaluate their effectiveness, we  reviewed program information, agency documentation, and data on the  status of the grants. We also interviewed EDA regional officials regarding  their grant monitoring practices and how they plan to evaluate the  effectiveness of the program. To determine how the CTAA program  compared with other EDA community grant programs, we obtained  agency information on the goals, eligibility criteria, activities, and targeted  recipients of the CTAA program and other EDA community grant  programs and interviewed agency officials.

EDA developed new regulations and designed  the CTAA federal funding opportunity, which incorporated the key  eligibility requirement that communities must be significantly impacted by  trade. The agency issued program implementation regulations in August  2009 and announced the CTAA federal funding opportunity in January  2010. EDA regional office staff said that EDA headquarters officials  provided guidance on program implementation by holding conference  calls and providing training on how to assess the merits of the  applications. In addition, EDA issued responses to a list of frequently  asked questions to provide additional guidance to regional office staff and  applicants.", "To help coordinate assistance to communities through the implementation  of the CTAA program, the TGAAA required EDA to establish and  participate in an Interagency Community Assistance Working Group.  The working group consisted of participants from EDA\u2019s Trade  Adjustment Assistance Division, the Department of Labor\u2019s TAA for  Workers Program, and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s TAA for Farmers  program. The working group held periodic discussions on CTAA  implementation in 2010, with much of the focus on coordinating the  process for certifying communities as eligible to apply for CTAA funding.  Each agency also provided updates and shared best practices on  implementation of the newly reauthorized TAA programs. EDA officials  said that even though the program was repealed, they plan to continue to  work closely and regularly with the TAA for Workers program, sharing  information related to TAA for Firms and TAA for Workers certifications  and providing referrals across programs to ensure that agency officials  are aware of the benefits of each program.", "We have previously reported on steps that agencies should take to  improve oversight and internal controls in the grant management process,  including steps within the preaward, award, implementation, and closeout  stages. EDA\u2019s grant management process is very similar to the grant  management process described in our previous report. EDA regional  office staff described the steps they took and provided documents that  showed they followed their standard grant award process as outlined in  the CTAA federal funding opportunity to administer the program. Each  regional office reported having conducted outreach, provided technical  assistance, received grant applications, and reviewed the applications in  their respective states (see fig. 3).", "Outreach and technical assistance. Because the eligibility  requirements were different for the CTAA program than for EDA\u2019s  other grants programs, EDA headquarters officials developed a list of  counties that were eligible for the program and notified elected state  officials of the existence of the list. EDA regional staff also said that  they conducted outreach through their network of Economic  Development Districts. Some regional officials said that they also  reached out directly to communities they knew were negatively  affected by trade. EDA regional staff said that they provided technical  assistance to applicants as needed.", "Receipt of applications and technical review. EDA regional offices  received more than 130 CTAA applications. Applicants were required  to submit full applications by April 20, 2010. In our review of 12 grant  files, we found that the applicants submitted their applications prior to  this date. EDA regional staff said that they conducted a technical  review of each application, verifying, among other things, the eligibility  of the applicant as outlined in the federal funding opportunity. EDA  regional staff said applications that did not pass the technical review  did not move forward to the next stage, the merit review.", "Merit review.

First, they highlighted difficulties associated with setting  up the new program. EDA headquarters staff noted that setting up a new  program required considerable effort because they were required to  develop entirely new regulations instead of integrating CTAA funding into  an existing EDA program. After the TGAAA established the program in  February 2009, EDA issued program implementation regulations for  comment in May 2009 and finalized the program regulations in August  2009. EDA then issued its federal funding opportunity for public comment  in December 2009 and issued the final federal funding opportunity  announcement in January 2010. EDA officials said that they had to  incorporate the program\u2019s complex trade-impact eligibility criteria into the  new program regulations and the federal funding opportunity, which  required that they modify standard processes and award criteria  appropriately. They noted that determining significant trade impact on  communities was complex and time consuming. Several EDA regional  officials also mentioned that there was an administrative burden in having  to learn the requirements and procedures of a new program. In addition,  four of the six regional offices hired a combined total of six new staff  members to administer the program, and EDA officials said existing staff  were pulled away from working on other EDA programs to respond to the  demands of administering CTAA.", "A second challenge cited by EDA officials was having to obligate all  program funds by the end of fiscal year 2010. EDA officials said they had  a relatively short amount of time\u2014a little over 3 months\u2014to conduct  outreach to potential applicants in the period between the federal funding  opportunity announcement in January 2010 and the application deadline  of April 20, 2010. EDA officials from some of the regional offices said that  the short time frame may have led to EDA\u2019s receiving fewer applications  than if the application period had been longer. They said that as a result,  some applicants may not have had enough time and resources to  develop their proposal, identify funds to meet the cost share  requirements, and build regional partnerships required to produce a  complete application.", "Third, EDA headquarters officials expressed concern over the reliability of  a list of more than 450 eligible counties that they compiled and published  to assist communities in demonstrating trade impact. EDA used the list to  notify the communities that they were eligible to apply for the grant.  However, EDA reported in issuing an updated version of the list that  some eligible communities may not have been included, and the list may  have included some ineligible communities. EDA subsequently required  all counties that appeared on the list to provide TAA certification data to  establish eligibility. An EDA official said the list of eligible counties was  difficult to create. For example, the list depended on Department of Labor  data on TAA for Workers certifications; however, these data include city  and state information but not county information. In 9 of the 12 grant files  we reviewed, the applicants provided evidence that they were on the list  to show their eligibility, in addition to evidence of TAA for Workers  certifications.

EDA officials reported that they review all of these  documents, which contain information such as whether the design of the  project is complete or construction has started and whether the grantees  are able to fund their portion of the project. EDA officials said that they  stay in contact with grantees mostly through phone calls and e-mails and  that they conduct site visits, although these are relatively limited due to  budget constraints. Within the EDA regional offices, engineers perform  the monitoring of CTAA grants for construction projects, and EDA project  managers monitor the grants for development of strategic plans. CTAA  grant monitoring has been absorbed into the routine workload of these  regional office officials. One engineer told us that on average he monitors  about 50 EDA grants at any given time, of which just one is a CTAA  grant. Another engineer agreed that this is a fairly standard monitoring  workload. In our review of 12 of the 36 grant files, we found no evidence  of deficiencies in the required performance and financial reports that EDA  regional offices received from grantees.

All CTAA grant funds had to be obligated by the end of  fiscal year 2010, though they could be disbursed over several years.  Thus, EDA had to award its grants during a single fiscal year, which  limited the agency\u2019s ability to amend grants, because any changes had to  be consistent with the original project intent, scope, and budget. EDA  officials stated that since other community grant program funding does  not expire at the end of the fiscal year, they can make changes to grants  for construction projects as long as these changes relate to the original  scope and are properly documented. Officials indicated the stricter  conditions on changing the terms of CTAA grant awards pose a particular  challenge with construction-related projects, because unforeseen  circumstances such as delays or changes in management may require  major changes in such projects. Officials stated that because EDA cannot  change CTAA grants, communities with construction projects that require  major changes may not be able to spend their grant money in time, which  could result in deobligated funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EDA Will Collect Performance Data on Projects, but It Is Too Early to Determine Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["All EDA grant recipients, including recipients of CTAA grants for  implementation projects, are required to provide data on jobs created,  jobs retained, and the amount of private investment leveraged.

We interviewed responsible EDA officials at headquarters and in  the six regional offices and conducted a site visit to the Philadelphia  Regional Office to gain an understanding of their grant solicitation,  approval, and oversight processes. We interviewed agency officials at  headquarters to gain an understanding of the agency\u2019s establishment of  and participation in the Interagency Community Assistance Working Group.", "To provide an in-depth review of the grant award process and monitoring,  including whether EDA followed its procedures, we obtained and  reviewed supporting documentation for the program. We selected a  nonprobability sample of 12 grant recipients for a file review. We used a  data collection instrument to review the sample of grant files against the  process and requirements outlined in the CTAA federal funding  opportunity, or the grant application announcement. In each file, we  reviewed applications, agency reviews of the applications, documentation  of the award process and decisions, and progress and financial reports.  Because we selected a nonprobability sample of grant recipients, the  information we obtained from these reviews cannot be generalized to the  whole group of 36 grant recipients. We selected the sample of 12 grant  recipients to provide a variety of grant awards on the basis of region,  grant amount, and grant type\u2014whether the purpose of the grant was to  help a community develop a strategic plan or implement part of an  existing strategic plan. The characteristics of our sample are listed below.", "To determine the number of grant files to select from each regional  office, we considered the distribution of CTAA funding. As a result, we  selected four grant files from Chicago; three from Atlanta; two from  Philadelphia; and one each from Seattle, Austin, and Denver.", "We selected grants representing the range of grant award amounts.", "The 36 CTAA grant award amounts ranged from $53,000 to $3.5  million. The grant award amounts in our sample ranged from $75,000  to $3 million.", "To determine the number of implementation grants versus strategic  planning grants to select, we considered the proportion of each type  receiving grant awards. For the implementation grants, we also  selected recipients according to the proportion of implementation  grants with construction projects. As a result, we selected 10  implementation grants\u20144 with construction projects and 6 with  nonconstruction projects\u2014and 2 strategic planning grants.", "In addition, our sample contained a mix of urban and rural  communities as well as a mix of grantee types. The sample included  three grant recipients that were an Economic Development District,  five counties, three cities or towns, and one that was a combined  recipient of a county and an Economic Development District.", "To identify the mechanisms that EDA established to monitor the grants  and evaluate their effectiveness, we reviewed program information,  agency documentation, and data on the status of the grants. We reviewed  monitoring documents, such as progress and financial reports, in our  grant file review. We also interviewed EDA regional officials regarding  their grant monitoring procedures, challenges they encountered in  monitoring the grants, and their plans for evaluating the effectiveness of  the program.", "To determine how the CTAA program compared with other EDA  community grant programs, we obtained agency information on the goals,  eligibility, activities, and targeted recipients of the CTAA program and  other EDA community grant programs. We interviewed EDA officials to  gain an understanding of the client base for each program and to identify  examples of CTAA grantees that may have qualified and those that may  not have qualified for multiple programs.", "We conducted this review from March 2012 through September 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: CTAA Grant Awards: Grantees, Amounts, and Grant Purpose", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Grantee", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: TAA Programs at a Glance: Responsible Agencies, Service Structures, Types of Assistance, Number Assisted", "paragraphs": ["Service structure  State and local workforce  agencies provide  assistance to workers  covered by certified  petitions.", "Type of assistance  Provides funds for services  and benefits including:  training, case management  and reemployment services,  income support, job search  and relocation allowances,  wage supplement allowance  for older workers, and  eligibility for health coverage  tax credit.", "The National Institute of  Food and Agriculture  develops and delivers  training and technical  assistance to groups of  farmers or fisheries.", "Provides funds for technical  assistance (training and  business plan development)  and cash payments to  implement business plans.", "EDA provides funding to 11  Trade Adjustment  Assistance Centers.
