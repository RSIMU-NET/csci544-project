An effective federal-state partnership is key to ensuring the most appropriate use of funds by, among other things, (1) setting appropriate payment rates for managed care organizations, and (2) ensuring only eligible individuals and providers participate in Medicaid.", "Federal financing approach : Automatic federal assistance during economic downturns and more equitable federal allocations of Medicaid funds to states (by better accounting for states' ability to fund Medicaid) could better align federal funding with states' needs, offering states greater fiscal stability. GAO has suggested that Congress could consider enacting a funding formula that provides automatic, timely, and temporary increased assistance in response to national economic downturns.", "Medicaid's ongoing transformation\u2014due to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), the aging of the U.S. population, and other changes to state programs\u2014highlights the importance of federal oversight, given the implications for enrollees and program costs.

Over  the past half-century, Medicaid has grown to be one of the largest  sources of health care coverage and financing for a diverse low-income  and medically needy population. It is the nation\u2019s second largest health  care program as measured by expenditures, behind only Medicare.  Medicaid is also a significant component of federal and state budgets,  with estimated outlays of $529 billion in fiscal year 2015, of which   $320 billion is expected to be financed by the federal government and  $209 billion by the states. Medicaid was estimated to account for the  second largest share of state spending that year, exceeded only by state  spending on elementary and secondary education. An important health  care safety net, Medicaid covered about 72 million individuals\u2014roughly  one-fifth of the U.S. population\u2014during fiscal year 2013. Medicaid\u2019s  diverse enrollee population includes children, low-income adults,  individuals who are elderly, and those who are disabled. The program  covers a comprehensive set of services, including physician, and  inpatient and outpatient hospital care, and is also a particularly significant  source of health care coverage and financing for certain services. For  example, Medicaid is the nation\u2019s primary payer of long-term services and  supports (LTSS), including nursing home care and home- and  community-based services to allow individuals to age in their homes.", "An already large and complex program, Medicaid is undergoing a period  of transformative change, as enrollment is growing under the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), and Medicaid spending is  projected to increase by nearly 60 percent by fiscal year 2023.example, PPACA permitted states to expand their Medicaid programs by  covering certain low-income adults not historically eligible for Medicaid  coverage, and more than half of the states have done so. Further, among  other factors, the aging of the population and new developments with  technology are both transforming and challenging Medicaid and the rest  of the U.S. health care system. In addition, changing economic conditions  have influenced the number and mix of individuals who are eligible for  Medicaid coverage, and will continue to do so in the future.", "Medicaid is designed as a federal-state partnership, and both the federal  government and the states play important roles in ensuring that Medicaid  is fiscally sustainable over time and effective in meeting the needs of the  vulnerable populations it serves. Medicaid is financed jointly by the  federal government and states, administered at the state level, and  overseen at the federal level by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS). Medicaid, by design, allows significant flexibility for states to  design and implement their programs. This has influenced the  development of the program and has resulted in over 50 distinct state- based programs that vary in how health care is delivered, financed,  reimbursed, and overseen. While state flexibility is a key element of the  program, federal oversight is important to help ensure that funds are used  appropriately and that enrollees can access quality care. However, the  size, growth, and diversity of the Medicaid program create significant  challenges for oversight. There is an inherent tension between states\u2019  efforts to design programs that best meet their local needs and federal  efforts to oversee the states\u2019 programs.

In our survey of state Medicaid officials in 2012, for  example, officials in about half of the states reported challenges ensuring  enough participating specialty providers for Medicaid enrollees, such as in  obstetrics and gynecology, surgical specialties, and pediatric services. In  addition, we found that about 21 percent of respondents with Medicaid- covered children reported that it was only sometimes or never easy to see  a specialist, compared to about 13 percent of respondents with privately  insured children, from 2008 through 2010. Our 2010 national survey of  physicians found that specialty physicians were generally more willing to  accept privately insured children as new patients than Medicaid-covered  children; similarly, more physicians reported having difficulty referring  Medicaid-covered children to specialty providers than reported having  difficulty referring privately insured children. (See fig. 8.)", "We have also found that both Medicaid-covered adults and children may  face challenges obtaining mental health care. Research has shown that  Medicaid enrollees experience a higher rate of mental health conditions  than those with private insurance.

We found that while the percentage of  individuals with Medicaid dental coverage who had a dental visit  increased from 28 percent in 1996 to 34 percent in 2010, individuals with  Medicaid dental coverage were still much less likely than privately insured  individuals to have visited the dentist. About two-thirds of Medicaid- covered children, for example, did not visit the dentist at all in 2010, while  most privately insured children did. (See fig. 9.) This difference in use of  dental services persisted despite the fact that Medicaid-covered children  may have a greater need for dental care than privately insured children.  We have found that Medicaid-covered children are almost twice as likely  to have untreated tooth decay as privately insured children. In addition,  states have found it particularly challenging to ensure a sufficient number  of dental providers for Medicaid enrollees.", "CMS has taken some steps to address access to dental care, and other  steps could build on those efforts. In 2010, for example, the agency  launched a Children\u2019s Oral Health Initiative that aimed to, among other  things, increase the proportion of Medicaid and State Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program (CHIP) children who receive a preventive dental  service. In response to our prior recommendations, CMS also took steps  to ensure that states gather information on the provision of Medicaid  dental services by managed care programs, and to improve the accuracy  of the data on HHS\u2019s Insure Kids Now website, which provides state- reported information on dentists who serve children enrolled in Medicaid  and CHIP. We recommended that CMS require states to verify that  dentists listed on the Insure Kids Now website have not been excluded  from Medicaid by HHS, and periodically verify that excluded providers are  not included on the lists of dentists posted by the states. However, CMS  has said that it relies on states to provide accurate lists of eligible dentists  and that data issues prevent the agency from independently verifying that  excluded providers are not included on the website.

These reports, known as CMS 416 reports, include  such information as the number of children receiving well-child checkups  and the number of children referred for treatment services for conditions  identified during well-child checkups. CMS has used these reports to  identify states with low reported rates of service provision, to help identify  state Medicaid programs needing improvements. In addition, states  voluntarily report Child Core Set measures, which assess the quality of  care provided through Medicaid and CHIP, and include, for example,  measures of access to primary care and the receipt of follow-up care for  children prescribed attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medication.

While these are positive steps, we have  noted that CMS\u2019s ability to monitor children\u2019s access to services is  dependent on consistent, reliable, complete, and sufficiently detailed  data from each state. The Child Core Set measures, for example,  are voluntarily reported by states, and we have reported that although  the number of states reporting measures has increased in recent  years, that states have varied considerably in the number of  measures they reported.
