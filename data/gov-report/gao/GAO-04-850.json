GAO examined the extent to which JCAHO's pre-2004 hospital accreditation process identified hospitals not complying with Medicare requirements, the potential of JCAHO's new process for improving the detection of deficiencies in Medicare requirements, and the effectiveness of CMS's oversight of JCAHO's hospital accreditation program. GAO analyzed CMS data on hospitals state surveyors found to have deficiencies in Medicare requirements that JCAHO surveyors did not detect, analyzed CMS's measure of JCAHO's ability to detect noncompliance with Medicare requirements, and interviewed JCAHO officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["JCAHO's pre-2004 hospital accreditation process did not identify most of the hospitals found by state survey agencies in CMS's annual validation survey sample to have deficiencies in Medicare requirements. In comparing the results of the two surveys, CMS considered whether it was reasonable to conclude that the deficiencies found by state survey agencies existed at the time JCAHO surveyed the hospital. In a sample of 500 JCAHO-accredited hospitals, state agency validation surveys conducted in fiscal years 2000 through 2002 identified 31 percent (157 hospitals) with deficiencies in Medicare requirements. Of these 157 hospitals, JCAHO did not identify 78 percent (123 hospitals) as having deficiencies in Medicare requirements. For the same validation survey sample, JCAHO also did not identify the majority--about 69 percent--of deficiencies in Medicare requirements found by state agencies. Importantly, the number of deficiencies found by validation surveys represents 2 percent of the 11,000 Medicare requirements surveyed by state agencies in the sample during this time period. At the same time, a single deficiency in a Medicare requirement can limit the hospital's capability to provide adequate care and ensure patient safety and health. Inadequacies in nursing practices or deficiencies in a hospital's physical environment, which includes fire safety, are examples of deficiencies in Medicare requirements that could endanger multiple patients. The potential of JCAHO's new hospital accreditation process to improve the detection of deficiencies in Medicare requirements is unknown because the process was just implemented in January 2004. JCAHO plans to move from using announced to unannounced surveys in 2006, which would afford JCAHO the opportunity to observe hospitals' operations when the hospitals have not prepared in advance to be surveyed. In addition, the pilot test of the new accreditation process was of limited value in predicting whether it will be an improvement over the pre-2004 process in detecting deficiencies. Limitations in the pilot test included that hospitals were not randomly selected to participate; that observers from JCAHO accompanied each surveyor, thus possibly affecting surveyors' actions; and that JCAHO evaluated the results instead of an independent entity. CMS has limited oversight authority over JCAHO's hospital accreditation program because the program's unique legal status effectively prevents CMS from taking actions that it has the authority to take with other health care accreditation programs to ensure satisfactory performance. For example, requiring JCAHO's hospital accreditation program to submit to a direct review process or placing the program on probation while monitoring its performance. Further, CMS relies on a measure to evaluate how well JCAHO's hospital accreditation program detects deficiencies in Medicare requirements that provides limited information and can mask problems with program performance, uses statistical methods that are insufficient to assess JCAHO's performance, and has reduced the number of validation surveys it conducts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2002, nearly 7.4 million Medicare beneficiaries received  inpatient health care at hospitals that participated in Medicare. Federal  law establishes criteria for hospitals for purposes of Medicare. The  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency  responsible for administering Medicare, has established quality and patient  safety requirements called conditions of participation (COP) that hospitals  must meet in order to be eligible for Medicare payment. Hospitals that are  accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare  Organizations (JCAHO) are generally deemed under federal law to be  compliant with Medicare requirements for patient safety and health and  become eligible for payments from Medicare. No other health care  accreditation program has this same statutory authority.", "JCAHO is a private, not-for-profit organization that accredits most of the  hospitals that participate in Medicare. JCAHO sets standards that  accredited hospitals must meet and reports that these standards are more  comprehensive than the Medicare COPs. In January 2004, JCAHO  implemented a new hospital accreditation process with goals that included  further enhancing health care quality and safety.", "CMS oversight of JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program is limited  because it cannot restrict or remove JCAHO\u2019s accreditation authority if the  agency detects problems. To oversee the program, CMS conducts on-site  validation surveys of a sample of JCAHO-accredited hospitals and reports  annually to Congress on the results of these surveys. The validation  surveys, which are performed by agencies that CMS has agreements with  in each state, help CMS determine whether Medicare quality and safety  requirements are being met. CMS compares the results of these state  surveys against survey results obtained through JCAHO\u2019s hospital  accreditation program. CMS uses a measure called the rate of disparity  that summarizes the extent to which an accreditation program has failed  to cite deficiencies identified by state agency validation surveys. We are  using the term serious deficiency in this report to indicate a deficiency in  one or more Medicare COPs. Examples of serious deficiencies include a  hospital\u2019s inability to provide adequate nursing services or failure to  implement and enforce infection control policies. According to CMS,  serious deficiencies substantially limit a hospital\u2019s capability to render  adequate care and adversely affect the safety and health of patients.", "Questions have been raised by the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) and others regarding  whether accreditation by JCAHO ensures that hospitals provide adequate  care. Specifically, experts have questioned how well JCAHO\u2019s hospital  accreditation process identifies deficiencies in hospitals that could  jeopardize patient safety and health. A comprehensive study by the HHS  OIG found that JCAHO\u2019s surveys were not likely to identify patterns of  deficient care.", "You asked that we examine the effectiveness of JCAHO\u2019s hospital  accreditation process in ensuring that hospitals comply with Medicare  COPs to ensure the safety and health of Medicare beneficiaries.  Specifically, we (1) examined the extent to which JCAHO\u2019s pre-2004  hospital accreditation process identified deficiencies in Medicare COPs  that were identified by state survey agencies, (2) determined whether  JCAHO\u2019s new hospital accreditation process has potential for improving  the detection of deficiencies in Medicare COPs and whether the process  was adequately tested, and (3) examined the effectiveness of CMS\u2019s  oversight of JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program.", "To determine the extent to which JCAHO\u2019s pre-2004 hospital accreditation  process identified deficiencies in Medicare COPs that were identified by  state survey agencies, we used data from a CMS comparison of state  validation survey findings with findings of JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation  surveys, which indicated whether JCAHO found deficiencies in its  standards. Of the four possible outcomes to this comparison of survey  findings\u2014(1) JCAHO and state agencies both identify no deficiencies, (2)  JCAHO identifies deficiencies not found by state agencies, (3) JCAHO and  state agencies both identify the same deficiencies, and (4) state agencies  identify deficiencies that JCAHO does not\u2014we focused on the fourth  because it highlights the need for CMS oversight of the hospital  accreditation program. For the second outcome, there could be two  reasons for the disparity between JCAHO\u2019s and state survey agencies\u2019  findings: hospitals corrected deficiencies identified by JCAHO prior to the  state agency survey or the state survey agency did not identify a deficiency  that existed. In addition, not all JCAHO findings are equivalent to  noncompliance with a Medicare COP. To determine whether JCAHO\u2019s  findings on deficiencies in its standards were comparable to the state  agencies\u2019 findings, CMS staff compared the two surveys and considered  whether it was reasonable to conclude that the deficiencies found by state  survey agencies existed at the time JCAHO surveyed the hospital. For  deficiencies that CMS determined that JCAHO failed to identify, CMS met  with JCAHO to address disputed findings and consider additional evidence  on comparability offered by JCAHO. CMS provided results for a sample of  500 JCAHO-accredited hospitals from fiscal years 2000 through 2002. We  determined that the data CMS provided on serious deficiencies were  adequate for addressing the issues in this report. On the basis of this  sample of 500 JCAHO-accredited hospitals, we determined, using CMS\u2019s  data, both the percentage of serious deficiencies and the percentage of  hospitals with serious deficiencies identified by the state survey agencies  where JCAHO surveyors did not find comparable deficiencies. The  analysis we performed on the results of the validation surveys was limited  to the hospitals included in the validation survey sample and cannot be  generalized to all JCAHO-accredited hospitals.", "To determine whether JCAHO\u2019s new hospital accreditation process has  potential for improving the detection of serious deficiencies, we identified  changes in the accreditation process and analyzed significant new  features. To determine whether JCAHO\u2019s new hospital accreditation  process was adequately tested, we reviewed the testing procedures and  results that JCAHO used to determine the effectiveness of its new survey  process in identifying quality and safety deficiencies. Because the new  accreditation process was implemented recently, we did not have  information to compare JCAHO survey performance in detecting serious  deficiencies with state agency survey performance.", "To determine the adequacy of CMS\u2019s oversight of JCAHO\u2019s hospital  accreditation program, we reviewed relevant statutory and regulatory  provisions regarding oversight of health care accreditation programs and  how CMS had implemented this authority in order to provide oversight. To  supplement our review, we conducted interviews with officials from CMS,  state survey agencies, and JCAHO; representatives from other  organizations active in health care accreditation and the hospital industry;  and experts in quality of care.

For most  hospitals, the triennial survey is the only time that JCAHO conducts an on- site review of the hospital\u2019s compliance with all quality standards and  issues decisions on how well the hospital has complied with JCAHO\u2019s  standards. In 2004, JCAHO implemented a new hospital accreditation  survey process, which, according to JCAHO, is intended to reduce the cost  of accreditation to health care organizations and JCAHO, enhance public  confidence that health care organizations are in continuous compliance  with standards, increase the real and perceived value of accredited  organizations, meet the requirements of deeming authorities and  purchasers, and improve satisfaction for hospitals participating in the  accreditation program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS Oversight of JCAHO", "paragraphs": ["CMS exercises oversight of JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program  primarily through its validation surveys and annual reports to Congress.

However, one serious deficiency  in any one of these hospitals could limit its ability to provide adequate care  to its patients. For example, a serious deficiency in the nursing services  COP at a hospital in Texas found by a state agency but missed by JCAHO  in 2000 included such problems as failure to prepare and administer drugs  in accordance with federal and state laws, inadequate supervision and  evaluation of the clinical activities of nonemployee nursing personnel, and  nursing care and procedures provided to patients that were not within the  scope of accepted standards of practice. Among hospitals with serious  deficiencies identified by CMS\u2019s validation program but not by JCAHO,  there were on average 1.1 serious deficiencies per hospital, with a range  from 1 to 6.

Table 3 shows the number of serious  deficiencies, by category, identified by state survey agencies in CMS\u2019s  validation program but missed by JCAHO surveyors. The larger number of  deficiencies in physical environment may be related to the difference in  how state agencies generally survey separately a hospital\u2019s compliance  with the life safety code portion of the physical environment COP. JCAHO  surveys assess compliance with the life safety code using a combination of  the hospital\u2019s self-assessment, a hospital building tour, and observations  made by all surveyors during the survey process. Examples of deficiencies  in physical environment that JCAHO did not identify but CMS\u2019s validation  program found in a hospital in Alabama in 2000 included the following:  several exterior exits lacked emergency exit lighting; several exterior exits  were illuminated only by single light bulbs; fire alarm system and fire  extinguishers had not been inspected annually as required; and an  automatic sprinkler system had not been inspected annually and  maintained by certified personnel as required. Serious deficiencies in the  COP on physical environment compromise patient safety and health.", "The total number of deficiencies not identified by JCAHO in the quality-of- care COP categories\u2014those COPs that involve the oversight and delivery  of patient care\u2014is similar to the number not identified by JCAHO in the  physical environment COP. While the number of serious deficiencies not  found by JCAHO in individual quality-of-care COP categories is smaller  than the number not found in physical environment, when these quality-of- care COPs are combined, the proportion of serious deficiencies JCAHO  missed is almost 60 percent of the total number of serious deficiencies  identified by state survey agencies. The following are examples of  hospitals found to be out of compliance with multiple quality-of-care  COPs:  In 2000, CMS removed the deemed status as a Medicare provider of a  JCAHO-accredited hospital in California for failure to comply with two  COPs, one of which was infection control. The hospital failed to provide a  sanitary environment to avoid sources and transmission of infections and  communicable diseases and failed to develop a system for ensuring the  sterilization of medical instruments.", "Also in 2000, CMS notified a hospital in Texas that if it did not implement a  plan of correction the hospital\u2019s participation in the Medicare program  would be terminated.

For  example, if the hospital\u2019s priority focus process data suggest that a patient  with an orthopedic-related diagnosis such as a hip fracture should be  traced, the JCAHO surveyor would review the patient\u2019s medical record,  noting where the patient had entered into the hospital and any services  and transfers that occurred. Then the surveyor would retrace the steps in  the patient\u2019s care process by observing and talking to staff in some of the  areas in which the patient received care. If the patient entered through the  emergency department, was transferred to a medical/surgical unit, and  then went to the operating room, the surveyor would go to these areas to  interview staff about the care given to this specific patient.

Additionally, CMS uses a  measure that provides limited information to evaluate the performance of  JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program, has significantly reduced the  number of surveys conducted as part of CMS\u2019s validation program, and  does not use measures that are based on sound statistical methods to  assess the performance of JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS Oversight Authority of JCAHO Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Because of JCAHO\u2019s unique legal status, CMS\u2019s oversight of JCAHO\u2019s  hospital accreditation program is limited in two major ways: Unlike other  accreditation programs with deeming authority, JCAHO does not have to  reapply to CMS to reauthorize its deeming authority, and CMS cannot take  action to address performance problems with JCAHO\u2019s hospital  accreditation program.", "JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program is the only Medicare accreditation  program for which CMS does not have to conduct an evaluation of the  accreditation standards and the processes used to conduct surveys.  Without this evaluation, CMS is deprived of key oversight tools it is  authorized to use with other accreditation programs: detailed information  about any proposed changes to the accreditation process and public input.  CMS cannot require JCAHO to provide information about proposed  changes to its accreditation requirements and hospital survey processes.  Also, because it is not required to reapply to CMS for deeming authority,  JCAHO does not have to provide CMS information that other accreditation  programs must provide, such as a detailed description of its survey  processes, a comparison of its standards to Medicare requirements, and  the qualifications of its surveyors, which CMS reviews to ensure that the  programs comply with Medicare requirements. For example, when  JCAHO\u2019s hospice accreditation program applied for deeming status in  1999, CMS required changes to JCAHO\u2019s hospice accreditation process,  including requiring JCAHO to make unannounced surveys of Medicare- certified hospices. According to a CMS official, JCAHO\u2019s hospital  accreditation program has provided much of the information required of  other accreditation organizations; however, CMS has no authority to  require JCAHO to make changes to the hospital accreditation program as  it does with other health care accreditation programs. Statutory provisions  regarding public notice and comment do not apply to JCAHO\u2019s hospital  accreditation program as they do to other accreditation programs. The  reapplication process for other accreditation programs requires affording  the public an opportunity to provide input to CMS on an accreditation  program\u2019s request for deeming authority. Because JCAHO does not have to  reapply for deeming authority, the public does not have the opportunity to  review and comment on JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program.", "A second limitation is CMS\u2019s inability to address any performance issues  with JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program.

When other Medicare accreditation programs have  a rate of disparity of 20 percent or more, CMS can take steps such as  imposing a year-long probationary period and removing deeming authority  at the end of the probationary period if the rate of disparity remains at 20  percent or more. For JCAHO, however, CMS\u2019s actions toward correcting  the program\u2019s deficiencies are limited to including recommendations for  improvement in its annual reports to Congress and negotiating with  JCAHO to voluntarily adopt CMS\u2019s recommendations.", "In its annual report to Congress, CMS made recommendations in fiscal  year 2002 aimed at improving JCAHO\u2019s ability to detect serious  deficiencies in the life safety code, part of the COP on physical  environment. CMS noted that JCAHO permits hospitals to self-assess  compliance with life safety code requirements. While CMS stated that it  did not object to the concept of hospital self-assessment of life safety code  requirements, it made five recommendations to JCAHO for improving  implementation:  1.  Require hospitals to use qualified personnel, such as fire marshals and  architects, to conduct self-assessments of compliance with the life  safety code requirements.  2.  Set minimum standards for identifying and improving life safety code  deficiencies identified by hospital self-assessments.  3.  Require hospitals to submit their self-assessments on life safety code  issues prior to JCAHO conducting accreditation surveys to provide  surveyors and personnel in JCAHO\u2019s central office time to review the  material prior to the accreditation surveys.  4.  Increase the use of JCAHO experts in the life safety code requirements  in its central office.  5.  Address the issue of hospitals that do not make improvement within  self-determined time frames.", "JCAHO did not adopt all of these recommendations. It disagreed with the  first recommendation. Its response indicated that its requirement to use  qualified personnel to complete the self-assessment, while more general,  was sufficient. It further indicated that policies were in place for CMS\u2019s  second and fifth recommendations. CMS later agreed that JCAHO\u2019s  policies do satisfactorily address the fifth recommendation. JCAHO  planned to examine ways to adopt CMS\u2019s third and fourth  recommendations. CMS however, had no authority to compel JCAHO to  comply with the remaining recommendations. According to CMS, it  continues to discuss implementation of its recommendations with JCAHO.  JCAHO stated that while its initial response to CMS\u2019s recommendations in  2003 reflected then current JCAHO policies, subsequent policy evolutions  are addressing CMS\u2019s recommendations. Specifically, JCAHO is working  with the American Society of Hospital Engineers to develop a process for  review by experts of hospital self-assessments on life safety code issues  prior to JCAHO\u2019s conducting on-site accreditation surveys and to identify  those hospitals for which engineering expertise should be added to on-site  surveys."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS\u2019s Validation Program Needs Improvement", "paragraphs": ["CMS states that the goal of its validation program is to provide reasonable  assurance to Congress that the JCAHO accreditation process ensures  hospital compliance with Medicare COPs.

CMS uses this measure in its  reports to Congress to assess JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program and  as the basis for making recommendations for improvement. CMS  calculates the rate of disparity as the difference between the number of  hospitals found with serious deficiencies by state survey agencies and the  number of hospitals found with serious deficiencies by the accreditation  survey, divided by the number of hospitals in the sample. For example, if  state survey agencies conducted 200 surveys as part of CMS\u2019s validation  program and found 60 hospitals out of compliance with at least one COP,  but JCAHO\u2019s survey found that only 22 of the hospitals were out of  compliance, the rate of disparity would be 19 percent ((60 - 22)/200).", "CMS has established in regulation a rate of disparity of 20 percent or  greater as the threshold for taking action against an accreditation  program. According to a CMS official, the use of 20 percent as the  threshold is not based on empirical evidence but rather on what CMS  believed Congress would find acceptable. Consequently, the threshold  may not be appropriately placed to indicate unacceptable performance by  a hospital accreditation program. For example, if JCAHO failed to identify  serious deficiencies in all 14 hospitals that the state agencies identified  with serious deficiencies from a sample of 79 hospitals, the rate of  disparity would be a satisfactory 18 percent ((14-0)/79).", "CMS\u2019s rate of disparity measure used in isolation does not consistently  reflect an accreditation program\u2019s ability to detect serious deficiencies. As  the number of hospitals with serious deficiencies detected by state survey  agencies decreases, regardless of JCAHO\u2019s performance in detecting them,  it is more likely that the rate of disparity will be less than CMS\u2019s 20 percent  threshold. As a result, the performance of JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation  program is difficult to judge based on this measure alone. For example, if  state survey agencies performed 200 validation surveys and found 100  hospitals or 50 percent with serious deficiencies and JCAHO found 30  hospitals or 30 percent of the hospitals found by state agencies, the rate of  disparity would be 35 percent ((100-30)/200). However, if the state  agencies found 50 hospitals, or 25 percent, of the 200 hospitals with  serious deficiencies and JCAHO found 15 hospitals, or 30 percent of the  hospitals that the state agencies identified, the rate of disparity would be  almost 18 percent ((50-15)/200). The percentage of serious deficiencies  found by state survey agencies and also by JCAHO remained the same in  both examples, but the rate of disparity was improved significantly by the  larger number of hospitals without serious deficiencies in the second  example. This indicates that the rate of disparity does not consistently  measure the accreditation program\u2019s ability to detect serious deficiencies  found by state survey agencies. (See table 5.) In addition to the rate of  disparity, other components, such as the proportion of hospitals with  serious deficiencies and the total number of serious deficiencies found by  state agencies but missed by the accreditation program, are important  indicators of an accreditation program\u2019s overall performance.", "CMS does not analyze the statistical results of its validation survey  samples in ways that would allow it to better assess JCAHO\u2019s ability to  detect serious deficiencies. CMS has not documented the methods it uses  to select hospitals for validation surveys and did not supply us with clear  technical justification for the methods used. Further, CMS\u2019s validation  sample includes hospitals that, because of its sampling method, have  varying chances of selection, but it does not take this into account when  calculating statistics based on the sample. According to CMS\u2019s sampling  method, the selection of hospitals is influenced by factors such as the  month in the fiscal year that JCAHO performed the accreditation survey  and how many hospitals were targeted for completion that year in the  state in which the hospital was located. Thus, some hospitals have a  greater chance of selection than others. CMS also does not take these  different chances of selection into account when calculating statistics for  its annual reports to Congress, which prevents CMS from accurately  assessing JCAHO\u2019s performance. Moreover, CMS does not measure and  report in its annual reports the extent to which its estimates based on the  validation survey sample are likely to reflect how well JCAHO detects  deficiencies in the larger population of hospitals it accredits.", "In addition, the number of usable traditional validation surveys completed  is smaller than the number of hospitals CMS samples for validation  surveys. This difference may affect the accuracy of the data that CMS  presents to Congress if the hospitals where the traditional surveys were  completed produce different results than those where surveys are not  completed or are not usable. During its sampling process, CMS selects a  sample size close to the targeted number of hospitals each year. Some  hospitals from this sample may be excluded because CMS chose to  perform another type of survey for them that cannot be used to validate a  JCAHO accreditation survey. In addition, state agencies are not always  able to complete the requested traditional validation surveys within 60  days from the JCAHO accreditation survey, as required, or a hospital may  be excluded because it lost its deemed status or closed. The size of the  difference between the number of hospitals sampled and the number of  usable traditional validation surveys completed therefore varies, as it did  during the 3-year review period (see table 6).", "CMS reduced the number of validation surveys conducted by state  agencies from a target of approximately 5 percent of the total number of  hospitals that JCAHO accredits to a target of approximately 1 percent,  with at least one survey in each state. Reducing the target of validation  surveys from 5 percent to 1 percent results in the number of validation  surveys being reduced from 227 in fiscal year 2002 to a target of 75  validation surveys in fiscal year 2003 and 72 in fiscal year 2004.", "Reducing the targeted number of validation surveys to 1 percent provides  less reliable information on how well JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation  program ensures compliance with Medicare COPs. For example, for a 5- percent target, the estimate of the proportion of JCAHO-accredited  hospitals with a particular deficiency that is derived from the validation  survey could be as much as 6.0 percentage points higher or lower, for a  range of 12.0 percentage points. If the 5-percent target produced an  estimate that 50 percent of JCAHO-accredited hospitals had a particular  deficiency, the percentage of JCAHO-accredited hospitals not complying  could range from 44.0 to 56.0 percent. However, for a 1-percent target the  estimate could be 11.4 percentage points higher or lower, for a range of  about 22.8 percentage points. For example, if the 1-percent target  produced an estimate that 50 percent of JCAHO-accredited hospitals had a  particular deficiency, the percentage of JCAHO-accredited hospitals not  complying with a Medicare COP could range from 38.6 to 61.4 percent.", "This reduction in the number of validation surveys is of additional concern  because it coincides with the implementation of JCAHO\u2019s new  accreditation process, which has an unproven capacity to detect  deficiencies. CMS\u2019s target sample size for traditional validation surveys for  fiscal year 2004 will be further reduced because the sample also includes  18-month validation surveys. In 2004, CMS is planning to conduct 17 of  these 18-month surveys as part of its overall validation survey target of 72.  Thus, CMS could be using as few as 55 validation surveys to determine  JCAHO\u2019s performance."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["For 3 consecutive years, JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program, which  accredits most of the hospitals participating in Medicare, exceeded CMS\u2019s  threshold for unacceptable performance.

Yet, CMS was unable to take  action against JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program as it can with other  accreditation programs because it lacked the authority to do so. Although  CMS has recommended in its annual reports to Congress that JCAHO  make changes in its hospital accreditation program to improve its ability  to detect serious deficiencies, some of these recommendations have not  been implemented.

We chose  these measures because they reflect performance in detecting and  correcting serious deficiencies, which according to CMS, substantially  limit a hospital\u2019s capability to render adequate care and adversely affect  the health and safety of patients. We reviewed data, provided by CMS, on  500 traditional validation surveys conducted by state survey agencies  during fiscal years 2000 through 2002. In these validation surveys, state  survey agencies documented whether they found serious deficiencies in  Medicare COPs. CMS compared state survey agency findings with  JCAHO\u2019s accreditation surveys that identified deficiencies in JCAHO\u2019s  standards. CMS then determined whether the state survey agencies\u2019  findings on serious deficiencies in the 22 Medicare COPs that can be  deemed were comparable to JCAHO\u2019s findings on deficiencies in JCAHO\u2019s  standards in the following way. Two CMS experts such as nurses reviewed  the comparability of serious deficiencies in the quality-of-care conditions  identified in validation surveys to deficiencies in JCAHO\u2019s accreditation  standards identified in JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation surveys. Two  experts, such as building engineers, reviewed the comparability of serious  deficiencies identified in the validation surveys on the condition on  physical environment. Where there was disagreement, the two experts met  to resolve their differences. CMS does not have written protocols for  determining comparability. Experts are expected to use their best  professional judgment. CMS experts also had to consider whether it is  reasonable to conclude that the deficiencies existed at the time that  JCAHO surveyed the hospital. For those deficiencies that CMS determines  that JCAHO has failed to identify, it met with JCAHO to address disputed  findings and to consider additional evidence on comparability offered by  JCAHO. There are four possible outcomes to this comparison of survey  findings\u2014(1) JCAHO and state agencies both identify no deficiencies, (2)  JCAHO identifies deficiencies not found by state agencies, (3) JCAHO and  state agencies both identify the same deficiencies, and (4) state agencies  identify deficiencies that JCAHO does not\u2014we focused on the fourth  because it highlights the need for CMS oversight of the hospital  accreditation program. For the second outcome, there could be two  reasons for the disparity between JCAHO\u2019s and state survey agencies\u2019  findings: hospitals corrected deficiencies identified by JCAHO prior to the  state agency survey or the state survey agency did not identify a deficiency  that existed. In addition, not all JCAHO findings are equivalent to  noncompliance with a Medicare COP.", "From these 500 surveys, we determined the number of hospitals with  serious deficiencies and the total number of serious deficiencies identified  by state agencies but that CMS determined were not identified by JCAHO.  These data include 123 hospitals in which state survey agencies identified  one or more serious deficiencies and JCAHO did not make comparable  findings according to CMS. These data also include 167 serious  deficiencies identified by state agencies but that CMS determined  comparable findings were not identified by JCAHO.", "For fiscal years 2001 and 2002, we obtained from CMS a comparison  between the validation surveys conducted by the state survey agencies and  the accreditation surveys conducted by JCAHO, which identified serious  deficiencies identified by the state agencies but not by JCAHO as  determined by CMS. For fiscal year 2000, CMS did not supply its  determinations of the comparability of findings in validation and  accreditation surveys for 31 of 82 serious deficiencies. We followed a  protocol similar to the one used by CMS to determine the comparability of  the remaining 31 serious deficiencies, which included 29 quality-of-care  serious deficiencies and 2 physical environment serious deficiencies. Two  analysts with nursing backgrounds compared the findings and made  determinations on their comparability based on their professional  judgment. In cases of disagreement, a third analyst with a background in  nursing made the determination.", "We did not include 1998 and 1999 data in our analysis because CMS used a  method that undercounted the number of deficiencies identified by state  survey agencies but not identified by JCAHO.

We also examined the features of the  new accreditation process by reviewing descriptive material obtained  from JCAHO and interviewing experts in health care quality.

In  the absence of written methodological documentation, we relied on  information provided by CMS officials to evaluate the methodology. They  gave us the following information about their sampling method. At the  beginning of each year, CMS determines a target for the number of  hospitals that will be sampled for validation surveys in each state. Each  month, CMS receives a list of hospitals scheduled for a JCAHO  accreditation survey in that month. Prior to sampling, CMS removes from  the list those hospitals that have received a validation survey in the last 3- year accreditation cycle and hospitals that do not participate in Medicare.  In the first month of the year, CMS selects a random sample of hospitals to  be surveyed from JCAHO\u2019s list. In subsequent months, CMS removes  hospitals in states in which the state target has been met and then selects a  random sample of hospitals. Prior to sending the list to state survey  agencies, CMS determines which hospitals will receive traditional  validation surveys and which will receive other types of surveys that  cannot be used to assess the performance of JCAHO\u2019s hospital  accreditation program. State survey agencies must then complete  traditional validation surveys within 60 days of the completion of JCAHO\u2019s  accreditation survey for the results to be used by CMS to measure the  performance of JCAHO\u2019s hospital accreditation program. According to  CMS officials, the sampling procedures CMS uses are necessary because  they are not informed more than 1 month in advance which hospitals  JCAHO will survey for accreditation.", "In reviewing the sampling procedures they described, we determined that  CMS initially selects a probability sample of hospitals for its state agency  validation surveys.
