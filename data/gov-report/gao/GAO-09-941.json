In 2008, based upon our survey of polling places, we estimate that 27.3 percent of polling places had no potential impediments in the path from the parking to the voting area--up from16 percent in 2000; 45.3 percent had potential impediments but offered curbside voting; and the remaining 27.4 percent had potential impediments and did not offer curbside voting. All but one polling place we visited had an accessible voting system--typically, an electronic machine in a voting station--to facilitate private and independent voting for people with disabilities. However, 46 percent of polling places had an accessible voting system that could pose a challenge to certain voters with disabilities, such as voting stations that were not arranged to accommodate voters using wheelchairs. Most states have established accessibility requirements and funded improvements to help facilitate accessible voting, and all states reported that they required local jurisdictions to offer alternative voting methods. In 2008, 43 states reported that they required accessibility standards for polling places, up from 23 states in 2000. Additionally, most states reported that they used federal HAVA funds to improve the physical accessibility of polling places. Further, all states reported that they required local jurisdictions to offer alternative voting methods, such as absentee voting. At the same time, 31 states reported that ensuring polling place accessibility was challenging. Justice provided guidance on polling place accessibility and conducted an initial assessment of states' compliance with HAVA's January 2006 deadline for accessible voting systems. Since then, Justice's oversight of HAVA's access requirements is part of two other enforcement efforts, but gaps remain. While Justice provided guidance on polling place accessibility, this guidance does not address accessibility of the voting area itself. Justice currently conducts polling place observations for federal elections that identifies whether an accessible voting system is in place, but it does not systematically assess the physical accessibility of polling places or the level of privacy and independence provided to voters with disabilities. Justice also conducts a small number of annual community assessments of Americans with Disabilities Act compliance of public buildings, which includes buildings designated as polling places. However, these assessments do not provide a national perspective on polling place accessibility or assess any special features of the voting area and the accessible voting system that are set up only on Election Day."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Voting is fundamental to our democratic system, and federal law generally  requires federal election polling places to be accessible to all eligible  voters, including the elderly and voters with disabilities. In particular, the  Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act (VAEHA)  requires that, with a few exceptions, political subdivisions responsible for  conducting elections ensure that polling places used in federal elections  are accessible to voters with disabilities. These requirements can present a  challenge to state and local election officials because achieving  accessibility\u2014which is affected by a person\u2019s type of impairment as well  as by various barriers posed by polling place facilities and voting  methods\u2014is part of a larger set of challenges these officials face in  administering elections on a periodic basis. In fact, during the 2000 federal  election, we found that only 16 percent of polling places had no potential  impediments to voting access for people with disabilities\u2014although most  polling places with potential impediments offered curbside voting. The  number of voters who may face difficulties exercising their right to vote  due to mobility and other impairments could grow as the proportion of the  population age 65 and older is expected to grow from 12 percent of the  population in 2003 to more than 20 percent of the population by 2030.  Disability increases with age and studies have shown that with every 10  years after reaching the age of 65, the risk of losing mobility doubles.", "Congress enacted the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) to address  these and other challenges encountered during the 2000 federal election.  HAVA required each polling place to have at least one voting system for  use in federal elections that is accessible for people with disabilities by  January 1, 2006. This voting system can be a direct recording electronic  voting system (e.g., touch screen) or another system that, according to  HAVA, must provide people with disabilities the same opportunity for  voting privately and independently as is afforded to other voters. In  addition, HAVA created the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to  serve, among other purposes, as a clearinghouse and information resource  for election officials with respect to the administration of federal  elections. HAVA also required the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) to provide annual grants to state and local governments to  improve the accessibility of voting systems and polling places, and a total  of $79.5 million has been appropriated for this purpose since 2003. While  our work since the passage of HAVA has reported improvements in state  provisions and local practices to ensure accessibility of polling places, the  extent to which these provisions and practices have improved accessibility  nationally is unknown. To address these issues, you asked us to examine  voting access for people with disabilities at polling places on Election Day,  November 4, 2008. Specifically, this report examines (1) the proportion of  polling places that have features that might facilitate or impede access to  voting for people with disabilities and how these results compare to our  findings from the 2000 federal election; (2) the actions states are taking to  facilitate voting for people with disabilities; and (3) the steps the  Department of Justice (Justice) has taken to enforce HAVA voting access  provisions. We provided some preliminary findings on the proportion of  polling places that had features that might facilitate or impede access to  voting for people with disabilities and how these results compare to our  findings from the 2000 federal election in a report that we issued earlier  this year. We also plan to issue a report on voting practices in long-term  care facilities later this year.", "To estimate the proportion of polling places with features that might  facilitate or impede access to voting for people with disabilities, we visited  randomly selected polling places across the country on Election Day,  November 4, 2008. We used a two-stage sampling method that created a  nationally representative sample of polling places in the contiguous United  States, with the exception of those in Oregon. The first stage involved  selecting a random sample of counties weighted by their total populations.  We based the probability of each county\u2019s selection on the size of its  population so that heavily populated counties, which tend to have more  polling places than less-populated counties, would have a greater chance  of being selected in the sample. Each time a county was selected, we  returned it to the sample universe, which gave it an additional chance of  being selected. Therefore, some counties with large populations were  selected multiple times, resulting in a final selection of 84 unique counties  in 31 states (which was the equivalent of 100 counties). This method  allowed us to select a sample that was representative of polling places  across the country on Election Day. The second stage involved randomly  selecting 8 polling places in each county for each time the county was  selected. On Election Day 2008, we visited a total of 730 polling places. At  each polling place, we took measurements and made observations of  facility features that could facilitate access to the voting area\u2014such as  accessible parking and door thresholds that do not exceed \u00bd inch in  height. We also identified voting methods and features that could facilitate  or impede private and independent voting for people with disabilities in  the voting area, such as voting stations that were properly configured for a  wheelchair. In addition, we conducted short interviews with chief polling  place officials to identify other accommodations for voters\u2014such as  curbside voting outside the polling place. We documented our  observations and interviews with poll workers in a data collection  instrument (DCI) we developed. The DCI was similar to the one used in  our 2000 study of polling places, but we updated it to incorporate changes  that have occurred in federal laws and guidance since 2000.", "This study focused on features in the path leading from the parking area to  the voting area that might facilitate or impede access to voting for people  with disabilities, as well as challenges to private and independent voting in  the voting area. However, because the extent to which any given feature  may affect access is dependent upon numerous factors\u2014including the  type or severity of an individual\u2019s disability\u2014we were not able to  determine whether any observed feature prevented access. Accordingly,  we did not categorize polling places as \u201caccessible\u201d or \u201cinaccessible.\u201d  Moreover, we did not determine whether curbside or other  accommodations offered at polling places actually facilitated voting.  Finally, we did not assess polling places for legal compliance with HAVA  accessible voting system requirements or other federal laws, and we did  not test the accessible capabilities of these voting systems.", "To address our second and third objectives, we administered a Web-based  survey of election officials in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 4  U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin  Islands) between December 2008 and February 2009. We received a 100  percent response rate. We also searched state election Web sites to better  understand and illustrate states\u2019 actions to facilitate voting for people with  disabilities, and obtained and reviewed relevant documentation for  selected states. The scope of this work did not include contacting election  officials from each state and local jurisdiction to verify survey responses  or other information provided by state officials. Also, we did not analyze  states\u2019 laws to determine their voting access requirements, but instead  relied on the states\u2019 responses to our survey.", "To determine what actions Justice has taken to enforce HAVA voting  access provisions, we interviewed Justice officials and reviewed relevant  federal laws, guidance, and other documentation.

In our report on the 2000 election, we found  limited funding was one of the main barriers that most state officials faced  in improving voting accessibility, especially in providing accessible voting  systems and, in some cases, making temporary or permanent  modifications to polling places to make them accessible. However, with  the availability of HAVA funding since that time, most state officials  reported on our survey that they used HAVA funds or a combination of  HAVA and state funds to help improve accessibility in these areas. The  majority of states (45) reported spending or obligating HAVA funds and, in  some cases, also using state funds to enhance physical access to polling  places. For example, election officials in Nebraska reported spending  HAVA funds to evaluate the accessibility of polling places throughout the  state and to ensure they were compliant with ADA standards.  Furthermore, 39 states reported obligating or spending HAVA funds or a  combination of HAVA and state funds to improve voting systems and  technology. For example, Minnesota used HAVA funds to buy ballot- marking machines so that voters with disabilities could mark regular  paper ballots privately and independently and to develop instructional  videos on how to use the machines.", "Even though states have taken actions to make the voting process more  accessible, many states reported that it was very or moderately  challenging to implement certain aspects of HAVA\u2019s voting access  requirements. According to our state survey, 31 states reported that  ensuring polling place accessibility was very or moderately challenging.  (See table 4.) For example, one area in California reported that it was  challenging to find enough accessible polling places in some rural  communities because limited accessible buildings are available.  Additionally, 24 states reported that it was very or moderately challenging  to purchase DREs or other accessible voting systems. For example,  several states said that it was difficult to buy accessible systems because  of EAC\u2019s delay in certifying voting systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All States Offered Alternative Methods Or Accommodations for Voting on or before Election Day", "paragraphs": ["In addition to efforts to ensure polling place accessibility, most states  offered alternative voting methods, such as absentee voting, that could  help facilitate voting options for people with disabilities.

However, the number of states that allow absentee voting  without requiring that voters provide a reason has increased slightly since  the 2000 election, from 18 states to 24 states in 2008. Of the 43 states that  reported requiring local jurisdictions to offer in-person absentee voting, 40  states required that locations used for in-person absentee voting abide by  the same accessibility provisions and accommodations as Election Day  polling places. In addition to absentee voting, all 23 states that reported  that they required or allowed local jurisdictions to offer early voting also  required early voting locations to meet the same HAVA and state  accessibility requirements as Election Day polling places.", "Some states required polling places to provide other accommodations for  voters with disabilities, such as curbside voting and audio or visual aids,  although fewer states required some of these accommodations in 2008  than in 2000. According to our state survey, the number of states that  required curbside voting decreased from 28 states in 2000 to 23 states in  2008 (see fig. 13). Likewise, the number of states that required staff in local  jurisdictions to take a ballot to the residence of a voter with a disability  who needed assistance on or before Election Day decreased from 21 states  in 2000 to only 9 states in 2008. These practices may have declined  because more states have taken actions to make polling places accessible  since the 2000 election, and more states reported allowing people to vote  absentee without having to meet specific criteria.

Justice provided guidance on the new HAVA voting system  requirements, while the EAC, which was authorized by HAVA to develop  guidance and serve as a clearinghouse for election information, was being  formed. During this time, Justice officials said they made a considerable  effort to educate state and local election officials and national  organizations representing election officials and people with disabilities  on HAVA voting system requirements. For this effort, Justice officials met  with state and local election officials across the country and gave  presentations on HAVA requirements at National Association of  Secretaries of State and National Association of State Election Directors  meetings. In addition, Justice provided information about HAVA voting  system requirements on its Web site and posted answers to frequently  asked questions. Justice also provided informal responses to questions  from state election officials on specific aspects of HAVA voting system  requirements. In one response, Justice stated that a HAVA-compliant  voting system requires both the voting system and polling place to be  accessible to people with disabilities. Furthermore, the EAC, in  consultation with Justice, developed an advisory opinion stating that a  HAVA-compliant voting system should be accessible to people with  disabilities (as defined by the ADA), which includes not just the technical  features of the voting system, but configuring the system to allow people  with disabilities to vote privately and independently.", "As part of these early efforts, Justice provided guidance to poll workers on  how to assess and create a physically accessible polling place. In 2004,  Justice published the Americans with Disabilities Act: ADA Checklist for  Polling Places, which provided information to voting officials on key  accessibility features needed by most voters with disabilities to go from  the parking area to the voting area. The checklist also describes how to  take measurements of sloped surfaces, door openings, ramps, and other  features to help identify potential impediments and suggest possible  alternatives and temporary modifications. Justice officials said they have  distributed 16,000 copies of the Americans with Disabilities Act: ADA  Checklist for Polling Places, primarily to advocacy groups and state and  local election officials, and received over 80,000 hits on its Web site since  the checklist was released in February 2004. According to our survey, 34  states found the checklist to be moderately to very helpful and several  state election officials with whom we spoke said they used it to develop  their own state assessments of polling place accessibility. While the  checklist provides limited guidance on accessibility features within the  voting area, it does not provide information about the configuration of the  voting system\u2014such as positioning the voting system in such a way as to  allow a person using a wheelchair to vote privately and independently.", "In 2005, the EAC adopted Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, which  include accessibility standards that specify the configuration of the voting  station to accommodate people using a wheelchair. The main purpose of  these guidelines is to develop technical specifications and standards for  voting systems for national testing and certification. HAVA does not  require adoption of the guidelines at the state level, although states may  choose to adopt the guidelines and make them mandatory in their  jurisdictions. While these guidelines are used to specify voting system  testing standards, EAC officials told us that user-friendly guidance  targeted to poll workers on HAVA voting system requirements, polling  place accessibility, and voting assistance to people with disabilities is  needed.", "In addition to early guidance, Justice also conducted an initial assessment  of states\u2019 progress toward meeting the January 2006 deadline for  compliance with HAVA voting system requirements. In 2003, Justice sent  letters to state election officials summarizing HAVA voting system  requirements. Justice followed up with letters in 2005 and 2006, which  outlined HAVA voting system requirements and asked states to respond to  a series of questions to help gauge whether every polling place in the state  had at least one accessible voting machine and whether poll workers were  trained in the machine\u2019s operation. Although states were not required to  submit reports to Justice under HAVA, Justice officials said all states  responded to the department\u2019s letters. Justice officials reviewed state  responses and followed up with state officials, sometimes on a weekly  basis, if they were not satisfied with the progress being made. Justice also  monitored local media outlets and state election and procurement Web  sites and consulted with national disability groups, election organizations,  and local advocacy groups to independently verify information provided  by states. If Justice determined that sufficient progress toward HAVA  voting system compliance was not being made, it initiated investigations  and, in two cases, pursued litigation when all other options were  exhausted. Justice filed complaints against New York and Maine in 2006,  in part because these states had not made sufficient progress in  purchasing and implementing HAVA accessible voting systems. Since then,  according to Justice, both Maine and New York acquired and implemented  HAVA accessible voting systems for the November 2008 federal election.  Justice officials told us that their assessment of HAVA voting system  requirements was part of an initial effort to ensure that all states had  accessible voting systems by the required January 1, 2006, deadline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Justice\u2019s Current Monitoring of Polling Place Accessibility Has Some Gaps", "paragraphs": ["Once the 2006 deadline passed and all states reported having accessible  voting systems, Justice continued only limited oversight of HAVA voting  system requirements and polling place accessibility, as part of two ongoing  enforcement efforts. These limited efforts leave gaps in ensuring voting  accessibility for people with disabilities. For example, Justice supervises  polling place observations for federal elections on Election Day to  primarily assess compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965; however,  some limited observations on other federal voting statues, such as HAVA,  are also included. Specifically, polling place observers look for accessible  voting systems and assess whether poll workers are trained in their  operation. In calendar year 2008, 1,060 federal observers and 344 Justice  staff members observed 114 elections in over 75 jurisdictions covering 24  states. For such efforts, Justice officials select polling places where they  believe there may be a problem, on the basis of negative news coverage,  complaints received, or information provided by election officials.  Information from polling place observations can provide evidence for an  ongoing investigation or lawsuit. Justice sometimes initiates investigations  on the basis of complaints and other information received. In some cases,  the information may also be used to initiate a matter if an investigation has  not already been opened. Justice officials told us that, as part of their  Election Day 2008 observations, they came across some polling places  where accessible voting machines were not turned on or poll workers  were unable to operate the accessible machine. However, based on our  Election Day assessments, the potential impediments and challenges for  voters with disabilities to access and cast a ballot on accessible voting  systems may be more common than what Justice officials said they found  through their observations. Importantly, Justice did not systematically  assess the physical accessibility of the polling places or the level of privacy  and independence provided to people with disabilities by the accessible  voting system, which limits the department\u2019s ability to identify potential  accessibility issues facing voters with disabilities.", "In addition, Justice officials said they annually initiate a small number of  community assessments of ADA compliance in public buildings, including  buildings designated as polling places, but these assessments include a  small portion of polling places nationwide and are generally not conducted  on Election Day. According to Justice, these assessments\u2014called Civic  Access assessments\u2014can be resource-intensive, which, in part, may limit  the number that the department can complete in a given year. Justice  initiated three Civic Access assessments in calendar year 2008. Justice  selects communities for Civic Access assessments on the basis of a  number of characteristics within a community, including size of the  disability community, geographic location, complaints received from  citizens and advocacy groups, and proximity to a university or tourist  attraction\u2014which, according to Justice officials, might attract people with  disabilities from outside of the community. In planning for the assessment,  Justice requests information from the communities about their polling  places, such as their locations, modifications made on election days, and  steps taken to make polling places accessible. The on-site reviews assess  as many polling places as possible within the scope of the overall review.  Justice officials said they prioritize polling places for assessments on the  basis of geographic location, proximity to other buildings targeted for  assessment in the review, and extent of public use of the facility for any  purpose. To conduct on-site reviews\u2014which typically take 1 to 3 weeks to  complete\u2014Justice deploys teams of attorneys, architects, and  investigators to take measurements of a variety of public buildings.  Afterwards, Justice compiles a list of physical barriers and impediments  for people with disabilities found during the on-site review. Then Justice  generally negotiates and enters into a settlement agreement with the  election jurisdiction, which includes recommendations for improvements,  a time frame for implementing needed changes, and requirements for  reporting and documentation. Between 2000 and 2008, Justice entered into  161 Civic Access settlement agreements, of which, 69 contained one or  more recommendations aimed at polling place provisions. However, given  the small number of Civic Assess assessments conducted annually, the  information on polling place accessibility does not provide a national  perspective on polling place accessibility. In addition, since these  assessments are not conducted during elections, they do not assess any  special features of voting areas and accessible voting systems that are set  up only on Election Day."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["State and local election officials across the country took a considerable  step toward improving voting access for people with disabilities by having  accessible voting systems at virtually every polling place we visited on  Election Day 2008. These voting systems have been significant in enabling  some Americans with disabilities to vote privately and independently at  their neighborhood polling place for the first time. This also shows that  Justice\u2019s efforts to assess states\u2019 implementation of HAVA voting system  requirements achieved the desired outcome of ensuring that polling places  had at least one accessible voting system. Despite these significant efforts,  voters with disabilities may have had difficulty casting a ballot on these  systems because the majority of polling places still had one or more  potential impediments that could prevent a voter with a disability from  even getting to the accessible voting system. Furthermore, in close to half  of polling places, the accessible voting system itself could pose challenges  for voters with disabilities to vote privately or independently. If these  conditions continue, there may be some voters with disabilities who will  experience frustration and dissatisfaction with the voting process on  future election days, while others could be discouraged from voting  entirely.", "Ensuring that voters with disabilities can successfully vote privately and  independently requires government to think broadly about access: how  voters will arrive at the polling place, enter and move through the building,  and cast a ballot using an accessible voting system. For example, just  taking an accessible voting system out of its case and setting it up on any  voting station is not enough if a voter using a wheelchair cannot reach it.  Although Justice\u2019s Americans with Disabilities Act: ADA Checklist for  Polling Places has been widely distributed and is considered helpful by  states, it only includes limited information on creating an accessible voting  area and does not have guidance on configuring voting systems for people  with disabilities. In addition, Justice\u2019s current oversight of HAVA voting  system requirements and polling place accessibility does not address all  aspects of voting access. Without monitoring that focuses on the broad  spectrum of voting accessibility for people with disabilities, it will be  difficult for Justice to ensure it is meeting its oversight duties under HAVA  and other federal voting statutes and to know whether voters with  disabilities are being well-served. We acknowledge that extensive  monitoring of polling place accessibility could be a costly and challenging  undertaking. However, Justice already demonstrated its ability to leverage  resources when it worked with states, disability advocacy organizations,  and others to conduct its initial assessment of states\u2019 implementation of  HAVA voting system requirements. As the proportion of older Americans  increases, the number of people with disabilities will also likely continue  to grow, and it will become even more important to ensure that voting  systems are accessible to all eligible voters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To identify and reduce the number of potential impediments and other  challenges at polling places that might hinder or detract from the voting  experience for people with disabilities, we recommend that the  Department of Justice look for opportunities to expand its monitoring and  oversight of the accessibility of polling places for people with disabilities  in a cost-effective manner. This effort might include the following  activities:    working with states to use existing state oversight mechanisms and using  other resources, such as organizations representing election officials and  disability advocacy organizations, to help assess and monitor states\u2019  progress in ensuring polling place accessibility, similar to the effort used  to determine state compliance with HAVA voting system requirements by  the 2006 deadline;    expanding the scope of Election Day observations to include an  assessment of the physical access to the voting area and the level of  privacy and independence being offered to voters with disabilities by  accessible voting systems; and    expanding the Americans with Disabilities Act: ADA Checklist of Polling  Places to include additional information on the accessibility of the voting  area and guidance on the configuration of the accessible voting system to  provide voters with disabilities with the same level of privacy and  independence as is afforded to other voters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Justice, EAC, and HHS for review and  comment.

Specifically, Justice generally agreed with our suggestion to work with  states to use existing state oversight mechanisms and other resources to  help assess and monitor states\u2019 progress in ensuring polling place  accessibility, similar to the effort it undertook shortly after HAVA was  enacted. Justice said that it can look for opportunities to enhance  educational efforts to states and gather some additional information to  assess state accessibility programs, and work with election officials and  disability rights organizations to stress the importance of polling place  accessibility and ask for their assistance in improving compliance with  federal requirements related to accessibility, but said that it is unlikely to  have the resources for a comprehensive undertaking similar to its earlier  effort. Justice also generally agreed with our recommendation to expand  the scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act: ADA Checklist for  Polling Places to provide additional information on ensuring the  accessibility of the voting area and include guidance on the configuration  of the accessible voting system.", "Justice expressed concerns about our suggestion to expand the scope of  Election Day observations to include an assessment of the physical access  to the voting area and the level of privacy and independence being offered  to voters with disabilities by accessible voting systems. In particular, it had  concerns about shifting the focus of the federal observer program from its  primary purpose of ensuring compliance with the Voting Rights Act of  1965, and not having the resources to train and deploy observers to  conduct extensive assessments of polling places on Election Day. At the  same time, Justice said that it will continue to have Election Day observers  and monitors note whether polling places have an accessible voting  system and will consider incorporating some additional questions such as  observing whether the accessible voting system appears to be situated in a  way that voters can use the system privately and independently. In  response, we believe that the actions we suggest to expand Justice\u2019s  monitoring and oversight activities are consistent with the agency\u2019s stated  function. As laws are enacted and revised to support voting accessibility,  Justice can be positioned to fully meet its duties by modifying its  assessment approaches. That stated, we believe that incorporating  additional questions such as these would satisfy our recommendation and  could be done without adding significant work and interfering with the  primary purpose of the Election Day observer program. Justice also  provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "The EAC expressed appreciation for our research and said that the report  will be a valuable resource for the EAC and election officials as they  continue to develop, implement, and evaluate effective election  administration practices regarding voting accessibility.

Election officials in  several counties granted us access on the condition that we not interview  polling place officials on Election Day, and, in several polling places,  officials were too busy assisting voters to be interviewed. In these cases,  we e-mailed and called chief polling place officials after Election Day to  complete the interview. Polling place officials contacted after Election Day  were asked the same questions as the officials interviewed on Election  Day.

We reviewed the Americans with Disabilities  Act: ADA Checklist for Polling Places and informal guidance, such as  letters responding to state election officials\u2019 requests for additional  guidance on HAVA voting access requirements.

The Voting Section also sometimes initiates  matters to monitor private lawsuits and to observe elections.

If the presuit settlement discussions do not result  in a settlement, the complaint is filed in federal district court and the  parties engage in litigation.
