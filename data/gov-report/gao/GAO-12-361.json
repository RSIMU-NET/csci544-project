Justice has identified supply chain protection measures, but has not developed procedures for implementing or monitoring compliance with and effectiveness of these measures. Until comprehensive policies, procedures, and monitoring capabilities are developed, documented, and implemented, it is more likely that these national security-related departments will rely on security measures that are inadequate, ineffective, or inefficient to manage emergent information technology supply chain risks. In contrast, Defense has made greater progress through its incremental approach to supply chain risk management. The department has defined supply chain protection measures and procedures for implementing and monitoring these measures.

IT supply chain- related threats can be introduced in the manufacturing, assembly, and  distribution of hardware, software, and services. Moreover, these threats  can appear at each phase of the system development life cycle, when an  agency initiates, develops, implements, maintains, and disposes of an  information system.

To identify key risks, we analyzed government and  nongovernment reports on IT supply chain risks. We also validated  identified threats with experts from the Office of the Director of National  Intelligence, the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency,  and the Defense Intelligence Agency. To identify department efforts to  address IT supply chain risks, we analyzed department information security  policies and procedures and interviewed senior information security  program officials at the Department of Energy (Energy), the Department of  Justice (Justice), DHS, and Defense.

According to the Software Engineering Institute (SEI),  the identity of each product or service provider may not be visible to  others in the supply chain. Typically, an acquirer (such as a federal  agency) will only know about the participants directly connected to it in  the supply chain. As a result, an acquirer will have little visibility into the  supply chains of its suppliers.", "For example, a program office at a federal  agency may rely on a prime contractor to acquire, develop, and maintain  an information system. In turn, the prime contractor may obtain the  equipment, software, and services that constitute the system through  various means, including the  reuse of existing equipment or legacy software; outsourcing of system development to an additional supplier; development of the capability in-house; or acquisition of the capability directly from a supplier or commercial off- the-shelf-vendor, or through open-source means.", "In addition, the complexity of corporate structures, in which a parent  company (or its subsidiaries) may own or control IT companies that  conduct business under different names in multiple countries, presents  additional challenges to obtaining a full understanding of the source of an  information system.

An official from Trusted  Mission Systems and Networks, an office within the Defense Office of the  Chief Information Officer, stated that lessons learned from the pilots  should aid in the implementation of supply chain protection throughout the  system development life cycle in a manner that enables systems to meet  departmental cost, schedule, and performance requirements.", "In addition, the 2009 policy states that the supply chain pilots shall  include, among other things, processes to assess threats from potential suppliers providing critical  components to applicable systems; processes to detect the occurrence, reduce the likelihood of  occurrence, and mitigate the consequences of products containing  counterfeit components or malicious functions; and enhanced developmental and operational test and evaluation  capabilities, including software vulnerability detection methods and  automated tools.", "In addition, a July 2011 memorandum, which was issued by the Principal  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics, requires every acquisition program to submit and update a  \u201cprogram protection plan\u201d at each milestone of Defense\u2019s system  acquisition process. Among other things, program protection is intended  to be the integrating process for managing risks to advanced technology  and mission-critical system functionality from supply chain exploits or  design vulnerabilities throughout the acquisition life cycle.", "Defense has developed, documented, and disseminated procedures to  facilitate the effective incremental implementation of supply chain  protection measures. In February 2010, the department released a supply  chain risk management Key Practices and Implementation Guide, which  describes 32 specific measures that an organization could take to  enhance supply chain protection. Examples of these measures include maximizing visibility into suppliers;  choosing programming languages, subsets, and tools that counter  weaknesses; and  reducing supply chain risks during software updates and patch  management.", "Defense has also developed, documented, and disseminated procedures  related to program protection plans. According to these procedures,  program protection plans should guide a program office\u2019s security  measures, and should be updated as threats and vulnerabilities change  or are better understood. The procedures identify at least four ways in  which Defense programs should manage supply chain risk. Specifically,  the procedures recommend that program officials  identify critical program information, critical functions, and  components; document how supply chain threat assessments will be used to  influence system design, development environment, and procurement  practices; assess the need for trusted suppliers for integrated circuits; and  identify specific counterfeit protection measures.", "Defense has also implemented a monitoring mechanism to determine the  status and effectiveness of its supply chain protection pilots. Trusted  Mission Systems and Networks is responsible for collecting supply chain  risk management data and metrics on pilot efforts and reporting the  results of the pilots conducted between 2009 and 2010. For example, this  office issued a limited release report, dated April 2011, that described the  findings and lessons learned related to supply chain protection. According  to the report, this information was based on data collected from the 2010  supply chain pilots conducted in fiscal years 2009 and 2010. An official  within Trusted Mission Systems and Networks stated that the office has  continued to provide quarterly reports on the status and lessons learned  from ongoing pilot activities.", "In addition, Defense has monitored compliance with, and the effectiveness  of, program protection policy and procedures for several acquisition  programs. According to the Deputy Director for Program Protection, Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics, the office has conducted six milestone reviews since July 2011.  We observed evidence that, for four of the milestone reviews, appropriate  Defense officials had verified whether or not the acquisition program had  complied with the July 2011 memo and procedures related to program  protection planning. For example, the documentation associated with one  review conditioned approval on program officials completing an analysis to  identify critical components and information within 180 days of the  milestone review decision. Regarding the two remaining programs,  Defense Systems Engineering officials documented deficiencies in the  program protection plan for one of the programs, and, according to the  Deputy Director for Program Protection, Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, these deficiencies were  communicated to senior officials prior to the milestone review decision. The  remaining program was not approved for continued development.", "According to Trusted Mission Systems and Networks officials, the  department is collecting metrics to assess the effectiveness of the supply  chain risk management aspects of protection planning. Specifically,  officials stated that the department is currently collecting data concerning  the extent to which the department has engaged with program managers  to understand supply chain threats, conducted criticality analyses to  identify critical functions, and developed appropriate countermeasures  and mitigations. According to an official within Trusted Mission Systems  and Networks, the department had conducted 63 such engagements  during fiscal year 2011."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Security-Related Agencies Participate in Governmentwide Efforts to Address Supply Chain Security", "paragraphs": ["The four national security-related agencies also participate in interagency  efforts to address supply chain security.

Although a number of federal laws authorize a  preference for American supplies or end products, these laws are of  limited use for enhancing information assurance. For example, the Buy  American Act, which is designed to promote national commerce and  industry, generally (1) restricts federal agencies\u2019 purchase of nondomestic  (\u201cforeign\u201d) manufactured products, and (2) requires that each federal  agency report to Congress annually for fiscal years 2009-2011 on the  amount of acquisitions it made from entities that manufactured end  products outside the United States. Under the act, however, an end  product can be considered domestic even if it contains foreign  components. Moreover, as implemented, the act does not apply to the  acquisition of commercial IT products, which means that the government  may purchase commercial IT without regard to the Buy American Act and  its reporting requirements. Similarly, the Berry Amendment, which  requires domestic sourcing by Defense of specialty metals, also has  limited value for IT assurance.
