The FBI has shifted agent resources to its top priorities of counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and cyber crime. Some of these agent resources were shifted away from drug, white-collar, and violent crime enforcement programs. The FBI's drug program has sustained, by far, the largest reduction in FBI agent workforce--about 550 positions, or more than 80 percent of the nonsupervisory field agents who were permanently reprogrammed. In addition, the FBI has had a continuing need to temporarily redirect agents from drug, white-collar, and violent crime enforcement to address counterterrorism-related workload demands. While GAO and other organizations have focused considerable attention on the progress of the FBI's transformation, this report addresses questions about the extent to which the shift in resources has affected federal efforts to combat drug, white-collar, and violent crime and whether other agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the drug enforcement area, are filling gaps created by FBI resource shifts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The data GAO examined are inconclusive about the effect of the shifts in the FBI's priorities after September 11 on federal efforts to combat drug, white-collar, and violent crime. Indicators are mixed on the effect of the FBI shift on federal drug, white-collar, and violent crime enforcement. Further, GAO's analyses should be cautiously viewed as short-term indicators that are not necessarily indicative of long-term trends. Data GAO examined on federal drug enforcement efforts did not show a conclusive effect of the FBI's shift in agent resources to priority areas. GAO found that combined FBI and DEA nonsupervisory field agent resources decreased by about 10 percent since September 11 but that DEA is expecting significant increases in positions over the next 2 fiscal years. The combined number of newly opened FBI and DEA drug matters has declined by about 10 percent since 2001, from 22,736 matters in fiscal year 2001, which ended just after September 11, to 20,387 matters in fiscal year 2003. This decline may be attributed, at least in part, to an increased emphasis on cases targeting major drug organizations rather than to fewer investigative resources. In addition, referrals of drug matters to U.S. Attorneys from all federal sources decreased about 2 percent. Similarly, data do not show a conclusive impact on federal efforts to combat white-collar and violent crime resulting from the FBI's shift in priorities. For example, while the number of white-collar crime referrals from federal agencies to U.S. Attorneys declined by about 6 percent, from 12,792 in fiscal year 2001 to 12,057 in fiscal year 2003, violent crime referrals from all federal sources have increased by about 29 percent, from 14,546 in fiscal year 2001 to 18,723 in fiscal year 2003. Views of law enforcement practitioners GAO interviewed were mixed on the effect of the FBI's shift in resources on drug, white-collar, and violent crime enforcement efforts. Although these views are not representative of all practitioners, some did not think the FBI's shift had a significant impact on these crime enforcement efforts in their communities, while others said that drug, white-collar and violent-crime investigations had suffered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has the dual mission of  protecting national security and combating traditional crimes such as  drug, white-collar, and violent crime. As a result of the September 11,   2001, terrorist attacks, the FBI committed to transforming itself to  strengthen its ability to combat terrorism. One of the goals of the FBI\u2019s  transformation efforts was to shift its investigative resources to increase  its focus on its national security mission.", "As we have previously reported, the FBI\u2019s recent focus on its top priorities  of counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and cyber crime has required a  continuous shift in resources away from drug, white-collar, and violent  crime enforcement, despite additional appropriations to hire special  agents in priority areas. Drug enforcement has sustained, by far, the  largest reduction in FBI agent workforce.", "While GAO and other organizations, for example, the Congressional  Research Service (CRS) and the National Academy of Public  Administration, have focused considerable attention on the progress of the  FBI\u2019s transformation efforts, we have also had questions about the extent  to which the shift in resources has affected federal efforts to combat  traditional crimes that were a significant portion of the FBI\u2019s caseload  before the terrorist attacks. Questions have been raised about the effect, if  any, that the FBI\u2019s shift in resources into priority areas may have had on  the enforcement of drug, white-collar, and violent crimes and whether  other federal agencies, including the Drug Enforcement Administration  (DEA) in the drug enforcement area, are filling gaps created as a result of  the FBI resource shift.", "To assist with its oversight responsibilities, the House Appropriations  Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary and Related  Agencies has requested that we study the effects FBI\u2019s shift to its new  priorities has had on enforcement of selected traditional crimes. To assess  overall impacts of the FBI\u2019s shift in resources, this report examines the  following issues: (1) How has FBI\u2019s shift in agent resources since  September 11 affected federal efforts to combat drug crime? (2) How has  FBI\u2019s shift in priorities affected federal efforts to combat white-collar and  violent crime?", "To examine the effect of FBI\u2019s post-September 11 shift in resources to  national security priorities on federal efforts to combat domestic drug  crime, we analyzed data related to (1) the combined nonsupervisory field  agent resources devoted to drug enforcement by the FBI and DEA; (2) the  number of newly opened FBI and DEA drug matters; (3) the number of  drug matters referred from all federal agencies to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices  for prosecution. We also conducted semistructured interviews to  determine what impacts, if any, selected headquarters and field law  enforcement officials have observed. To examine the effect of the FBI\u2019s  post-September 11 priority shifts on federal efforts to combat white-collar  and violent crime, we analyzed data indicating the number of such matters  referred to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices for prosecution from the FBI and all  other federal agencies. In addition, we included in our semistructured  interview for law enforcement officials questions related to impacts  observed, if any, on violent and white-collar crime caseloads and  enforcement activities. The interviewees, although working in locations  that experienced some of the sharpest reductions in FBI drug program  resources, are not representative of all locations or even of all of those  locations that experienced similar reductions in resources. The data we  analyzed and interviews with law enforcement officials should be  considered as short-term indicators with limitations in their ability to  determine the effect of FBI priority shifts.", "Because the reliability of FBI, DEA, and Executive Office for U.S.  Attorneys (EOUSA) information management systems data is significant to  the findings of this review, we also interviewed officials of FBI, DEA, and  EOUSA to determine what steps they take to assess the accuracy of data  elements in these systems and what limitations, if any, they have identified  with the data elements used for our review. We also did a limited  assessment of the reliability of the data systems used for this report, and  we determined that the required data elements are sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this review.", "We performed our work from December 2003 to July 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Our scope and  methodology are discussed in greater detail in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the terrorist attacks of September 11, national security, including  counterterrorism, was a top-tier priority for the FBI. However, this top tier  combined national security responsibilities with other issues, and the  FBI\u2019s focus and priorities were not entirely clear. According to a  Congressional Research Service report, the events of September 11 made  clear the need to develop a definitive list of priorities. In June 2002, the  FBI\u2019s director announced 10 priorities. The top 3 priorities were to   (1) protect the United States from terrorist attack (counterterrorism),   (2) protect the United States against foreign intelligence operations and  espionage (counterintelligence), and (3) protect the United States against  cyber-based attacks and high-technology crimes (cyber crime). White- collar crime ranked seventh in the priority list, and violent crime ranked  eighth. Drug crimes that were not part of transnational or national  criminal organizations were not specifically among the FBI\u2019s top   10 priorities.", "In June 2003 and March 2004, we testified that a key element of the FBI\u2019s  reorganization and successful transformation is the realignment of  resources to better ensure focus on the highest priorities. Since  September 11, the FBI has permanently realigned a substantial number of  its field agents from traditional criminal investigative programs to work on  counterterrorism and counterintelligence investigations. The FBI\u2019s staff  reprogrammings carried out since September 11 have permanently shifted  674 field agent positions from the drug, white-collar, and violent crime  program areas to counterterrorism and counterintelligence.  About 550 of  these positions (more than 80 percent of the permanently shifted  positions) came from the FBI\u2019s drug program, with substantially smaller  reductions from the white-collar and violent crime programs. In addition,  the FBI established the cyber program. As figure 1 shows, about   25 percent of the FBI\u2019s field agent positions were allocated to  counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and cyber crime programs prior to  the FBI\u2019s change in priorities. As a result of the staff reprogrammings and  funding for additional special agent positions received through various  appropriations between 2002 and 2004,  the FBI staffing levels allocated to  the counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and cyber program areas have  increased to about 36 percent and now represent the single largest  concentration of FBI resources. Figure 1 also notes that the number of  nonsupervisory FBI field agent positions has increased from 10,292 in  fiscal year 2002 to 11,021 in fiscal year 2004, about 7 percent.", "Additionally, the FBI has had a continuing need to temporarily redirect  special agent resources from other criminal investigative programs to  address counterterrorism and other higher-priority needs. The FBI  continues to redirect agents from drug, white-collar, and violent crime  programs to address the counterterrorism-related workload demands.  These moves are directly in line with the FBI\u2019s priorities and in keeping  with its policy that no counterterrorism leads will go unaddressed. Figure  2 shows that the counterterrorism program continues to rely on resources  that are temporarily redirected from other crime programs. Appendix   II contains figures that show the reductions in FBI nonsupervisory field  agent positions and work years charged to the drug program and, to a  lesser extent, the white-collar and violent crime programs after   September 11.", "As one might expect, the reallocation of resources to align with post- September 11 priorities resulted in a significant increase in newly opened  FBI counterterrorism matters, while the number of newly opened FBI  drug, white-collar, and violent crime matters declined between fiscal year  2001 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. As shown in figure 3, the  FBI\u2019s newly opened counterterrorism matters increased by about   183 percent, from 1,006 matters in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2001 to  2,850 matters in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003.", "In contrast, the number of newly opened FBI drug matters declined from  1,447 in fiscal year 2001 to 587 in fiscal year 2003\u2014a decrease of about   60 percent. FBI newly opened white-collar and violent crime matters also  remained below pre-September 11 levels, though the decreases have not  been as dramatic as those in the drug crime program. The decreases from  fiscal year 2001 to fiscal year 2003 were about 32 percent in the number of  newly opened white-collar crime matters and about 40 percent in newly  opened violent crime matters. See appendix III for figures showing the  pre- and post-September 11 changes in the FBI\u2019s newly opened drug,  white-collar, and violent crime matters.", "Also, as expected with the significant shift in resources to address national  security priorities, the FBI\u2019s referrals of counterterrorism matters to U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 Offices for prosecution have increased since September 11,  while referrals of drug, white-collar, and violent crime matters have  decreased. In fiscal year 2001, which ended just after September 11, 2001,  the FBI referred 236 counterterrorism matters to U.S. Attorneys for  prosecution. In fiscal year 2003, the FBI referred 1,821 of these matters to  U.S. Attorneys, an increase of about 671 percent. At the same time, FBI  referrals of drug, white-collar, and violent crime matters decreased about  39 percent, 23 percent, and 10 percent respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Conclusive Effect on Federal Drug Enforcement Resulting from FBI Agent Resource Shifts because Results Are Mixed and Available Data Have Limitations", "paragraphs": ["We could not conclusively identify an effect on federal drug enforcement  resulting from the FBI\u2019s shift in resources after September 11, because  results of our analyses were mixed and the data we used had limitations.

Further, DEA, the lead agency for federal drug  enforcement, is continuing to increase its resources as positions  appropriated by Congress in prior fiscal years are filled. The combined  number of newly opened FBI and DEA drug matters has declined by about  10 percent since September 11. However, the combined number of  referrals of drug matters to U.S. Attorneys from all federal sources  decreased about 2 percent.

The decrease has not been more pronounced because  DEA, as the nation\u2019s single-mission drug enforcement agency, has devoted  more resources to domestic drug enforcement than has the FBI in both  pre- and post-September 11 periods. As the number of FBI nonsupervisory  field special agents assigned to drug program investigations has decreased  from about 1,400 in fiscal year 2001 to about 800 in fiscal year 2004, the  number of DEA nonsupervisory field agents has increased slightly. These  DEA positions increased from a little less than 3,100 positions in fiscal  year 2001 to a little more than 3,200 positions in the second quarter of  fiscal year 2004.  DEA devoted about twice as many agent resources as  the FBI did to domestic drug enforcement before the terrorist attacks, and  the DEA share of the combined FBI and DEA domestic drug enforcement  agent resources has continued to increase since then.", "A Department of Justice official noted that Justice has pursued the goal of  increasing agent strength, and the DEA domestic drug operations chief  said that he expects the number of DEA domestic drug agents to increase  significantly over the next 2 fiscal years, when positions already  appropriated by Congress are filled. According to the chief, DEA expects  to fill 216 new special agent positions appropriated in fiscal year 2003 by  the end of fiscal year 2004. The agency plans to fill 365 additional positions  appropriated in fiscal year 2004 during fiscal year 2005. Thus, in fiscal year  2005, the combined number of FBI and DEA drug enforcement agent  resources should exceed the pre-September 11 workforce strength, and in  fiscal year 2006, the total should continue to increase. In fiscal year   2005, DEA is requesting 111 additional agent positions for domestic  enforcement. The chief said that he has worked with FBI and Department  of Justice officials to determine where to deploy new special agent  positions allocated since September 11 and that DEA has put additional  resources in high-threat areas where the FBI had shifted resources out of  drug enforcement. The chief said that DEA is pacing the hiring of new  agents in an effort to manage its growth so that as new special agents  come on board, DEA has the necessary infrastructure, including office  space, cars, equipment, and training resources, to support them.", "In contrast, the chief of the FBI\u2019s drug section said that FBI officials do not  foresee a significant increase in the number of agents assigned to drug  investigations. However, he was not aware of any plans to withdraw  additional agent resources from the drug program.  He also said he was  hopeful that in future years, as the FBI gained experience and resources  for its national security-related priorities, fewer temporary diversions of  special agents from drug work to higher priorities would be necessary. In  addition, a Justice Department official noted that in fiscal year 2004, FBI  received additional agent positions funded under the Organized Crime  Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program, and that additional  OCDETF field positions were requested for the FBI in the 2005 budget.   Since FBI officials do not foresee a significant increase in the number of  special agents deployed to its drug program, if the trends continue, DEA  would have an even larger portion of the combined FBI and DEA domestic  drug program agent resources in the future than it currently has."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of FBI and DEA Newly Opened Drug Matters Decreased About 10 Percent after September 11", "paragraphs": ["Although the number of the FBI\u2019s newly opened drug matters decreased  about 60 percent after September 11, the combined decrease in the  number of FBI and DEA newly opened matters is much smaller\u2014about   10 percent\u2014because DEA has a much larger drug caseload than the FBI.

He  said that the policy has resulted in DEA opening fewer cases but that those  cases have potential to dismantle or disrupt the operations of major drug  cartels.  In commenting on a draft of this report, a Department of Justice  official more broadly stated that the decrease in newly opened drug  matters was due to the Justice strategy, which directs resources on  complex, nationwide investigation of entire drug trafficking networks.

We also analyzed FBI and DEA budget and resource allocation  information. We focused our analysis primarily on nonsupervisory field  special agent positions because these positions are directly involved in  investigations, while supervisors, managers, and headquarters agents often  have noninvestigative responsibilities in addition to their investigative  duties. To determine the number of newly opened FBI and DEA drug  matters, we analyzed case management system data for the period from  fiscal year 2001 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2004. We also  reviewed the Department of Justice\u2019s Domestic Drug Enforcement  Strategy and discussed resource allocation issues and concerns with FBI  and DEA officials. We did not attempt to analyze data on drug  enforcement resource allocations and drug matters opened for federal  agencies and departments other than the FBI and DEA that are involved in  investigating drug-related crimes. To determine the number of drug  referrals from the FBI, DEA, and other federal agencies to U.S. Attorneys,  we analyzed Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA) case  management data on the number of referrals received by referring agency  and type of referral for fiscal year 2001 through 2003. We did not have  access to criminal case files and thus did not provide any assessment of  changes in the quality or complexity of traditional criminal investigations  in pre- and post-September 11 periods.", "To provide perspectives of law enforcement officials on impacts, if any,  they observed on traditional FBI criminal enforcement areas as a result of  the FBI\u2019s shift of resources to new priorities, we interviewed selected  federal headquarters and field officials, police department supervisors,  and representatives of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. At  FBI headquarters we interviewed the chief of the drug section, and at DEA  headquarters we interviewed the chief of the domestic drug program. The  field locations we visited, as shown in table 1, had among the greatest  shifts of FBI resources from traditional criminal programs into new  priorities. Using a semistructured interview and a data collection  instrument, at each location we asked FBI and DEA field office managers  and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office supervisory prosecutors and local police  department supervisors responsible for drug enforcement about any  impacts they had observed on their caseloads, workloads, and crime in  their communities as a result of the FBI shift in priorities. The results of  these interviews cannot be generalized to any broader community of law  enforcement agencies or officials or to other geographic locations.", "To examine the effect of the FBI\u2019s post-September 11 priority shifts on  federal efforts to combat white-collar and violent crime, we considered   (1) the number of matters referred to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices for  prosecution from the FBI and all other federal agencies and (2) the effects,  if any, observed by law enforcement officials we interviewed. To  determine how the numbers of white-collar and violent crime matters  referred to U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices for prosecution from the FBI and all  other federal agencies have changed, we analyzed case-management  system data from EOUSA. To provide perspectives from selected law  enforcement officials on any changes in federal white-collar and violent  crime enforcement activities as a result of the FBI\u2019s shift in priorities, we  included in our structured interview questions about effects federal and  local law enforcement officials we visited might have observed on white- collar and violent crime caseloads, workloads, and law enforcement  activities in their communities. We did not attempt to collect information  on the number of newly opened white-collar and violent crime matters  from all federal sources because there is no agency comparable to DEA,  with single-mission dedication to white-collar crime or violent crime  investigations. Many different federal agencies and offices, including  criminal investigative agencies and inspectors general, investigate these  matters, but our time frames did not allow us to obtain resource allocation  data from them.", "The data should be viewed as short-term indicators with limitations. The  full impact of the FBI\u2019s shift in priorities may not be apparent for several  years. While we looked at numbers of agent resources, matters opened,  and matters referred for prosecution, we could not fully assess the less  tangible factors of the quality of agent resources and investigations and  the complexity of investigations. Neither could we determine what  investigations the FBI might have pursued had it had additional agent  resources.", "Because the reliability of FBI, DEA, and EOUSA information management  systems data is significant to the findings of this review, we interviewed  FBI, DEA, and U.S. Attorney personnel to determine what steps they take  to assess the accuracy of data elements and what limitations, if any, they  have identified with the data elements used for our review.
