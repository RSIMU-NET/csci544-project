GAO recommended in a 1998 oversight report that FTA improve the program. The subcommittee requested that GAO review this program. GAO identified (1) the extent to which triennial reviews indicate that grantees met applicable federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008; (2) the strengths and weaknesses of the triennial review process; and (3) FTA's performance measures for the triennial review and the extent to which they meet key attributes of successful performance measures. GAO addressed these objectives by analyzing oversight data on 424 grantees that had three triennial reviews, reviewing triennial review reports and guidance, assessing FTA's performance measures; and interviewing FTA headquarters and regional officials, contractors who conduct the reviews, and grantees."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's analysis of FTA's triennial review oversight data found that over two-thirds of the 424 grantees analyzed have not consistently improved overall performance in terms of meeting more federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through 2008. Fifty-one percent of grantees had mixed results in meeting requirements and 17 percent consistently met fewer requirements; while 31 percent consistently met more requirements--one of the goals of the triennial review program. Executives from three grantees that met most requirements attributed their performance to, among other things, having job descriptions that link employee responsibilities to the triennial review--a practice they said contributed to a culture of accountability. During the same time, grantees had the greatest number of findings in 5 of 23 triennial review areas, including the procurement and drug and alcohol testing areas. While FTA helps grantees address findings, additional efforts to identify the underlying causes and the severity of findings could further benefit grantees. FTA's triennial review program uses some strong management practices--having a well-defined process, using an information system to monitor grantees, and issuing reports timely. Still, two areas could be strengthened. First, while FTA is legislatively required to conduct a complete review of grantees' adherence to federal requirements at least once every 3 years, GAO identified a few instances where documentation does not clearly show that FTA reviewed all requirement areas. For example, 10 triennial review reports for 2008 showed that the drug and alcohol program area was \"not reviewed.\" FTA's practice is to review all areas, regardless of documentation, but because FTA's guidance is not clear about how to document the review of areas where FTA has conducted a related special review in the prior two years, a few grantees may not be reviewed for 5 years. FTA plans to revise its guidance to avoid ambiguity. Second, FTA is aware of the burden oversight reviews place on grantees and works to limit this burden. However, in a limited number of cases, FTA did not coordinate its special oversight reviews with the triennial review schedule, which may place undue burden on a few grantees receiving multiple oversight reviews in the same fiscal year. FTA's two timeliness performance measures for assessing the triennial review program--(1) closing 80 percent of grantees' deficient findings within 30 days of their due date and (2) issuing 95 percent of the final triennial review reports within 30 days of completing a review--meet some, but not all key attributes of successful measures. Although both measures link throughout the organization, have measurable targets, are clearly stated, and do not overlap, the \"close findings\" measure does not meet the objectivity and reliability attribute. For example, data inaccuracies in past \"close findings\" data raised questions about the reliability of the measure. Also, both measures do not assess the core program activity to evaluate grantees' performance or governmentwide priorities, such as the quality of the triennial review program, and thus, as a whole, are not balanced, making it difficult for managers to not overemphasize one priority at the expense of others."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Public transportation systems are playing an increasingly important role in  the nation\u2019s overall transportation system. Public transit increases  mobility for millions of Americans in communities both large and small,  provides congestion relief, promotes safe travel, and helps reduce our  country\u2019s dependence on foreign oil. The Department of Transportation\u2019s  Federal Transit Administration (FTA) fosters the development and  maintenance of bus, subway, trolley, passenger ferry boat, and other  public transportation systems through several grant programs to transit  agencies serving both rural (population less than 50,000) and urban  communities (population 50,000 or more). A large portion of FTA\u2019s grants  are formula grants to transit agencies in urban areas across the country.  This Urbanized Area Formula Program received 42 percent of FTA grant  funds\u2014about $22 billion from fiscal years 2004 through 2009. In addition,  Congress recently appropriated an additional $6 billion for the Urbanized  Area Formula Program in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009.", "Federal law requires the Secretary of Transportation to review and  evaluate completely the performance of each recipient of Urbanized Area  Formula Program grants (grantee) that receives urbanized area formula  funds under this section in complying with statutory and administrative  requirements, at least once every 3 years.

Grantees must comply with a variety of  requirements to safeguard federal funds and help ensure safe  transportation, among other things.", "As the subcommittee prepares for the 2009 surface transportation  reauthorization, we assessed, at your request, FTA\u2019s triennial review  program. Specifically, we identified (1) to what extent FTA\u2019s triennial  reviews indicate that grantees met applicable federal requirements from  fiscal years 2000 through 2008, (2) the strengths and weaknesses of the  triennial review process, and (3) FTA\u2019s performance measures for the  triennial review and to what extent FTA\u2019s measures meet key attributes of  successful performance measures.", "To identify the extent to which triennial reviews indicate that grantees are  meeting applicable federal requirements from fiscal years 2000 through  2008, we obtained and analyzed data from FTA\u2019s Oversight Tracking  System (OTRAK)\u2014the official electronic information system used for  tracking and monitoring oversight activities. Specifically, we conducted  various analyses of oversight data on 424 of the approximately 600  urbanized area formula fund grantees. These 424 grantees received exactly  3 triennial reviews from fiscal years 2000 through 2008\u2014the period of time  for which OTRAK data was available. We found most OTRAK data  sufficiently reliable for our purposes, but have reliability concerns about  closed findings data used for performance measurements, which we  discuss later in this report. To identify the strengths and weaknesses of the  triennial review process, we reviewed federal guidance for improving  grant accountability, previous GAO reports on oversight, FTA\u2019s oversight  review order, the Triennial Review Contractors\u2019 Guide, oversight review  schedules, and the contents of over 200 triennial review reports for fiscal  years 2007 and 2008. We also attended FTA\u2019s new grantee triennial review  workshop and observed one of FTA\u2019s 2008 triennial reviews. To identify  performance measures for the triennial review and the extent to which  they meet key attributes of successful performance measures, we  reviewed the key attributes of successful performance measures, as  described in our past work on the Government Performance and Results  Act of 1993 and FTA\u2019s strategic and annual performance plans.  Specifically, we compared each of FTA\u2019s performance measures against  each of the key attributes to determine the extent to which they fully met,  partially met, or did not meet all key attributes. Finally, we interviewed  FTA headquarters officials, staff in all 10 FTA regional offices,  representatives of the four contracting firms that conduct the triennial  reviews, and professional transportation associations. We also selected 10  grantees and interviewed executives from these grantees to discuss their  performance, as assessed by the triennial review. We selected these  grantees on several factors, including their past performance, as assessed  by triennial reviews; having both a triennial review and another FTA  oversight review in the same fiscal year; and demographic features, such  as size and geographic region.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2008 to June 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Figure 1 summarizes key information  about FTA\u2019s 10 regions, including the total amount and funds for the  Urbanized Area Formula Program.", "In 1994, FTA laid out a common framework for regional and headquarters  staff to administer oversight reviews in FTA Order 5400.1. That order,  which remains in effect today, describes the process for conducting  various oversight reviews and taking corrective actions. In addition, the  order established an internal working group called the Oversight Review  Council to develop oversight review schedules, coordinate review  schedules to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlap, and achieve a  comprehensive, uniform, and cohesive approach, among other things.", "The triennial review provides FTA with a valuable opportunity to routinely  evaluate the use of federal funds for about 600 urban area grantees at least  once every three years\u2014or about 200 grantees each year. It covers many  areas, such as procurement, financial management, and drug and alcohol  programs. Appendix II contains FTA\u2019s descriptions of all 23 triennial  review areas. FTA also uses a similar, general review to oversee grantees  that receive rural area formula funds\u2014a state management review.", "In addition to the more general triennial and state management reviews,  FTA conducts special oversight reviews with a narrowed subject matter  focus, such as procurement system reviews, which help ensure that  grantees (especially 30 grantees that receive large amounts of federal  transit funds) are purchasing buses and trains using competitive bidding  practices, as well as special civil rights reviews, which help ensure that  grantees are, among other things, providing public transportation to the  disabled and adhering to equal employment opportunity practices.  Grantees also experience non-FTA reviews, such as single audits that  examine grantees\u2019 financial statements, inspector general audits, and  various state audits. Table 1 describes FTA\u2019s primary oversight reviews.", "The triennial review covers 23 triennial review areas, but given the need to  review all of these areas, the time constraints (estimated at about 130  hours for each review), and in order to reduce the oversight burden upon  grantees, FTA does not conduct an in-depth document review or  inspection. For example, FTA normally samples no more than 15 financial  records during site visits, conducts a spot check of facility and  maintenance records, and may only inspect a few buses and subway cars  during the review. However, according to FTA officials, when an area of  concern or deficiency is noted, FTA will expand the review to examine  these areas more in-depth. Figure 2 summarizes the major steps in the  triennial review process.", "The triennial review also gives FTA an opportunity to provide technical  assistance to individual grantees\u2014assistance specifically aimed to help  individual grantees resolve specific deficient findings resulting from  triennial reviews. FTA also helps grantees prepare for the triennial review  by holding annual triennial review workshops throughout the country and  offering formal training courses focused on specialized subject areas  through the National Transit Institute\u2014a training institute funded by an  FTA grant.", "While officials from both FTA headquarters and regional offices are  ultimately responsible for implementing the triennial reviews, they have  increasingly relied on contractors since the program was created in the  early 1980s. After we reported in 1992 that FTA had not fully utilized  contractors for oversight activities, it has, since 1996, used contractors to  conduct all triennial reviews. FTA, through its Office of Program  Management, awarded multiple-year, firm, fixed-price contracts totaling  about $4 million each year to four contractors to conduct the fiscal years\u2019  2008 through 2012 triennial reviews.", "To assist contractors with the reviews, FTA developed the Triennial  Review Contractors\u2019 Guide. FTA has expanded the contractors\u2019 guide  from its original 29 pages to over 200 pages in 2008. The contractors\u2019 guide  provides the questions to ask grantees for each of the 23 triennial review  areas, a list of grantees\u2019 documents that contractors are to examine, and a  method that contractors are to use for determining whether grantees are  meeting federal requirements.", "The contractors\u2019 guide assists contractors with the decision-making  process about what constitutes a deficient finding by providing condition  statements for the 23 triennial review areas. For example, according to the  contractors\u2019 guide, if the grantee has included the lobbying prohibitions  clause (that is, the prohibition from using federal funds to lobby for  additional federal funds) in its procurement solicitations, then the grantee  is not deficient; otherwise, the grantee is deficient. The contractors\u2019 guide  also contains suggested corrective actions if a grantee is found deficient,  (e.g., the grantee must certify to FTA that it will have subgrantees,  contractors, and subcontractors comply with the lobbying prohibitions  requirement.) In another example, if FTA conducted a special  procurement system review (see table 1) in the prior two fiscal years or if  one is scheduled for the year of the grantee\u2019s triennial review, then a  review of the procurement area is not necessary and a notation is made in  the triennial review report as \u201cnot reviewed.\u201d Subsequently, contractors  enter predetermined, deficiency codes into OTRAK that correspond to  explanations for any deficient findings, herein called findings.

Executives representing these three grantees implemented some  management practices that they believe contributed to their high  performances. One management practice included linking the job  descriptions of pertinent individuals to the triennial review\u2014a practice  that grantee executives said contributed to a culture of accountability.  Specifically, the controller\u2019s and grants administrator\u2019s job descriptions for  the large grantee explicitly required these individuals to be responsible for  the triennial review. An assistant director of public works, responsible  for managing the transit system of a small grantee, was required to help  implement FTA requirements, among other things. In addition, according  to the chief executive officer of the medium grantee, the officer set verbal  job expectations with managers of zero findings, which the officer  believed contributed to the high performance in the triennial review.", "Another practice implemented by 2 of the 3 high-performing grantees was  to initiate external reviews by independent consultants to assess their  operations, which contributed to, or is expected to sustain, their high  performance. Executives from a large grantee we interviewed attributed  their high performance to an external review conducted several years ago  that focused on the grantee\u2019s readiness for the triennial review. Despite  having zero findings in their last two consecutive triennial reviews,  executives from the medium grantee recently completed an external  maintenance review that they believe should help them achieve their goal  of operating an efficient transit system and that is necessary to remain  good stewards of public funding.", "FTA officials recognize the importance of sharing best practices among  grantees. As such, it advocates a grantee mentoring system where regional  offices, within resource and budget restraints, initiate, encourage and  direct grantees to team with recognized grantee leaders in order to  improve grantee performance.

These  five areas accounted for about 54 percent of all findings over the last nine  years. This may not be unexpected since we also found a positive  relationship between the number of questions asked for certain areas and  the number of findings. Specifically, grantees tended to have higher  numbers of findings in those areas where the contractors\u2019 guide requires  contractors to ask more questions when compared to other areas. For  example, for fiscal year 2008, contractors asked grantees 20 questions in  the procurement area, as compared to 2 or 3 questions in other areas, such  as school bus and half-fare, which had far fewer findings. Figure 5 shows  the percentage of triennial review findings for the top 5 areas, compared to  the other 18 areas for the same 424 grantees over the nine-year period.", "FTA has also analyzed OTRAK data on past triennial reviews, identified  similar areas with the greatest number of findings, and provided resources  at a national level to help grantees address the findings in these areas.  According to several end of year reports, FTA analysis of deficiency codes  related to the procurement area showed grantees lacking justification for  non-competitive awards, lacking open competition, having no contract  administration system, and having no written record of procurement  history. For the drug and alcohol area, deficiency codes pointed to  grantees having policies that were out-of-date or lacked required elements,  and conducting random drug and alcohol tests below the federally  required level. To help grantees improve their performance in areas with  the greatest number of findings, FTA has provided an increasing amount  of technical assistance to individual grantees; workshops that focus on,  among other things, procurement related matters; and training. In its 2003  end of year report, FTA noted that a decline in findings from fiscal year  2000 to 2003 indicated the effectiveness of its efforts to improve grantees\u2019  performance.", "We could not definitively determine whether, or to what degree, FTA\u2019s  technical assistance, workshops, and training improved grantees\u2019  performance because while workshops increased from 2005 to 2008, so  did the total number of findings. Other factors could have contributed to a  reduction of grantees\u2019 findings over the last nine years. The reduction in  findings could have been caused by contractors reporting that they did not  review certain areas for some grantees that had recently experienced a  special oversight review or by FTA conducting a pilot study in 2005 to  streamline the triennial review process, which also resulted in some areas  not being completely reviewed. Further, grantees, as well as FTA  headquarters and regional officials, cite a shift over the years in how FTA  conducts the triennial reviews\u2014from a \u201cgotcha\u201d auditing approach to a  customer-service approach, helping grantees quickly resolve findings  during the reviews and lessening the need to report the findings.", "Although FTA analyzes deficiency codes in OTRAK data to determine  problem areas, these codes alone do not describe the underlying causes  for the findings. Generally accepted government auditing standards  recommend that federal agencies, such as FTA, identify, to the extent  possible, the underlying cause in developing findings as this provides  persuasive evidence on the factor(s) responsible for the problem.  Deficiency codes pointing to grantees lacking open competition or not  having a written record of their procurement history, for example, is not  an underlying cause, as grantees\u2019 ability to meet procurement  requirements may be caused by grantees not having sufficient or  knowledgeable staff to initiate a competitive contracting process. If FTA  would identify these as common underlying causes, it could prescribe, as  part of the necessary corrective action, that grantees attend specific  procurement training courses. Knowing the common underlying causes of  grantees\u2019 findings could provide FTA with valuable information to help  many grantees find solutions to correct their findings and improve  grantees\u2019 long-term performance. FTA officials stated that during the  workshops, they plan to emphasize ways to identify systemic deficiencies.", "Officials expressed concern about their authority to use oversight funds  for the purpose of undertaking additional efforts to help the grantees meet  or exceed requirements by identifying the common underlying causes for  less than satisfactory levels of performance. Officials told us that they  have the authority to use oversight funds for providing individual grantees  with technical assistance\u2014assistance necessary to satisfactorily address  specific findings resulting from the grantee\u2019s triennial review.

However, individuals entering severity data into OTRAK  labeled almost 98 percent of findings as medium, which makes it difficult  for FTA to prioritize technical assistance in problem areas. According to  FTA officials, contractors or regional staff made judgments about the level  of severity because FTA has not developed definitions from which to make  this judgment. This could mean the information on severity is not  consistent across the country. FTA officials said that they plan to improve  their data collection efforts for the fiscal year 2010 triennial reviews by  establishing definitions for the three levels of severity, which could  provide more meaningful findings data and add significant value to the  information FTA collects to target its technical assistance for the purposes  of improving grantees\u2019 performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Triennial Review Program Uses Some Strong Management Practices, but Can Be Improved in a Few Areas", "paragraphs": ["Strengths of the triennial review include a well-defined process, the  increased use of an electronic tracking system to monitor grantees\u2019  performance, increased timeliness in issuing triennial review reports, and  the willingness of FTA staff to seek out opportunities for continuous  improvement.

Preparing policies and procedures that outline individual  responsibilities meets an important element of strong federal grant  accountability best practices.", "Another strength is an increased use of an information system to track and  monitor grantees. In 1998, we criticized FTA for not making full use of its  information system because its regional staff had not been uniformly  updating the system and its headquarters staff was not enforcing its use as  a management tool. FTA upgraded OTRAK in 2003 from a local-area  computer network to a Web-based system, which allows headquarters and  regions to share information and track oversight activities more efficiently.  FTA has continued to incrementally update this system. In addition, the  contractors\u2019 guide directs contractors to input the findings from each  review into OTRAK and all regional staff and contractors we spoke with  reported using OTRAK. Performance information, such as that recorded  in OTRAK, helps agencies identify, prioritize, and manage potential at-risk  grantees.", "FTA has strengthened its triennial review reporting process by issuing  more timely triennial review reports than in previous years. In 1998, we  criticized FTA for taking an average of 182 days after the site visit to  process its 1995 and 1996 triennial review reports and recommended that  FTA follow its established 90-day time frame. FTA subsequently  established a performance measure in 2001 of issuing 95 percent of  triennial review reports within 30 days of completing a review. FTA has  significantly improved its performance in issuing reports in recent years.  FTA reported it issued between 82 to 94 percent of triennial review reports  within 30 days of completing the review from fiscal year 2004 through  2008. During that same time period, only 2 of 902 reports were issued more  than 60 days after the review.", "Finally, FTA has looked for ways to continuously improve by contracting  with Booz Allen Hamilton to examine its oversight review processes and  recommend ways to improve them. In January 2008, Booz Allen Hamilton  issued its final report, outlining four areas of improvement: program  planning, program execution, program evaluation, and change  management. We found that FTA is taking steps to respond to  recommendations in these areas, including developing a strategic  approach for prioritizing each of the Booz Allen Hamilton  recommendations and developing a Web-based, master calendar feature in  OTRAK that is expected to improve the visibility of future oversight review  schedules to assist both FTA headquarters and regional staff in  coordinating the oversight review schedules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FTA Could Better Ensure and Document that Grantees Receive a Complete Review at Least Once Every Three Years", "paragraphs": ["FTA is required to conduct a complete review and evaluation of grantees\u2019  adherence with statutory and administrative requirements at least once  every three years. In reviewing 198 fiscal year 2008 triennial review  reports, we identified, but could not confirm, 33 instances where FTA may  not have completely reviewed and evaluated grantees in all areas.  Specifically, contractors recorded in the 2008 triennial review reports that  certain areas were \u201cnot reviewed\u201d because FTA had conducted special  oversight reviews on these areas in the prior two years\u2014fiscal years 2006  or 2007.

Because the  area was not reviewed during the 2008 triennial review, these grantees  may not be reviewed in this area for 5 years (this area was last reviewed  during the 2006 special oversight review and will not be reviewed again  until the 2011 triennial review). While FTA\u2019s contractors\u2019 guide describes  the flexibility to not review certain areas, FTA regional office staff  provides triennial review contractors with the approval to not review  certain areas when a special oversight review has been conducted in the  prior two years or is scheduled in the fiscal year of the triennial review.", "FTA officials indicate that their practice is to update its review and  evaluation of an area having an oversight review in the prior two years.  However, the guidance does not always instruct contractors to document  this update in the triennial review reports to help FTA ensure it meets the  statutory requirement of a complete review at least once every three years.  As an example, the contractors\u2019 guide describes such a process for  reviewing and evaluating the planning area, telling contractors to review  previous planning certification review reports during the triennial review  desk review, verify the status of any findings, and determine if corrective  actions have been implemented on schedule.

Specifically, headquarters officials explained  that regional staff and contractors discuss the results of special oversight  reviews conducted in the prior two years, such as any outstanding findings  from the prior reviews, and reach consensus on the extent to which a  grantee would be reviewed in the related area during the triennial review,  ranging from an area not being reviewed at all to a more detailed review in  the area, depending on the situation. However, officials acknowledged that  the results of those discussions are not always documented in the triennial  review reports, especially in regards to the extent to which areas are to be  reviewed or not reviewed during the triennial review. Because of this lack  of documentation, we could not confirm in the 33 instances noted above  whether or to what extent all 23 areas were reviewed and evaluated.", "By allowing flexibility in the contractors\u2019 guide to not review certain areas,  FTA may not be ensuring that all areas are completely reviewed and  evaluated at least once every three years, as required by statute. In  addition, because grantees can and do experience findings during triennial  reviews, despite having special oversight reviews in the prior two years,  updating previously conducted special oversight reviews is important. We  identified seven instances where grantees had received special oversight  reviews in the financial management and civil rights areas in fiscal years  2006 and 2007, yet during the 2008 triennial review, findings in these areas  resurfaced. Finally, proper evaluation and documentation provides future  reviewers with a more transparent audit trail of findings and gives FTA  managers the confidence that grantees were completely reviewed and  evaluated in all 23 areas at least once every three years. Officials plan to  refine and use OTRAK to document, among other things, the results of  special oversight reviews that occurred in the years between triennial  reviews, which would help ensure grantees adhere to requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncoordinated Scheduling of Multiple Oversight Reviews May Unduly Burden Some Grantees", "paragraphs": ["We found a limited number of instances in which grantees may have been  unduly burdened by uncoordinated scheduling of multiple oversight  reviews in the same fiscal year. We found that 23 of 198 grantees (12  percent) receiving a triennial review in fiscal year 2008 also received one  or more special oversight reviews in the same year. Twenty-four of 183  grantees (13 percent) received multiple reviews in fiscal year 2007,  including one medium sized grantee that underwent a special procurement  system review in January 2007, a drug and alcohol program review in  February 2007, and a triennial review in June 2007.  The same grantee  also underwent two special civil rights reviews\u2014an Americans with  Disabilities review in October 2007 and a Disadvantaged Business  Enterprises review in November of 2007.", "One grantee with whom we spoke said that although the triennial review is  beneficial, the multiple oversight reviews it received in the same fiscal  year were burdensome, redundant and delayed project schedules and cost  the grantee about $18,000 to $20,000. Four other grantees provided  information showing they spent about 100 to 300 hours preparing for and  hosting 2- to 3-day triennial reviews involving sometimes over 20  individuals and many departments. Some grantees also said that special  oversight reviews continue for two or more weeks and require even more  grantee time and attention.", "Representatives from the American Public Transportation Association\u2014an  association that represents many grantees\u2014also said that two or more  FTA oversight reviews in the same year could be burdensome. According  to the association representatives and grantees with whom we spoke,  multiple reviews in the same year are especially burdensome for smaller  grantees, whose employees tend to be responsible for multiple review  areas. For example, a small grantee told us that the triennial review alone  taxed its two employees who were responsible for addressing many of the  areas in the triennial review. Large grantees, on the other hand, typically  have several employees in a division responsible for one triennial review  area, so the burden of multiple reviews may be less taxing for them than  for small grantees.", "The decision-making body responsible for developing and coordinating  FTA\u2019s oversight review schedules is the Oversight Review Council; but,  according to FTA officials, the Oversight Review Council is not fulfilling  these responsibilities, as it was inactive on and off in recent years because  of management changes and priorities. FTA Order 5400.1 requires the  Oversight Review Council to develop and coordinate various oversight  review schedules to avoid unnecessary duplication and overlap, among  other things. The Council was reinstituted in 2007 after management  changes, and continues to redefine its roles and responsibilities. Further,  FTA is aware of the burden oversight reviews place on grantees and works  to limit this burden.", "Without the Oversight Review Council taking responsibility for developing  and coordinating oversight review schedules, FTA offices developed their  own oversight processes, which, in some instances, could lead to grantees  receiving a triennial review and a special review in the same fiscal year.  For example:    FTA\u2019s goal is to conduct special procurement reviews every three years on  the 30 grantees that receive large amounts of federal transit funds.", "The Offices of Civil Rights and Safety and Security conduct their own  special oversight reviews, including reviews of grantees that have had civil  rights complaints filed against them. According to officials from the Civil  Rights office, after notifying the regions and others of the schedules, the  regions are to notify headquarters about any scheduling conflicts.", "The drug and alcohol review schedules are sometimes made without  informing regional staff because this information is sensitive.", "Other FTA officials who conduct special oversight reviews enter their  scheduled review date of grantees in OTRAK. However, regional staff said  they are sometimes not aware of special review scheduling.", "In receiving urban area formula funds, grantees agree to the  congressionally-mandated triennial review at least once every three years.  Some grantees are subject to other FTA oversight reviews. Having an  effective body to coordinate the strategic planning of special oversight  reviews, in coordination with the triennial review, could help increase  FTA\u2019s oversight coverage of grantees, while at the same time, minimize the  undue burden of uncoordinated multiple oversight reviews on some  grantees. FTA\u2019s new Web-based, master calendar feature in OTRAK is  expected to improve the visibility of future oversight review schedules."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FTA\u2019s Two Triennial Review Performance Measures Meet Some, But Not All Key Attributes of Successful Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["FTA established two performance measures to assess timeliness of steps  in the triennial review program: (1) 80 percent of triennial review findings  are to be closed within 30 days of their due date (\u201cClose Findings Timely\u201d);  and (2) 95 percent of the final triennial review reports are to be issued  within 30 days of the completion of the review (\u201cIssue Reports Timely\u201d).  While these measures meet some, they do not meet all key attributes of  successful measures, as described in our past work on the Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993. Further, FTA lacks performance  measures that assess other core elements of FTA\u2019s triennial review  program, including the outcome and quality of the reviews. FTA officials  recognize the limits of their current performance measures and have  begun efforts to enhance them. Table 3 summarizes the 9 key attributes we  used to analyze FTA\u2019s performance measures.", "Figure 6 compares FTA\u2019s triennial review performance measures to these  key attributes, showing that they meet some but not all attributes. Both  measures meet 4 of 9 attributes; that is, they link to agency goals, provide  a measurable target, are clear, and have limited overlap with other  measures. The Issue Reports Timely measure meets 2 additional attributes  by demonstrating objectivity and reliability.", "Linkage. We found FTA\u2019s two triennial review performance measures link  throughout the organization\u2014from FTA regional offices, through  headquarters, and to the department level. Both performance measures  aligned with the Department of Transportation\u2019s strategic goal of  organizational excellence in the FTA Annual Performance Plan, FTA  regional business and strategic plans, and individual performance  appraisals. In addition, FTA officials\u2014including officials in the  Performance Management Division, the Office of Program Management,  and all 10 regional offices\u2014confirmed in interviews that performance  goals were communicated across the agency. Such communication is  important to ensure FTA officials understand what the organization is  trying to achieve and the goals it seeks to reach.", "Measurable target. Both performance measures also have measurable  numeric targets\u2014given in percentages\u2014that allow FTA officials to easily  assess whether overall goals and objectives were achieved. Numeric  targets facilitate assessments of whether objectives were achieved  because comparisons can be easily made between projected performance  and actual results. FTA reports meeting the Close Findings Timely  measure in fiscal years 2004 through 2007; and in fiscal year 2008, closed  74 percent of findings within 30 days. Although FTA reports never meeting  the Issue Reports Timely measure in fiscal years 2004 through 2008, it has  greatly improved the timeliness with which it issues triennial review  reports. From fiscal years 2004 through 2008, FTA nearly met its goals in 4  of the 5 years.", "Clarity. We found the performance measures are clearly stated and each  has a definition that is consistent with the methodology used to calculate  it. The Issue Reports Timely formula is the percentage of reports issued  within 30 days of the final conduct of the review, and the Close Findings  Timely formula is the number of findings closed within 30 days of the due  date, divided by the sum of the number of findings closed plus the number  of findings open that are 30 days past the due date. Clear measures provide  transparency and allow managers to accurately assess FTA\u2019s performance  in issuing triennial review reports and closing findings in a timely manner.", "Limited overlap. Both program performance measures have unique  names, definitions, and do not overlap. One measure evaluates the  timeliness of issuing reports, while the other assesses the timeliness of  closing findings. The presence of distinct performance measures prevent  managers from sifting through unnecessary or redundant information.", "Objectivity. We found the Issue Reports Timely measure is objective  because the data elements used to calculate it are free from significant  bias. However, our analysis of the Close Findings Timely measure found  that its objectivity is limited because decisions to close findings, establish  due dates for when grantees must address findings, and extend, if  necessary, any due dates, is done largely at the discretion of regional staff,  in consultation with grantees, and, when appropriate, headquarters  officials. This presents opportunities to influence this measure because  regional staff may use different criteria for when to close or extend  deadlines. While FTA officials recently met to discuss a mandatory  process to uniformly close findings across all FTA regions, the current  lack of criteria reduces the transparency of FTA\u2019s performance in closing  findings. For example, an FTA official stated that the Closing Findings  Timely performance measure could result in the unintended consequence  of prematurely closing findings. The annual performance appraisals and  resulting compensation for regional staff, including the Regional  Administrators, are based, in part, on meeting the Close Finding Timely  performance measure. While we did not find widespread instances when  findings were prematurely closed, an official from the civil rights office  stated there have been cases when regional staff closed triennial review  findings in OTRAK and requested that the civil rights office monitor the  grantees\u2019 progress in resolving them.", "Reliability. We found the Issue Reports Timely measure is reliable, as FTA  has standard procedures for collecting data, and based on our examination  of individual triennial review reports, accurately stated the number of  reports issued in the most recent end of year report for fiscal year 2008.  However, our analysis of data used to calculate the Close Finding Timely  performance measure found data inaccuracies and, therefore, the measure  does not meet the key attribute of reliability. After examining closed  findings data we found several instances where OTRAK reported findings  open more than seven years after they were due for closure. FTA officials  familiar with the database said that these inaccuracies resulted from FTA  regional staff not entering data into OTRAK after the transition to the new  Web-based information system in 2003 and said, but could not document,  that the findings were likely closed. However, we also found OTRAK data  entry errors from fiscal years 2005 through 2007\u2014after FTA had  transitioned to the Web-based system\u2014where the database showed almost  200 findings were open more then one year after they were due for  closure. Headquarters officials said, but could not document, that these  findings are inaccurately listed as open in OTRAK and were likely closed  at the regional level. Officials further stated they plan to re-examine the  regional process for closing findings and issue guidance to improve this  process. Finally, the 2008 Booz Allen Hamilton report noted instances of  missing data in OTRAK because some regions were using stand alone  spreadsheets instead of fully using the database to report closing  findings. Officials acknowledged that entering closed findings data into  the database can be problematic, especially for inexperienced regional  staff not familiar with OTRAK. Officials believe that a 2007 decision to tie  regional staff performance appraisals to data entered into OTRAK should  provide an incentive to ensure future data are reliable. In addition, officials  said they are emphasizing the importance of recording data into OTRAK to  regional offices and contractors. Without reliable data, FTA managers  cannot be confident in the extent to which performance goals have been  achieved, including the timeliness in closing findings.", "Core program activities. Both triennial review performance measures do  not meet the triennial review program\u2019s core program activity, evaluating  whether grantees meet federal requirements over time. While FTA\u2019s  existing performance measure of Close Findings Timely may increase  adherence to federal requirements by encouraging grantees to address  findings, it does not provide an overall program level assessment of  grantees\u2019 performance over time. In addition, FTA measures annual  grantee compliance information in Triennial Review Program end-of-year  reports, but has not developed performance measures that set targets to  evaluate progress. Therefore, FTA does not assess whether the triennial  review program is increasing grantees\u2019 ability to continuously meet federal  requirements. FTA could measure the core program activity of the  triennial review program in various ways, such as assessing grantees\u2019  performance at the end of each review year or assessing grantees\u2019 long  term performance, as our previous analysis of findings data shows. See  figure 3.", "Governmentwide priorities. FTA\u2019s current performance measures  partially address governmentwide priorities by ensuring that FTA reports  on its timeliness in conducting reviews and in addressing corrective  actions. However, the measures do not evaluate other governmentwide  priorities, including the outcome of the reviews\u2014the extent to which  grantees are meeting federal requirements, or the quality of the triennial  reviews.", "Outcome. The performance measures assess the output of the triennial  review program\u2014the closing of findings and issuing of final reports\u2014 but, not the outcome\u2014grantees\u2019 ability to meet federal requirements.  As previously stated in the discussion of core program activities,  outcome performance measures\u2014such as grantees\u2019 performance over  time, or annual progress against a measurable target\u2014can help  evaluate the results of the triennial review programs. Without such a  measure, FTA is limited in the extent to which it can effectively  ascertain and document the extent to which the triennial review  program is improving grantees\u2019 performance in meeting federal  requirements and FTA managers have limited information on program  performance, making the possibility of achieving program goals less  likely.", "Quality. FTA has no performance measures for assessing the quality of  the triennial review program. FTA officials help ensure quality by  checking triennial review reports to determine whether the  contractors made reasonable findings for grantees, determining what  actions grantees must take to resolve findings, and attending some site  visits to oversee contractors. However, FTA officials are unsure how  to develop a measure for evaluating the quality of the triennial review  program. In addition, Booz Allen Hamilton reported that FTA  headquarters and field staff do not have a common understanding of  what constitutes a quality review or how it could be measured.  Without common quality standards, FTA cannot evaluate the overall  quality of the program nor ensure the results and objectives of the  triennial review program are being met. Performance measures related  to quality could assess the implementation of triennial reviews,  including a way to oversee contractors and test the overall quality of  reviews. Many federal agencies periodically review their programs to  ensure they meet quality standards. FTA officials recognize the  benefits of such performance measures and plan to enhance its current  measures and standards to assess the quality and value added of the  triennial review program to help ensure that the results and objectives  of the triennial review program are being met.", "Balance. FTA\u2019s triennial review program performance measures address  only one of three governmentwide priorities and, therefore, are not  balanced\u2014an attribute that applies to the overall suite of measures, rather  than the measures individually. Balanced performance measures allow  managers to understand what other triennial review aspects are working  well and why. Adding outcome and quality performance measures will  help balance the existing timeliness measures and could allow managers  to better set triennial review priorities by not overemphasizing one or two  priorities at the expense of others. FTA officials recognize current  performance measures do not assess some aspects of the triennial review  program and are undertaking efforts to enhance them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Strong FTA oversight of federal surface transportation grant programs  helps ensure that grantees meet federal requirements, provide safe public  transportation, and safeguard from misuse the billions of dollars that  Congress appropriated for surface transportation programs to help  America recover from the economic downturn and the billions more that  Congress plans to reauthorize for surface transportation. FTA\u2019s efforts  over the past decade to improve the congressionally-mandated triennial  review\u2014the primary means for overseeing hundreds of grantees\u2014have  produced concrete results. For example, FTA now regularly collects  oversight data on grantees, issues the vast majority of triennial review  reports within 30 days of the review (a significant improvement since our  last report in 1998), and provides grantees with technical assistance to  address problem areas. Nonetheless, FTA should undertake additional  efforts to further improve the triennial review program.", "Although one of the goals of the triennial review program is to assist  grantees in meeting more federal requirements over time, our analysis of  OTRAK data shows many grantees with mixed success in reducing their  numbers of findings over three triennial reviews from fiscal years 2000  through 2008; and 17 percent of the grantees we reviewed met fewer  federal requirements in their latest triennial review than they did in their  two previous reviews. While FTA analyzes apparent problem areas, its  analysis does not provide information on the underlying causes of findings  and information on the level of severity for each finding. Without  conducting further analyses of its OTRAK data and better understanding  the underlying causes of grantees\u2019 performance in triennial reviews, FTA  may be missing valuable opportunities to increase its effectiveness in  helping grantees improve their performance.", "The triennial review process could be improved in two respects. First,  when a grantee has recently received or is scheduled to receive a special  oversight review, the flexibility currently allowed in the contractors\u2019 guide  could lead to confusion about how to document that all 23 triennial review  areas are completely reviewed at least once every three years. Until FTA  revises its guidance to remove the \u201cnot reviewed\u201d category, require an  updated evaluation of areas reviewed in the prior two years of the triennial  review, and describe how to document triennial review reports with the  updates, FTA does not provide assurance that grantees are being assessed  equally and are receiving a complete review and evaluation at least once  every three years, as required. Second, until the Oversight Review Council  performs its role as oversight review coordinator or delegates this role to  another FTA body, uncoordinated, multiple oversight reviews may not  effectively increase FTA\u2019s coverage of grantees and may place undue  burden on a few grantees.", "Finally, although FTA\u2019s two triennial review performance measures meet  some of the key attributes we have previously reported are necessary for a  successful program, the Close Findings Timely measure could be  improved to minimize the possibility for manipulation and increase the  reliability of closed finding data. Without an internal control process to  verify whether grantees have satisfactorily resolved findings, FTA cannot  determine the validity of reported results for the Close Findings Timely  performance measure. Without reliable data, FTA may be unable to  determine the validity of reported results and make appropriate decisions.  FTA also lacks performance measures for evaluating the outcome and  quality of the triennial review program. Such performance measures are  essential because they can help decision makers determine areas for  improvement and increase the likelihood of achieving program goals, such  as increasing the number of grantees that meet federal requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To support the triennial review program\u2019s goal of having grantees  consistently meet more federal requirements, the Secretary of  Transportation should direct the FTA Administrator:  1.

As part of this  analysis, FTA should consider and identify, when necessary: (1) high  performing grantees and their management practices, among other  things; (2) the areas in which problem findings occur, and the  underlying causes of these findings; and (3) the level of severity for  each finding. 2.  To help ensure that a complete performance review and evaluation of  each grantee is conducted at least once every three years, in  accordance with the statutory requirement, revise the contractors\u2019  guide to remove the \u201cnot reviewed\u201d category, require an updated  evaluation of areas reviewed in the prior two years of the triennial  review, and describe how contractors should document the triennial  review reports with updates to other reviews, such as special oversight  reviews conducted in the prior two years. 3.

Documents  included a system description, requirements, and background; reference  guides; data entry controls and processes; data dictionary; deficiency  codes; and the users\u2019 manual. We requested and obtained OTRAK findings  data by grantee and by area from fiscal years 2000 through 2008. Data prior  to 2000 was not available. We sorted the data to, among other things,  determine the extent to which grantees\u2019 performance in meeting federal  requirements increased, decreased, both increased and decreased, or  remained constant in three triennial reviews; which grantees averaged  fewer than two findings in their triennial reviews; and which areas  accounted for the greatest numbers of findings. We did not have direct  access to the OTRAK database, but took several steps to assess the  reliability of the data. We performed electronic testing to identify missing  data, obtained and reviewed the queries that FTA used to generate the  data that we requested, and discussed with FTA and its OTRAK  contractors the results of the information. Based on these tests, we  excluded 150 grantees because they did not meet our criteria, having  exactly three triennial reviews in the last nine years and excluded 27 other  grantees because, according to FTA officials, they received triennial  reviews for multiple triennial review cycles, more than 3 fiscal years, or  both as a result of triennial reviews that were either canceled or closed  without findings.", "To address the strengths and weaknesses of the triennial review process,  we reviewed federal guidance for improving grant accountability, federal  internal control standards, GAO reports on performance measures, FTA  Order 5400.1, triennial review reports of numerous grantees, and a 2008  Booz Allen Hamilton report of FTA\u2019s oversight programs.

In addition, we examined  specific areas reviewed or not reviewed during fiscal years 2007 and 2008  triennial review reports and compared the areas to completed or planned  special oversight reviews.
