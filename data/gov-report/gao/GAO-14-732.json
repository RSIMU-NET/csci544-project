Some partnerships create tiers of partnerships with hundreds of thousands of partners. Tiered large partnerships are challenging for IRS to audit because tracing income through the tiers to the ultimate partners is complex.", "GAO was asked to assess IRS's ability to audit large partnerships. GAO's objectives include: 1) determine what IRS knows about the number and characteristics of large partnerships, 2) assess IRS's ability to audit them, and 3) assess IRS's efforts to address the audit challenges. GAO analyzed IRS data from 2002 to 2011 and IRS audit documentation, interviewed IRS officials, met with IRS auditors in six focus groups, and interviewed private sector tax lawyers knowledgeable about partnerships."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of large partnerships has more than tripled to 10,099 from tax year 2002 to 2011.

Most audits resulted in no change to the partnership's return and the aggregate change was small. Although internal control standards call for information about effective resource use, IRS has not defined what constitutes a large partnership and does not have codes to track these audits. According to IRS auditors, the audit results may be due to challenges such as finding the sources of income within multiple tiers while meeting the administrative tasks required by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) within specified time frames. For example, IRS auditors said that it can sometimes take months to identify the partner that represents the partnership in the audit, reducing time available to conduct the audit. TEFRA does not require large partnerships to identify this partner on tax returns. Also under TEFRA, unless the partnership elects to be taxed at the entity level (which few do), IRS must pass audit adjustments through to the ultimate partners. IRS officials stated that the process of determining each partner's share of the adjustment is paper and labor intensive. When hundreds of partners' returns have to be adjusted, the costs involved limit the number of audits IRS can conduct. Adjusting the partnership return instead of the partners' returns would reduce these costs but, without legislative action, IRS's ability to do so is limited.", "Note: A 3-year statute of limitations governs the time IRS has to conduct partnership audits, which is about equally split between the time from when a return is received until the audit begins and the time to do the audit. IRS then has a year to assess the partners their portion of the audit adjustment.", "IRS has initiated three projects\u2014one of which is under development\u2014to make large partnership audit procedures more efficient, such as identifying higher risk returns to audit. However, the two projects implemented were not developed in line with project planning principles. For example, they do not have clear and measurable goals or a method for determining results. As a consequence, IRS may not be able to tell whether the projects succeed in increasing audit efficiency."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider requiring large partnerships to identify a partner to represent them during audits and to pay taxes on audit adjustments at the partnership level.

A 3-year statute of limitations governs the time in which IRS  must complete its audits of partnerships, which begins on the due date of  the return or date of return filing, whichever is later. IRS on average takes  about 18 months after a large partnership return is received until the audit  is started, leaving another 18 months to actually conduct an audit, as  illustrated in figure 8.

The burden of doing so falls  largely on IRS, taking time and effort away from doing the actual audit  work. For example, TEFRA does not require partnerships to designate a  TMP on their returns. In addition, TEFRA allows the TMP to be an entity,  not a person. In either case, IRS auditors spend time requesting that the  partnership designate a TMP or tracking down an actual person to act as  a representative for the TMP\u2014unless the partnership chose to list that  person on the Form 1065.

The entities will use this tactic as a first line of defense  against an audit.", "If a large partnership does not designate a TMP on the partnership return,  IRS will provide the partnership the opportunity to do so.  If the  partnership does not, TEFRA requires that the partner with the largest  profit interest automatically becomes the TMP. However, if IRS  determines that it is impracticable to apply this rule, then IRS may  designate the TMP.before giving the partnership an opportunity to designate a TMP because  the IRS designation may be opposed by the partners and IRS needs to  collect information to find a partner that meets the criteria. As a  consequence, exercising this authority can still mean that the start of  audit is delayed. However, if IRS were to move directly to the largest  profit interest rule or chose to designate the TMP using its existing  authority instead of reaching out to the partnership, IRS could save  valuable time during the average 18-month window it has to completes  the audit. IRS does not track data on the time spent identifying the TMP.  Focus group participants said that identifying and qualifying the  designated TMP could take weeks or months. Losing a few months from  the 18 months to audit a large partnership could be significant to IRS field  auditors.", "IRS officials said that they are hesitant to do so  IRS officials said IRS has issued new job aids and training on identifying  the TMP, clarified TMP requirements, and added a section about TEFRA  in the December 2013 revision of IRS Publication 541, Partnerships.  However, these steps do not solve the fundamental problem of limited  audit time being lost while identifying a TMP. A legislative change to  TEFRA requiring all large partnerships to designate a TMP on their tax  returns and to provide updated TMP information to IRS once an audit  starts would solve the problem. Without such a change, IRS\u2019s field audits  of large partnerships are inefficient which hinders its ability to fulfill its  mission of ensuring tax law compliance. The costs of such a legislative  change should be low. There would be no increased costs to IRS\u2014the  change would reduce IRS\u2019s costs.

This limits the number of  large partnerships that IRS can audit. Furthermore, since IRS generally  has one year after the 3-year statute of limitations ends to pass through  adjustments, the campus has to start linking returns before it knows  whether there will be an audit adjustment or whether an adjustment will  be large enough to merit passing through. In a large partnership, dividing  the adjustment among hundreds or thousands of partners may result in  amounts that are so small that IRS deems them not worth the cost to  pass through. IRS officials said that they do not track how often the audit  adjustments are not passed through and how much unpaid tax is not  collected as a result. IRS campus officials estimated that they close  50,000 to 60,000 returns for all partnerships each year and further  estimated that 65 to 70 percent of these are closed without passing  through any adjustment.", "IRC \u00a7 704(b) provides partnerships the option to use special allocations. They are  generally listed in the partnership agreement that specifies such things as the  partnership\u2019s name and purpose, partner contributions, and management responsibilities.  The agreement is to specify ratios for passing through partnership income, losses,  deductions, and credits to the partners. information systems. IRS has requested funding in its fiscal year 2014  and 2015 budget proposals for an updated information system that would  allow it to automate the linking process and collect more robust data but  funding has not been approved.", "Large Partnerships May Pay Tax on Audit Adjustments Rather Than  Pass Them Through to the Partners but Such Payments are Not  Widely Used  Current law allows large partnerships to pay a tax owed as determined by  audit adjustments at the entity level rather than passing the adjustments  through to partners, which would avoid all the costs of campus audits.  This is allowed under both the Electing Large Partnership (ELP) audit  procedures and under IRS procedures for closing audits with what is  called a closing agreement. However, few large partnerships elect to  become an ELP. Further, partnerships must voluntarily agree to use a  closing agreement to pay a tax at the entity level and few do so.", "The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and  Means and the Administration have also put forth proposals to address  some of the challenges of auditing large partnerships. While the  proposals differ somewhat and apply to partnerships with different  numbers of partners, both would allow IRS to collect tax at the  partnership level instead of having to pass it through to the taxable  partners. For example, the Administration developed a legislative  proposal to make the ELP audit procedures mandatory for partnerships  with 1,000 or more direct and indirect partners, known as the Required  Large Partnership proposal. IRS officials said that these legislative  proposals, if passed, would significantly help address challenges involved  with passing through audit adjustments.", "These proposals would involve tradeoffs and decisions about how to treat  partners. For example, because the partners may be taxed at different tax  rates, the single tax rate applied to the net audit adjustment at the  partnership level may be different than the rate partners would pay if the  adjustment was passed through.", "IRS Field Auditors Face Barriers Accessing Timely Support and  Training to Address Complexities  IRS focus group participants stated that they do not have the needed  level of timely support from IRS counsel, TEFRA coordinators, and  specialists. Focus group participants said that the support is critical  because they had limited knowledge of the technical tax issues for  partnerships and they may only work on a partnership audit once every  few years. Further, focus group participants stated that it can take weeks  or months to get needed input and planning audits is difficult because  they do not know how long it will take to get the needed stakeholder input.  Unexpected delays reduce the average18-month window of time for audit  work.", "Focus group participants said that some IRS locations have only one  TEFRA coordinator to answer questions about partnership audits. For  example, IRS has one TEFRA coordinator to support all audits in New  York State. IRS officials said that the number of TEFRA coordinators  declined from 28 in fiscal year 2006 to 20 in May 2014 while workload  increased. One IRS official said that TEFRA coordinators have to respond  to requests for assistance and review and process TEFRA audits for  partnerships of all sizes, not only large partnerships. IRS officials said that  they plan to hire two coordinators in fiscal year 2014 and five in fiscal year  2015.", "IRS counsel officials told us that they believe that the number of delayed  responses is fairly low, in contrast to what focus group participants said,  and IRS counsel strives to process all requests for legal advice within 45  days of receipt. However, IRS counsel officials said that they do not track  the number of requests for large partnership audits; if known, the  response time would help IRS auditors to plan their audit work. Such a  change would be in line with IRS\u2019s strategic plan, which has a strategic  objective on utilizing data to make timely, informed decisions.", "In addition to help from stakeholders, IRS focus groups participants told  us that they have trouble accessing refresher courses on TEFRA and  partnership tax issues. IRS officials told us that IRS field auditors may not  understand that such training is available and can be taken with the  permission of their supervisors. They also said that such training is not  usually mandatory and some auditors may choose to not take it. Ensuring  IRS auditors have access to training would be in line with IRS\u2019s current  strategic plan, which highlights the importance of building a talented  workforce.

However, the relatively low  rate at which IRS audits large partnerships and the minimal results  achieved raise concerns about IRS\u2019s ability to ensure the tax compliance  of large partnerships. IRS has little data available to know why its audits  are finding so little tax noncompliance. That is because IRS has not  consistently defined \u201clarge partnership\u201d\u2014accounting for both the number  of partners and amount of assets\u2014and devised a related coding system  to track any audit results. Without such data, IRS cannot conduct analysis  to identify ways to better plan and use IRS resources in auditing large  partnerships as well as analyze whether large partnerships present a high  noncompliance risk.", "Without the data, testimonial evidence from IRS auditors indicates that  they feel challenged to audit complicated partnerships for compliance  without sufficient time and support. Existing audit procedures set in law  and in IRS regulations add to the time pressures and constrain IRS  auditors. Because so little is currently known about large partnership  noncompliance, it would be premature to try to design overall, long-term  solutions. An incremental approach could be based on what is currently  known, including legislative changes that Congress should consider as  well as actions that IRS should take.", "Legislative changes could help IRS auditors deal with the time constraints  and reduce the resource demands of large partnership audits. Requiring  large partnerships to designate a qualified TMP that the field auditors can  contact is a relatively simple step that could reduce audit delays.  Requiring large partnerships to pay any tax due at the entity level would  also save resources but would not be a simple change. Such a change  would have differing impacts on partners who may be in different tax  brackets. The change would save the resources that are now devoted to  the paper driven, labor intensive process of passing adjustments through  to large numbers of partners. Paying taxes due on audit adjustments at  the entity level has advantages over other options for audit efficiency  gains such as automating the current paper driven process. Even if IRS  was given resources to modernize its campus information systems, parts  of the adjustment pass-through process would continue to require labor  intensive reviews of partnership agreements.", "IRS can take several actions that would begin to provide better  information about large partnership compliance and audit results, or that  could lower audit costs. Actions that would be a first step towards better  information for analyzing large partnership compliance include developing  a consistent definition of a large partnership along with activity codes that  could be used to track audit results. To lower audit costs and avoid  wasting audit staff time, IRS could change its practice governing when to  use its authority to select a TMP, and the regulation which established the  number of days an audit can be open without triggering more costly  closing procedures. IRS could also better ensure that limited calendar  time is not wasted in an audit. It could do so by tracking delays in  providing expert support, clarify when auditors can expect such support,  and then use this information about the support that can realistically be  provided to better plan the number and scope of new audits, so that the  time allowed under the statute of limitations is more effectively used.", "While IRS has initiated three projects to improve its audit procedures, it  has not followed project planning principles, including taking the steps  needed to effectively track the results for the two projects that have been  implemented.
