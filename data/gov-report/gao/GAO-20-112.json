This national emergency results in part from the activities of international narcotics traffickers and their organizations. The Kingpin Act, enacted in 1999, allows Treasury to designate and sanction individuals and entities that contribute to illicit narcotics trafficking. Sanctions and other consequences include blocking a designee's property and assets, denying U.S. travel visas to designees, and penalizing U.S. persons who violate the prohibitions in the Kingpin Act.

Federal Banking Agencies monitor the OFAC compliance programs of U.S. banks through regular bank examinations. Additionally, OFAC handles enforcement through warnings, monetary penalties, and other methods. As required, OFAC reports annually to Congress on Kingpin Act designations and corresponding agency expenditures, but it has provided limited guidance to partner agencies on expenditure data they report. As a result, agencies use different methods to calculate the personnel and resource costs associated with their Kingpin activities. For example, the Department of Homeland Security said it only reports personnel expenditures when it is the lead investigative agency, but the Department of Defense reports personnel expenditures when it is not the lead. Furthermore, OFAC has not reported the limitations in agency data in its congressional reports. This lack of clear expenditure information could hinder oversight of the Kingpin Act.", "OFAC officials noted challenges to assessing the overall effectiveness of the Kingpin Act, but they and their U.S. and international partners track and report a range of results. The primary challenge cited is the difficulty of isolating the effect of the Kingpin Act from multiple other programs combating drug trafficking organizations. Results reported by OFAC and its partners include, for example, from 2000-2019, OFAC reported that it had designated more than 2,000 Kingpins and their supporters, and frozen more than half a billion dollars in assets under the act.

This process allows OFAC to coordinate its  investigations and designations with U.S. partner agencies and foreign  governments. (See fig. 2.) We determined the designation process  through interviews with OFAC and partner agency officials, and selected  nine cases to review the implementation of the designation process.", "OFAC\u2019s Kingpin Act designation process includes the following six steps:  1.  Identify potential targets. OFAC first identifies potential targets for  investigation and Kingpin Act designation. OFAC\u2019s partner agencies  can submit recommendations for potential targets. According to OFAC  officials, they consider information provided about potential Tier 1  targets from the recommending agency, such as whether the targets  are on the U.S. multiagency list of priority drug trafficking targets,  what unique identifiers the recommending agency can provide to  minimize the chance of investigating the wrong target, and which  drug(s) and quantities the targets traffic and to which markets.  Additionally, OFAC considers (1) the likelihood that the target would  meet the legal criteria for designation and have an impact, (2) the  expectation that designation would complement rather than hinder law  enforcement and foreign counterpart investigations and operations,  (3) any unintended negative consequences on third parties, and (4)  the current availability of OFAC resources. According to OFAC  officials, Tier 2 targets are generally identified as part of the  investigation of a Tier 1 target or designee. Officials said the decision  to pursue designation depends on whether there is sufficient evidence  to demonstrate that the target satisfies the designation criteria in the  act. As early as at this step, but at some point before designation,  OFAC coordinates with partner agencies to ensure that they do not  have an ongoing investigation or other diplomatic interactions that will  be adversely affected by a Kingpin Act designation.  2.  Gather evidence. OFAC gathers evidence on the identified target to  determine whether it meets the criteria for identification or designation  and whether there is a network associated with the target. OFAC  requests information on the target from other partner agencies.  According to OFAC officials, they do not request information from all  of OFAC\u2019s partner agencies during the investigation of each target if  they deem the information provided by a subset of the partner  agencies to be sufficient evidence. OFAC also conducts its own  research and uses all sources\u2014including public and classified\u2014to  develop an evidentiary package. OFAC works with partner agency  headquarters, and domestic and international field offices (as needed  for each case) to collect information on either a person\u2019s drug  trafficking activities or activities that support drug trafficking  organizations. OFAC and partner agency officials said they also  collect information about targets from their foreign government  partners and counterparts, as appropriate. OFAC also ensures that  the derogatory information collected is linked to the target and not, for  example, another person with the same name.  3.  Assemble evidentiary package. OFAC compiles the collected  information into an evidentiary package maintained in its electronic  case management system. According to OFAC officials, the case  management system documents the date when each step is  completed and contains sign off by an approving official. In addition,  OFAC officials said the case management system contains a  summary of the evidence OFAC gathered to justify designating an  individual or entity, and links to the source documents provided by  partner agencies. Because the information in the evidentiary package  may be sensitive, classified, and compiled from multiple sources,  OFAC typically does not share the evidentiary packages with its  partner agencies, with the exception of DOJ for legal review purposes.  However, under certain circumstances, OFAC may allow partner  agencies to review portions of an evidentiary package after ensuring  that there is a specific need to know and that there is adherence to  rules for disclosure to another agency.  4.  Legal review. OFAC provides the evidentiary package first to  Treasury\u2019s Office of General Counsel and then to DOJ\u2019s Civil Division  for legal review. Treasury\u2019s Office of General Counsel reviews the  package for legal sufficiency, while DOJ assesses the risks  associated with potential future litigation resulting from the  identification or designation. According to OFAC and DOJ officials,  attorneys often seek clarification or additional evidence from OFAC at  this stage. In those cases where Treasury\u2019s Office of General Counsel  deems the basis for designation or identification to be legally sufficient  and DOJ determines that the identification or designation presents an  acceptable level of litigation risk, they give OFAC clearance to finalize  the evidentiary package and proceed with the action.  5.  Consult with partner agencies. Once the evidentiary package  passes legal sufficiency, OFAC consults with all of its partner  agencies to obtain concurrence. OFAC presents the names of  individuals or entities it has decided to designate and a high-level  summary of the reasons for designation to its partner agencies for  final consultation and concurrence. According to officials from each of  the partner agencies, this allows them the opportunity to identify if  OFAC\u2019s plan to designate a target will damage any of their operations  or ongoing investigations or cause unacceptable damage to  diplomatic relations with the host government in the country where the  target resides or maintains citizenship. This consultation phase also  allows for OFAC and other Treasury offices, such as the Office of  Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes (TFFC), as well as partner  agencies to develop an engagement plan for outreach with relevant  parties, including foreign governments and the press, as appropriate.  While partner agencies at the U.S. embassy in the country of the  proposed designation are given the opportunity to concur with OFAC\u2019s  decision to designate, agency representatives in headquarters give  final agency concurrence. OFAC does not designate anyone unless  all partner agencies concur. If an agency tells OFAC at any point  during the process that designating a target would damage the  agency\u2019s investigation or operations, OFAC officials said they  coordinate with the partner agency to determine how to proceed. For  example, OFAC may delay the Kingpin Act designation until the  partner agency has completed its investigation and can take  simultaneous action against the target.  6.  Designate the target(s). If all partner agencies concur with OFAC\u2019s  designation proposal, OFAC takes action to identify the Kingpins and  designate any affiliated targets. The evidentiary package is provided  to the OFAC Director who, if concurring with the designation, signs a  memorandum that identifies or designates the targets. At this time,  OFAC also adds the individuals and entities to the SDN List. OFAC  announces the actions publicly and records them in the Federal  Register. Figure 3 provides an example of an OFAC announcement of  a Kingpin Act designation. According to Treasury officials, OFAC also  coordinates with other Treasury offices and partner agencies at  headquarters and U.S. embassies to execute an outreach and  engagement plan. Once OFAC has taken these steps, it begins to  monitor and enforce compliance with the sanctions it imposes against  Kingpin Act designees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Flexibility in Designation Process Allows OFAC to Coordinate with Partner Agencies and Foreign Governments", "paragraphs": ["OFAC and U.S. partner agency officials said flexibility built into the  process can affect the length of time it takes to investigate a target and  the sequence of steps taken. For example, OFAC\u2019s coordination with  multiple U.S. partner agencies and foreign governments throughout the  process may influence the sequence of steps taken. In addition, drug  traffickers often change their organizations and operations in an attempt  to evade investigators, which can contribute to the length of time to  complete an investigation. According to OFAC officials, the process is  intended to ensure that: designations do not jeopardize other agencies\u2019 ongoing investigations,", "OFAC\u2019s actions are coordinated with other planned civil or criminal  actions against each target to maximize the disruption to the drug  trafficking organization, and  investigators can collect sufficient evidence to designate targets  despite targets\u2019 constantly changing efforts to evade detection.", "Coordination with partner agencies. Multiple U.S. agencies may have  concurrent investigations of a Kingpin Act target, requiring coordination  between OFAC and U.S. partner agencies to include decisions about how  sharing information could affect their own investigations. When agencies  withhold information about a target to ensure that their own investigation  of the target is not compromised, it may take longer for OFAC to develop  an evidentiary package that satisfies the Kingpin Act\u2019s designation  criteria. In addition, the length of the designation process and the  sequence of steps also depend on how far along other agencies\u2019  investigations of a target are. For example, if a law enforcement agency is  able to provide enough evidence when the potential target is first  identified and OFAC officials think little additional investigation is needed  to further develop an evidentiary package, they may complete more than  one of the designation steps concurrently in order to designate the target  as quickly as possible. According to OFAC and partner agency officials,  the coordination allows them to agree to and plan the civil and criminal  actions to be taken to maximize the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to disrupt  the drug trafficking organization.", "Coordination with foreign government officials. According to OFAC  and U.S. partner agency officials at headquarters, in Mexico, and in  Colombia, foreign government officials determine whether to share  derogatory information about Kingpin Act targets on a case-by-case  basis. OFAC and partner agency officials in Colombia credited host  government information sharing as a primary factor in OFAC\u2019s ability to  complete evidentiary packages for Colombian targets and one reason  why OFAC has been able to investigate and designate more individuals  and entities in Colombia than in other countries. Coordination with  foreign partners also allows OFAC to time designations strategically to  coincide with civil and criminal actions against the target by foreign  governments. For example, on May 17, 2019, the Under Secretary for  TFI and a Mexican government official announced coordinated,  sanctions-related actions. The Under Secretary announced the Kingpin  Act designation of seven individuals and six entities affiliated with the  Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG) and its close ally, the Los  Cuinis drug trafficking organizations. Treasury coordinated closely for  months with the Mexican Financial Intelligence Unit, the Mexican Attorney  General\u2019s Office, and the Mexican Federal Police on this action. The  Mexican Financial Intelligence Unit froze the Mexican bank accounts held  by all of the designees, according to Treasury officials. Although actions  like this sometimes require them to delay a designation, OFAC officials  noted that the results of coordination can increase the impact of Kingpin  Act designations.", "Changes to drug trafficking organizations. According to OFAC and  partner agency officials, drug traffickers attempt to evade investigators by  being unpredictable and making changes to their organizational structure  and operations. Changes to the organization may result in the need for  longer investigations if information gathered about an individual trafficker  or a trafficking organization becomes outdated or irrelevant. Operational  changes include such things as using shell companies or virtual assets,  which several OFAC and partner agency officials said complicate their  attempts to gather evidence of proceeds from drug trafficking, and can  also lengthen the designation process.", "Based on our analysis of nine Kingpin Act designations, we found that the  duration and sequence of steps leading to designations varied. According  to OFAC officials, each investigation includes a unique set of  circumstances that affect the length and sequence of steps. From  initiation to designation, the nine cases we reviewed ranged from 6  months to 38 months (See fig. 4.) Time spent preparing the evidentiary  packages for the cases ranged from 3 months to 31 months. Although  OFAC got partner agency concurrence for seven cases after attorneys  had begun the legal review of evidentiary packages, OFAC documented  completion of this step before legal review had begun for two cases. The  timing for submitting the case to partner agencies for initial designation  consideration varied, including one case that OFAC did not submit until  the month that attorneys completed legal reviews of the evidentiary  package. For one case, OFAC followed most of the steps twice before  designating the target. OFAC officials told us that if the decision is made  to delay a designation after they have completed all of the steps leading  up to designation, it may be necessary to go through the steps again to  determine whether there is new derogatory information about the target  and whether the information in the evidentiary package is still current and  legally sufficient before designating the target."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OFAC Has Informed Partner Agencies of the Designation Process in Several Ways, Which Partner Agencies Generally Find Sufficient to Understand Their Roles", "paragraphs": ["OFAC officials reported that they disseminate information about the  designation process and agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities for the  process in several ways.

Furthermore, OFAC has not disclosed limitations to the  consistency or reliability of the expenditure data in its reports. The Kingpin  Act requires Treasury, no later than July 1 each year, to provide the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of  Representatives and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate  a report describing the status of sanctions imposed, including the  personnel and resources directed towards the imposition of such  sanctions during the preceding fiscal year, and providing background  information with respect to newly-identified significant foreign narcotics  traffickers and their activities. OFAC has submitted annual reports to  Congress since 2003. Each report includes information from OFAC on  both agencies\u2019 expenditures and on designations announced during the  year.", "To prepare the report, OFAC requests partner agency expenditures.  OFAC sends annual emails requesting the amount agencies spent on  personnel and resources for their Kingpin Act activities. For at least the  last 3 years, OFAC has sent the partner agencies a memo stating that for  personnel expenses, agencies could estimate the percentage of time  spent by staff members on activities directly attributable to implementing  the Kingpin Act during the year covered in the report and multiply by the  staff members\u2019 salaries during the year. However, the guidance does not  clarify or provide examples of types of personnel expenditures that  agencies should consider as attributable to implementing the Kingpin Act.  As a result, agencies must interpret for themselves what to include in their  estimated personnel expenditure submissions to OFAC. The memo listed  some examples of what agencies could include as resource expenditures  related to the implementation of the Kingpin Act, such as research  materials and information access, travel, equipment, supplies, outside  services, and security. OFAC officials said they are not more prescriptive  with their guidance because the Kingpin Act is not specific about which  expenses to report.", "Agencies reported different methods for determining expenditure amounts  and the information on agency personnel expenditures varied  substantially from year to year. Officials from some of the partner  agencies reported calculating estimates of personnel expenditures based  on the paygrades of personnel engaged in Kingpin Act investigations or  interagency meetings, while others stated that they did not report  expenditures because they determined that their level of engagement  was minor and did not warrant reporting. According to DEA officials, they  do not report on personnel expenditures for the time they spend  investigating Kingpin Act targets because the investigations  simultaneously support their own cases against the targets. According to  officials from some agencies, such as DHS, they only reported personnel  expenditures for cases on which they were the lead investigative agency.  As a result, DHS reported $2.4 million in personnel expenditures in fiscal  year 2015, $0 between fiscal years 2016 and 2018, and then about $2  million in fiscal year 2019. Other partner agencies, such as DOD and  State, report personnel expenditures even though they do not lead  specific Kingpin Act investigations. As a result, the reported expenditures  of agencies may not be consistent and may not represent a reliable total  for Kingpin Act activities across the U.S. government. See figure 5 for the  Kingpin Act\u2013related personnel expenditures reported by Treasury and its  partner agencies.", "Agencies\u2019 determinations of what they include as resource expenditures  vary as well. For example, several agencies have reported no resource  expenditures for the last 3 years, but State has reported a small resource  expenditure that, according to State officials, accounts for transportation  expenses for Kingpin Act interagency meetings.", "OFAC officials said they do not know what agencies are including in their  annual expenditure reports because OFAC does not seek information  from agencies explaining their annual expenditure submissions and  OFAC reports them as submitted. Moreover, OFAC officials said they  did not verify the amounts reported to confirm, for example, why DHS and  DOD reported personnel expenditures in some years many times greater  than DOJ personnel expenditures, even though DOJ is the lead  investigative agency for the majority of Kingpin Act cases.", "The Kingpin Act requires OFAC to report on the personnel and resources  expended on the imposition of Kingpin Act sanctions each year.  Additionally, federal internal control standards require entities to ensure  that they are using quality information to achieve their objectives.  Although Treasury reported in the most recent annual report from July  2019 that OFAC\u2019s significant increase in resource expenditures was due  to the addition of overseas costs and database contracts, the annual  reports do not account for significant changes in agencies\u2019 expenditures  from year to year. Because OFAC does not provide guidance that clarifies  what agencies are required to include in their annual expenditure  submissions or disclose the limitations in the consistency and reliability of  expenditure data from partner agencies, OFAC cannot provide assurance  that its annual reports to Congress on Kingpin Act interagency  expenditures contain quality information that is transparent and consistent  across all reporting agencies.

These officials noted that the primary challenge  in assessing the effectiveness of Kingpin Act sanctions is that they cannot  isolate the impact of Kingpin Act sanctions from those of multiple other  efforts and factors. For example, whether the estimates of the amount of  drugs entering the United States is increasing or decreasing depends  upon the sum total of activities of counternarcotics programs managed by  organizations in the United States, other countries, and the international  community. In addition, we have previously reported other challenges that  agency officials have stated can make it difficult to assess the  effectiveness of economic sanctions, including frequent shifts in policy  goals and objectives, and a lack of reliable data. Treasury officials noted  that sanctions are often used in conjunction with other policy tools, such  as diplomatic engagement and export controls. According to Treasury  officials, distinguishing the impact of each tool leveraged is exceedingly  difficult due to the limited information available via intelligence and law  enforcement channels.", "Moreover, while Treasury\u2019s partner agencies said Kingpin Act  designations contribute to their counternarcotics goals, these agencies\u2019  are unable to quantify contributions specifically related to the Kingpin Act  in measuring progress toward their own agencies\u2019 goals. Partner  agency officials said they do not consider the Kingpin Act to be a  government program for which effectiveness can be assessed; rather,  they stated that the Kingpin Act is one tool among many that U.S.  government agencies can use where appropriate in their efforts to combat  drug trafficking. According to partner agency officials, effectiveness of  sanctions in achieving policy goals is often discussed at an interagency  level, which allows the U.S. government to consider these issues in the  larger policy context, because sanctions are often only one element of  broader government-wide strategies to achieve U.S. policy goals.", "Treasury conducts some assessment of both the potential and observed  impacts of specific Kingpin Act designations. The Office of Intelligence  and Analysis (OIA), Treasury\u2019s intelligence component, conducts both  predesignation and postdesignation assessments. OIA officials noted  that they consider it part of their mission to inform Treasury policymakers  of potential impact before a designation occurs. According to OIA officials,  OIA\u2019s predesignation assessments are narrowly focused and can be  delivered in any number of formats, including emails, spreadsheets, and  briefings. OFAC officials said they provide OIA with name and summary  evidentiary information on a potential target. According to OIA officials,  they use the information to assess the potential level of impact (e.g.,  negligible or significant) a Kingpin Act designation may have on the  target, its network, or other third parties, based on a variety of factors. For  example, OIA may determine that a Kingpin Act designation can result in  significant impact if evidence indicates that a designation will impose high  costs and obstacles for a target to continue drug trafficking activity.  According to OIA officials, such assessments have been required by the  Under Secretary since 2018 and OIA has completed predesignation  assessments on all Kingpin Act designations during that time period for  senior Treasury officials\u2019 consideration. Additionally, since 2018, OIA  has completed two postdesignation assessments. OIA officials said they  share these assessments with OFAC so it can incorporate the lessons  learned into future investigations or to develop new designations. OIA  officials said that the decision to conduct postdesignation assessments of  Kingpin Act designations is based on resources and the availability of  information to assess impact.", "OFAC officials said they have not undertaken formal, systematic  assessments on the impact of Kingpin Act designations because OFAC\u2019s  staffing resources are primarily assigned to designation investigations  and reviewing of petitions for Kingpin Act designation reconsideration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OFAC and Its Partner Agencies Have Reported Results, Including That Kingpin Act Sanctions Have Frozen Assets and Aided in Drug Trafficking Investigations", "paragraphs": ["OFAC and its U.S. partner agencies reported on various results related to  Kingpin Act sanctions. OFAC reported that it had designated more than  2,000 individuals and entities under the Kingpin Act as of June 2019.  (See fig. 6 for the number of individuals and entities designated by year.)  These designations are about evenly split between designations of  individuals and designations of entities across the four designation  classifications. OFAC reported 195 Tier 1 designations (B1 and B4  classification), and 2,033 Tier 2 designations (B2 and B3 classification).", "OFAC also reported that it has frozen more than half a billion dollars of  sanctioned individuals\u2019 or entities\u2019 assets under the Kingpin Act between  2000 and 2019. According to OFAC data, almost 80 percent of the total  assets frozen were from one individual in 2017. For the remaining years,  the amount frozen fluctuated between $1.7 million and $36.4 million  without a clear upward or downward trend.", "Further, law enforcement partner agencies cited the Kingpin Act as an  important tool in aiding their investigations that may result in actions such  as indictment or arrest of designees. For example, in one of our nine  cases, a federal grand jury indicted Raul Flores Hernandez\u2014the  suspected leader of a Guadalajara-based drug trafficking organization\u2014in  August 2017 for moving large quantities of cocaine from South America to  Mexico for distribution and further transportation into the United States.  OFAC designated him (as well as 21 of his alleged criminal associates  and 42 businesses and other entities affiliated with his drug trafficking  organization) under the Kingpin Act concurrent with the indictment.  According to OFAC and DEA officials, sharing information about Flores  Hernandez was essential to both the designations and the indictment.  According to these officials, disrupting the access of significant narcotics  traffickers and their networks to the U.S. financial system and barring  them from travel to the United States has been helpful in motivating  several designees to cooperate with law enforcement investigations.", "Moreover, U.S. agencies report that the ability to sanction entire drug  trafficking networks increases pressure on traffickers to cease  involvement with illicit narcotics. OFAC officials stated that removing  designees from the OFAC list is, in some cases, evidence of disruption of  drug trafficking organization or other positive behavior change. To be  removed, designees must petition OFAC and demonstrate that they no  longer meet the criteria to be designated under the Kingpin Act. As of  June 2019, OFAC had removed 399 individuals and entities previously  designated under the Kingpin Act, of which five were Tier 1 designations  (B1 and B4 classification), and 394 were Tier 2 designations (B2 or B3  classification).", "Foreign government officials also reported that Kingpin Act sanctions  have assisted them in imposing penalties on drug traffickers. Foreign  government officials we met with in Colombia reported that their Supreme  Court issued a ruling that permits their countries\u2019 banks to terminate  accounts of, and deny service to, Kingpin Act designees because of the  risk the banks would face if they continued those business relationships.  According to Mexican government officials, a bankers\u2019 association, the  Financial Intelligence Unit, and the bank regulator in Mexico issued  guidance supporting Mexican banks\u2019 rights to deny service to Kingpin Act  designees. Mexican government officials also stated that once the United  States publicly identifies a Mexican national as a drug trafficker by  designating him or her under the Kingpin Act, Mexican law enforcement  entities face less public opposition when they arrest, imprison, or extradite  the individual. According to government officials we met with in Colombia,  information that OFAC and other U.S. agencies share as part of their  Kingpin Act investigations help them justify seizing designees\u2019 assets. For  example, according to OFAC officials, OFAC, DEA, and Colombian  authorities led a joint investigation that led to the October 2018  Colombian asset seizure of 202 assets of two individuals in Colombia  valued at over USD $500 million. The Colombian seizure included farms,  land, houses, hotels, apartments, businesses, commercial properties,  emerald mines, horses and vehicles.", "Some Kingpin Act designations have had unintended consequences for  foreign persons other than those targeted by the sanctions. The  Congressional Research Service has reported that some designations  have been associated with significant economic losses and  unemployment by individuals not involved in illicit narcotics when large  companies are liquidated in the process. Treasury officials stated that  foreign drug trafficking organizations often attempt to integrate their illicit  proceeds into the legitimate economy by owning or controlling businesses  that may employ individuals who are not associated with drug trafficking  activities. According to Treasury officials, it is imperative that Treasury  designate businesses that are owned or controlled by drug trafficking  organizations, despite the employment of individuals who may not have  knowledge of the illicit activities. They said that prior to designating such  foreign businesses, Treasury coordinates closely with other U.S.  government agencies, the relevant U.S. embassy, and with the relevant  foreign counterparts to minimize the impact on employees who lack  knowledge of the illicit activities. According to the Congressional  Research Service, some designations have also been associated with  upticks in drug trafficking\u2013related violence when, in combination with law  enforcement action, drug trafficking organizations are dismantled and  competing groups vie for abandoned territory.", "Furthermore, some designations have negatively affected public  perceptions of the United States within the designee\u2019s country of  residence, according to OFAC and partner agency officials. For example,  OFAC and State officials stated that there was significant public criticism  of U.S. intervention when OFAC designated a Mexican celebrity in  conjunction with a significant narcotics trafficker.

From the countries with the most  designations, we considered only B1 and B4 designations. Additionally,  we only considered designations that occurred after May 2015, when the  authority to designate was delegated from the President to the Secretary  of the Treasury, so that the process followed for designation would most  closely resemble the current process. We considered cases with a range  in number of B2 and B3 designations affiliated with the B1 or B4  designee. Furthermore, we ensured that we selected cases from both  Western Hemisphere countries where most of the designations have  occurred (including cases in Colombia and Mexico where we performed  fieldwork), and non\u2013Western Hemisphere countries to learn whether the  process differs geographically. To account for those criteria, we selected  nine cases to review. OFAC provided data on the milestone dates and  results associated with the cases from its electronic case management  system. We were unable to independently assess the data provided  against the system, but we were able to corroborate some dates, such as  designation dates, with public documents such as press releases. In  addition, OFAC officials answered our questions about the variance in  case data they provided by explaining factors that contributed to the  length or sequence of investigative steps of each case.

In addition, we  met with officials from financial regulator agencies and the national  banking associations in Colombia and Mexico to understand how U.S.  enforcement of Kingpin Act sanctions affected their operations. To assess  the extent to which OFAC included information required by the Kingpin  Act for Treasury\u2019s reports to Congress, we also reviewed the annual  reports OFAC submitted to Congress from 2003 to 2019 and OFAC  guidance sent to partner agencies from 2017 through 2019 seeking their  input into the reports.
