GAO reported that its review of meta-analyses (studies that analyze other studies and synthesize their findings) that included findings from over 400 studies related to detecting deception conducted over the past 60 years, other academic and government studies, and interviews with experts in the field, called into question the use of behavior observation techniques, that is, human observation unaided by technology, as a means for reliably detecting deception. The meta-analyses GAO reviewed collectively found that the ability of human observers to accurately identify deceptive behavior based on behavioral cues or indicators is the same as or slightly better than chance (54 percent). GAO also reported on other studies that do not support the use of behavioral indicators to identify mal-intent or threats to aviation.", "GAO found that DHS's April 2011 validation study does not demonstrate effectiveness of the SPOT behavioral indicators because of methodological weaknesses. The validation study found, among other things, that some SPOT indicators were predictive of outcomes that represent high-risk passengers, and that SPOT procedures, which rely on the SPOT behavioral indicators, were more effective than a random selection protocol implemented by BDOs in identifying outcomes that represent high-risk passengers. While the April 2011 SPOT validation study is a useful initial step and, in part, addressed issues raised in GAO's May 2010 report, methodological weaknesses limit its usefulness.

In 2010, we found, among other things, that  BDOs could not record all behaviors observed in the SPOT database  because the database limited entry to eight behaviors, six signs of  deception, and four types of serious prohibited items per passenger  referred for additional screening, though BDOs are trained to identify 94  total indicators.subsequent to our May 2010 report, the validation study used data that  were collected from 2006 through 2010, prior to TSA\u2019s improvements to  the SPOT database.

Specifically, different levels of criteria were used to determine  whether passengers in each group were referred to a LEO, which is a  necessary precondition for an arrest. Because of this discrepancy  between the study groups, the results related to the LEO arrest metric are  questionable and cannot be relied upon to demonstrate the effectiveness  of the SPOT program\u2019s behavioral indicators.

Specifically, we found that SPOT referral data from fiscal years  2011 and 2012 indicate that SPOT and LEO referral rates vary  significantly across BDOs at some airports, which raises questions about  the use of SPOT behavioral indicators by BDOs. The rate at which  BDOs referred passengers for SPOT referral screening ranged from 0 to  26 referrals per 160 hours worked during the 2-year period we  reviewed.

We found  that there is a statistically significant relationship between the length of  time an individual has been a BDO and the number of SPOT referrals the  individual makes. This suggests that different levels of experience may be  one reason why BDOs apply the behavioral indicators differently. TSA  has efforts underway to better define the behavioral indicators currently  used by BDOs, and to complete an inter-rater reliability study. The inter- rater reliability study could help TSA determine whether BDOs can  consistently and reliably interpret the behavioral indicators, which is a  critical component of validating the SPOT program\u2019s results and ensuring  that the program is implemented consistently.

In response to a recommendation in our May  2010 report to develop a plan for outcome-based performance measures,  TSA completed a performance metrics plan in November 2012. The  plan defined an ideal set of 40 metrics within three major categories that  TSA needs to collect to measure the performance of its behavior  detection activities. As of June 2013, TSA had collected some information  for 18 of 40 metrics the plan identified, but the agency was collecting little  to none of the data required to assess the performance and security  effectiveness of its behavior detection activities or the SPOT program  specifically. For example, TSA did not and does not currently collect the  data required to determine the number of passengers meaningfully  assessed by BDOs, BDOs\u2019 level of fatigue, or the impact that fatigue has  on their performance.", "To address these and other deficiencies, the performance metrics plan  identifies 22 initiatives that are under way or planned as of November  2012. For example, in May 2013, TSA began to implement a new data  collection system, BDO Efficiency and Accountability Metrics, designed to  track and analyze BDO daily operational data, including BDO locations  and time spent performing different activities. According to TSA officials,  these data will allow the agency to gain insight on how BDOs are utilized,  and improve analysis of the SPOT program. However, according to the  performance metrics plan, TSA will require at least an additional 3 years  and additional resources before it can begin to report on the performance  and security effectiveness of its behavior detection activities or the SPOT  program.", "Without the data needed to assess the effectiveness of behavior  detection activities or the SPOT program, we reported in November 2013  that TSA uses SPOT referral, LEO referral, and arrest statistics to help  track the program\u2019s activities. As shown in figure 1, of the approximately  61,000 SPOT referrals made during fiscal years 2011 and 2012 at the 49  airports we analyzed, approximately 8,700 (13.6 percent) resulted in a  referral to a LEO. Of the SPOT referrals that resulted in a LEO referral,  365 (4 percent) resulted in an arrest.", "TSA has taken a positive step toward determining the effectiveness of its  behavior detection activities by developing the performance metrics plan,  as we recommended in May 2010. However, as we reported in November  2013, TSA cannot demonstrate the effectiveness of its behavior detection  activities, and available evidence does not support whether behavioral  indicators can be used to identify threats to aviation security. According to  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance accompanying the  fiscal year 2014 budget, it is incumbent upon agencies to use resources  on programs that have been rigorously evaluated and determined to be  effective, and to fix or eliminate those programs that have not  demonstrated results. As we concluded in our November 2013 report,  until TSA can provide scientifically validated evidence demonstrating that  behavioral indicators can be used to identify passengers who may pose a  threat to aviation security, the agency risks funding activities that have not  been determined to be effective. Therefore, in our November 2013 report,  we recommended that TSA limit future funding for its behavior detection  activities. DHS did not concur with our recommendation.", "The negatively and significantly related indicators were more commonly associated with  passengers who were not identified as high-risk, than with passengers who were identified  as high-risk. available. However, as described in the report, in addition to the meta- analyses of over 400 studies related to detecting deception conducted  over the past 60 years that we reviewed, we also reviewed several  documents on behavior detection research that DHS officials provided to  us, including documents from an unclassified and a classified literature  review that DHS had commissioned.", "Finally, in stating its nonconcurrence with the recommendation to limit  future funding in support of its behavior detection activities, DHS stated  that TSA\u2019s overall security program is composed of interrelated parts, and  to disrupt one piece of the multilayered approach may have an adverse  impact on other pieces. As we reported in November 2013, TSA has not  developed the performance measures that would allow it to assess the  effectiveness of its behavior detection activities compared with other  screening methods, such as physical screening. As a result, the impact of  behavior detection activities on TSA\u2019s overall security program is  unknown. Further, not all screening methods are present at every airport,  and TSA has modified the screening procedures and equipment used at  airports over time. These modifications have included the discontinuance  of screening equipment that was determined to be unneeded or  ineffective. Therefore, we concluded that providing scientifically validated  evidence that demonstrates that behavioral indicators can be used to  identify passengers who may pose a threat to aviation security is critical  to the implementation of TSA\u2019s behavior detection activities.  Consequently, we added a matter for congressional consideration to the  November 2013 report. Specifically, we suggested that Congress  consider the findings in the report regarding the absence of scientifically  validated evidence for using behavioral indicators to identify aviation  security threats when assessing the potential benefits of behavior  detection activities relative to their cost when making future funding  decisions related to aviation security. Such action should help ensure that  security-related funding is directed to programs that have demonstrated  their effectiveness.", "Chairman Hudson, Ranking Member Richmond, and members of the  subcommittee, this concludes my prepared testimony.
