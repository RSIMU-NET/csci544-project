For example, FAA has a strategic plan with long-term, outcome-oriented goals and objectives. Its annual Performance and Accountability Report includes the agency's progress in achieving its goals, and allows Congress to monitor performance trends. This report also provides financial information useful for analyzing its operating results and financial position. FAA's budget documents combined with performance data could provide Congress information to use in determining whether resources are achieving the planned performance improvements. Used together, this information could assist Members of Congress and congressional staff in their oversight responsibilities. Through its legislative support agencies--GAO, Congressional Research Service and the Congressional Budget Office--and the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Inspector General (IG), congressional committee staff also have access to considerable resources for oversight. For example, GAO's 2005 High Risk Series Update includes FAA's Air Traffic Control Modernization program and discusses progress the agency has made in addressing its problems. DOT's IG annually reports on the top management challenges facing FAA, such as safety and capacity challenges. Effective communication is needed to ensure that information agencies provide meets congressional needs. While considerable information resources are available, they may not be available in a manner that is useful to committees. We have reported that although agencies collect and produce a great deal of information, much of it did not reach the interested committees, and the information that did reach them was difficult to digest, highly aggregated, or was received too late to be useful. In the case of FAA, House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee staff said FAA has a large quantity of information available and effective communication between the staff and agency, but is interested in using technology to gain additional agency data. While FAA provides a great deal of information on its Web site, it could take additional advantage of technology to improve the timeliness and usefulness of information to the Congress. For example, a Frequently Asked Questions section could provide quick access to information often requested by committees. As a result of our discussions with committee and agency staff, FAA has initiated two suggested technology enhancements, a For Congress page on its Web site, providing a single point of access for information relevant for oversight, and a Web site subscription service notifying committee staff when relevant information has been updated on its Web site. Further, regular meetings between congressional committees and agency officials could identify the committee's oversight objectives, provide a forum to discuss the issues, and develop approaches to meet them. Importantly, these findings constitute lessons learned that may be transferable to other agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In your letter dated September 13, 2004, you noted that federal agencies  develop an abundance of performance, budget, and financial information  for internal use as well as to report to Congress for oversight purposes.

The key to financial  accountability is obtaining accurate and useful information on a timely and  ongoing basis to support day-to-day managerial decisions and oversight.

CAS has been principally  implemented in the ATO and Commercial Space Transportation, which  together comprise over 80 percent of FAA\u2019s budget. FAA\u2019s other two lines of  business, Aviation Safety and Airports are expected to implement CAS in  fiscal year 2006.", "CAS takes direct cost data from DOT\u2019s financial management system and  allocates those costs from the organization that incurred the costs to the  organization, product, or service that benefited from the costs. The system  allows analysis of costs aggregated within a program, activity, location or  strategic goal. Allocated costs can also be used in an analysis of  comparative operating efficiency for different operating periods or  different locations. An example is a ratio of costs to a nonfinancial activity  measure, such as cost per day, per employee, or per flight. Apparent  abnormalities in trends or at particular locations may then be investigated.  For example, at FAA the direct cost of an air traffic controller at a terminal  would be allocated to airport operations, in proportion to takeoffs and  landings, which are a major \u201cdriver\u201d of those costs. Similarly, the indirect  cost of a maintenance technician would be allocated to the lines of  business that benefited from those costs using an appropriate allocation  base.", "A financial scoreboard in use at FAA regularly tracks trends in these unit  costs, overhead rates, and other performance measures. Tracking these  trends is key to identifying operating inefficiencies and, when projected to  anticipated operating volumes, can help determine future financing needs.", "According to FAA, CAS provided labor and overhead cost data which were  used in the preparation of a competitive sourcing study for ATO flight  service stations. The cost data were used as a basis to estimate the future  cost of those existing in-house flight services. Comparison of those  projected in-house costs to the costs of procuring the services from bidders  in the private sector resulted in contracting out ATO Flight Service Stations  in fiscal year 2005 at a projected contract savings of about $2.2 billion  through fiscal year 2015.

In the January 2005 update, GAO  presented the status of areas previously identified as high-risk. These  included two involving FAA\u2014FAA Financial Management and FAA Air  Traffic Control modernization. We determined that FAA\u2019s progress in  improving financial management overall, a high-risk area since 1999, has  been sufficient to remove it from the list. However, while FAA had made  progress in addressing root causes of problems with its Air Traffic  Control modernization, originally designated as high-risk in 1995, we  maintained the high-risk designation.

In addition, many of these QFRs, as well  as other requests for information, are handled in an ad hoc manner by  individual FAA officials. When similar requests for information arrive, FAA  officials often have to create an entirely new response. An FAA official said  they had a general FAQ section, available on the bottom of all FAA Web  pages, but it does not include the QFRs, or other questions regarding FAA  planning, budgeting or performance. A FAQ section on the For Congress  Web page could minimize agency efforts by allowing it to post requested  information once, rather than tying up valuable time and resources by  repeatedly responding to similar questions.

The content allowed through the  moderated access would be negotiated between the agency and committee.  One way for committees to identify documents that are available would be  to provide increased search capabilities on the FAA Web site.

New ways must be continually found to use emerging  technology and approaches to make agency information transparent and  readily available. But despite the availability of information, and in FAA\u2019s  case, its public accessibility, more can be done to make this information  readily accessible to congressional committees. In particular, improving  access to information via technology solutions like those described in this  report could allow congressional committees to access information as  needed and minimize the number of duplicative information requests  agencies are asked to respond to. In addition, establishing a schedule of  routine meetings will provide congressional committees and agency  officials with the opportunity to discuss in-depth the issues and challenges  facing all federal agencies, including FAA.

FAA\u2019s statements of budgetary  resources for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 are displayed in figure 12.", "Committee staff could use information from FAA\u2019s statement of budgetary  resources to obtain an overview of the agency\u2019s financial position and  direction, addressing questions such as:   Were there increases or decreases in budget authority, unobligated  budgetary resources, total budgetary resources, obligations incurred,  and/or disbursements?", "To what extent were current fiscal year budgetary resources used?", "For example, FAA\u2019s statements of budgetary resources for fiscal years 2003  and 2004 show that budgetary authority, budgetary resources, obligations  incurred, and disbursements all increased in fiscal year 2004, indicating a  possible expansion in FAA\u2019s overall activities for the year. However, FAA\u2019s  budgetary resources increased at a faster pace than outlays and  obligations, which might indicate a change in FAA\u2019s budgetary needs that  should be analyzed further.", "FAA provides additional information about the use of its budgetary  resources in the required supplementary information section of its PAR,  which includes a schedule of budgetary resources by major fund type. As  shown in figure 13, an analysis of this schedule shows that the operations  fund uses the most budgetary resources followed by the grants-in-aid to  airports fund and the facilities and equipment fund. In addition, readers  may compare the fiscal year 2004 schedule of budgetary resources by  major fund type to schedules for prior years. A comparison of the fiscal  year 2003 and 2004 schedules included in the 2004 PAR shows that  budgetary resources for facilities and equipment grew by 3.8 percent,  compared to 8.1 percent growth for grants and 5.0 percent growth for  operations. This type of analysis allows for consideration as to whether  FAA\u2019s current use of budgetary resources is efficient and reflects  congressional priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statement of Financing", "paragraphs": ["The statement of financing reconciles the resources used to finance an  agency\u2019s operations for each fiscal year using budgetary accounting with  the net cost of operations determined using the accrual basis of  accounting. It explains the differences between an agency\u2019s obligations of  budget authority as reported in budget documents and the statement of  budgetary resources, and the net cost of its operations as shown in the  statement of net cost, indicating the various categories of transactions that  are considered when preparing one of those statements but not the other.  The statement illustrates the link between budgetary accounting (primarily  cash basis), which records obligations when goods and services are  ordered, and financial (accrual basis) accounting, which records expenses  when goods are consumed and services are received in fulfillment of the  agency\u2019s objectives. FAA\u2019s fiscal year 2003 and 2004 statements of financing  are shown in figure 14.", "Committee staff could use information from the statement of financing to  facilitate an understanding of FAA\u2019s financial position and direction,  addressing questions such as:   How much of FAA\u2019s net costs were due to the depreciation of its assets?", "How much did FAA spend on capitalized fixed assets?", "For example, FAA\u2019s statements of financing for fiscal years 2003 and 2004  show an increase of 29 percent in resources used to acquire assets,  transactions which affect budgetary resources but are not shown on the  statement of net costs until they are used up or depreciated, in the case of  property, plant, and equipment. As a result, additional oversight may be  warranted for the increase in resources being used to finance the  acquisition of assets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Bernice Steinhardt on (202) 512-6543 or steinhardtb@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact names above, Linda Calbom, Director; Christine  Bonham, Assistant Director; Elizabeth Curda, Assistant Director; Jack  Warner, Assistant Director; Kevin J.
