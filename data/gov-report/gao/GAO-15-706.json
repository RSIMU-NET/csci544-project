In addition, in 2014, U.S. companies conducted more orbital launches than companies in Russia, which conducted four, or Europe, which conducted six.", "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\u2014which is responsible for protecting the public with respect to commercial space launches, including licensing and permitting launches\u2014faces multiple challenges in addressing industry developments. If Congress does not extend the regulatory moratorium beyond September 2015, FAA will need to determine whether and when to regulate the safety of crew and spaceflight participants. Most commercial space launch company representatives told GAO that they favor extending the regulatory moratorium beyond September 2015 to allow the industry more time to develop. Current bills propose extending it as well. In addition, according to FAA officials and industry stakeholders, FAA faces an increasing workload related to licensing and permitting launches such as NASA's commercial cargo and crew programs that involve transporting cargo and crew to the International Space Station; space tourism; and the launching of small satellites.", "FAA's budget requests for its commercial space launch activities generally have been based on the number of projected launches. However, in recent years, the actual number of launches has been much lower than the projections. For fiscal year 2016, FAA requested a 16 percent increase in staff for its commercial space launch activities to keep pace with industry growth. Office of Management and Budget guidance indicates that if an agency is requesting significant changes in full-time positions, it should provide a detailed justification of the changes and discuss alternative implementation strategies. However, FAA's fiscal year 2016 budget submission does not provide a detailed justification of the staffing changes and does not consider alternatives to hiring additional staff. Because FAA has not done this, Congress lacks information that would be helpful in making decisions about the resources needed for the agency's commercial space launch activities. FAA officials said that the agency lacked additional workload metrics, which officials are now developing to include in future budget submissions for its commercial space launch oversight activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FAA, in its budget submissions, provide more detailed information about the Office of Commercial Space Transportation's workload.

We visited launch  facilities in Mojave, CA, and Wallops Island, VA, to review how FAA  carries out its launch safety activities. We chose to visit the Mojave Air  and Space Port because it is an FAA-licensed launch site where a  number of companies are conducting space launch and development  activities for both suborbital and orbital operations and because it was  the site of the SpaceShipTwo test flight accident in October 2014. In  addition, we visited the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at NASA Wallops  Flight Facility in Wallops Island, VA, because it is an FAA-licensed launch   and was the site of Orbital Sciences\u2019  site located on a federal rangelaunch mishap in October 2014.

In particular, we compared the number of  launches that FAA projected during the last 10 fiscal years, which it  generally used as the basis for its budget requests, with the actual  number of launches that occurred. FAA provided information about the  steps that it took to ensure the completeness and reliability of the data on  the number of launches that the agency licensed and permitted and  inspections that it conducted, as well as the data on overtime and  compensatory expenditures. Based on our review of this information, we  determined the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To  determine how changes in the number and types of commercial space  launches could affect the government\u2019s overall exposure and  indemnification for commercial launches, we discussed the factors  affecting the government\u2019s overall exposure and indemnification for  commercial launches with FAA officials, industry representatives, and an  insurance company representative.

However, as a  result of the Space Shuttle Challenger accident in 1986, the U.S.  government transferred responsibilities for commercial payload launches  to the private sector. In the NASA Reauthorization Act of 2005, Congress  directed NASA to foster the commercial spaceflight industry, as the end of  the Space Shuttle program would leave the United States without a  domestic capability to transport crew and cargo to and from the ISS.  This led NASA to establish the commercial cargo and crew programs to  facilitate safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation services to low- earth orbit instead of purchasing seats on the Russian Soyuz and  developing new government launch vehicles.

First, federal government contracts,  such as NASA\u2019s commercial cargo program, have supported the industry  and have resulted in an increase in the number of U.S. commercial  launches and revenues. For example, in 2014, SpaceX launched two  cargo resupply missions for NASA, and NASA ordered three additional  missions to SpaceX\u2019s CRS contract. NASA also procured eight launches  from Orbital Sciences in 2008 that were scheduled to occur between  2014 and 2016.

Moreover, some companies are  seeking ways to further reduce costs. For example, Blue Origin is  developing new main engine elements for United Launch Alliance\u2019s future  expendable launch vehicles. Representatives from one company and an  industry association and an expert told us that reusable stages will lower  launch prices. In previous work, we reported that according to industry  stakeholders, launch prices, along with launch vehicle reliability, were the major factors that customers focus on when selecting launch providers.One expert noted, however, that although reusable stages will lower  launch costs and prices may decrease, those decreases may not be  enough to significantly affect demand because prices will be affected by  many other parameters such as other nations\u2019 launch pricing schemes  and possible shifts in consumer demand.", "Third, the emerging space tourism industry and small satellite industry in  the United States also may help the U.S. commercial space launch  industry expand. As noted earlier, some U.S. companies are developing  reusable launch vehicles to carry spaceflight participants on suborbital  flights and to place small satellites into orbit. According to FAA,  companies are also developing small expendable launch vehicles to  deploy small satellites in space.", "Finally, the federal government\u2019s current indemnification of FAA licensed  launches helps keep launch costs low. As we found in 2012, countries  such as China, France, and Russia have indemnification regimes with no  limits on the amount of government indemnification. Representatives  from five commercial space launch companies, three experts, an industry  advisory group, an industry association, and a spaceport told us that  government indemnification is critical to the U.S. launch industry. One  expert, for example, said that indemnification is critical mainly because all  other space-faring nations also have insurance or indemnification subsidy  programs. He added that if in the future, the number of launches and  companies expands greatly in the United States, a formal government  indemnification program possibly could be replaced with an industry- funded insurance system. The federal government currently indemnifies  launch operators by providing catastrophic loss protection covering third- party liability claims in excess of required launch insurance in the event of  a commercial launch incident, subject to the availability of appropriations.

The challenges for FAA that they identified included the  following: (1) determining whether and when to regulate the safety of  crew and spaceflight participants, (2) increased workload relating to  licensing and permitting launches and launch sites, (3) creating a safety  reporting system, and (4) responding to emerging business plans.", "Determining whether and when to regulate the safety of crew  and spaceflight participants: In 2014, FAA released a set of  recommended practicesthat the agency indicated could be a starting point for the industry  to develop standards, or if needed, for FAA to develop regulations.   on human spaceflight occupants\u2019 safety  FAA officials said that if the moratorium is not extended beyond  September 30, 2015, the agency has no plans to issue regulations  regarding the safety of crew and spaceflight participants. The  officials said rather than issuing regulations, FAA is looking to  industry to develop industry consensus standards detailing  validation and verification criteria that are needed to implement  the agency\u2019s recommended practices. The officials also noted that  if the moratorium remains in place, industry may not have an  incentive to devote much time or energy to developing industry  standards (discussed later in this report).", "In 2006, we recommended that to be proactive about safety, FAA  should identify and continually monitor space tourism industry  safety indicators that might trigger the need to regulate the safety  of crew and spaceflight participants before the moratorium expires  (rather than responding only after a fatality or serious incident  occurs) and issue guidance on the circumstances under which it  would regulate the safety of crew and spaceflight participants.  FAA disagreed with our recommendation, stating that in light of its  observation of safety risk management, safety assurance and a  general safety culture in the commercial space launch industry  and other factors, it found no compelling reason to issue  guidelines on the circumstances under which it would regulate the  safety of crew and spaceflight participants. During this review, an  FAA official also said that in theory, the agency could promulgate  regulations after an accident, but under the moratorium, it would  be limited to the design feature that caused the accident. For  example, he said that any regulatory action taken in response to  the SpaceShipTwo accident would depend on the results of the  NTSB\u2019s accident investigation. This official also said that the  development of standards by industry may take less time than the  years it would take for FAA to promulgate regulations.", "Representatives from six of the nine commercial space launch  companies that we interviewed, the three experts, the Chairman of  the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee, and  the President of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, all  recommended that the regulatory moratorium be extended beyond  September 30, 2015. Among the reasons provided were allowing  the space tourism industry and industry standards more time to  develop and because of changing technologies. However, they  had different opinions regarding about how long to extend the  moratorium, ranging from 1 to 15 years. Representatives from two  companies suggested that the moratorium be extended  indefinitely. However, one of the experts said that the moratorium  should not be extended for an unreasonably long time or  indefinitely because there will a point in the future when start-up  companies either become successful or fail. Rather, he suggested  that the moratorium be reevaluated periodically to allow  companies to conduct adequate business planning and for the  government to collect information for future decision making on  regulatory and budgetary issues. Another expert we interviewed  said that although he supported extending the moratorium on  regulating crew and spaceflight participant safety, he suggested  that FAA and industry start discussions regarding what a  regulatory framework would look like. In response, an FAA official  said that the agency is concerned about how an extension of the  moratorium would impact the practicality of such discussions, but  that the moratorium would not prohibit FAA from engaging in such  a dialogue with industry These representatives and the experts we interviewed also  provided various reasons why the space tourism industry has not  already begun commercial operations, such as technological  challenges, the amount of time needed for testing and  engineering, and financing. By contrast, representatives from two  of the nine companies that we contacted\u2014both are companies  that are focused on orbital operations\u2014favored allowing the  moratorium to expire. A representative from one company said, for  example, that regulation is needed to provide protection against  companies that may not be safe. He also said that the lack of FAA  regulations defining what is considered \u201csafe\u201d for spaceflight  participants will increase the vulnerability of the commercial  human spaceflight industry to public outcry if loss of life occurs  due to a mishap. However, he added that if there is a clear and  justifiable safety regulatory framework, then a mishap will appear  as a regrettable but inevitable part of any transportation industry\u2019s  growth.", "An FAA official indicated that the agency\u2019s position is that the  moratorium should be allowed to expire. FAA officials explained  that although the agency has no plans to regulate the safety of  crew and spaceflight participants, if at some point FAA were to  identify a systemic issue with existing vehicle designs or  operations, the officials would like to be able to quickly initiate the  development of appropriate regulations to address that issue. The  bill approved by the Senate in August 2015 would extend the  regulatory moratorium by 5 years through 2020, while the bill that  the House of Representatives passed in May 2015 would extend  the regulatory moratorium by 10 years through 2025.", "Increased workload relating to licensing and permitting  launches and launch sites:", "Licensing more launches: In fiscal year 2014, FAA licensed  and permitted 20 launches and re-entries, up from 6 in fiscal  year 2005 and compared with an average of about 11  launches and re-entries during each fiscal year from 2005 to  2014. (Fig. 6 shows changes in the number of licensed and  permitted launches and re-entries from 2005 through May  2015.) A large part of this increase is due to launches for  NASA\u2019s commercial cargo program, which involves  transporting cargo to and from the ISS. One of the experts we  interviewed said the impact of the June 2015 SpaceX launch  mishap on NASA\u2019s commercial cargo program and FAA\u2019s  launch licensing workload depends on several variables such  as the cause of the mishap, future program funding, and the  availability of other international vehicles to supply the ISS. In  the future, FAA also will need to license launches for NASA\u2019s  commercial crew program, which involves transporting  astronauts to and from the ISS and is expected to begin in late  2017, following certification of the provider vehicles. Some  launch companies are also preparing to launch small satellites.  According to FAA, 20 percent of the projects in \u201cpre- application coordination\u201d for possible FAA authorization  involved nonconventional satellite deployment, including small  satellites and the use of hybrid launch vehicles.", "Conducting more inspections: In fiscal year 2014, FAA  conducted 223 commercial launch inspections, up from 15 in  fiscal year 2005 and compared with an average of 70  inspections during each fiscal year from 2005 to 2014.", "According to FAA officials, an average of 20 to 30 inspections  is required for each launch and inspections can take from 4  hours to 3 12-hour shifts to complete. Officials said that FAA  has conducted more safety inspections, especially those  associated with pre-launch and reentry activities, to allow the  agency to identify safety issues early for correction and to  avoid noncompliance with regulations and the conditions set  forth in the launch license. FAA conducts different types of  inspections such as launch and reentry operations and launch  site operations, and FAA inspectors are present at launches.", "Licensing new types of vehicles and technologies:", "Companies are developing a variety of new vehicles and  technologies. For example, the space tourism industry is  developing hybrid launch systems such as SpaceShipTwo,  which have elements of both aircraft and rocket-powered  components. FAA officials said that hybrid vehicles are  evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine which  regulations apply. As discussed earlier, some companies  are testing the re-use of elements of launch vehicles, such  as first and second stages of the vehicles, which FAA will  need to review for licensing.", "Some companies are also testing autonomous flight safety  systems, which would allow a launch vehicle that is off  course to be terminated without humans taking action.  Most licensed launches to date have involved flight  termination systems that were human-operated. FAA  officials said that approving such autonomous systems will  involve complicated software analyses.", "An FAA official said that reentries from orbit carrying  humans, including NASA crew from the ISS, will be  significantly more complex and resource intensive for the  agency to regulate and license compared with current  launch and reentry regulation and operations. According to  FAA, operators plan to maximize their flexibility to conduct  successful reentries, using multiple reentry sites and  dynamic decision making that could postpone the selection  of a site and the vehicle\u2019s corresponding trajectory until just  hours before the planned landing. An FAA official said that  to adequately prepare for these sites to be used, the  agency must evaluate all of them during its licensing  process, develop and implement plans to manage the  airspace around each site, and remain prepared to  compute real-time aircraft hazard areas throughout a  reentry operation.", "Licensing more and complex launch sites: Although launch  sites traditionally have been located in coastal areas at federal  launch facilities, last year FAA licensed an inland launch site  that is collocated with a commercial airport in Midland, TX.  FAA officials said that operating commercial launch sites  located inland will require the Office of Commercial Space  Transportation to work with other FAA offices to safely and  effectively integrate launch vehicles into the National Airspace  System to avoid interference with other air traffic. Furthermore,  although commercial space launches have traditionally  occurred at Air Force ranges, FAA is licensing more  nonfederal launch sites. As of July 2015, there were 10 FAA- licensed commercial launch sites, compared with six in 2006.  In addition, as of May 2015, FAA had received partial  applications for four additional launch sites. (See fig. 3 for  launch site locations.)", "Responding to industry requests for changes in licensing  and permitting: Representatives from five of the nine  commercial launch companies that we interviewed, the  Chairman of the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory  Committee, and the President of the Commercial Spaceflight  Federation said they would like FAA to allow companies to  hold experimental permits and licenses for the same vehicle  design, which is currently prohibited. One company  representative, for example, said this would allow continued  testing and development of a vehicle while it is in commercial  operation. FAA officials said they would like to be able to  approve experimental permits and licenses for the same type  of vehicle, but that it is not permitted under the Commercial  Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004, so the act would  need to be amended for this to be authorized. Bills passed  by the Senate in August 2015 and the House of  Representatives in May 2015 would allow a launch license and  experimental permit to be issued for the same type of vehicle  design.", "Creating a safety reporting system: Although FAA created a  Commercial Space Transportation Lessons Learned System for  industry to share safety data, as of May 2015, it contained only  three submissions. An FAA official said that it is difficult to create a  lessons learned database that is anonymous for those making  submissions and that companies may be concerned about sharing  proprietary information. However, FAA has established a voluntary  safety reporting system for the airline industry called the Aviation  Safety Action Program. This program encourages the voluntary  reporting of safety issues and events by employees of companies  that are FAA certificate holders. FAA created the program to  encourage aviation employees to voluntarily report safety issues  even though they may involve alleged regulatory violations. Those  reports are protected from disclosure, with certain exceptions.  The Office of Commercial Space Transportation\u2019s 2015 business  plan contains a plan to determine the feasibility of a voluntary  safety reporting system. According to FAA, legislative protections  for voluntarily submitted safety data are likely to be needed. As  discussed earlier, NTSB recommended as part of its investigation  of the SpaceShipTwo accident that FAA implement a database of  lessons learned from commercial space mishaps investigations.", "Uncertain regulatory framework and authority for regulating  emerging business plans: Some companies are developing  business plans that could present regulatory challenges for FAA.  In December 2014, FAA informed Bigelow Aerospace that in  principle, the agency supports the company\u2019s plans to develop a  lunar habitat. Some companies are also considering mining  resources on the moon and asteroids. Although FAA plans to  leverage its existing launch licensing authority to encourage such  private sector investments, it is also concerned that the current  regulatory framework may not fulfill the federal government\u2019s  obligations under the Outer Space Treaty of 1967. That treaty  established principles governing the activities of nations in the  exploration and use of outer space, including the moon and other  celestial bodies. FAA officials cited an April 2014 letter from the  State Department to FAA indicating that the Department is  concerned that the \u201cnational regulatory framework for  nongovernmental space activities, in its present form, does not  appear adequate to enable the United States Government to fulfill  its obligations under  with respect to the  activities proposed by Bigelow.\u201d However, the Chairman of the  Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee stated that  FAA does not have regulatory authority over activities in space or  on the moon. Representatives from two commercial space launch  companies said that FAA should regulate activities in space, while  a representative from another company thought that FAA should  not have such authority. FAA officials told us that federal authority  regarding activities in space should be clarified to prevent  companies from going to other countries to operate their  businesses. The bill that the House of Representatives passed in  May 2015 states that \u201cny asteroid resources obtained in outer  space are the property of the entity that obtained such resources,  which shall be entitled to all property rights thereto, consistent with  applicable provisions of Federal law and existing international  obligations.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commercial Space Launch Industry Is Starting to Develop Standards for Human Spaceflight but Faces Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The commercial launch industry has begun developing human spaceflight  standards and, as of June 2015, had developed two voluntary  standards\u2014one on the storage, use, and handling of liquid propellants  and the other on hazardous materials notification. This effort is being led  by the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, an industry association  established to promote the development of commercial human  spaceflight, among other objectives. A representative from the  Commercial Spaceflight Federation said the association is developing  these standards to promote safety. An association representative also  said that, unlike NASA\u2019s human spaceflight standards for its commercial  crew program that are focused on orbital operations using vehicles that  are similar to those used in the past, the industry standards are intended  for use in both orbital and suborbital flight using vehicles with a variety of  designs. However, representatives from the association and three  companies leading the development of the standards said the process of  developing standards for human spaceflight is difficult for several  reasons, including (1) that multiple types of technologies are being  developed simultaneously, (2) that resources to devote to this effort are  lacking, and (3) that FAA is not providing enough direction about its  priorities. The association representative said two or three standards  would be developed per year, but did not know how many would be  prepared in total.", "The Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act provides that the  Secretary of Transportation \u201cshall encourage, facilitate, and promote the  continuous improvement of the safety of launch vehicles designed to  carry humans.\u201d FAA officials said they interact with stakeholders  through the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee,  FAA\u2019s annual Commercial Space Transportation Conference, FAA\u2019s  Commercial Space Transportation Center of Excellence, industry  workshops, and meetings with license and permit holders and applicants  regarding industry-led efforts to develop industry standards. As stated  earlier, FAA also developed a set of recommended practices in 2014 on  human spaceflight occupants\u2019 safety. This document, which FAA  prepared based on NASA\u2019s requirements and guidance for its commercial  crew program, provides 89 recommended practices regarding human  spaceflight on suborbital and orbital launch and reentry vehicles in the  categories of design, manufacturing, and operations that are primarily  performance-based. Specific topics include medical limits for spaceflight  participants, human protection, and flightworthiness. However,  Commercial Spaceflight Federation representatives said they would like  FAA to provide more information about which practices within the  document are agency priorities. When we asked FAA officials about this  topic, they said that industry is in the best position to identify its priorities.  Agency officials also said that an industry standards committee has not  yet been formed on which FAA could participate. The bills passed by the  Senate in August 2015 and the House of Representatives in May 2015  would require the Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the  commercial space launch industry, to report to Congress every 2 years on  the progress of developing voluntary consensus standards starting in  2016.", "The Chairman of the Commercial Space Transportation Advisory  Committee cited the development of industry consensus standards for the  regulation of the light sport aircraft industry as a possible approach that  the commercial space launch industry could follow. According to an FAA  official who participated in developing standards for the light sport aircraft  industry, FAA worked with the industry to develop standards within a year  and shared its views about which standards the agency favored. FAA  later incorporated these standards by reference into their regulations  which made them enforceable. However, the FAA official acknowledged  that FAA found through its airworthiness certification process that many  manufacturers were not in compliance with the standards. This official  also said that the light sport aircraft industry knew the direction it wanted  to go with the standards, which facilitated the process. Another FAA  official noted that the effort was conducted under a FAA rulemaking  process, and that once the standards were developed, the agency had to  accept them. The official said that this process differed from the situation  that the Office of Commercial Space Transportation faces because it  cannot proceed with rulemaking regarding commercial spaceflight.  Furthermore, another FAA official said that a disadvantage of industry  consensus standards is the possibility that one entity could attempt to  dominate the process to favor a particular design. A representative from  one commercial launch company said that it may be impossible to  develop consensus standards because of the number of different vehicles  that are being developed and that his company withdrew from the  process because there were too many diverse opinions. Commercial  Spaceflight Federation representatives said the standards must be  approved by three-fourths of the members who vote.

(The table shows the actual number of launches in both fiscal and  calendar years because the projections in the budget submissions were  not always clear regarding whether they pertained to fiscal or calendar  years.) Furthermore, while the capability of transporting crew to the ISS is  expected in fiscal year 2018, continued budget uncertainty for the  commercial crew program could put that date in jeopardy and it is unclear  whether those vehicles currently in development under the commercial  crew program will be ready in time.

As noted earlier,  FAA calculates the maximum probable loss to estimate the losses likely  to occur from a potential launch mishap to determine the amount of third- party losses against which launch companies must insure. Launch  companies purchase third-party liability insurance up to the maximum  probable loss, which is capped at a maximum of $500 million or the  maximum liability insurance available on the world market at reasonable  cost, if less. The federal government, subject to the availability of  appropriations, then provides indemnification for losses over the  maximum probable loss up to $1.5 billion adjusted for post-1988 inflation,  which is about $3.06 billion in 2015. Figure 7 illustrates the three tiers of  coverage.", "The federal government has not paid any third-party liability claims as  none of the 246 FAA licensed launches and reentries from 1989, when  launches were first indemnified, through May 2015 have resulted in  losses which would invoke indemnification. This includes the recent two  launch mishaps involving Scaled Composites\u2019 SpaceShipTwo and Orbital  Sciences\u2019 Antares, both of which occurred in October 2014. The  SpaceShipTwo accident occurred under a FAA experimental permit that  was issued to Scaled Composites; the federal government does not  indemnify permitted activities. The Antares mishap, a FAA licensed  launch, did not result in third-party losses over the maximum probable  loss which FAA calculated as $56 million.", "As we have previously reported, industry changes could increase the  government\u2019s exposure to third-party liability, but the amount of increase  could be mitigated as long as the maximum probable loss methodology is  reasonable and maximum probable loss calculation is accurate.  Increases in the number of prospective launches and reentries would  increase the number of times the government is exposed to potential  claims. In addition, changes in the types of launches and reentries could  increase the government\u2019s exposure but the increase could be mitigated if  the maximum probable loss calculation accurately takes them into  account.", "First, the number of launches and reentries covered by federal  indemnification is forecasted to increase, and the federal government\u2019s  potential exposure to third-party liability claims would increase with the  added volume. NASA expects to procure 42 launches from launch  companies to carry cargo and crew to the ISS from fiscal years 2015  through 2020. The space tourism industry may also increase the number  of launches and reentries covered by federal indemnification, although  the timing of these launches and reentries is uncertain. In general, by  increasing the volume of launches and reentries, the probability of a  catastrophe occurring is also increased. A catastrophic accident could  result in third-party losses over the maximum probable loss, which would  invoke federal indemnification.", "Second, forecasted types of launches and reentries include newly  developed launch vehicles that have a shorter launch history than more  \u201clegacy\u201d launch vehicles. For example, Virgin Galactic\u2019s SpaceShipTwo,  XCOR\u2019s Aerospace\u2019s Lynx, and Blue Origin\u2019s New Shepard vehicle are  new vehicles. However, increased flights of a launch vehicle could make  a vehicle more reliable. For a vehicle to be certified to fly NASA\u2019s  highest priority science missions, NASA requires at least three successful  flights (two of which must be consecutive) of the same vehicle  configuration, among other factors. However, an insurance company  representative with whom we spoke stated that even launch vehicles with  a proven launch history can have accidents particularly if the vehicle has  been modified. To license launches of launch vehicles and determine the  maximum probable loss, FAA reviews the launch vehicle, flight path, and  the potential casualties and fatalities that could result from varying types  of launch failures at different points along the path. In addition, although  many forecasted launches are anticipated to take place at federal ranges,  including Cape Canaveral Air Force Station and Kennedy Space Center  where range safety oversight is provided in addition to that of FAA, some  forecasted launches and reentries may occur from licensed launch sites  that are not located on a federal range and one launch site is collocated  at a commercial airport. Thus, according to FAA, the maximum probable  loss could be higher for such launches.", "According to FAA, industry changes that include space tourism flights  may not increase the federal government\u2019s potential exposure because  the government provides indemnification only for property damage, and  injury and death of the public and does not indemnify those involved in a    launch, including crew and spaceflight participants onboard a vehicle. Instead, these individuals are required to sign cross waivers stating that  they will not bring claims against the federal government in the event of a  mishap.crew or spaceflight participants when determining the maximum probable  loss.", "Thus, FAA does not consider whether the launch is carrying  As we have previously reported, although some industry changes may  alter the government\u2019s exposure, an accurate maximum probable loss  calculation will mitigate the effects to some extent. If the maximum  probable loss calculation is accurate, the estimated losses will adjust for  the risk profile of each license, such that the likelihood the government  would indemnify a third-party remains the same regardless of the industry  change. Thus, whether the launch vehicle is newly developed or manned,  an accurate maximum probable loss calculation would adjust for the  increased (or decreased) potential damage associated with that vehicle.  For example, if the maximum probable loss for an unmanned launch over  an unpopulated area is $35 million, it could be $45 million for the same  launch over a populated area and the government would indemnify from  the maximum probable loss up to an additional $3.06 billion in 2015 for  losses. In this example, the higher maximum probable loss accounts for  the higher expected damages over a populated area, and the estimated  likelihood that the launch company\u2019s gross liability would exceed the  maximum probable loss (triggering government indemnity) would remain  the same. However, the amount the government would pay if the launch  company\u2019s gross liability does exceed the maximum probable loss may  change with these industry changes\u2014and could be higher or lower\u2014 depending on the circumstances. For example, a launch from a licensed  launch site with a flight path over a populated area could affect the  severity of a potential accident and thus the amount by which third-party  claims exceed the maximum probable loss. These effects  notwithstanding, if the industry changes would result in losses that  exceed $500 million or the amount of the insurance that launch  companies could purchase at a reasonable cost, the federal  government\u2019s exposure may increase by the amount of the shortfall.  However, according to FAA data on commercial launches and reentries,  the average maximum probable loss for launches\u2014most of which are  from federal, coastal launch sites\u2014was about $99 million and ranged  from $23 million to $267 million as of January 2012.", "In July 2012, we recommended that FAA review whether its risk  methodology should be updated due to advances in risk modeling of  potential catastrophic events since the maximum probable loss  methodology was first established in the 1980s.", "FAA uses an \u201coverlay  method\u201d that estimates a debris field and potential impacts on nearby  populated areas. On the other hand, insurance companies use  \u201ccatastrophe modeling\u201d that generates a distribution of potential losses  and simulated probability of different losses using computer simulations.

However, currently  there is not enough information to know the level of resources that FAA  needs for its commercial space launch oversight activities. Over the last  decade, FAA has generally based its budget submissions on the  projected number of launches, but launches are not the only indicators of  its commercial space launch activity workload. FAA is hindered by the  lack of data on how much time its staff spend on related responsibilities  such as consulting with companies before they submit their license or  permit applications.

DOT stated it was concerned that the report did  not adequately convey the dramatic growth in commercial space  transportation activity and innovation underway, which will affect the  workload of FAA\u2019s Office of Commercial Space Transportation. DOT said  the report focuses on the licensing of NASA-sponsored commercial  programs and on delays in the suborbital space tourism industry. It also  said that the report does not give sufficient attention to the emerging  market for the deployment of small satellites, which the department said  is a significant activity for the industry and FAA. For example, DOT said  that FAA currently has 54 projects in \u201cpre-application coordination\u201d for  possible authorization, 81 percent of which is unrelated to NASA  programs or space tourism.", "In the report, we focused on FAA\u2019s increasing workload related to  licensing and permitting launches such as for NASA\u2019s commercial and  cargo programs, in part, because the agency reported in its Annual  Compendium for Commercial Space Transportation: 2014 that launches  in the next 10 years are predominantly commercial launches to the ISS,  i.e., NASA programs. Further, according to a forecast for 2014 through  2023 in FAA\u2019s Annual Compendium for Commercial Space  Transportation: 2014, the number of small satellites drops off toward the  end of the forecast period, but the number of launches remains relatively  steady during this time period as NASA expects to begin its commercial  crew program. In response to FAA\u2019s comments, we added more  information to the report about the agency\u2019s workload relating to small  satellites, including its pre-application coordination activities.

FAA concurred with  the recommendation and in response, intends to reassess one of the  main assumptions that it uses to determine the maximum probable loss\u2014 the cost of casualty value\u2014which represents the value of a lost life or  injury due to a catastrophic launch incident. Specifically, FAA would like  to contract for a study on whether the $3 million figure it currently uses  should be raised. According to FAA, the Department of Transportation  (DOT) uses $9.2 million for the value of a statistical life, a figure that is  based on people\u2019s willingness to pay for safety. However, FAA told us  that in the case of commercial space launches, there could be data based  on liability determined through the judicial process, such as in the case of  a wrongful death suit that would provide a more appropriate figure for  required third-party liability insurance. A study would look at these factors  and assess what would be the figure that best captures the cost of  casualty as a result of a commercial space launch accident. In addition,  FAA has contracted with ACTA Inc., a company that has provided flight  risk and safety hazard analyses of space launches for the U.S. Air Force  and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, to review FAA\u2019s  maximum probable loss methodology. ACTA is assessing whether FAA  could use a risk profile method that looks at a variety of scenarios and  probabilities of launch mishaps using software simulations.

ACTA plans to conclude this  review and report to FAA in December 2015.", "FAA told us that the agency is also looking at catastrophic risk models  and thresholds of risk and would like to develop a risk profile method that  would then be reviewed by an external party. Most launch companies and  an insurance company that provides third-party liability insurance for  commercial launches with whom we spoke said that FAA\u2019s maximum  probable loss methodology is reasonable and does not need  improvement. However, as the maximum probable loss establishes the  point at which the federal government is liable for third-party claims  subject to the availability of appropriations, we continue to believe that a  review of whether the methodology could be improved is warranted,  especially given changes in the types and number of forecasted  increases in commercial launches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objective, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objective was to review the extent to which the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) is prepared to address changes that have occurred  in the commercial space launch industry over the last decade and  potential changes in the future.

We also interviewed  FAA officials, industry stakeholders, and experts about the factors that  have affected the U.S. commercial space launch industry during the last  decade. We chose these companies and industry organizations by  reviewing FAA reports on the commercial space launch industry and  other literature. We interviewed representatives from the majority of U.S.  commercial space launch companies identified in FAA\u2019s 2014 annual  report on commercial space transportation. Of the nine companies we  interviewed, three conducted licensed launches in 2014. The experts that  we interviewed were selected from academia and private industry based  on their knowledge of FAA\u2019s oversight of the commercial space launch  industry. Their views are not generalizable. Table 2 lists the organizations  and experts that we interviewed.", "To identify the challenges that FAA faces in licensing and regulating  commercial space launches and how it is addressing them, we asked  FAA officials, industry stakeholders, and experts for their views on how  developments in the industry affect FAA\u2019s oversight responsibilities. We  also reviewed data on FAA\u2019s licensing, permitting, and safety inspection  workload during the last decade; program guidance; legal requirements  and restrictions; business plans; and related documentation.", "Regarding the status of developing industry standards for human  spaceflight, we interviewed representatives from three companies who  are involved in developing the standards as well as the Commercial  Spaceflight Foundation, which is leading the effort. We also reviewed  FAA\u2019s legal responsibilities to promote human spaceflight safety. In  addition, to compare how standards were developed for another  emerging aviation industry, we interviewed an FAA official who  participated in developing standards for the light sport aircraft industry.", "To evaluate how FAA estimates its commercial space launch licensing  workload for future fiscal years when submitting budget requests to  Congress and how the changing market might affect its budget needs in  future years, we discussed with FAA officials how the agency prepares its  launch projections and its commercial space launch oversight workload.  In addition, we examined FAA\u2019s budget submissions for its Office of  Commercial Space Transportation from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal  2016 to determine the extent to which FAA\u2019s launch projections were  used as the bases for its budget submissions. We also compared (1)  FAA\u2019s fiscal year 2016 budget submission for the Office of Commercial  Space Transportation against the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  guidance on budget formulation and (2) the number of launches that FAA  projected during the last 10 fiscal years with the actual number of  launches that occurred. In addition, we discussed the workload metrics  that the Office of Commercial Space Transportation collects and analyzed  the office\u2019s overtime and compensatory expenditures during the last 5  years. FAA provided information about the steps that it took to ensure the  completeness and reliability of the data on the number of launches that  the agency licensed and permitted and inspections that it conducted, as  well as the data on overtime and compensatory expenditures. Based on  our review of this information, we determined the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To study how changes in the number and types of commercial space  launches could affect the government\u2019s overall liability and  indemnification for commercial launches, we reviewed prior GAO reports  and testimonies and discussed the factors affecting the government\u2019s  overall potential liability and indemnification for commercial launches with  FAA officials, industry representatives, and an insurance company  representative. We also discussed with FAA officials the status of our  2012 recommendation that the agency review its risk methodology  regarding maximum probable loss.", "Moreover, we visited launch facilities in Mojave, CA, and Wallops Island,  VA, to review how FAA carries out its launch safety activities. We chose  to visit the Mojave Air and Space Port because it is an FAA-licensed  launch site where a number of companies are conducting space launch  and development activities for both suborbital and orbital operations and  because it was the site of the SpaceShipTwo test flight accident in  October 2014. In addition, we visited the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport  at NASA Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, VA, because it is an  FAA-licensed launch site located on a federal range and was the site of  Orbital Sciences\u2019 launch mishap in October 2014.", "We also interviewed officials from the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration regarding its commercial crew and cargo programs and  related issues, the National Transportation Safety Board about the status  of its investigation of the SpaceShipTwo accident, and the U.S. Air Force  regarding its launch safety oversight at federal ranges and interaction with  FAA.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 to August 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objective. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Catherine Colwell (Assistant  Director), Namita Bhatia Sabharwal, Melissa Bodeau, Kevin Egan, Bob  Homan, David Hooper, Maureen Luna-Long, SaraAnn Moessbauer,  Shelby Oakley, Jack Sheehan, Joe Silvestri, and Kristin Van Wychen  made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
