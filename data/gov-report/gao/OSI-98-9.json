Subsequent to the start of the Special Inquiry, the VA OIG received a series of additional letters from the complainant alleging that the cover-up (1) involved not only Hospital and VA management but the VA OIG as well and (2) had continued even after the October 1992 start of the joint FBI and VA OIG investigation. The OIG issued the Special Inquiry report in September 1995.

Further, both the Assistant IG and the analyst responsible for the Special Inquiry told us that the OIG did not review or investigate the allegations of cover-up.

Truman VA Medical Center, Columbia, Missouri. The body of that draft report made no reference to allegations of a cover-up by the Hospital Director and Central Region Chief of Staff. In the draft report, only one issue was addressed\u2014whether management officials complied with VA policy when responding to the revelation of the unexplained deaths.", "According to the Assistant IG who prepared the final report, he did not review the underlying evidence while preparing the final report, nor did he reconcile the stated facts in the report with the underlying evidence prior to issuing the report.

He added that had the inquiry included investigation of a crime, it would have been appropriate to show whether a pattern of conduct existed. One method of establishing such a pattern, as is required by the OIG\u2019s Investigative Policy and Procedure Guide for special inquiries, is to create a chronology of events and actions. The OIG did not do this.", "Frequently a single act, taken by itself, is not sufficient to establish that the act was done willfully and intentionally with improper purpose.

The Special Inquiry analysts interviewed the pathologist and the TQI Coordinator. One individual recalled the statement being made; the other did not. However, the analysts never interviewed the Hospital Director or the Central Region Chief of Staff about this issue. Because of this, it was never verified that the conversation had taken place as alleged; and the OIG never attempted to resolve the conflicting testimony by questioning the person who had allegedly made the statement or the person to whom the statement had allegedly been made.", "Based on our review of relevant memorandums and tape recordings of interviews, we determined that the analysts questioned the Hospital Director and the Central Region Chief of Staff about compliance with VA policies. The analysts told us they accepted \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d answers instead of asking follow-up questions. For example, the analysts accepted, without probing further, the Hospital Director\u2019s response that he did not recall the District Counsel\u2019s advice in August 1992 that he notify the FBI or OIG about the unexplained deaths.

In its prepared statement, the OIG expressed concerns about its shortcomings in protecting the complainant\u2019s identity and stated that it had issued a written apology to the complainant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Office of Inspector General Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General\u2019s letter dated April 24, 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.Despite how the OIG may characterize its work, we determined that its review was not planned or executed in a manner that would support the conclusion that it had found \u201cno conclusive proof of an intentional cover-up\u201d by Hospital and Central Region officials and \u201cno evidence of criminal misconduct by top management.\u201d The work done, as described by those who did it and as reflected in the workpapers, did not include collecting and analyzing evidence to identify intentional cover-up efforts. 2.In addition to in-depth analyses of pertinent documentation, our findings and conclusions are based on extensive interviews of witnesses, including the Assistant IG and lead analyst. Further, these interviews were conducted without the presence of OIG management and the influence that may result from such presence. Information contained in our report was taken from documentation we examined and witnesses we interviewed. To help refresh their recollections and focus them on the issues, we provided the witnesses with copies of relevant sections of the OIG manual and supporting documentation for the Special Inquiry. We have also included additional information in our report to support our findings. 3.According to the VA OIG criminal investigator who conducted the criminal investigation with the FBI, he never read the Special Inquiry report that was issued in 1995. Further, he said he has no idea as to whether statements in the report were true or accurate. 4.Section A of the Special Inquiry report is the Hospital and Central Region management\u2019s response to the unexplained deaths. That section concludes that the OIG found \u201cno conclusive proof of an intentional cover-up by Medical Center and Region officials\u201d and \u201cno evidence of criminal conduct by top management.\u201d No attempt was made to formally reconcile the final Special Inquiry report to the underlying evidence until we asked whether such a reconciliation had been done. Further, following our request in 1997, the analyst who was responsible for referencing the report told us that she was unable to reconcile some of the stated facts. 5. We have added to our report a discussion of the types of issues we believe the OIG should have probed further and examples of instances in which further probing could have elicited additional information. 6.We disagree that a conclusion needs no supporting evidence. Since conclusions represent review and analysis of evidence, it is essential to include documentation and its analysis in the workpapers. But the OIG had no evidence or analysis to support its conclusion. Further, contrary to the OIG\u2019s conclusion, documentation in the OIG file suggested that the Hospital Director\u2019s actions limited access. For example, according to a memorandum for the record prepared by the lead analyst, the criminal investigator told the analyst that he suspected that the Hospital Director had told Hospital staff not to talk to investigators. 7.We have added a reference to our report about the OIG\u2019s receipt of an additional allegation from the complainant. 8.We have clarified our report to show the source of our statement about the reason for the OIG\u2019s delaying action on the complainant\u2019s allegations. 9.While we did not interview the Assistant IG for Healthcare Inspections, the IG is incorrect in his assumption that the facts as stated in our report are based solely on the statements made to us by the TQI Coordinator. Rather, the reason that we interviewed the TQI Coordinator was to corroborate statements contained in a January 1995 contact memorandum that she had prepared\u2014immediately following the contact\u2014to document her telephone conversation with the Assistant IG. 10.We have revised our report to reflect that the TQI Coordinator contacted the FBI at the request of the Associate Director and the Chief of Human Resources. 11.The referenced footnote has nothing to do with the Hospital management\u2019s investigation of alleged nepotism concerning the appointment of the Director\u2019s son as Chief of Human Resources. Rather, the purpose of the footnote is to inform the reader that the person who requested the TQI Coordinator to make calls concerning the complainant is the son of the individual on whom the complainant focused his allegations. 12.The IG\u2019s characterization of its June 1993 Hotline policies as the most recent is incorrect. The current policy was issued in August 1995 as reflected in our report. The OIG\u2019s May 1, 1998, acknowledgement of this fact appears in the appended addendum. 13.We have withdrawn our proposed recommendation for revising the OIG\u2019s August 1995 policies and procedures for protecting the privacy of complainants. We concur with the IG that any corrective action would require training and compliance with policy, not formulating or rewriting policy. Accordingly, we have made the appropriate changes to our report. 14.We have considered these comments and made changes to the report where appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Office of Special Investigations, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Chicago Field Office", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of the General Counsel, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Aldo A.
