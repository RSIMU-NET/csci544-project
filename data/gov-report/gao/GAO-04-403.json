USAID, the Department of State, and the Department of Defense spent $508 million, $254 million, and $64 million, respectively, for humanitarian, quick-impact, and some longer-term projects. U.S. funding represented about 38 percent of the $3.7 billion the international community disbursed over the 2-year period. U.S. humanitarian and short-term assistance benefited Afghanistan, but longerterm reconstruction efforts achieved limited results by the end of fiscal year 2003 due to late funding. By providing food and shelter to returning refugees and other vulnerable populations, early U.S. assistance helped avert a humanitarian crisis. USAID's and Defense's quick-impact projects also helped rebuild smallscale infrastructure such as schools and bridges. USAID initiated several longerterm reconstruction activities, such as repairing the Kabul-Kandahar road and starting a democracy program. However, because of delays in funding most major assistance contracts were not signed until summer 2003, limiting the results in fiscal years 2002-2003. U.S. coordination mechanisms for Afghanistan assistance were generally effective, but international assistance was not well coordinated in fiscal years 2002-2003. In addition, the United States lacked a complete and integrated assistance strategy, which hampered the U.S. government's ability to focus available resources and hold itself accountable for measurable results. Further, U.S. officials responsible for coordinating efforts lacked complete financial data, which hindered their ability to oversee the assistance. In fiscal years 2002-2003, Afghanistan confronted many obstacles that other postconflict nations have faced, such as multiple competing parties. In addition, security deteriorated and opium production increased, thereby jeopardizing U.S. reconstruction efforts. Lack of staff, poor working conditions, and delayed reconstruction funding further impeded U.S. efforts. In September 2003, to expedite progress, the U.S. government announced the \"Accelerating Success\" initiative, providing $1.76 billion for reconstruction in 2004."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-three years of war and destructive domestic policies and more than  5 years of drought destroyed Afghanistan\u2019s government, judicial, economic,  and social institutions and its transportation, health, sanitation, and other  infrastructure.

By the end of fiscal 2003, USAID had built or  rehabilitated several physical infrastructure projects, most notably the  Kabul\u2013Kandahar road. Many of the early physical infrastructure projects  handled through the quick-impact programs used local or low-technology  procedures in order to speed implementation. For example, the OTI  projects applied stone, gravel, and dirt to improve transport over secondary  and tertiary roads.  By contrast, a contract for the longer-term  Rehabilitation of Economic Facilities and Services infrastructure program  (REFS), signed in September 2002, provided engineering and construction  services for the production of paved roads and seismically sound buildings.", "The Kabul-Kandahar road, a U.S. presidential priority, represents a  significant political symbol within Afghanistan and is the main transport  route for north-south trade from Central Asia to the Indian Ocean. In about  17 months, under the REFS contract, USAID contractors demined, graded,  and installed the first layer of pavement on a segment of highway  stretching 389 kilometers (approximately the distance from Washington,  D.C., to New York, N.Y.).  As a result, travel between the two cities was  reduced from several days to about 6 hours. The road requires two more  layers of asphalt and the construction of bridges and culverts; the  estimated project completion date is October 2004. The prime contractor  for the REFS program was also responsible for constructing schools and  clinics listed as objectives under the education and health sectors.  However, as of the end of fiscal 2003, although OTI and the PRTs built and  rehabilitated schools and clinics, none of the more sophisticated buildings  included in the infrastructure contract had been built.", "In addition to the USAID infrastructure projects, State identified  communications as an infrastructure element essential to meeting the long- term security needs of Afghanistan. USAID provided for voice and e-mail  communication between the central government in Kabul and all 32  provinces by installing a high-frequency radio communications network.  The U.S. Trade and Development Agency provided short-term advisors to  create a strategic plan for telecommunications development. By October  2003, two telephone companies had established service in Afghanistan, but  according to USAID and others, connectivity was still unreliable.", "Economic governance. When the U.S. government began its reconstruction  efforts in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank\u2014 necessary to set fiscal policy and handle the country\u2019s reconstruction cash  flow, respectively\u2014were operating at an elementary level. USAID helped to  reestablish the Ministry of Finance, create a central bank of Afghanistan  and a new currency, and reform the customs process.  To do this, USAID  awarded a contract for its Sustainable Economic Policy and Institutional  Reform Support program in November 2002. Under the program, USAID  helped rehabilitate the ministry building and provided advisors to retrain  the bank\u2019s staff. In addition, USAID helped the central bank establish and  distribute a new national currency (the \u201cafghani\u201d). This involved collecting  and destroying an estimated 13 trillion of the greatly devalued, previously  existing afghanis and the disparate currencies printed by warlords. USAID  supported the commercial bank sector by assisting in legal and regulatory  reform and training financial sector officials. As a result, international  commercial banks began to receive licenses in the fall of 2003. Further,  USAID helped to partially rehabilitate the Kabul customs house and airport  customs facilities, streamline customs processes, and establish a tax  identification number system for traders. Despite these and other efforts  aimed at encouraging the provinces to remit revenue to the central  government, according to the UN and others, warlords continued to keep  large portions in their own regions, undermining the authority of the  central government.", "Health care. In November 2002, USAID, with assistance from the UN  Population Fund, Japan\u2019s aid agency, and the European Commission,  completed a comprehensive assessment of health facilities, services,  personnel, and supplies available throughout the country.  This effort  helped Afghanistan's Ministry of Health to establish a national health  strategy and national health priorities. All grants for health sector activities  must address the priorities established in the ministry\u2019s strategy. The study  found that Afghanistan has approximately one health facility per 27,000  inhabitants. It also established that nearly 40 percent of existing basic care  facilities employ no female health workers.

To expand U.S. support for Afghanistan\u2019s health  sector goals, USAID established its Rural Expansion of Afghanistan\u2019s  Community-Based Health Care program through a contract signed in May  2003, as a continuation of previously begun work.", "Education.  By the end of fiscal year 2003, USAID, through quick-impact  projects, had repaired or constructed approximately 200 schools, provided  more than 25 million textbooks,  trained over 3,000 teachers, and  supplemented approximately 50,000 teachers\u2019 salaries with vegetable oil.  (The oil represented 26 percent of the teachers\u2019 monthly income.) To assist  Afghanistan with longer-term education goals, USAID created the  Afghanistan Primary Education Program through a contract signed in June  2003. Early efforts in this program included developing and beginning to  disseminate an accelerated learning curriculum for girls, who were not  educated under the Taliban. USAID plans to train 30,000 classroom  teachers between fiscal years 2003 and 2006. The prime education  contractor in charge of the training referred to the educators it will train as  \u201cmentors\u201d because they will not have the same qualifications as formally  trained teachers.", "Agriculture. Through quick-impact projects, USAID helped farmers  reestablish agricultural production by distributing approximately 9,300  metric tons of seed and 12,400 metric tons of fertilizer, and by  rehabilitating more than 7,000 rural irrigation structures. USAID also  helped improve the rural economy by repairing over 70 bridges and tunnels  and more than 7,000 kilometers of secondary and tertiary roads and by  employing the equivalent of 1 million Afghans for 1 month.  In July 2003, the  agency awarded a contract for the Rebuilding Agricultural Markets  Program, aimed at increasing the food security and incomes of the rural  population. However, as of October 2003, work under this contract had not  yet begun.", "Democracy strengthening. USAID established two democracy and  governance programs, one to help implement the political goals set by the  Bonn Agreement and the other to bolster the civil society, media, and  political parties.  Through the beginning efforts of these programs, in  conjunction with the quick-impact activities, the United States provided  key technical assistance, civic education, and logistics support for the  emergency loya jirga (grand council) to establish the interim government,  and for the second loya jirga to ratify a new constitution.  USAID also  provided over 130 advisers to the Afghan ministries and funded  approximately 880 staff positions. In addition, USAID supported the  creation of radio stations and trained over 320 journalists to aid the  development of a free and independent media.  As of October 2003, USAID  and the international community had helped the Afghan government  establish judicial reform, human rights, and constitutional commissions.  Further, USAID commissioned designs for a provincial courthouse and a  judicial complex in Kabul. USAID\u2019s cooperative agreement with the  Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening, establishing  the democracy strengthening program, was not signed until July 2003.", "Gender equity.  USAID did not create separate women\u2019s projects but rather  included elements promoting gender equity in its programs. For example,  some quick-impact infrastructure projects incorporated women\u2019s labor into  the construction process. In Kunduz, where USAID helped a community  build a retaining wall, women participated and earned income by making  wire screens to contain rocks placed in the wall by the men. In addition,  USAID facilitated the involvement of women in the loya jirgas (women  accounted for 20 percent of the delegates at the December 2003  constitutional loya jirga) and in the Afghan government by rehabilitating  15 day care centers in ministry buildings to encourage Afghan women to  return to work. USAID also encouraged the return of girls to the classroom  by creating an accelerated education program. USAID also made maternal  care one of its primary health goals. However, Afghan society still limits  women\u2019s travel and work, which complicates attempts to educate, train, or  provide medical care to them, and nearly 40 percent of existing health care  facilities employ no female health workers. Further, several girls\u2019 schools  have been set on fire to protest educating women, and a female loya jirga  representative\u2019s life was threatened when she expressed her negative  opinion about the government\u2019s collaboration with warlords."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Coordination Mechanisms Established, but U.S. Strategy and Financial Data Were Incomplete; International Assistance Coordination Remained Weak", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2002\u20132003, the U.S. government established several  mechanisms to coordinate its assistance effort in Afghanistan, but it lacked  a comprehensive reconstruction strategy.

Repeated violent clashes among the warlords  continued throughout fiscal years 2002\u20132003, forcing USAID and other  assistance agencies to periodically suspend their assistance activities in the  affected areas. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the  United States uses warlord-commanded militias in its continuing  counterinsurgency effort against the Taliban.

According to analyses by the International  Monetary Fund, RAND Corporation, and others, Afghanistan received  about $67 in annual per capita assistance in 2002 and 2003; by contrast, the  annual per capita aid provided during the first 2 years in other recent  postconflict settings was greater. For example, annual per capita assistance  was $256 in East Timor (1999\u20132001) and $249 in Bosnia (1995\u20131997). At the  October 19, 2003, meeting of the Consultative Group Standing Committee,  the Afghan government warned the international community that the  reconstruction effort might fail and that success would occur only if the  rate of international obligations were increased and national  reconstruction projects were fully funded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accelerating Success Initiative Designed to Increase Funding for Reconstruction", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government announced in September 2003  a new initiative called  \u201cAccelerating Success,\u201d to increase funding and expedite the  reconstruction efforts, particularly regarding infrastructure,  democratization and human rights, and security.  The initiative was  designed to be implemented in the 9-months leading up to the presidential  elections planned for June 2004. The U.S. government plans to provide  $1.76 billion for the acceleration effort. Approximately $1 billion of that  amount would provide funding for elections, major and secondary road  construction, health and education programs, economic and budget  support to the Afghan government, senior advisers and technical experts,  and private sector initiatives. The remaining $700 million would be targeted  toward building the Afghan National Army, training and equipping the  police force, expanding the counternarcotics program, and establishing  rule of law. Funding for the initiative was appropriated in November 2003;  however, USAID did not receive the money until January/February 2004,  leaving only 7 months to complete visible reconstruction projects before  the September election. Moreover, the need to evaluate projects quickly  will increase under the initiative, but no additional funds have been  included for this purpose.", "In April 2003, prior to the \u201cAccelerating Success\u201d initiative, at the request of  President Karzai, the United States decided to complete the first layer of  pavement of the Kabul-Kandahar road by December 2003 instead of  December 2005.  Under the original plan, the estimated cost to bring the  road up to international standards was $113 million; the United States  pledged $80 million, while Saudi Arabia and Japan each pledged an  additional $50 million. In shortening the timeline by 2 years, the United  States assumed responsibility for 389 kilometers of the 482-kilometer  distance. (See fig. 21.) Consequently, the United States hired several more  subcontractors, increased the labor and security forces, imported  additional equipment, and tapped the world market of asphalt. The first  layer of pavement was completed about 17 months after the contract was  signed, and the road opened on December 16, 2003. By the time in 2004 that  contractors lay the final layers of asphalt, repair the road\u2019s bridges, and  construct the culverts, USAID projects that the road\u2019s total cost to the  United States will be $270 million, more than double the original cost  estimate, due to accelerating the project."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["After 23 years of war, the reconstruction needs of Afghanistan are  immense.  Since the fall of the Taliban regime in October 2001, the United  States has viewed the establishment of a stable, democratic Afghanistan as  essential to U.S. national security.  The United States, in cooperation with  the international community, is attempting to rebuild Afghanistan and help  the country become a stable and functioning democracy. U.S.-led efforts in  fiscal years 2002\u20132003 helped avert a humanitarian crisis; however,  conditions in Afghanistan, such as the deteriorating security situation, the  relative weakness of the central government, and the increase in opium  production, complicate the longer-term reconstruction process and  threaten its ultimate success. In addition, despite a consensus that  reconstruction assistance is essential to achieving the U.S. goal in  Afghanistan, most funding for reconstruction in fiscal years 2002\u20132003 was  not allocated until 17 months after the signing of the Bonn Agreement. This  delay, as well as a lack of staff and equipment, further hindered U.S. efforts.  Consequently, overall progress towards Afghanistan\u2019s reconstruction goals  by the end of fiscal year 2003 was limited.", "The President\u2019s broad strategy published in February 2003 and reported on  semiannually states that success in Afghanistan demands that the U.S.  government follow a coherent, consistent, and closely coordinated  strategy. However, for most of fiscal years 2002\u20132003, the United States  lacked such a strategy. In addition, USAID, which provided the majority of  U.S. assistance to Afghanistan, lacked a complete operational strategy to  guide its nonsecurity-related efforts, making it difficult for the agency to  integrate projects, focus available resources, and be held accountable for  achieving measurable results. The need for such a strategy has become  more vital given that, between August 2002 and July 2003, USAID awarded  seven major multiyear reconstruction contracts worth hundreds of millions  of dollars. Further, most of the U.S. agencies providing assistance to  Afghanistan did not have readily available comprehensive financial data on  their efforts, limiting the ability of individuals and institutions charged with  coordinating and overseeing the assistance to execute these  responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Administrator of USAID revise its strategy for the  agency\u2019s assistance program in Afghanistan. The revised strategy should,  among other things, (1) contain measurable goals, specific time frames,  and resource levels; (2) delineate responsibilities; (3) identify external  factors that could significantly affect the achievement of its goals; and (4)  include a schedule for program evaluations that assess progress against the  strategy\u2019s goals.", "In addition, to improve oversight of U.S. assistance to Afghanistan, we are  making two recommendations to the Secretary of State. We recommend  that the Secretary of State direct the Coordinator for U.S. Assistance to  Afghanistan to (1) produce an annual consolidated budget report for all  assistance to Afghanistan and (2) semiannually report obligations and  expenditures for the assistance provided, delineated by relevant U.S.  agencies and the bureaus and offices within each agency semiannually."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of State and Defense  and to the U.S. Agency for International Development. State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s  written comments are presented in appendixes VI and VII, respectively.   State and USAID generally concurred with much of the information  presented on the situation in Afghanistan for the period covered by our  review.  State emphasized that despite security and other challenges,  significant progress had been made, not only with respect to humanitarian  and short-term assistance, but also in advancing long-term security,  reconstruction, and governance objectives.  USAID stated that the report  presented a fair picture of the situation in Afghanistan at the end of fiscal  year 2003, when USAID\u2019s large reconstruction efforts were just beginning.   Both agencies included in their response additional information on more  recent activities taken and progress made.  The Department of Defense did  not provide official written comments, but provided technical comments,  as did USAID, that we have incorporated where appropriate.", "In response to our recommendation that USAID revise its operational  strategy for Afghanistan to include details such as measurable goals,  timeframes, and required resources, USAID said that its less  comprehensive interim strategy was appropriate given the situation in  Afghanistan during the early phases of the ongoing efforts.  While we  recognize in the report that the strategy was an interim strategy, the need  for a more complete strategy is vital due to the large increase in USAID  assistance funding for Afghanistan. USAID said that it is committed to  developing a standard strategic plan for Afghanistan during 2004, which  would be consistent with our recommendation.  The Department of State  disagreed with our finding that the United States lacks a complete and  integrated assistance strategy, citing its December 15, 2003 report to  Congress, titled Fiscal Year 2004 Strategic and Financial Plan for  Reconstruction and Related Activities in Afghanistan. In the plan, State  noted that the United States is pursuing a three-fold strategy in  Afghanistan, focusing on security, reconstruction, and governance. We  found that most of the strategies that were published in fiscal years 2002  and 2003 lacked details on funding and other resources, measurable goals,  timeframes, as well as a means to measure progress. However, in the  report, we also cite State\u2019s June 2003 Mission Performance Plan as meeting  many of the requirements for a government-wide operational strategy.  Although the fiscal year 2004 plan cited by State in its comments includes  more details on the U.S. assistance budget for Afghanistan, like some of the  previously published strategies, it lacks operational details, including time  frames, measurable goals, and a means to measure progress toward those  goals.", "In response to our recommendation that State produce an annual  consolidated budget for all U.S. assistance to Afghanistan and report to  Congress semiannually on obligations and expenditures, State emphasized  that policymakers are provided with information on U.S. obligations  weekly, and that close interagency collaboration occurs regarding all  funding issues. In addition, State said that it already keeps Congress  regularly informed through staff briefings, hearings, and mandated reports.  We disagree. As we reported, complete and readily accessible obligation  and expenditure data were not available, and consequently, it is difficult for  the Coordinator to determine the extent to which U.S. assistance dollars  are being used to achieve measurable results in Afghanistan. Moreover, we  found that government-wide expenditure data on U.S. assistance to  Afghanistan is not collected, obligation data is collected on an ad hoc basis,  and that the Coordinator\u2019s office experienced difficulty in consistently  collecting complete and accurate obligation data from U.S. government  agencies. Further reporting obligation data alone is insufficient. Obligation  data measures the extent to which contracts have been awarded, orders  placed, and similar transactions, not the extent to which money actually  has been spent on the ground on visible projects. Consequently, reporting  obligations alone does not provide an accurate portrayal of the progress of  the assistance effort. For example, as our report shows, although $647  million was obligated for reconstruction projects in fiscal 2002 and 2003,  less than a third of the total, or $214 million was actually spent.  Regular  reporting of both obligations and expenditures for U.S. assistance to  Afghanistan would provide the Coordinator and Congress a more complete  picture of what funds actually have been spent on visible projects.", "We are sending copies of this report to other interested congressional  committees. We are also sending copies to the Administrator of USAID, the  Secretary of State, and the Secretary of Defense. We also will make copies  available to others upon request.

To meet the requirements of the directive and provide Congress with a  comprehensive accounting of U.S. assistance to Afghanistan for fiscal years  2002\u20132003, we (1) analyzed U.S. obligations and expenditures; (2)  identified the results of assistance projects through September 30, 2003; (3)  evaluated U.S. and international assistance coordination mechanisms and  the U.S. assistance strategy; and (4) examined the major obstacles that  affected the achievement of U.S. policy goals and the reconstruction effort.", "We collected data on fiscal years 2002 and 2003 obligations and  expenditures from the U.S. departments and agencies responsible for  implementing U.S. government\u2013funded projects in Afghanistan. These  include U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human  Services, State, and Treasury; the U.S. Trade and Development Agency; and  the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).  Because there is  no single repository of financial information for all U.S. assistance in  Afghanistan, we contacted each agency directly. In addition, because the  Department of State does not have a consolidated financial reporting  mechanism for programs in Afghanistan, we contacted each bureau and  office separately\u2014including the Bureaus of Population, Refugees, and  Migration, and International Narcotics and Law Enforcement; and the  Offices of International Information Programs, Humanitarian Demining  Programs, and Trafficking in Persons.", "To determine which funds were applied to humanitarian and quick-impact  projects and which were applied to longer-term reconstruction funding, we  requested the agencies to designate their funding accordingly.  In the case  of USAID, we relied on the stated mission of the responsible funding  bureau to make the determination.  For example, the missions of the Office  of Foreign Disaster Assistance and Office of Transition Initiatives include  addressing emergency situations and implementing quick-impact projects,  respectively.", "Since USAID did not provide separate financial management records for  fiscal years 2002 and 2003, we, in consultation with USAID, sorted the  obligation and expenditure data by year to arrive at the fiscal year  breakdowns that appear in this report.  The Department of Defense was  unable to disaggregate PRT project data by fiscal year.  The fiscal 2002  obligations and expenditures in the report include only funds spent on  humanitarian daily rations, while the fiscal 2003 figures include all PRT  funds in 2002 and 2003.", "To delineate how funding and projects were distributed by province, we  combined information from both USAID and the Department of Defense.   USAID provided the information from a programmatic, rather than a  financial database, as the financial database did not include data by  location. Because the programmatic database had been updated only to  September 17, 2003, the numbers used for figure 5 are less than the total  obligations reported as of September 30, 2003.  However, according to  USAID, it can be assumed that the proportion of assistance by province did  not change during that time lag.  Also as a result of the data being drawn  from a programmatic database, we are unable to show expenditures by  province, because the database tracks only obligations.", "To assess the reliability of the obligations and expenditures data from U.S.  agencies providing assistance to Afghanistan, we (1) interviewed officials  at the Departments of Defense, State, and USAID regarding their methods  of gathering, managing, and using data; (2) reviewed USAID\u2019s financial  audit statement; and (3) compared the data we gathered with USAID\u2019s  Congressional Budget Justifications and the Department of State\u2019s 150  account documentation, as well as with the government-wide Afghanistan  assistance compilation done by the Department of State\u2019s Resource  Management bureau. A Department of State official stated that the data  State compiled are not completely accurate, due in part to the lack of a  requirement for all agencies to report to one central office on a regular  basis, which results in variation in the frequency of reporting by individual  agencies and differences in how agencies track data. However, the  Department of State relies on these data for decision-making purposes and  to track how quickly money for Afghanistan is being used.  Based on our  assessment, we conclude that the data are sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of showing, in gross numbers, the level of nonsecurity-related  assistance that the U.S. government provided to Afghanistan in fiscal years  2002 and 2003.", "To assess the reliability of the data on the pledges and disbursements made  by international donors, we (1) interviewed the official at the Department  of State who is responsible for compiling these data based on information  provided by the Government of Afghanistan and (2) performed some basic  reasonableness checks of the data against other sources of information.   We determined that the data are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  making a broad comparison of the United States\u2019 contributions to those of  other major donors and the combined total for all other donors.  However,  we also noted several limitations in the data, notably the fact that the data  are largely self-reported by donor nations to the Afghan government and  are affected by differences in exchange rates.  In addition, donors both  over- and under-report due to varying definitions of disbursement.   Furthermore, the data on larger donors are considered more reliable than  the data on smaller donors, according to the Department of State. Due to  these limitations, and the fact that we could not contact each of the donors,  we were unable to determine the reliability of the precise dollars amounts  pledged and disbursed by every donor.  Nevertheless, because these are the  only available data and are used by the Department of State, we present the  dollar amounts reported to have been pledged and disbursed by each donor  in appendix V.", "To examine the results of assistance projects through September 30, 2003,  we collected and analyzed information from the Departments of State and  Defense, and USAID in Washington, D.C., which outlined policy goals, basic  strategies, program objectives, and monitoring efforts.

In October 2003, we traveled to Afghanistan to examine the  implementation of USAID and the Department of Defense\u2019s assistance- related operations. While in country, we spent 13 days in the capital city,  Kabul, interviewing officials from the Afghan Ministries of Finance, Health,  Agriculture, and Rural Rehabilitation and Development; the Afghan  commissions on Human Rights and the Judicial Reform; the UN Assistance  Mission in Afghanistan; the UN Development Program (UNDP); and the  U.S. Departments of State and Defense and USAID. We also met with most  of USAID\u2019s primary implementing partners (including the Louis Berger  Group, Creative Associates, Management Sciences for Health, and Bearing  Point) as well as nongovernmental organizations not funded by the United  States, such as the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit and the  Danish Committee for Aid to Afghan Refugees. In Kabul, we inspected  Afghanistan\u2019s new banking system, customs house, and the rehabilitation  of the Rabia Balkhi Women\u2019s Hospital. We also spent a total of 7 days in the  Bamian, Kunduz, and Hirat provinces, where we inspected U.S.-funded  projects, implemented primarily by either the OTI or the Department of  Defense\u2019s PRTs. While in the provinces, we met with an Afghan shura  (community council), teachers, and other community members involved in,  or affected by, U.S. reconstruction projects.

Using the criteria  contained in the U.S. Government Performance and Results Act and USAID  Automated Directives System, we examined USAID strategies to determine  whether they contained the basic elements of an operational strategy  articulated in the act and in agency guidance. Our analysis of international  coordination mechanisms included a review of UN and Afghan government  documents, including the Afghan National Development Framework and  Budget, pertaining to the international coordination mechanisms utilized in  Afghanistan in fiscal years 2002\u20132003.
