This report examines: (1) state and local progress and challenges in implementing NG911 and (2) federal actions to address challenges and planned next steps. GAO reviewed relevant statutes, regulations, and federal agency reports and plans. GAO also analyzed NHTSA's survey data on state 911 implementation for calendar year 2015, the most recent year for which data were available, and interviewed federal officials, state and local officials from nine states (selected to represent different regions and various phases of NG911 implementation), and officials from industry and advocacy groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) National 911 Program's most recent national survey on Next Generation 911 (NG911) implementation indicated that about half of states were in some phase of transition to NG911 in 2015, but that state and local progress varied. Specifically, 10 states reported that all 911 authorities in their state processed calls using NG911 systems; however, 18 states reported having no state or local NG911 transition plans in place\u2014which may indicate these states were in the early phases of planning for the transition to NG911 or had not yet begun. GAO spoke with state and local 911 officials in 9 states, which were in various phases of implementing NG911, and found that none of the 9 selected states were accepting images, audio files, or video. State and local 911 officials identified a number of challenges to implementing NG911. Such challenges are related to funding, evolving technology and operations, and governance. For example, officials in 3 states said that the current funding they collect from telephone service subscribers may not be sufficient to support NG911's transition costs while simultaneously funding the operation of existing 911 systems.", "Federal agencies\u2014including NHTSA, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, the Federal Communications Commission, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security\u2014have responsibilities to support NG911 implementation, such as through coordinating activities and administering grants, and are taking actions to assist state and local entities in addressing challenges to NG911's implementation. Such actions include developing resources, offering technical assistance, and convening stakeholders to explore emerging NG911 issues. For example, as the lead entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, NHTSA's National 911 Program is developing resources on NG911 topics, such as federal funding and governance structures. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to facilitate the state and local transition to NG911, the program lacks specific performance goals and measures to assess its progress. Without such goals and measures, it is not clear to what extent the program is effectively achieving its mission.", "In 2018, the National 911 Program plans to establish an interagency initiative tasked with creating a National NG911 Roadmap. This roadmap is intended to identify next steps for the federal government in supporting the creation of a national, interconnected NG911 system. While the National 911 Program is taking steps to develop a list of national-level tasks as part of its roadmap initiative, the program does not have a plan to identify: (1) roles or responsibilities for federal entities to carry out these tasks or (2) how the program plans to achieve the roadmap's objectives. Collaborating with the appropriate federal agencies to determine federal roles and responsibilities to carry out the roadmap's national-level tasks could reduce barriers to agencies effectively working together to achieve those tasks. Furthermore, developing an implementation plan that details how the roadmap's tasks will be achieved would place the National 911 Program in a better position to effectively lead interagency efforts to implement NG911 nationwide."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NHTSA's National 911 Program develop performance goals and measures and, for the National NG911 Roadmap, determine agencies' roles and responsibilities and develop an implementation plan.

According to the National Emergency Number Association, approximately  240 million calls are made to 911 in the United States each year, with  over 80 percent of these calls made from wireless devices. However, the  nation\u2019s legacy 911 systems rely on aging infrastructure that is not  designed to accommodate modern communications technologies. As a  result, states and localities\u2014the primary providers of 911 services  through approximately 6,000 call centers nationwide\u2014are working to  upgrade their 911 systems to the next generation of services, commonly  known as Next Generation 911 (NG911). Benefits of NG911 systems  include improved capabilities to communicate with callers, increased  resiliency of 911 operations, and enhanced information sharing among  911 call centers and first responders. Call centers using NG911 will be  able to receive voice calls and accept various forms of data, such as text  messages, images, video, and vehicle crash data. Such information can  help to facilitate quick and accurate dispatch of emergency responders  (such as police, firefighters, and ambulance crews) and can be beneficial  in situations where a 911 caller is unable to speak.", "The transition to NG911 includes replacing the existing legacy 911  networks\u2014which carry voice calls and limited data\u2014with NG911 systems that use Internet Protocol (IP)-based technology. As we have previously  reported, modernizing communications networks can improve customers\u2019  access and services. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  notes that as legacy infrastructure is retired, the transition period in which  multiple technologies may be used simultaneously raises potential  challenges for 911 services. To assist states and localities in this  transition, the Next Generation 911 Advancement Act of 2012 (2012 Act)  outlined federal agencies\u2019 roles and responsibilities related to NG911.  The 2012 Act required the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA) within the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) within the  U.S. Department of Commerce to create a national program to improve  coordination and communication among federal, state, and local  stakeholders. This initiative is known as the National 911 Program, which  serves as the federal point of coordination for activities among 911  stakeholders and leads the national effort to eventually connect  approximately 6,000 independently operated 911 call centers into an  interconnected, nationwide NG911 system. The 2012 Act also required  FCC\u2014which has regulatory authority over telecommunications carriers\u2014 to issue specific recommendations to support the NG911 transition,  among other responsibilities. In addition, the 2012 Act required the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014which has responsibilities  related to ensuring the security and interoperability of emergency  communications nationwide\u2014to work with FCC, NHTSA, and NTIA on  specific NG911 activities.", "You asked us to review the status of implementation of NG911  nationwide.

We also reviewed FCC\u2019s data on state collection and  distribution of 911 fees and charges for calendar year 2015. According to  our review of the survey data, relevant documentation, and conversations  with staff responsible for the data, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to generally describe states\u2019 progress in implementing  NG911 and to provide background on 911 fee collection and costs.", "We also selected a non-generalizable sample of 10 states for case  studies, based upon a variety of factors, including variation in geographic  location, reported progress in implementing NG911, number of annual  911 calls, and whether states diverted 911 fees to other uses. We  requested interviews with and documentation from state and local 911  officials from the 10 selected states about NG911 implementation  progress, challenges, federal actions, and any additional assistance  needed. We obtained documentation from and interviewed officials from  nine states; one of the selected states did not respond to our requests.  While not generalizable to all states, the information obtained from our  case studies provides examples of broader issues faced by states and  localities in managing the transition to NG911.", "In addition to our case study work, we reviewed relevant statutes,  regulations, our prior reports, and documentation of federal agency  actions and plans. We also interviewed officials from federal agencies,  including NHTSA, NTIA, FCC, and DHS, and officials from national  associations representing emergency-response-technology companies,  wireless and wireline phone carriers, emergency-communications entities,  and consumer groups. We identified guidance on leading practices for  performance management, and reviewed interagency collaboration  practices from our prior work. We also applied relevant federal  standards for internal control that are key to helping agencies better  achieve their missions and desired program results. We assessed  NHTSA\u2019s efforts to set goals and achieve desired results for the National  911 Program using these standards, this guidance, and selected  collaboration practices from our prior work.

NG911 represents the next evolution in 911 services by using  IP-based technology to deliver and process 911 traffic. Under NG911, call  centers will continue to receive voice calls and location information, but  will also be able to accommodate emergency communications from the  range of technologies in use today. In addition, NG911 systems provide  call centers with enhanced capabilities to route and transfer calls and  data, which could improve call centers\u2019 abilities to handle overflow calls  and increase information sharing with first responders."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "911 Communications Process", "paragraphs": ["Generally speaking, 911 communications begin when a caller dials 911  using a landline, wireless, or Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)  system. Once a 911 caller places an emergency call, a communications  provider receives and routes the call to the appropriate call center, along  with the caller\u2019s phone number and location (i.e., street address for a  landline caller, approximate geographic location for a wireless caller, and  the subscriber\u2019s address for VoIP). Calls and data may be routed to 911  call centers using legacy methods (i.e., routing calls across traditional  telephone networks) or NG911 methods (i.e., routing calls and other data  through IP-networks). Once the call reaches a call center, trained call  takers and dispatchers determine the nature of the emergency and  dispatch first responders, typically using a variety of equipment and  systems, including call handling systems, mapping programs, and  computer aided dispatch. Figure 1 illustrates the 911 communications  and dispatch process.", "As illustrated in figure 1, NG911 systems use IP-networks capable of  carrying voice plus large amounts of data. These emergency-services  networks are typically deployed at the state or regional level with multiple  call centers connecting to the network. However, the existence of an IP- network alone does not constitute an NG911 system. As defined by  standards developed by the emergency communications community, an  NG911 system should have the capability to, among other things: provide a secure environment for emergency communications; acquire and integrate additional data for routing and answering calls; process all types of emergency calls, including multimedia messages;  transfer calls with added data to other call centers or first  responders.", "While NG911 systems must possess certain capabilities, it is important to  note that states and localities may make decisions about which  capabilities they intend to use to best meet their needs.

Operational changes can include the need  for additional training or the development of new policies and procedures  (e.g., new procedures for processing or storing multimedia). These  technical and operational changes may also have effects on 911 funding  and state and local governance structures, which we will discuss in more  detail later in this report.", "According to an FCC advisory body that examined NG911 systems  architecture in 2016, while NG911 systems are implemented in a variety  of ways at the state or local level, NG911 implementation can occur  gradually and in phases. According to this model, NG911  implementation occurs on a continuum that begins with legacy 911  systems and ends with a fully deployed NG911 national end-state where  all individual 911 call centers nationwide would be connected. The NG911  implementation model identifies activities that take place as part of the  NG911 transition, many of which occur concurrently, such as: planning (e.g., conducting feasibility studies, preparing databases,  establishing governance models); acquiring, testing, and implementing NG911 system elements (e.g.,  establishing an emergency-services IP-network, location-based call  routing, processing multimedia);  connecting call centers within a jurisdiction (i.e., jurisdictional end- state in which all call centers are fully NG911 operational, supported  by agreements, policies, and procedures); and  connecting NG911 systems nationwide (i.e., national end-state in  which all call centers in the nation are fully NG911 operational,  supported by agreements, policies, and procedures).", "In addition, because 911 services provide an essential function, the  implementation of NG911 generally involves using both the legacy  system and the NG911 system simultaneously for a period of time,  according to the FCC advisory body, to ensure 911 services are not  disrupted as new system elements are tested and implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State and Local Roles", "paragraphs": ["Deploying and operating 911 is the responsibility of 911 authorities at the  state and local level.

For example, we previously reported that some states  collect fees or charges for 911 and administer a statewide 911 program.  Other states authorize local entities to collect fees or charges for 911 and  administer 911 programs at the local level. Still other states use a  combination of these approaches. According to a panel of experts  convened by the National 911 Program, historically, 911 authority has  been coordinated and maintained locally with no requirement to  coordinate with other jurisdictions.

Additionally, as of the fall of 2017, none of the selected states we spoke  with were processing multimedia\u2014such as images or audio/video  recordings\u2014through their 911 systems due to concerns related to  privacy, liability, and the ability to store and manage these types of data,  among other things. The national survey data, based on responses from  45 states, measured the extent to which NG911 planning and acquisition  of NG911 equipment and services were occurring, and the extent to  which basic NG911 functions were operational at the state and local  levels in 2015.", "Planning: This measure includes state and local NG911 plans for  governance, funding, system components, and operations.

Additionally, FCC, NHTSA, and industry reports noted that state  and local financing strategies are generally insufficient to fully implement  NG911. Specifically, these reports note that the need to provide new  capital for NG911 implementation while simultaneously funding legacy  operational costs during the transition can strain state and local funding.", "Limited funding: Officials in three states told us that their current  funding may not be able to support the upfront costs of infrastructure  and equipment acquisitions associated with the transition to NG911.  Further, officials said they will need to simultaneously fund both the  new NG911 and legacy 911 systems currently in operation until the  NG911 systems are fully operational. To address these challenges, a  Minnesota official told us about how the state leveraged economies of  scale to reduce overall costs through cost sharing between multiple  call centers and of call centers consolidating operations from 114 to  104 call centers. Additionally, a Virginia official told us that to cover  the upfront costs of transitioning to NG911, the state plans to borrow  from the state treasury and then repay the treasury with future-year  fee collections.", "Fee diversion: Diversion of fees intended for 911 costs to non-911  activities may affect a state\u2019s or locality\u2019s ability to cover NG911  transition costs and necessitate identifying alternative funding  sources. The FCC\u2019s 2016 annual report on 911 fees indicates that for  calendar year 2015, all but two of the states that responded to FCC\u2019s  911 fee survey affirmed that their state or jurisdiction collects fees  from phone users to support or implement 911 services. State and  local authorities also determine how these 911 fees can be used.  FCC\u2019s report also indicated that eight states and Puerto Rico reported  diverting a total of more than $220 million (or approximately 8.4  percent) of 911 fees collected to non-911 purposes. Some of these  diverted funds were directed to other public safety programs, and  others were diverted to either non-public safety or unspecified  purposes. According to one state official, had it not been for 911 fees  being diverted to non-911 purposes, funding would have been  sufficient to cover the NG911 transition without having to go to the  state legislature for additional funding. However, officials in the other  eight selected states told us that either fee diversion was not an issue  in their state or that the diversion of funds had not affected their  state\u2019s ability to implement NG911.", "Evolving technology and operations: Officials in eight states told us  that the retirement of legacy infrastructure and the transition to IP-based  systems introduces new technical and operational challenges for call  centers and states, as well as for equipment and service providers.", "Interoperability: Officials in three selected states mentioned that  connecting to neighboring networks\u2014whether within or between  states\u2014could pose challenges. For example, officials mentioned that  states and localities may have obtained different equipment, software  applications, or service providers \u2013 all of which can make  interconnections difficult. Officials in Maine and New Hampshire told  us that differences in service providers can also be a challenge to  seamlessly connecting to neighboring systems. In an instance where  two states (Minnesota and North Dakota) have worked to connect  their 911 systems, both states used the same service provider, which  officials said allowed for fewer barriers to connection.", "Cyber risks: Officials in three states told us that the transition from a  traditional system that only transmits voice traffic to an IP-based  system that transmits voice and data traffic has significantly increased  the risk of a cyber-attack. This can be a challenge because managing  cyber risks is a new and evolving role for state and local 911  authorities. Approaching the transition to NG911 without managing  these risks could result in disrupted or disabled call center operations  and ultimately a delayed response to an emergency situation.", "Multimedia: Officials in three states mentioned potential  implementation challenges related to accepting and processing  multimedia such as audio recordings, images, and videos. More  specifically, one official said they did not have procedures to manage  or store these multimedia files once received. In addition, another  official raised privacy and liability concerns.", "Call routing: One of the core services of an NG911 system is the  ability to have calls routed to the appropriate call center based on a  wireless caller\u2019s physical location, instead of the location of the  cellular tower that receives and transmits the call. An FCC-sponsored  working group reported that there are several options for achieving  this and each option has unique positive and negative aspects. One  challenge officials in two states noted was that rather than a single,  nationwide approach to routing these calls, state and local 911  authorities would need to work individually with the wireless carriers to  determine how to best implement location-based call routing.", "Governance: FCC has noted that transitioning to NG911 will likely result  in new roles and levels of coordination between state 911 authorities,  local 911 authorities, 911 call centers, and 911 service providers. Further,  relationships among authorities at the state and local level may change  as states work to interconnect NG911 systems. State and local officials  noted that these types of governance challenges can apply in a variety of  situations, including within or between states.", "Evolving roles: As previously mentioned, 911 governance structures  vary among states. These varying governance structures may pose  different challenges. For example, some states have a centralized  structure in which a single government agency is responsible for  statewide 911 system\u2019s administration and policy. Officials in two  states told us that although they faced challenges transitioning to  NG911, their states\u2019 centralized 911 structure eased the transition in  their states because there was uniformity in policy and technology,  among other things, coming from a single statewide authority. In other  states, 911 systems are primarily a local responsibility and organized  with decentralized authorities and resources. In these instances, there  may be specific challenges related to transitioning to an  interconnected NG911 system. Such challenges may include the  need for increased levels of coordination among numerous  jurisdictions with potentially disparate organizational structures, levels  of funding, and priorities. An official also noted that there are  governance challenges related to connecting states and evolving  relationships between 911 authorities and service providers.", "Informing decision makers: One of the challenges identified by  officials in two states is differing levels of experience and  understanding by state and local officials as to what NG911 priorities  should be for timely implementation.

These standards state that management sets objectives in order to meet  the entity\u2019s mission, strategic plan, and goals and requirements of  applicable laws and regulations. In addition, our work on leading  practices for managing for results indicated that an agency\u2019s strategic  goals should also explain what results are expected from the agency and  when to expect those results. Further, these goals form a basis for an  entity to identify strategies to fulfill its mission and improve its operations  to support the achievement of that mission.", "As the lead entity for coordinating federal NG911 efforts, the National 911  Program faces a complex and challenging task of assisting the 911  community while the nation\u2019s 911 systems undergo a major  transformation.

According to the National 911 Program, a list of the  national-level tasks needed to advance NG911 implementation  nationwide has not been created to date. In addition, state officials we  spoke with said there are certain issues related to interoperability and  cybersecurity that federal agencies need to address before states can  connect their respective state NG911 systems. To address these issues,  NHTSA\u2019s National 911 Program issued a request for proposal (RFP) in  August 2017 for managing the roadmap development process and  awarded a contract in September 2017. While the National 911 Program  is taking steps to develop a National NG911 Roadmap, the program does  not have a plan to identify: (1) roles or responsibilities for federal entities  to carry out national-level tasks or (2) how the program plans to achieve  the roadmap\u2019s objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Clarifying Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA\u2019s NG911 roadmap RFP specifies that by identifying a list of  national-level tasks that are developed and adopted by the 911  stakeholder community, the roadmap could serve as a blueprint to carry  out these tasks and thereby ensure the interoperability of the nation\u2019s  NG911 system. However, the National 911 Program does not have plans  for the entities participating in the development of the roadmap to be  assigned roles and responsibilities for executing the roadmap\u2019s national- level tasks. National 911 Program officials told us the National 911  Program does not plan to assign roles and responsibilities because  NHTSA does not have the authority to require or assign tasks for other  entities. Additionally, program officials view the simultaneous identification  of tasks and assignments of responsibility for those tasks as a risk to  facilitating a candid and productive discussion with entities participating in  the roadmap initiative. However, officials stated it may be appropriate for  agencies participating in the roadmap initiative to perform specific tasks  after the roadmap is finalized. We have previously examined interagency  collaborative mechanisms and identified certain key issues for federal  agencies to consider when using these mechanisms to achieve results.
