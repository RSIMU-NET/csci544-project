In this report, GAO estimates (1) the percentage of all and large corporations that had no federal income tax liability and (2) average ETRs based on financial statement reporting and tax reporting. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed economic literature, analyzed IRS data for tax years 2006 to 2012 (the most recent data available), including the financial and tax information that large corporations report on Schedule M-3, and interviewed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) officials and subject matter experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In each year from 2006 to 2012, at least two-thirds of all active corporations had no federal income tax liability. Larger corporations were more likely to owe tax. Among large corporations (generally those with at least $10 million in assets) less than half\u201442.3 percent\u2014paid no federal income tax in 2012. Of those large corporations whose financial statements reported a profit, 19.5 percent paid no federal income tax that year. Reasons why even profitable corporations may have paid no federal tax in a given year include the use of tax deductions for losses carried forward from prior years and tax incentives, such as depreciation allowances that are more generous in the federal tax code than those allowed for financial accounting purposes. Corporations that did have a federal corporate income tax liability for tax year 2012 owed $267.5 billion.", "These reasons also explain why corporate effective tax rates (ETR) can differ substantially from statutory tax rates. ETRs attempt to measure taxes paid as a proportion of economic income, while statutory rates indicate the amount of tax liability (before any credits) relative to taxable income, which is defined by tax law and reflects tax benefits built into the law. The statutory tax rate on net corporate income ranges from 15 to 35 percent, depending on the amount of income earned. For tax years 2008 to 2012, profitable large U.S. corporations paid, on average, U.S. federal income taxes amounting to about 14 percent of the pretax net income that they reported in their financial statements (for those entities included in their tax returns).", "When foreign and state and local income taxes are included, the average ETR across all of those years increases to just over 22 percent. GAO also computed ETRs that combine large profitable corporations and those large corporations with current year losses, which pay little if any actual tax. Over tax years 2008 to 2012, all large corporations\u2014profitable and those that reported current year losses\u2014paid 25.9 percent of their pretax net income in U.S. federal income taxes, and 40.1 percent when foreign and state and local taxes are included. Including corporations with losses results in a more comprehensive estimate, but makes the results difficult to interpret because ETR is not meaningful for a corporation in a year in which it has a net loss. GAO could not examine the variation in ETRs across corporations with the aggregated data available, although GAO's prior work suggests that ETRs are likely to vary considerably."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO does not make recommendations in this report.

As policymakers  debate this issue, it will be helpful to also have an understanding of the  average effective tax rate (ETR) for corporations, which equals the  amount of income tax corporations pay divided by their pretax income.  ETRs are more appropriate measures of corporate tax burdens than  statutory rates because ETRs reflect the combined effects of exemptions,  deferrals, tax credits, and other tax benefits. Our previous report on  corporate ETRs found that in 2010, whether for all large corporations or  only profitable ones, the average ETRs were significantly below the  statutory rate.", "As Congress continues discussions on corporate tax reform and what  burden corporations should bear, you asked us to assess the extent to  which U.S. corporations pay federal income tax and the percentage that  had no federal income tax liability.

The Schedule M-3  reconciles income and expense amounts that corporations report for  financial statement purposes with amounts they report for tax purposes,  and is the data source we used for analyzing ETRs, as described below.  We report data for all corporations for tax years 2006 to 2012, for all  Schedule M-3 filers for tax years 2006 to 2012, and for profitable  Schedule M-3 filers for tax years 2008 to 2012.

Consequently, the scope of the  corporate entities included in our analysis can differ from the scope of the  entities included in publicly filed financial statements because not all  foreign entities represented in those statements are included in a federal  tax return. In addition, our estimates of effective tax rates remain limited  to corporations with assets of $10 million or more because those are the  ones that filed a Schedule M-3. Our analysis covers all large corporations  for tax years 2006 to 2012 and profitable large corporations (i.e., those  that did not report net losses in their financial statements) for tax years  2008 to 2012.

It also includes net income that  corporations earn in the form of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, and  realized capital gains. The statutory rate of tax on net corporate income  ranges from 15 to 35 percent, depending on the amount of income  earned. The United States taxes the worldwide income of domestic  corporations, regardless of where the income is earned, but allows a  foreign tax credit for certain taxes paid to other countries. The timing of  the tax liability depends on several factors. For example, income earned  by foreign subsidiaries is generally not taxed until it is distributed\u2014such  as in the form of a dividend\u2014to the U.S. parent corporation.  Another  important element of the U.S. corporate income tax system is the  treatment of losses incurred in a given tax year. If a corporation has a net  operating loss in a particular year, the corporation may carry those losses  forward into future tax years or backward into prior tax years. When  carried back, corporations can deduct those losses from taxable income  and are eligible for a refund equal to the difference between previously  paid taxes and taxes owed after deducting the current year\u2019s loss. Losses  carried forward may be used to reduce future taxable income and tax  liabilities, but cannot be used to reduce taxable income below zero. As a  result, a corporation with a substantial loss in a particular year may claim  deductions stemming from that loss over a number of years in the future.", "While corporate income taxes have declined markedly as a share of  gross domestic product since the 1950s, they remain an important source  of federal revenue. In fiscal year 2014, corporate income tax revenue as a  share of gross domestic product was 1.9 percent and totaled $321 billion.  By comparison, revenues from individual income taxes and from social  insurance and retirement receipts (e.g., Medicare) were $1.4 trillion and  $1.02 trillion, respectively, in that year. Corporate income taxes  accounted for 10.6 percent of all federal revenues in 2014, up from 6.6  percent in 2009, but still below their recent high of 14.7 percent in 2006  (see figure 1)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial and Tax Reporting Requirements for Corporations", "paragraphs": ["Businesses operating as publicly traded corporations in the United States  are required to report the income they earn and the expenses (including  taxes) they incur each year according to two separate standards. First,  corporations must produce financial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles in order to provide certain  information to investors and creditors. The income and expense items  reported in these statements are commonly known as book items.  Second, U.S. corporations must file corporate income tax returns on  which they report income, expenses, and tax liabilities, according to rules  set out in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and associated Department of  the Treasury regulations. While the IRC generally requires that a  corporation\u2019s taxable year and overall method of accounting conform to  those standards used for financial reporting purposes, specific differences  are permitted (and, in some cases, required). These are known as book- tax differences. One important source of book-tax differences is  incentives for investment and other specific activities that Congress has  chosen to incorporate into the tax code. For example, the bonus  depreciation allowance permits businesses to depreciate qualified capital  assets much more rapidly than they are permitted to do under financial  accounting. As a result, taxable income will be reduced by a greater  amount than will book income for the year in which the qualified  investment is made. However, in later years (until the asset is completely  depreciated), book income will be reduced by greater amounts than will  taxable income.", "Corporations with assets that equal or exceed $10 million are required to  report these book-tax differences to IRS on the Schedule M-3 of their  income tax returns.

Average effective tax rates  attempt to measure taxes paid as a proportion of economic income. By  contrast, the marginal effective tax rate focuses on the tax burden  associated with a specific investment (usually over the full life of that  investment), and thus is a better measure of the effects that taxes have  on incentives to invest. Meanwhile, statutory rates determine the amount  of tax liability (before any credits) relative to taxable income, which is  defined by tax law and reflects tax benefits and subsidies built into the  law.

In tax year 2012, 70.1 percent of the 1.62 million active  corporations had no federal income tax liability with the peak coming in  2009 near the end of the recession.

Large  corporations were less likely to have incurred losses. In each year during  that period, between 34.9 percent and 44.2 percent of Schedule M-3 filers  had negative net tax income. A second reason is that other corporations  had positive net tax income that was completely offset by net operating  loss deductions (NOLD) carried forward from prior tax years. In each year  from 2008 to 2012, approximately 15 to 19 percent of all active  corporations had their income completely offset in this manner. Similar  percentages of all and profitable large corporations had their income  completely offset by NOLDs from 2008 to 2012. The use of federal tax  credits appears to have had little effect on the number of corporations that  paid no tax in each year (this does not imply that these credits did not  significantly reduce the amount of tax that some corporations paid).

These rates were 2.6 percentage points higher than the unadjusted rates  (see figure 3).", "Even with the adjustment for NOLDs, these ETRs remain well below the  top statutory federal income tax rate of 35 percent for a number of  reasons. First, to the extent that corporations have foreign-source income  on which they have paid tax to foreign governments, their U.S. federal  income tax will be reduced by the foreign tax credit. Also, as noted earlier,  tax incentives, such as the bonus depreciation allowance, will cause  taxable income (on which the actual federal tax is based) to be less than  book income (which is the denominator of the ETR).

On  average, over tax years 2008 to 2012, all large corporations actually paid  25.9 percent of their pretax net income in U.S. federal income taxes. The  inclusion of large corporations with losses raises federal ETRs between 3  and 15 percentage points higher than those of large profitable  corporations for years in which ETRs are calculated for both, including tax  years 2009 to 2012. This increase occurs because firms with current year  losses, which pay little if any actual tax, have a negligible effect on the  numerator of the ETR, but their losses can significantly reduce the pretax  net book income in the denominator. For example, in tax year 2009,  profitable large corporations had pretax net book income of $1.187 trillion,  while unprofitable large corporations had net current year losses of $619  billion, netting to a pretax book income of $568 billion. The inclusion of  large corporations with current year losses in that year more than doubles  the ETR based on actual federal taxes paid in comparison to the rate for  only profitable large corporations.

As we noted, the first set of estimates  provides meaningful information for an important population of firms  without the distortion caused by the losses of other corporations. The  second set of estimates covers a more comprehensive population of  firms; however, an ETR is not meaningful for a corporation in a year in  which it has a net loss. Consequently, it is not clear how to interpret  average ETRs for populations that include some corporations with net  income and others with net losses for a given year. The simplified  example in table 1 demonstrates the nature of this problem. In this  example, Corporation A is profitable in all years, while Corporation B  incurs losses in the first 2 years, which it then offsets against its income in  the third year. A weighted average ETR based on the combined data for  the two corporations for all 3 years provides an accurate representation at  the aggregate level of the tax burden on income earned in those 3 years  (35 percent). However, when the time period is limited so that not all  losses can be used during the period, the estimates do not give an  accurate representation of the longer term rates. The average for the first  2 years (70 percent) overstates the burden because it does not include  the income against which Corporation B\u2019s losses during these 2 years is  actually offset. Instead, those losses offset a completely different  corporation\u2019s income. Conversely, the average for the last 2 years (26.3  percent) understates the burden over the 3-year period because losses  incurred outside of the 2-year period are used to reduce tax payments  during the period. The types of distortions shown in this example arise at  the beginning and end of any finite period of analysis.  losses would be to reduce pretax net book income in the denominator by  the amount of NOLDs used in that year. The estimate that results from  this approach shows the ETRs on the portion of current-year income that  was not offset by prior-year losses. As seen in table 2, compared with our  original actual taxes paid ETRs for profitable corporations, the estimates  that are adjusted for NOLDs are slightly higher. None of these ETRs for  corporations that are profitable in a given year is meant to represent the  tax burden averaged across all corporations (both profitable and  unprofitable ones).", "In commenting on our May 2013 report on ETRs, at least one person  stated that ETRs for the full population of corporations are more  appropriate for policymakers.

These measures do not include  income earned by foreign subsidiaries or the taxes that those foreign  subsidiaries pay, except in the cases where that income is repatriated to  U.S. corporations in the form of dividends or falls into certain categories  of income that are taxed immediately under federal tax rules. In the  remainder of this section, we compare the data on worldwide taxes  available to us for this report with the data we used for our previous  report.", "First, we need to describe some of the relevant U.S. tax rules applying to  foreign-source income. The United States taxes domestic corporations on  their worldwide income, regardless of where it is earned. A U.S.  corporation may directly or indirectly own shares of stock of other  corporations both foreign and domestic; if the U.S. corporation owns all or  a significant number of shares of stock, it may be considered a parent  and the other corporation a subsidiary.  In general, a U.S. taxpayer who  owns stock in a corporation is not taxed on income earned by the  corporation when it is earned, but taxed when it is distributed to the  taxpayer, such as in the form of dividends. When the taxpayer is a U.S.  corporation and it owns shares of a foreign corporation in a jurisdiction  with a lower corporate tax rate than that of the United States, this can  result in what is known as deferral. However, the Internal Revenue Code  (IRC) has antideferral provisions which limit deferral in certain  circumstances. For example, if a foreign entity is a Controlled Foreign  Corporation, as defined in statute, then certain U.S. shareholders, such  as parent corporations, are taxed on their share of certain income earned  by the Controlled Foreign Corporation when it is earned. The income of a  Controlled Foreign Corporation to be included in U.S. shareholders\u2019  income includes the income defined in subpart F (often called Subpart F  income) and earnings of the Controlled Foreign Corporation invested in  U.S. property. Major types of Subpart F income include income from  passive investments, income from transactions with entities related to the  Controlled Foreign Corporation, and insurance income as well as certain  other easily manipulated income, which are ineligible for deferral. When  income is deemed to be received by the U.S. corporation in this way, it  may have already been taxed in the foreign country where it was earned.", "The IRC allows U.S. parent corporations to claim a foreign tax credit for  taxes paid to other countries so that foreign source income, such as  repatriated dividends and Subpart F income, is not taxed twice. This  results in U.S. corporations paying federal income tax on foreign-source  income only to the extent that the federal income tax on that income  exceeds the foreign tax credit. Section 78 of the IRC requires U.S.  corporations electing to claim the foreign tax credit to \u201cgross-up\u201d (i.e.,  increase) their dividend income by the amount of creditable foreign  income taxes associated with the dividends they received. Similar  requirements apply to Subpart F income.", "For our prior report we did not have data relating to the amount of foreign  tax credits claimed by our population of profitable large corporations. As  a substitute for the amount of foreign taxes paid, we used the current  foreign tax expenses and foreign withholding tax expenses that the  taxpayers reported in their financial statements. In the case of repatriated  dividends, our measure included foreign taxes paid on the dividends  themselves, but not any foreign tax paid on the subsidiaries\u2019 income out  of which the dividends were paid. In the latest data we obtained from the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS), we do have amounts for the foreign tax  credits claimed in 2012 by the profitable corporations. The new data also  enabled us to make reliable estimates of the foreign tax credits claimed in  2010 and 2011; however, we could not make similar estimates for earlier  years.", "Although this new measure includes the most comprehensive measure of  foreign taxes available in our database, it does not achieve a perfect  alignment between the taxes included in the numerator and the income  included in the denominator. Nevertheless, after discussions with  analysts from IRS and Department of the Treasury, we concluded that  this new measure represents the closest alignment between income and  the taxes paid thereon that is possible with the aggregated Schedule M-3  data available to us. More importantly, as we mentioned in the body of  our report, regardless of the adjustments we make above, our worldwide  ETR estimates do not represent a comprehensive worldwide ETR. They  do not account for income not repatriated by Controlled Foreign  Corporations and the foreign taxes paid on that income. Data do not exist  to measure both the complete worldwide income of U.S. corporate groups  and the actual taxes that they pay. A truly comprehensive rate could be  either higher or lower than the ones we report. The rate of foreign tax paid  on income that Controlled Foreign Corporations choose to repatriate may  be higher than the rate paid on foreign income that is not repatriated.  Since the U.S. tax system provides a foreign tax credit to U.S.  corporations on foreign taxes paid when income is repatriated, it may  create an incentive for Controlled Foreign Corporations to repatriate  income earned in high tax countries, so that U.S. parent corporations can  claim the full foreign tax credit amount. In contrast, as the foreign tax rate  decreases, the U.S. tax due when the income is repatriated increases,  creating a disincentive to repatriate income earned in low tax countries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Summary of Selected Past Estimates of Average Effective Tax Rates Based on Financial Statement Data", "paragraphs": ["We used the criteria in our May 2013 report for selecting studies that  included estimates of corporate effective tax rates (ETR).
