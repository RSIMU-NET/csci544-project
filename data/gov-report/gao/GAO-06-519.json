The east and Gulf coasts are relatively low-hazard areas. While high-hazard areas have been identified, limited information exists on the likely impacts of a tsunami in those areas. Some coastal areas lack inundation maps showing the potential extent of tsunami flooding in communities, and others have maps that may be unreliable. State assessments of likely tsunami impacts on people and infrastructure have been limited, in part, due to a lack of tsunami loss estimation software, as exists for floods and other hazards. Although federal warning centers quickly detect potential tsunamis and issue warnings, false alarms and warning system limitations hamper their effectiveness. Some state and local emergency managers have raised concerns about false alarms--the 16 warnings issued since 1982 were not followed by destructive tsunamis on U.S. shores--potentially causing citizens to ignore future warnings. Furthermore, limitations in the Emergency Alert System and NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards may impede timely warnings to communities. For example, signal coverage for these two systems is insufficient to transmit warnings to some coastal areas and failure to properly activate them has resulted in warnings being delayed or not transmitted to some locations. NOAA has begun addressing false alarms but, according to agency officials, lacking the states' permission elsewhere, has only conducted \"live\" end-to-end testing of the warning systems in Alaska to identify problems. The at-risk communities GAO visited have mitigated potential tsunami impacts through planning, warning system improvements, public education, and infrastructure protection, but the level of implementation varies considerably by location. Most of the states and some communities GAO visited have basic mitigation plans identifying tsunami hazards. While all of these locations have multiple warning mechanisms in place, disruptions to key infrastructure such as telephone lines may hamper timely warnings. Furthermore, key educational efforts, such as distributing evacuation maps and developing school curricula have not been consistently implemented. In addition, few states and communities protect critical infrastructure from tsunamis through land-use and building design restrictions. Emergency managers attributed variability in their efforts to the need to focus on more frequent hazards like wildfires and to funding limitations. Furthermore, few communities participate in NOAA's preparedness program, according to NOAA officials, because they perceive the threat of a tsunami to be low. The nationwide expansion of NOAA's tsunami-related activities and NTHMP is under way; however, the future direction of these efforts is uncertain because they lack long-range strategic plans. NOAA has yet to identify long-range goals, establish risk-based priorities, and define performance measures to assess whether its tsunami-related efforts are achieving the desired results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 killed more than 200,000  The Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004 killed more than 200,000  people, displaced more than 1.5 million, and caused significant damage in  people, displaced more than 1.5 million, and caused significant damage in  12 countries in Asia and East Africa.

A tsunami wave may be very small in the deep ocean, but as it  approaches land can increase to tens of feet in height and reach shore as a  fast-moving wall of turbulent water. Tsunamis pose an inundation threat to  low-lying coastal communities from multiple destructive waves that can  penetrate far inland. Tsunamis are categorized as either distant or local.  Distant tsunamis travel long distances from their triggering events to strike  the coast hours later, allowing time to warn and evacuate threatened  communities. Local tsunamis strike the coast minutes after their near- shore triggering event, allowing little time for warning and evacuation.  However, the frequency of damaging tsunamis in the United States has  been low, compared with other natural hazards, such as hurricanes,  earthquakes, and floods.", "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) manages  federal tsunami detection and warning efforts. NOAA\u2019s National Weather  Service (NWS) operates two tsunami warning centers whose staff monitor  seismic data and, based on the location and magnitude of earthquakes,  issue warnings when tsunamis are likely. The warning centers transmit a  tsunami warning message to NWS forecast offices and state emergency  management centers, among others. NWS forecast offices transmit the  warning over NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards (NOAA Weather Radio)  and the Emergency Alert System. NOAA Weather Radio is a nationwide  network of radio stations broadcasting continuous weather information,  including warnings, watches, forecasts and other hazard information, 24  hours a day directly from NWS weather forecast offices. The Federal  Communication Commission\u2019s Emergency Alert System, designed to  provide the President a means to communicate with the American people  in the event of an emergency, can decode and retransmit NOAA Weather  Radio warning messages over radio and television broadcast and cable  systems.", "Federal, state, and local government agencies are all involved in efforts to  reduce the potential impacts of tsunamis through education, hazard  assessment, mitigation planning, and other activities. For example, NOAA  operates a tsunami preparedness recognition program known as  TsunamiReady that encourages communities to educate citizens on  tsunami hazards, develop tsunami hazard plans, and establish local  warning systems, among other things. In addition, NOAA provides  leadership and funding for the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation  Program (NTHMP). This program, initiated in 1996, has been a partnership  between NOAA; the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS); the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); and five states\u2014Alaska,  California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington\u2014to assess tsunami hazards,  improve and coordinate tsunami warning systems, and develop state and  local hazard mitigation programs. For example, under the NTHMP, NOAA  provides funding and technical support to help the states produce  inundation maps showing the extent to which coastal areas may be  flooded by a tsunami. Communities use these maps to help identify people  and property at-risk and to develop strategies for mitigating the hazard.  Furthermore, the Stafford Act, as amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act  of 2000, requires all states and localities to develop FEMA-approved  hazard mitigation plans to qualify for certain disaster relief funding. These  plans provide a framework for states and communities to assess their  vulnerability to all hazards and, if a significant tsunami threat exists,  develop approaches to reduce tsunami impacts on people and  infrastructure within their jurisdictions.", "In May 2005, the Congress appropriated $17.24 million in supplemental  funds for NOAA to expand and improve its tsunami detection capabilities,  enhance warning center operations and facilities, produce tsunami  inundation forecast models, and expand the TsunamiReady program  participation nationwide. In fiscal year 2006, $9.82 million in  appropriations were designated for tsunami-related activities, and NOAA  requested $21.66 million for fiscal year 2007. NOAA is initially spending  these funds primarily on enhancing its tsunami detection capabilities, for  example, by expanding its network of Deep-ocean Assessment and  Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) detection stations in the Pacific Ocean to  39 stations covering the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean  Sea.", "To address questions regarding the status of national tsunami  preparedness, this report (1) identifies U.S. coastal areas facing the  greatest tsunami hazard and the extent to which potential tsunami impacts  on people and infrastructure have been assessed; (2) discusses the  effectiveness of the existing federal tsunami warning system; (3) describes  ongoing local, state, and federal agency efforts to mitigate the potential  impacts of tsunamis on coastal communities; and (4) assesses NOAA\u2019s  efforts to develop long-range plans for federal tsunami programs.", "In conducting our work, we visited the states participating in the  NTHMP\u2014Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington\u2014as well as  Puerto Rico and Florida.

To identify the U.S. coastal areas facing the  greatest tsunami hazard and the extent to which their vulnerability to  tsunami impacts has been assessed, we reviewed historic and seismic data  and analysis from NOAA and other federal and state sources. For the  states facing the greatest tsunami hazards, we determined the extent to  which tsunami inundation maps identifying the potential vulnerability of  people and infrastructure have been prepared, and reviewed each state\u2019s  FEMA-approved, all-hazard mitigation plan to determine how and to what  extent tsunami impacts have been assessed.", "To discuss the effectiveness of the current federal tsunami warning  system, we visited both of NOAA\u2019s tsunami warning centers and met with  officials to discuss how they conduct their detection and warning  responsibilities and how they measure their effectiveness.

Tsunami generating earthquakes usually occur in  subduction zones, such as those found in the Pacific Ocean off the U.S.  western and Alaskan coasts, as well as in the Caribbean. Marked by deep  trenches in the seafloor, subduction zones are formed where one of the  earth\u2019s outer shell of tectonic plates plunges underneath another. Usually  the plates are gradually moving past each other, but friction may  temporarily lock them together, causing stress to build up between the  plates. Sometimes the stress is relieved suddenly in the form of a large  earthquake. As shown in figure 1, the bottom plate dives farther down,  snapping the top plate violently upward, disturbing the overlying seawater.  The size of the resulting tsunami depends on a complex set of factors,  including the size of the earthquake, its depth below the ocean floor, the  depth of the water, the type and amount of seafloor movement and the  energy released.", "Once generated, some tsunami waves move quickly inland while other  waves head toward the open ocean, often at speeds up to 600 miles per  hour. Therefore, a tsunami generated by an earthquake off the coast of  Alaska would be a local tsunami for that state\u2019s coastal areas, and could  strike within minutes of the event, while the same event is considered a  distant tsunami for the coast of Washington state, which would not likely  be hit until 3 or more hours later.", "While tsunamis can be a high impact natural hazard, the frequency of  damaging tsunamis in the United States has been low, compared with  other natural hazards. According to NOAA\u2019s records, the last tsunami  causing significant impacts was at Skagway, Alaska, in November 1994,  where the landslide and associated tsunami caused one death and $25  million in damages.  According to FEMA, flooding, severe storms, and  hurricanes are the most common and costly causes of disaster  declarations in the United States; at least 10 such events since 1989 have  each required FEMA relief expenditures in excess of a billion dollars.  Although damaging tsunamis are relatively rare, the devastation caused by  the Indian Ocean tsunami demonstrates the need for assessing the threat,  and for monitoring and preparing for an event in at-risk areas, particularly  low-lying, seismically active coastal areas.", "The West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska, is  responsible for warning Alaska, the west coast and east coast states, and  states along the Gulf of Mexico, while the Richard H. Hagemeyer, Pacific  Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, Hawaii, is responsible for warning  Hawaii and U.S. territories in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. These  warning centers use two types of data for determining when to issue a  tsunami warning. First, they receive and analyze earthquake data from  seismic networks operated by NOAA, USGS, the states, and universities to  determine whether to issue a warning. If the seismic data indicate that a  local tsunami may be generated, the responsible warning center issues a  warning based on the earthquake data alone. Second, the warning centers  analyze sea-level data to determine whether a tsunami has actually been  generated, and if not, cancel the warning. The centers receive sea-level  data through a network of DART stations and sea-level gauges, as shown  in figure 2. DART stations consist of a seafloor bottom-pressure recording  system that is capable of detecting tsunamis smaller than 1 inch and is  connected to a surface buoy that transmits the data by satellite to NOAA.  Scientists at the warning centers incorporate the data from the DART  stations into tsunami forecast models to estimate the size of the expected  waves and the potential impact on coastal areas. The tsunami warning  centers have used forecast models they developed, as well as models  developed by NOAA\u2019s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, which  produce expected tsunami inundations at nine high-risk locations.", "A network of federal, state, and local government agencies are responsible  for ensuring that a tsunami warning reaches the public. Figure 3 provides  an overview of the key components of this process. The federal tsunami  warning centers send a warning to NWS forecast offices and state  emergency management centers by multiple means, such as FEMA\u2019s  National Warning System, a dedicated telephone hotline, and NWS\u2019s  satellite-based National Weather Wire Service. The forecast offices, in  turn, transmit the warning over NOAA Weather Radio and the Emergency  Alert System (EAS). State emergency managers receive tsunami warnings  from NWS and then warn counties and local communities using multiple  methods, including a dedicated telephone network for state and local  emergency management officials. Finally, county and local officials are  responsible for warning the public and issuing evacuation orders, using a  variety of methods including bullhorns, sirens, and telephone systems.", "Federal, state, and local government agencies also conduct hazard  mitigation activities to reduce the potential impacts of tsunamis. At the  federal level, NWS operates the TsunamiReady community recognition  program. Initiated in 2000, TsunamiReady is modeled after NWS\u2019s  StormReady program for hurricanes and tornados. NWS meteorologists in  regional forecast offices are responsible for reviewing applications from  coastal communities and ensuring that they meet program requirements in  conjunction with state emergency management officials. NOAA also  provides a chairperson and funding for the NTHMP. From 1998 through  2001, NOAA provided $2.3 million annually for the NTHMP, increasing to  $4.3 million annually in 2002 through 2005, and returning to $2.3 million in  2006. Initially, the five participating states each received less than $100,000  annually from the NTHMP, but in recent years they have each received  approximately $275,000 annually to directly supplement their individual  mitigation efforts, while NOAA and the other federal partners used the  remaining funds to support their own activities under the program. NOAA  estimates that since the program\u2019s inception the states have matched the  NTHMP funding by a ratio of six state in-kind or dollar contributions for  every program dollar."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Tsunami Hazard Is Greatest in the Pacific States and Caribbean Territories, but the Potential Impacts Have Not Been Comprehensively Assessed", "paragraphs": ["Tsunamis pose the greatest hazard to the coastal areas of the five states  bordering the Pacific Ocean and U.S. territories in the Caribbean, but for  many of these areas reliable, comprehensive assessments of potential  tsunami impacts on people and infrastructure have not been completed.

The hazard levels are primarily based on  tsunami source, height, and frequency information since 1900\u2014the most  reliable and accurate information available\u2014from NOAA\u2019s National  Geophysical Data Center tsunami database.", "According to NOAA, Hawaii is a high-hazard area for distant and local  tsunamis. Hawaii has experienced many destructive tsunamis because of  its location in the Pacific Ocean, as shown in figure 4, where about 80  percent of all recorded tsunamis have occurred. More than one-half of all  tsunamis recorded in the Hawaiian Islands were generated in the distant  Aleutian regions of the northern and northwestern Pacific Ocean, and  about one-fourth were generated along the western coast of South  America. Hawaii\u2019s local tsunami threat stems from earthquake and  volcanic activity, which cause underwater landslides off the coast. Hawaii  suffered its greatest tsunami death and destruction in 1946, when an  earthquake in the Aleutian Islands generated a tsunami that reportedly  killed 159 people. Hilo, Hawaii suffered the greatest loss\u201496 deaths and  the destruction of its waterfront area. Since 1946, an additional five  tsunamis\u2014four distant and one local\u2014have caused a reported 63 deaths  and widespread destruction.", "NOAA considers the west coast a high-hazard area for distant tsunamis  and medium-hazard area for local tsunamis. Like Hawaii, the west coast  historically has suffered the most destruction from tsunamis generated by  Pacific earthquakes in the distant South America and Aleutian regions. In  California, two tsunamis have caused significant damage. The 1960  Chilean earthquake caused estimated tsunami damages of over $1 million,  and the tsunami generated by the 1964 Alaskan event killed 12 in Northern  California and caused an estimated $15 million in destruction, including  damages inside San Francisco Bay. Oregon and Washington both have  sustained damages in coastal areas from distant tsunamis over the years.  Although distant tsunamis historically have been most common, a local  tsunami generated by the 750 mile long Cascadia subduction zone, lying  just 50 to 100 miles off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and Northern  California, is considered a major threat. (See fig. 5.) Geologic and other  records from a Cascadia earthquake in 1700 suggest that the fault could  generate a tsunami wave of up to 30 feet that would likely reach the  Oregon coast in 15 to 30 minutes, raising concerns of a catastrophic future  event.", "Alaska is a high-hazard area for local tsunamis, but a low-hazard area for  distant tsunamis, according to NOAA. The local tsunami threat to Alaska is  caused by seismic activity in the Aleutian subduction zone where the  Pacific and North-American tectonic plates collide, as shown in figure 6.  Tsunamis generated by earthquake induced landslides occurring inside  bays have been responsible for most death and damage in Alaska. The  1964 Alaskan earthquake triggered several tsunamis that in some cases  struck land within 2 minutes of being generated. The tsunamis caused 106  deaths in Alaska and caused significant damage in the towns of Kodiak,  Seward, Whittier, and Valdez. Only once has a distant tsunami caused  damage in Alaska; the 1960 Chilean earthquake caused relatively minor  tsunami impacts on Alaskan harbors.", "The Caribbean area, including the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the  U.S. Virgin Islands, is a high-hazard area for local tsunamis but a low- hazard area for distant tsunamis, according to NOAA. The local tsunami  threat posed to the islands comes primarily from the potential for  earthquakes and underwater landslides in the Puerto Rico Trench  subduction zone that lies to the north of both Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands, as shown in figure 7. Puerto Rico\u2019s most devastating event  of the last century occurred in 1918, when an earthquake off the northwest  coast generated a tsunami of more than 15 feet, causing an estimated 140  deaths and about $4 million in property damages. In the town of Aguadilla,  nearly 300 homes were destroyed. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, an 1867  earthquake in the Anegada Trench sent destructive waves into the harbor  of Charlotte Amelie on the island of Saint Thomas, destroying boats, the  wharf, and the waterfront.", "According to NOAA, the Atlantic and Gulf state coasts are relatively low- hazard areas for distant or local tsunamis, with few reliable reports of  tsunami waves of any size ever reaching either coast. This is a  consequence of the low level of tsunami generating seismic activity  nearby\u2014the nearest subduction zones are in the Caribbean. Historically,  none of the tsunamis generated in the Atlantic Ocean region has  significantly affected the east coast of the United States. For example, the  1929 Grand Banks earthquake-induced landslide caused a tsunami which  killed 29 in Newfoundland but only resulted in a wave height of 1 foot on  the U.S. coast, and a distant tsunami generated by a massive earthquake  near Lisbon, Portugal in 1755 had no observed impact on the U.S. coast.  The potential distant threat from the collapse of a volcanic island off the  coast of Africa is the subject of scientific debate, and the potential for a  local tsunami-generating collapse of the continental shelf off of the east  coast is being investigated but is unconfirmed. Regarding the Gulf coast,  an earthquake in the Caribbean is considered the most likely source of a  tsunami; however, scientists believe that Florida and Cuba protect the Gulf  from Caribbean tsunamis and that the Gulf is unlikely to propagate a large,  destructive tsunami wave."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Tsunami Impacts on People and Infrastructure Have Not Been Comprehensively or Reliably Assessed", "paragraphs": ["Because inundation maps are the foundation for evaluating the potential  impacts of tsunami events, producing such maps has been a high priority  since 1996 for NOAA and the five states participating in the NTHMP.

Initially, the NTHMP planned to use  relatively simple modeling technology because this approach would  require fewer resources than the more advanced technique, known as two- dimensional modeling, which requires detailed seafloor and coastal terrain  data to accurately model wave action and impact. Upon comparison of  these two technologies, the NTHMP decided in December 1996 to use two- dimensional modeling techniques for all mapping. While the NTHMP  members recognized that adopting two-dimensional modeling would  reduce the pace of modeling and mapping, they agreed that the decision  would result in products of improved detail, quality, and reliability.", "Consequently, in the five states participating in the NTHMP, some coastal  areas currently do not have two-dimensional tsunami inundation maps,  while other coastal areas have inundation maps that predate current  modeling standards and therefore may not be reliable.

According to FEMA  risk assessment guidance, after mapping how and where hazards will  impact an area, planners should determine what elements of the  population, infrastructure, and economy will be impacted by the hazards  and estimate the potential losses that could occur. According to FEMA,  estimating losses is essential for decision making at all levels of  government, including providing a basis for developing mitigation plans  and policies, emergency preparedness, and response and recovery  planning.", "Each of the five Pacific region states, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands, have identified tsunamis as a hazard in their FEMA- approved, all-hazard mitigation plans. To obtain FEMA approval, states  are required to describe and estimate losses\u2014based on their own and  local jurisdiction assessments\u2014for state-owned or -operated buildings,  infrastructure, and critical facilities in areas subject to hazards. According  to FEMA, the agency deliberately took the approach of not being highly  prescriptive regarding the development of the plans\u2014focusing its  requirements more on what should be done rather than how it should be  done\u2014in recognition of the inherent differences among states in terms of  size, resources, capabilities, and vulnerability. For example, states are  highly encouraged, but not required, to consider impacts on vulnerable  populations, in particular elderly, disabled, and low-income persons, and  to analyze the potential economic and human impact that each hazard  would have statewide. FEMA also encourages the use of several tools in  preparing damage assessments, such as HAZUS-MH (Hazards U.S.\u2014Multi- Hazard), which is standardized computer software for comprehensively  estimating the likely human, structural, and economic damages from  earthquakes, floods, and hurricane winds. However, HAZUS-MH does not  include a tsunami loss estimation module; and according to FEMA, there is  no similarly reliable tool for estimating tsunami losses.", "The National Science and Technology Council\u2019s December 2005 report on  tsunami risk reduction specifically called for FEMA, NOAA, and USGS to  take responsibility for developing a coordinated risk-assessment tool\u2014 e.g., HAZUS\u2014for effective use in tsunami risk assessments. The National  Institute of Building Sciences\u2014which produced the existing HAZUS-MH  software for other hazards in partnership with FEMA\u2014has estimated that  developing tsunami loss estimation methods and software would take  about 3 years, at a cost of up to $10 million. A standardized tsunami loss  estimation tool would not only help the existing five NTHMP-member  states conduct risk assessments, but it would also be useful to any  additional states joining the NTHMP as it expands into a national program;  and it could also help the NTHMP and NOAA prioritize tsunami activities  to focus on the areas most vulnerable to tsunami losses.", "Because of the lack of tsunami inundation maps, the variability in  approaches that was allowed in the all-hazard plans, and the lack of a  standardized tsunami loss estimation tool, some at-risk states have not  specifically assessed potential tsunami impacts, while other at-risk states  or territories have produced assessments that do not provide complete  loss information for all areas. Consequently, emergency managers in the  at-risk states and territories do not have comprehensive information on  how many and what types of structures would be exposed and damaged,  how many people would likely be injured or killed, or the extent of likely  short- and long-term economic impacts in the event of a tsunami.

Based on historical tsunami  frequency information from the 1700\u2019s to the present, and estimates of  current daily beach attendance, NOAA\u2019s analysis suggests that while large  tsunamis occur more often in the Pacific region, over a 100-year time  frame, the potential loss of life in the Caribbean and Florida regions could  be greater due to higher beach attendance in these warm water locations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Warning Centers Quickly Detect Potential Tsunamis, but Warning Systems Have Limitations", "paragraphs": ["NWS\u2019s two tsunami warning centers quickly detect potential tsunamis and  issue warnings, but the effectiveness of these warnings has been  hampered by frequent false alarms and limitations in the federal systems  that transmit warnings to the local level.

Based on warning center data, the centers issued timely warning bulletins,  generally within 5 to 10 minutes for local events. The tsunami warning  centers have consistently reduced their average annual time to issue  bulletins\u2014from 11 minutes in 1996 to 6.4 minutes in 2005 for the center in  Alaska, and from 16 minutes in 1996 to 4.5 minutes in 2005 for the center  in Hawaii. According to tsunami warning center officials, more and better  quality seismic data, as well as improved analysis techniques and  computer equipment over the last decade, have enabled faster bulletin  issuance.", "While the warning centers are able to detect potential tsunamis and issue  timely warnings, some state and local officials have raised concerns about  their accuracy and reliability due to false alarms. No destructive tsunami  has reached U.S. shores following any of the 16 warnings\u2014primarily for  local tsunamis\u2014issued to states by the warning centers since 1982.  According to warning center officials, their responsibility to provide timely  warnings requires them to broadcast warnings based on limited,  preliminary earthquake information before any resulting tsunami wave is  actually observed. However, according to emergency response experts,  such false alarms can generate costly, potentially dangerous evacuations  and may cause people to ignore critical warnings in the future. For  example, according to the state of Hawaii\u2019s most recent estimate, an  evacuation from a tsunami false alarm in 1996 would have cost the state  $58.2 million in economic losses, or\u2014adjusted for inflation\u2014about $71  million in 2006 dollars.", "According to some state and local emergency management officials, a  false alarm occurred in June 2005, when they received a tsunami warning  from NWS that they felt was too broad. On June 14, 2005, the warning  center in Alaska detected a 7.2 magnitude earthquake 90 miles off the  Northern California coast. The center quickly issued a warning for all  coastal areas that were within two hours of the tsunami\u2019s forecasted travel  time, including areas from the northern tip of Canada\u2019s Vancouver Island  to the California-Mexico border. Knowing that it would take hours for the  tsunami to reach his community, a Southern California emergency  management official who received the warning sought to confirm the  tsunami\u2019s existence by contacting his Northern California counterparts  closer to the source. He learned that a destructive tsunami had not been  generated and determined that his community should not evacuate.  According to this official, because his area was not imminently threatened  by a tsunami, it should not have been included in the initial warning. As a  result of the feedback received after the June 14, 2005 event, the warning  center in Alaska has changed its warning protocols so that it will issue a  tsunami warning for only about half of the area that received a warning  during the June event, if a similar situation should occur in the future.", "Seismologists outside of NOAA have suggested that the tsunami warning  centers could reduce the duration\u2014and perhaps the number\u2014of false  alarms by relying more on seismic analyses that assess the type and  direction of an earthquake. For example, according to some state and  USGS seismologists, the June 14, 2005, earthquake\u2019s horizontal motion  should have indicated that the generation of a tsunami was highly unlikely,  enabling the warning center to cancel the warning within minutes, rather  than over an hour later. However, a NWS review of the event noted that  horizontal-motion earthquakes can trigger submarine landslides that can  in turn produce tsunamis, so the warning center should not cancel a  warning solely based on seismic analysis. According to warning center  officials, they receive feedback from outside seismologists regarding  warning procedures through organizations such as the NTHMP. However,  some outside seismologists are concerned that warning center  seismologists are reluctant to seek feedback or adopt new analytical  procedures for issuing and canceling warnings.", "NOAA expects that false alarms will be reduced with the expansion of the  sea-level data network and through an upgrade of its forecasting tools.  DART stations help reduce false alarms for distant tsunamis because the  stations detect slight changes in deep-ocean waves far from shore that  help forecast how these waves will grow as they approach the coast. In  addition to expanding the DART network, NOAA is upgrading the models  that use DART data to forecast tsunami flooding and is also expanding and  upgrading its network of sea-level gauges that the warning centers use to  confirm or cancel tsunami warnings. The tide gauge expansion plan calls  for deploying a total of 16 new gauges and upgrading 33 gauges by  November 2006.", "NOAA acknowledges the importance of reducing tsunami false alarms but  has not yet established performance goals or related metrics for  identifying progress toward this goal, such as tracking the number and  duration of warnings to areas that do not experience destructive tsunamis.

Transmitter failure has also  prevented warnings from being sent over EAS and NOAA Weather Radio.  For example, on June 14, 2005, some coastal communities in Washington  and Oregon did not receive the warning over EAS or NOAA Weather Radio  because transmitters failed to send a signal.

For example, staff in  some NWS forecast offices did not enter a tsunami-specific warning code  into a computer, resulting in EAS and NOAA Weather Radio not activating  rapidly, if at all. According to a subsequent NWS assessment of the event,  guidance to forecast office staff on tsunami warning procedures was  inadequate. Since the June 2005 event, coastal NWS forecast offices in  Washington, Oregon, and California have received guidance that, for  example, lists EAS activation as the proper first step when a tsunami  warning is received.", "Although the warning centers conduct monthly tests of their  communication systems to ensure that NWS forecast offices and state  emergency management centers receive the warnings, NWS does not  routinely conduct periodic end-to-end tests of the tsunami warning system  using the actual \u201clive\u201d computer codes rather than test codes. Such an end- to-end test would check the systems and procedures used to transmit an  actual tsunami warning from the tsunami warning center to the public and  identify technical gaps and procedural shortcomings. NWS conducted the  first such end-to-end test of the tsunami warning system in Alaska,  including activation of EAS and NOAA Weather Radio in March 2005. The  test uncovered breakdowns in EAS warning transmission at television and  radio stations whose EAS systems were not set up to use the tsunami  warning code. NWS is working with emergency managers and  broadcasters in Alaska to take corrective actions and retest the system. In  commenting on a draft of this report, NOAA stated that while it supports  broadening end-to-end testing in at-risk states it can conduct end-to end  testing using \u201clive\u201d warning codes for the EAS system only in those states  that permit it to do so.

However,  local emergency managers told us that inadequate warning siren coverage  was a significant issue in many locations, such as Ocean Shores,  Washington, and on Alaska\u2019s Kenai Peninsula. In addition, many of the  warning methods used by communities\u2014such as sirens and internet-based  messaging systems\u2014are dependent on telephone lines and other  infrastructure that would likely be disrupted by a strong earthquake.  During the June 2005 tsunami warning on the west coast, officials in  several communities noted that telephone lines were overloaded by a  surge of incoming 911 calls from concerned residents, in some cases,  preventing emergency managers from contacting other local officials and  preventing telephone-based warning systems from reaching all residents.

For example, in an actual emergency, traffic control and public  evacuations may take substantially longer than estimated.

In addition, Hawaii has developed a  tsunami specific curriculum that will be tailored to each of its counties.  Oregon and Hawaii also require schools in tsunami inundation areas to  conduct tsunami drills at least once a year, often in conjunction with  Tsunami Awareness month activities.

First, many of the state emergency  managers whom we spoke with noted that they are responsible for other,  higher priority hazards\u2014such as floods and wildland fires\u2014that occur  more frequently than tsunamis. Second, the states have limited funding  dedicated to tsunami preparedness activities. Of the approximately  $275,000 in NTHMP funds provided annually to each state, the states have  chosen to use most of it to develop or upgrade existing tsunami inundation  maps rather than for education or outreach efforts. Local emergency  managers echoed these challenges. Moreover, in many areas that depend  on tourism, local emergency managers said that businesses are reluctant  to post tsunami hazard information because it may scare tourists and  negatively impact the economy. Many noted, however, that since the  December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the subsequent June 2005  tsunami warning on the west coast, community interest in workshops and  forums has increased.

Oregon is the only  at-risk state we visited that has passed a land-use statute placing limits on  the construction of certain high occupancy structures within tsunami  inundation areas. Alaska also places restrictions on development in  certain designated \u201cnatural hazard\u201d areas, including coastal areas  potentially affected by tsunamis. One at-risk community also has been  successful in implementing a land-use strategy to mitigate future tsunami  losses. The city of Hilo, Hawaii, developed an Urban Renewal Plan\u2014based  on the devastation from the 1960 tsunami\u2014that set aside certain \u201copen  areas\u201d for limited use in order to minimize the danger of loss of life or  damage to property in areas potentially subject to inundation from  tsunamis.", "Tsunami experts believe that constructing new buildings in a tsunami  inundation area to better withstand tsunami forces can reduce loss of life  and property damage in cases where land-use planning and zoning are not  feasible. Building design and construction in the United States is governed  at the local level by building codes that establish minimum acceptable  requirements for preserving public safety. Although the Uniform Building  Code contains design requirements and standards for fire, wind, floods,  and earthquakes, it does not include requirements for tsunami-resilient  design. Nonetheless, two communities we visited, Hilo and Honolulu,  Hawaii, have developed guidelines for constructing tsunami-resilient  structures. For example, a 2000 Honolulu building ordinance requires,  among other things, that the inhabitable space in buildings at-risk from  tsunamis must be elevated above the regulatory flood elevation through  the use of posts, piles, piers or shear walls parallel to the expected flow of  a tsunami wave. None of the at-risk states we visited have developed  guidelines for constructing tsunami-resilient structures although  legislation establishing tax incentives for such construction is pending in  Washington. Hawaii\u2019s state legislature is currently considering a bill to  develop a state building code based on the International Building Code,  which, according to state emergency management officials, would  strengthen buildings against tsunamis and other hazards. In commenting  on a draft of this report, FEMA noted that, the International Building Code,  which has replaced the Uniform Building Code as the national model code,  also does not contain specific requirements addressing the tsunami  hazard. However, structures built in conformance with the International  Building Code are likely to perform better during a tsunami because of  other code provisions, particularly seismic requirements.", "Several states, including California and Oregon, have adopted laws and  ordinances for retrofitting existing buildings to reduce losses from future  earthquakes. For existing infrastructure, earthquake retrofits may  improve tsunami resistance, or help minimize floating debris that can  damage nearby buildings.

Although strategic planning is required for the major functions and  operations of agencies by the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993, it is not specifically required for individual programs within  agencies.

In addition, the Department of Commerce\u2019s Inspector  General has identified improving strategic planning as a top priority and  reported on the need for NOAA\u2019s programs to improve how they report  and measure performance toward achieving specific outcomes.", "In this context, a strategic plan would provide NOAA a framework for  ensuring that its tsunami-related activities are planned and implemented in  a risk-based manner. Our recent reports have emphasized the importance  of federal agencies using risk-based planning. For example, in a June 2005  testimony on the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s resource allocation,  we reported that the department must carefully weigh the benefit of  activities and allocate resources where the benefit of reducing risks is  worth the additional cost. Any actions taken by NOAA absent risk-based  analysis have the potential to divert funds away from locations, such as  the Pacific and Caribbean regions, where the tsunami hazard\u2014particularly  from local tsunamis\u2014is well documented. Some of NOAA\u2019s activities  designed to strengthen the tsunami program are scheduled in a manner  that raises questions about the extent to which they are risk-based. For  example, there is little historical evidence of tsunamis on the Atlantic  coast or Gulf coast, yet expansion activities already implemented or  scheduled in 2006 include the placement of DART stations in the Atlantic  Ocean, tsunami forecast modeling of an east coast community, and  recognition of new TsunamiReady communities on the east coast.

In August 2001, an expert panel reviewed the  NTHMP\u2019s progress and performance under the plan and provided a  number of suggestions for improving the program. While the then- chairman of the NTHMP drafted some goals based on the suggestions,  NOAA did not update or revise the plan to incorporate the experts\u2019  suggestions or the proposed goals because, according to the subsequent  chairman, the plan\u2019s four original goals had not yet been achieved.", "Five years later, two key issues raised by the expert panel review remain  concerns of the state NTHMP participants. First, the positive impacts of  the program were being largely assumed and not effectively measured.  State members of the NTHMP still believe that more needs to be done to  measure the effectiveness of tsunami mitigation activities\u2014such as  surveys to measure the effectiveness of public education programs.  Second, the NTHMP was \u201cseriously out of balance,\u201d in terms of focusing  on detection and risk assessment at the expense of working with  communities to educate and modify behaviors in ways that could save  lives. State members of the NTHMP remain concerned about the focus on  detection and warning systems improvements, which are perceived as  \u201cfederal solutions,\u201d rather than state and local educational and behavioral  activities, such as conducting tsunami preparedness drills, which they see  as key to community preparedness, particularly for local tsunamis.", "The NTHMP had planned to conduct another program review and develop  an updated implementation plan in 2006. These plans have been placed on  hold, according to the chairman of the NTHMP, because the decision to  make the NTHMP a nationwide program\u2014likely including representatives  of the 23 states on the Pacific, Atlantic, and Gulf coasts as well as the two  commonwealths and three U.S. territories in the Pacific Ocean and  Caribbean Sea\u2014raised significant issues that needed to be settled before  any revisions to the program\u2019s goals and objectives could be considered.However, failing to conduct a program review now means that the  program will not have vital information regarding (1) what has worked or  not worked in implementing the program since 2001 and (2) what tsunami  mitigation activities remain incomplete in the five original Pacific area  states with high tsunami hazards. A program review could contribute to  the development of a risk-based strategic plan that ensures that the  activities that remain uncompleted in areas with the greatest threat get the  highest priority for funding.", "According to NOAA officials, the agency expects to implement the nine  recommended actions for the NTHMP and the Tsunami Program  contained in the National Science and Technology Council\u2019s December  2005 report on tsunami risk reduction. The report, developed by NOAA,  USGS, FEMA, and other federal agencies, recommends actions such as  developing standardized and coordinated tsunami hazard and risk  assessments for all U.S. coastal areas, improving tsunami detection and  warning data and infrastructure, enhancing tsunami forecast and warning  capabilities, promoting the development of model mitigation measures,  and increasing outreach to communities. However, because the report and  recommendations were developed without the participation of the  NTHMP members, they question whether the recommendations and  priorities represent the best strategic direction for the NTHMP. All of the  state NTHMP members agree that full participation in program decision  making by individuals with state and local level knowledge of tsunami  mitigation activities is key to the efficiency and success of the NTHMP.", "In addition, state NTHMP members are particularly concerned that the  program\u2019s funding decisions and strategic direction may become less risk- based with the inclusion of numerous eastern and southern coastal states  with lower known tsunami hazards. These members want to ensure that  communities facing the greatest threat obtain the greatest benefits from  the program, particularly since many tsunami preparedness activities  remain incomplete and unfunded in the original five at-risk states. For  example, in 2005, the Director of the California Governor\u2019s Office of  Emergency Services estimated that in California alone over the next five  years about $19.5 million was needed for state preparedness activities and  about $7.5 million for local government activities. As such, state NTHMP  members were surprised to learn that some eastern states have already  submitted proposals for NTHMP funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the hazardous Pacific region, NOAA and its federal and state partners  are working to help prepare communities for tsunamis. However, much is  left to be done to improve tsunami hazard assessment, detection, warning,  and mitigation for these areas and other at-risk areas of the United States.  It is particularly important that when at-risk states complete their  inundation mapping, they then conduct comprehensive assessments of the  expected damage from a tsunami. Without this basic information,  emergency managers will not be able to effectively formulate plans to  mitigate potential tsunami impacts on people and infrastructure. In  addition, improved technical capabilities to detect tsunamis will be of  limited value if the warning systems and processes that NOAA depends on  to disseminate this information cannot reliably ensure that all threatened  individuals and communities will receive an accurate and timely warning.", "Because tsunamis are an infrequent hazard that may be overlooked due to  higher priority reoccurring natural hazards such as hurricanes and  flooding, NOAA and its federal and state partners face a significant  challenge ensuring that communities are sufficiently engaged in  preparedness activities. The Indian Ocean tsunami, however, has created a  window of opportunity by spotlighting the devastation and destruction  that can result from a lack of planning, preparedness, and education for  such an event\u2014no matter how rare. We believe that federal and state  partners can take advantage of this current sense of urgency and develop a  strategic approach that will ensure that the significantly increased  resources that have been made available to expand U.S. tsunami detection  and preparedness programs are being effectively targeted. As part of this  effort, all federal tsunami-related activities, including the TsunamiReady  program and the NTHMP, should be reassessed to determine how to  increase their effectiveness. Moreover, NOAA needs to address the lack of  long-range, risk-based strategic planning for these activities. Without  strategic planning and performance measures to guide these efforts, the  Congress and the public will lack important information about the extent  to which resources are being directed to activities that are of the greatest  benefit to the most vulnerable communities and to what extent  measurable progress is being made toward the desired results. We believe  U.S. tsunami programs guided by long-term strategic plans with  demonstrable achievements will be better able to sustain their efforts for  vulnerable coastal communities into the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help improve national tsunami preparedness, we are recommending  that the Secretary of Commerce direct the NOAA Administrator to take the  following six actions: work with the FEMA Director and the USGS Director to create  standardized tsunami loss estimation software to help communities  determine the potential impact of tsunamis and identify appropriate  mitigation actions;  reduce the number of tsunami warning false alarms by (1) completing the  planned expansion of tsunami detection stations, (2) reexamining NWS\u2019s  rules dictating when a warning will be issued and to which areas, (3)  establishing a routine process for other federal and state experts to  formally review and comment on the centers\u2019 use of seismic data, and (4)  setting performance goals to guide improvements; work with the states to conduct periodic end-to-end tests of the tsunami  warning system, including NOAA Weather Radio and the Emergency Alert  System, to ensure the system will function as intended during a tsunami  emergency;  evaluate the TsunamiReady program to determine what barriers, if any,  exist to participation and what modifications are needed to encourage  more high-risk communities to participate;  evaluate the NTHMP to determine what has worked well in the past and  what high priority activities remain to be completed and to help inform  strategic planning efforts, and; develop comprehensive risk-based strategic plans for the Tsunami  Program and National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program that consider  input from states and federal partners and include metrics for measuring  progress toward achieving program goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of a draft of this report to the Departments of  Commerce, Homeland Security and the Interior for their review and  comment. Commerce, representing NOAA, concurred with all six  recommendations and generally agreed with our findings, although it  provided technical and factual clarifications, which we have incorporated  into the report as appropriate. However, in its comments, NOAA suggested  a revision to one of the recommendations with which we disagree. In  response to our recommendation that NOAA evaluate the TsunamiReady  program to determine what barriers, if any, exist to participation and what  modifications are needed to encourage more high-risk communities to  participate, NOAA suggested changing the recommendation\u2019s focus from  \u201chigh-risk\u201d to \u201cat-risk\u201d communities. According to NOAA all U.S. coastal  communities should be prepared for a tsunami no matter how rare. While  we agree that preparing all U.S. coastal communities for a tsunami may be  a laudable long-term goal, given the agency\u2019s limited resources, it may be  an unrealistic goal in the short-term. Therefore, we believe that NOAA  should use a risk-based approach and target initial participation in the  TsunamiReady program to those communities that face the greatest risk.  Commerce\u2019s specific comments and our detailed responses are presented  in appendix I.", "Homeland Security, representing FEMA, commented on one of the six  recommendations and indicated that while it concurred with the  recommendation that NOAA work with FEMA and USGS to create  standardized tsunami loss estimation software, it was concerned that  FEMA did not have the funding or the staff resources to pursue such a  request and that such a request from NOAA would have to address these  resource needs. Homeland Security also noted that the report did not  mention other programs such as FEMA\u2019s Pre-disaster Mitigation Program  and the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which can be used by states and  communities to fund tsunami mitigation projects. We revised the report to  mention that these programs have funded tsunami mitigation projects.  Finally, Homeland Security stated that the report\u2019s description of the  TsunamiReady program as it relates to response, preparedness, and  mitigation activities is unclear. We believe that we have clearly  characterized the program as providing minimum guidelines that  communities can use to enhance tsunami readiness and therefore have not  revised the report in response to this comment. Homeland Security\u2019s  specific comments and our detailed responses are presented in appendix  II.", "The Department of the Interior commented that the report was a thorough  well-researched examination of the nation\u2019s tsunami warning system and  that it correctly recognizes the need for close collaboration at the federal,  state, and local levels to have an effective tsunami warning system.  Interior also said that it supports the need for a risk-based approach to  prioritizing federal investments in this system and is actively collaborating  with NOAA to provide the hazard assessments necessary for such an  approach. In addition, Interior said that one area it felt was inadequately  addressed in the report was the importance of a long-term federal role in  research to improve tsunami warnings and mitigate tsunami risks and  noted that none of our recommendations involved improving or expanding  research. While we agree that tsunami-related research is an important  issue, it was not included in the scope of our review, and consequently,  this report does not cover issues related to tsunami research or offer any  recommendations in this area.
