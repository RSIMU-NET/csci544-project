The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is the lead agency responsible for communicating security-related information with all modes. In response to the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, GAO assessed 1) the satisfaction of transportation stakeholders with the quality of TSA's transportation security information products, 2) satisfaction with mechanisms used to disseminate them, and 3) the extent to which TSA's roles and responsibilities are clearly defined. GAO surveyed 335 aviation, rail, and highway stakeholders (with an 82 percent response rate); reviewed agency planning documents; and interviewed industry associations, transportation stakeholders, and Department of Homeland Security officials.

TSA developed a series of products to share security-related information with transportation stakeholders such as annual modal threat assessments that provide an overview of threats to each transportation mode--including aviation, rail, and highway--and related infrastructure. Fifty-seven percent of the stakeholders (155 of 275 who answered this question) indicated that they were satisfied with the products they receive. However, stakeholders who receive these products were least satisfied with the actionability of the information--the degree to which the products enabled stakeholders to adjust their security measures. They noted that they prefer products with more analysis, such as trend analysis of incidents or suggestions for improving security arrangements. Further, not all stakeholders received the products. For example, 48 percent (128 of 264) of the stakeholders reported that they did not receive a security assessment in 2010, such as TSA's annual modal threat assessment. Improving the analysis and availability of security-related information products would help enhance stakeholders' ability to position themselves to protect against threats. Stakeholders who obtained security-related information through TSA's Web-based mechanisms were generally satisfied, but almost 60 percent (158 of 266) of stakeholders GAO surveyed had never heard of the Homeland Security Information Sharing Network Critical Sectors portal (HSIN-CS). DHS views HSIN as the primary mechanism for sharing security-related information with critical sectors, including transportation stakeholders. Forty-three percent of rail stakeholders, 28 percent of highway stakeholders, and 72 percent of aviation stakeholders--who consider TSA's aviation Web Boards as their primary information-sharing mechanism--had not heard of HSIN-CS. Among the 55 stakeholders that had logged on to HSIN-CS, concerns were raised with the ability to locate information using the mechanism. Increasing awareness and functionality of HSIN-CS could help ensure that stakeholders receive security information, including TSA products. Defining and documenting the roles and responsibilities for information sharing among TSA offices could help strengthen information-sharing efforts. Officials from TSA's Office of Intelligence consider TSA's Transportation Sector Network Management offices to be key conduits for providing security-related information directly to stakeholders. However, officials from these offices differed in their understanding of their roles. For instance, officials told GAO that their role was to communicate policy and regulatory information, rather than threat-related information. While TSA officials look to the current Transportation Security Information Sharing Plan for guidance, it does not include key elements of the approach that TSA uses to communicate security-related information to stakeholders. For example, it does not describe the roles of TSA's Field Intelligence Officers, who facilitate the exchange of relevant threat information with local and private entities responsible for transportation security. Clearly documenting roles and responsibilities for sharing security-related information with transportation stakeholders could improve the effectiveness of TSA's efforts and help ensure accountability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that TSA, among other actions, (1) address stakeholder needs regarding the quality of analysis in and availability of its products, (2) increase awareness and functionality of its information sharing mechanisms, and (3) define and document TSA's information sharing roles and responsibilities.

The sheer size and capacity of the sector, which  transports people, food, medicines, fuel, and other commodities vital to  the nation\u2019s safety, security, and economic well being, makes it an  attractive target for terrorists. Disrupted attempted terrorist activities in the  fall of 2010\u2014including a planned attack on the Washington, D.C., Metro  system, the discovery of explosive devices in air cargo packages bound  for the United States from Yemen, and information on threats to freight  and passenger rail obtained after the death of Osama bin Laden\u2014 demonstrate the importance of effective information sharing with public  and private transportation security stakeholders.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 assigned the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) responsibility for sharing information with its  federal, state, local, and private sector homeland security partners to  assist in the prevention of and response to terrorist attacks. The  Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  (9/11 Commission Act) directed DHS to create a Transportation Security  Information Sharing Plan (TSISP), which was first issued in July 2008 and  most recently updated in December 2010 and is designed to establish a  foundation for sharing transportation security-related information between  public and private entities that have a stake in protecting the nation\u2019s  transportation system. While multiple DHS components are responsible  for information sharing, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  is the department lead on providing transportation security-related  information to other DHS components and public and private  stakeholders.", "Our prior work on information sharing with private and public security  stakeholders has shown that information sharing continues to be a  challenge for the federal government. In January 2005, we designated  establishing effective mechanisms for sharing terrorism-related  information to protect the homeland a high-risk area because the  government had continued to face challenges in analyzing and  disseminating this information in a timely, accurate, and useful manner.  We reported that information is a crucial tool in fighting terrorism and that  its timely dissemination is critical to maintaining the security of our nation.  This area remains on our high-risk list. As a result of this designation, we  monitor federal efforts to remove barriers to and better achieve  information sharing. In addition, we have made a number of  recommendations to DHS to strengthen this area and the agency has  taken steps in response, such as expanding its efforts to share terrorism- related information with private sector entities and identifying state and  local partners\u2019 information needs. The National Strategy for Information  Sharing also discusses the need to improve information sharing, including  enhancing the quantity and quality of specific, timely, and actionable  information provided by the federal government to critical infrastructure  sectors. In 2010, we found that, while public transit agencies were  generally satisfied with the security-related information they received,  opportunities existed to streamline and reduce the volume of overlapping  information they receive. We also found that some stakeholders were  unaware of the information-sharing mechanisms available to them while  others found them difficult to access or use. We recommended, among  other things, for DHS and TSA to assess opportunities to streamline  mechanisms and to improve the awareness, use, and access to these  mechanisms among public transit stakeholders.", "Section 1203 of the 9/11 Commission Act directed us to conduct a survey  of the satisfaction of recipients of transportation security-related  information disseminated under the TSISP. we assessed the satisfaction of recipients of transportation security- related information within the aviation, passenger and freight rail, and  highway modes.

The act included requirements for deploying a  federal screening workforce at airports and screening all passengers and  property transported from or within the United States on commercial  aircraft. While TSA has a more direct role in ensuring the security of the  aviation mode through its management of a passenger and baggage  screener workforce that inspects individuals and their property to deter  and prevent an act of violence or air piracy, TSA has a less direct role in  securing other modes\u2014such as freight rail and highway and motor  carrier\u2014in that it generally establishes voluntary standards, conducts  inspections, and provides recommendations and advice to owners and  operators within those modes. Responsibility for securing these modes is  shared with other federal agencies, state and local governments, and the  private sector. However, TSA has responsibility for receiving, assessing,  and distributing intelligence information related to transportation security  in all modes and assessing threats to the transportation system.", "Within TSA, the Office of TSNM is responsible for setting policy for all  modes of transportation. For example, the Mass Transit TSNM office  develops strategies, policies, and programs to improve transportation  security including operational security activities, training exercises, public  awareness, and technology. TSA-OI receives intelligence information  regarding threats to transportation and aims to disseminate it, as  appropriate, to officials in TSA, the federal government, state and local  officials, and to industry officials with transportation responsibilities.  Although it is not an intelligence generator, the office receives and  assesses intelligence from within and outside of the intelligence  community to determine its relevance to transportation security.  Sources of information outside the intelligence community include other  DHS components, law enforcement agencies, and owners and operators  of transportation systems. TSA-OI also reviews suspicious activity  reporting by Transportation Security Officers, Behavior Detection Officers,  and Federal Air Marshals. TSA-OI has deployed Field Intelligence  Officers (FIO) throughout the United States to provide additional  intelligence support to Federal Security Directors (FSD) who are  responsible for providing day-to-day operational direction for federal  security at airports\u2014and their staffs. In addition, the FIOs serve as  liaisons with state, local, and tribal law enforcement officials and  intelligence fusion centers. TSA-OI disseminates security information  through security-related information products including reports,  assessments, and briefings. These products are also shared with  intelligence community members and other DHS organizations. Table 1  describes TSA\u2019s primary security-related information-sharing products.  TSA is one of several sources of security-related information for  transportation stakeholders. These stakeholders may also receive  information from other federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI), Department of Defense, and Department of  Transportation, as well as, among others, state and local fusion centers  and industry associations.", "TSA uses multiple mechanisms to distribute these products. Table 2  describes some of the mechanisms that TSA uses. Other mechanisms  that transportation stakeholders may use to obtain security-related  information include those operated by regional, state, and local entities  such as law enforcement agencies and emergency operations centers, as  well as industry-sponsored mechanisms such as the Association of  American Railroads\u2019 Railway Alert Network, among others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Generally Satisfied with TSA Information Products but Identified Opportunities to Improve Quality and Availability", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Were Generally Satisfied with Information, although Satisfaction Varied by Sector", "paragraphs": ["Because the private sector owns and operates the majority of  infrastructure and resources that are critical to our nation\u2019s physical and  economic security, it is important to ensure that effective and efficient  information-sharing partnerships are developed with these private sector  entities.

In support  of this endeavor, TSA is responsible for receiving, assessing, and  distributing intelligence information related to transportation security and  acting as the primary liaison for transportation security to the intelligence  and law enforcement communities.", "TSA has developed security-related information products as part of its  efforts to share security-related information with transportation  stakeholders. Our 2011 survey results indicate general satisfaction  among transportation stakeholders who received these products across  each mode of transportation, but satisfaction varied by transportation  sector. As highlighted in figure 1, 57 percent (155 of 275) of all  stakeholders who responded to our survey question concerning overall  satisfaction were satisfied with the security-related information they  received, while approximately 10 percent (27 of 275) were dissatisfied.", "Survey results regarding satisfaction with security-related information  products and briefings across transportation sectors indicate that  respondents from five of the seven sectors we surveyed were satisfied.  However, less than half of all respondents from both the air cargo (20 of  53) and class I rail (2 of 7) sectors respectively, were satisfied with TSA\u2019s  products, as shown in figure 2.", "We also asked survey respondents about their satisfaction with the  transportation security-related information they received or obtained from  a variety of other sources including the industry associations, FBI, and  security consultants, among others. As discussed earlier, other  organizations also provide transportation security information to state and  local transportation agencies. Stakeholders were generally satisfied with  the information from these other sources. For example, stakeholder  satisfaction among respondents that received information from the  industry associations, FBI, and security consultants was 81 percent (165  of 203), 69 percent (96 of 139), and 51 percent (52 of 102) respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Opportunities for Improving Product Actionability", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholder satisfaction with TSA products was measured both in terms  of overall satisfaction with all products combined, as well as across five  separate dimensions of quality\u2014accuracy, actionability, completeness,  relevance, and timeliness for each product type.

For the purposes of  the survey, actionability was defined as the degree to which TSA\u2019s  security-related information products enabled stakeholders to make  adjustments to their security measures, if such a change was warranted.  In open-ended comments included in our survey, stakeholders from each  of the sectors stated that actionable information also includes analysis of  trends, practices, and probability that would allow them to adjust their  security measures as appropriate.", "For example, of the 53 air cargo stakeholders that completed our survey,  6 provided open-ended comments in our survey that TSA provides very  little security-related information to their industry concerning unscheduled  air carriers such as on-demand cargo operations. These stakeholders  stated that the information they receive is usually related to either large  cargo companies like FedEx and UPS or passenger air carriers. While  only one Class I rail survey respondent reported being dissatisfied with  the security-related information their organization receives, five of the  seven Class I respondents cited concerns with the lack of analysis  associated with the information they receive from TSA. For example,  one Class I respondent suggested TSA increase incident analysis and  provide more detail on various terrorist approaches and how these  methodologies may impact freight rail. According to this respondent, more  rail-specific analysis would assist their industry with developing current  countermeasures to be as effective as possible against mitigating  potential threats.", "TSA officials stated that the GRID will provide a better opportunity for TSA to provide an  analytical summary of law enforcement and open source reporting emerging in the last 30  days, including information on threats, significant airport and aircraft incidents, terrorist  groups, security trends and new technologies, and intelligence and law enforcement  advisories. freight rail stakeholders we interviewed stated that TSA\u2019s security-related  information products lacked actionable analysis and did not contain  information that would allow them to take any specific actions. Also, 7 of  the 18 stakeholders we interviewed across each of the three modes  commented that opportunities exist for TSA to increase incident analysis  and provide more detail on pre-attack planning as well as the trends  identified in various terrorist attempts and how these may impact their  industry. Our previous work on information sharing highlights continuing  challenges that DHS faces in providing actionable information to its  stakeholders. For example, we previously reported that most information- sharing and analysis centers established to share information with  stakeholders from critical sectors have expressed concerns with the  limited quantity of information and the need for more specific, timely, and  actionable information from DHS and/or their sector-specific agencies.", "According to DHS, the federal government is uniquely positioned to help  inform critical security investment decisions and operational planning as  private sector operators generally look to the government as a source of  security-related threat information. However, we found that a lack of  actionable TSA data has led stakeholders to rely on other sources for  relevant security-related information. Of the 275 stakeholders who  completed our survey, 203 reported receiving security-related information  from other sources. Additionally, Amtrak officials told us that they have  contracted with intelligence analysts at Spectel to monitor open and  sensitive data sources for rail-related security material. The analysts  produce a weekly report called Railwatch that, according to these  officials, helps them develop tactics to defend against terrorist activity.  Amtrak officials told us that these analysts also work closely with  government agencies, including fusion centers, to develop and share  information that they described as much more rail-centric than the daily  security information that DHS makes available to them. TSA officials  noted that aviation stakeholders may receive security directives that  outline required steps for enhancing security.

For example, TSA officials responsible for overseeing the freight  rail sector said that they maintain contact information for each of their  approximately 565 industry stakeholders and aim to provide TSA-OI  products directly to the rail security coordinators designated by each  railroad. In contrast, TSA officials responsible for overseeing the highway  and motor carrier sector said that they share security-related information  on a more selective basis because of the large number and broad nature  of highway stakeholders. With tens of thousands of stakeholders\u2014 including bus, truck, and motor coach operators\u2014across the country, it is  not practical for TSA to reach every stakeholder. Therefore, TSA relies on  communications with representatives from these industries rather than  individual stakeholders. According to TSA officials, TSA works with  industry associations to distribute security-related information because  leveraging these partnerships allows TSA to broaden its ability to reach  stakeholders. However, stakeholders who are not affiliated with industry  associations may not receive these communications. For example,  according to the United Motorcoach Association, as many as two-thirds of  companies in their sector were not represented by an industry  association. While we recognize that not all stakeholders can receive  every product, stakeholders included in our survey were identified by TSA  as those who should be receiving this information.", "Receiving a full range of TSA security-related information products could  help stakeholders improve their situational awareness or change their  operations to better protect their facilities and assets. For example, an  official from a domestic passenger air carrier also told us that improved  information sharing could have prevented their airline from diverting a  plane with a disruptive passenger on board to Detroit, Michigan on the  same day that a passenger attempted to detonate explosives aboard  another Detroit-bound airplane on Christmas day 2009.

DHS  officials concurred with this recommendation and in January 2011  provided an implementation plan with target dates for addressing it.  However, the plan did not fully address the recommendation. For  example, the plan stated that TSA officials created a consolidated  \u201csuperlist\u201d of current members of another information-sharing mechanism  and invited them to join HSIN-PT.

Of those  that logged on to HSIN-CS, 40 percent (6 of 15) of highway stakeholders  and 53 percent (9 of 17) of rail stakeholders were satisfied with their  ability to locate information on HSIN-CS, as shown in figure 9. A rail  stakeholder who was less than satisfied noted in open-ended comments  on the survey and in an interview that HSIN-CS was difficult to navigate  with its many layers and that he could not find information for which he  was searching. When we attempted in August 2011 to search for TSA  security-related information products using the HSIN-CS search tool, we  encountered similar difficulties. For example, knowing that a Freight Rail  Modal Threat Assessment released in March 2011 mentioned Toxic  Inhalation Hazards, we searched HSIN-CS for this information using the  search tool, sorting results by date, but could only find the Freight Rail  Modal Threat Assessment from September 2009. Furthermore, when we  restricted the search to the \u201crail/pipeline\u201d sector, no information products  appeared. Such difficulties may hinder HSIN-CS from meeting the  security information needs of transportation stakeholders, and therefore  limit TSA in its goal of achieving useful, reliable, and continuous  communication of information. A TSA official agreed that the search  function on HSIN-CS has technical limitations that can affect the user\u2019s  ability to locate information.", "Stakeholder satisfaction with the quality of the information on HSIN-CS  varied by mode, as shown in figure 10. For most aspects of HSIN-CS on  which we surveyed stakeholder satisfaction (five of six), aviation  stakeholders responding to the survey were the most satisfied, and rail  stakeholders were the least satisfied.", "In September 2010, we reported that certain aspects of HSIN-PT were  not user-friendly. For example, 5 of 11 agencies that had access to  HSIN-PT and used it to receive security-related information reported  problems with using the system once they logged in. We recommended  that DHS take steps to ensure that public transit agencies can access and  readily utilize HSIN-PT and that HSIN-PT contain security-related  information that is of value to public transit agencies. DHS concurred and  in January 2011 provided an implementation plan with target dates for  addressing it. However, a September 2011 update to the plan did not  include estimated dates for completing the actions. Further, the plan did  not provide enough details about the actions to determine whether the  agency is taking the necessary steps to address the recommendation.", "Taking steps to ensure transportation stakeholders can access and  readily use HSIN-CS\u2014including improving the search function\u2014could  help DHS improve capacity of HSIN-CS to meet those stakeholders\u2019  security-related information needs. Because many transportation  stakeholders have not heard of HSIN-CS, do not access the system, or  encounter difficulties once they log in, they may not be receiving timely  information via the information-sharing mechanism that DHS has  established. DHS officials stated that our previous work has prompted  ongoing efforts to address these concerns. However these efforts are  primarily focused on working with public transit stakeholders to improve  HSIN-CS for that mode. DHS officials stated that improvements to HSIN- CS and its portals for other modes is dependent on input and involvement  from industry stakeholders."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "E-mail Alerts Serve as Additional Information- sharing Mechanism, but Reach and Satisfaction Vary by Mode", "paragraphs": ["TSA also described its e-mail alerts as a key information-sharing  mechanism.

A good internal control environment requires that the  agency\u2019s organizational structure clearly define key areas of authority and  responsibility and establish appropriate lines of reporting. We have  previously reported that collaborating agencies should work together to  define and agree on their respective roles and responsibilities. In doing  so, agencies can clarify who will do what, organize their joint and  individual efforts, and facilitate decision making. TSA-OI officials told us  that the TSNM offices for each transportation mode serve as the primary  contact to stakeholders. However, the specific roles and responsibilities of  each office in sharing security-related information with stakeholders are  not clearly defined. While TSA-OI depends on the TSNM offices to  provide security-related information directly to stakeholders in individual  transportation modes, officials from TSA-OI also stated that the  responsibility for disseminating transportation security information to  intended targets is shared with TSA-OI. However, because of the different  dynamics of each transportation mode, TSA-OI defers to the individual  modal TSNM offices in deciding how to help industry stakeholders obtain  TSA-OI information.", "TSA officials from five TSNM offices provided different interpretations of  the Office of TSNM\u2019s roles and responsibilities in disseminating TSA-OI  products and other security-related information. Officials from three of  these offices stated that the TSNM offices are the primary means for  disseminating security-related information products, with two of the three  stating that part of this responsibility is informing stakeholders of TSA\u2019s  Intel page on HSIN-CS. However, officials from two other TSNM offices  stated that the role of the TSNM offices is limited to communicating policy  and regulatory information rather than threat-related information.  Additionally, stakeholders differed among and within modes in the extent  to which they would contact the TSNM office to obtain security-related  information. For example, one aviation stakeholder stated that it would  call the TSNM office directly if it needed a product or information while  another stated that they would contact their Federal Security Director at  the local airport for the same information.", "Our survey results indicate that some stakeholders are not receiving  TSA\u2019s security-related information products and others are not aware of  the mechanisms available to them. While officials from both TSA-OI and  the Office of TSNM told us that the responsibility for ensuring that  stakeholders are receiving security-related products lies within their  offices, the roles and responsibilities are not documented and are open to  interpretation. TSA officials told us that they do not currently have an  information flow diagram or document describing or mandating  information sharing between TSA-OI and the Office of TSNM because the  two offices share information on a daily basis and discuss routing to  internal and external stakeholders. Further, TSA officials stated that  information flow regarding transportation security is dynamic and complex  with varying levels of classification, audiences, and topics. While it is  recognized that information products and mechanisms are selected and  utilized as appropriate to the circumstances, clearly documenting the  basic roles and responsibilities of its partners\u2014especially TSNM offices\u2014 in sharing security-related information with transportation stakeholders  and increasing awareness of information-sharing mechanisms could  improve the effectiveness of TSA-OI\u2019s information-sharing efforts and  help ensure accountability.", "Additionally, key elements of TSA\u2019s information approach are not  described in its December 2010 information-sharing plan. The 9/11  Commission Act requires DHS to annually submit an information-sharing  plan to Congress that describes how intelligence analysts within the  department will coordinate their activities within the department and with  other federal, state, and local agencies, and tribal governments, among  other things. TSA is the lead agency in developing the TSISP and  describes the plan as an annual report that establishes a foundation for  sharing transportation security information between all entities that have a  stake in protecting the nation\u2019s transportation system. TSA is not required  to share the plan with stakeholders but coordinates its updates with input  from the mode-specific SCCs. TSA officials described the plan as  overarching guidance for information-sharing activities within TSA.", "Additionally, the Transportation Systems Sector Specific Plan describes  the TSISP as including the process for sharing critical intelligence and  information throughout the sector. It states that the TSISP reflects a  vertical and horizontal network of communications for timely distribution of  accurate and pertinent information. The last update to the plan was  December 2010. However, this plan does not describe key information- sharing functions and programs, as follows:", "The TSISP does not acknowledge that the Aviation Web Boards are  the primary mechanism used for sharing security-related information  with the aviation community. TSA officials stated that this is the  primary tool used to share information with commercial aviation  airports and passenger air carriers as well as air cargo carriers.  Aviation stakeholders we interviewed confirmed that the Web Boards  are their primary means of receiving information from TSA.

As new threats emerge and vulnerabilities are  identified, dissemination of timely and actionable information is critical to  maintaining the security of our nation. While providing federal, state, local,  tribal, and private sector partners with the information they need can be  complicated, providing them with the right information at the right time can  prevent catastrophic losses from terrorist activities targeted at the  transportation modes. However, stakeholders cannot act on information  that they do not receive or cannot access. At the same time, if the  information stakeholders receive is not actionable, it is less valuable in  helping them prioritize, manage, or adjust security operations. While  specific actionable intelligence is not always available, providing these  stakeholders with more actionable analysis would help allow them to  adjust security measures or take other necessary actions to improve their  security postures and counter past and present threats.", "While TSA has taken steps to ensure that security-related information is  available to stakeholders when they need it through various mechanisms,  additional actions could help to ensure that stakeholders are aware of  these resources and can access them when needed. Given that DHS\u2019s  current outreach efforts have not resulted in widespread HSIN-CS  awareness and use among transportation stakeholders, additional actions  to improve system awareness and accessibility will help ensure that  transportation security information users receive timely and useful  security information. Additionally, developing outcome-oriented  performance measures could help assess progress in improving the  dissemination of key transportation security information to all appropriate  stakeholders. Because TSA has not clearly defined and documented  roles and responsibilities for disseminating security-related information  and the full range of its information-sharing efforts, TSA may not be  consistently providing security-related information products to external  stakeholders and divisions within TSA may not be held fully accountable  for performing their information-sharing activities.

DHS concurred with the findings and  recommendations in the report and described the efforts the department  has underway or planned to address our recommendations, as  summarized below. The Department of Transportation\u2019s Deputy Director  of Audit Relations replied in an e-mail received on October 27, 2011, that  the department had no comments on the report. Amtrak and the  Departments of Homeland Security and Transportation did not provide  comments on the e-supplement.", "In his e-mail, the Amtrak audit liaison noted that Amtrak recognizes the  pressure that TSA is under to produce meaningful intelligence and  information analysis to a diverse transportation industry where the  information flow is dynamic and complex. However, Amtrak added that at  the stakeholder level, the ability to quickly react and deploy to interdict a  terrorist threat, planning cycle, or incident based upon information that is  timely and actionable is crucial. According to Amtrak, improvements in  this area could significantly improve private industry\u2019s ability to plan,  defend, deter, and detect terrorist activities. Amtrak views its relationship  with TSA as a very important and critical one in addressing Amtrak\u2019s  security posture on a daily basis across the intercity rail system. Amtrak  also noted that it maintains relationships with other federal, state, and  international agencies to improve its intelligence and information-sharing  capacity. According to Amtrak, the combination of all these resources  allows Amtrak to stay abreast of intelligence trends and developing  information and to sift quickly through data and look for rail-centric  information.", "In its written comments, DHS stated that, since the conclusion of our  review, many of TSA\u2019s products now include analysis of threat levels,  trends, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Since this new development  occurred after our review, we did not evaluate the products referred to in  the statement. We encourage TSA to continue these efforts and to work  with stakeholder groups to ensure that the additional analysis and  actionable information provided in these products meets their needs. DHS  also stated that TSA will continue working with the DHS Office of  Infrastructure Protection to help modal stakeholders understand the  security information currently available on HSIN-CS and other systems.  DHS provided several examples of other information sources it is using.  While these may be appropriate systems for disseminating information to  members of the intelligence or law enforcement communities, 272 of the  275  transportation stakeholders responding to our survey did not list any  of these systems among their sources for security-related information.  DHS stated that its strategy has evolved to consider stakeholders\u2019  preferred methods of receiving security-related information. However, it  notes that this change has taken place since the conclusion of our review.  As such, we are not able to evaluate this statement. We encourage TSA  to increase its outreach efforts to ensure that stakeholders are aware of  these mechanisms and information and take further steps to ensure that  stakeholders are receiving TSA\u2019s information products through these  sources. In addition, DHS stated that TSA plans to enhance the  marketing of its information solutions, including HSIN-CS, and to align its  partners with its information-sharing roles and responsibilities. While  these are positive steps in encouraging information sharing with  stakeholders, they do not address the concern stakeholders expressed  regarding their ability to locate specific information on HSIN-CS. We  continue to believe that improving the search function could enhance  stakeholders\u2019 use of HSIN-CS in locating TSA products. Further, DHS  said that TSA has started to develop a system to measure and monitor  how stakeholders receive information, frequency of use, and methods  used for customer outreach and obtaining customer feedback. Finally,  DHS said that TSA will commit to creating an internal document of the  roles and responsibilities of TSNM and TSA-OI for information sharing  and share this document with the appropriate stakeholder groups. Doing  so could help clarify responsibilities and increase accountability.", "DHS also provided three technical clarifications in its written comments.  First, DHS stated that TSA has already begun using multiple information  systems to disseminate intelligence to stakeholders, and provided  examples of these systems.

For example,  differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of  information available to respondents, or the types of people who do not  respond to a question can introduce errors into the survey results. We  included steps in both the data collection and data analysis stages to  minimize such nonsampling errors. As we previously indicated, we  collaborated with our survey specialists to design draft questionnaires,  and versions of the questionnaire were pretested with seven members of  the surveyed population. In addition, we provided a draft of the  questionnaire to industry organizations for their review. From these  pretests and reviews, we made revisions as necessary to reduce the  likelihood of nonresponse and reporting errors on our questions. Our  analysts answered respondent questions and resolved difficulties that  respondents had in answering our questions. We examined the survey  results and performed computer analyses to identify inconsistencies and  other indications of error and addressed such issues, where possible. A  second, independent analyst checked the accuracy of all computer  analyses to minimize the likelihood of errors in data processing. To obtain  additional narrative and supporting context from stakeholders, survey  respondents were given multiple opportunities to provide additional open- ended comments throughout our survey.
