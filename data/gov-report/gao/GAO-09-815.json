GAO was asked to (1) describe sole proprietor losses and the extent to which the losses are noncompliant, (2) assess how well IRS addresses the noncompliance, and (3) identify any options to better limit noncompliant losses.

Ninety-five percent of these loss filers deducted some or all of their losses against other income, deducting a total of $40 billion. According to IRS estimates last made for 2001, 70 percent of the sole proprietor tax returns reporting losses had losses that were either fully or partially noncompliant. About 53 percent of aggregate dollar losses reported in 2001 were noncompliant. This noncompliance would correspond to billions of dollars of lost tax revenue. IRS's compliance programs address only a small portion of sole proprietor expense noncompliance. Despite investing nearly a quarter of all revenue agent time in 2008, IRS was able to examine (audit) about 1 percent of estimated noncompliant sole proprietors. These exams are costly and yielded less revenue than exams of other categories of taxpayers, in part because sole proprietorships are small in terms of receipts. Another enforcement program that primarily uses third-party information to electronically verify compliance is not effective because little expense information is reported by third parties. One approach for limiting sole proprietor loss noncompliance would impose a rule that limits losses that could be deducted from other income. The tax code has a number of such limitations. A loss limitation could reduce noncompliant losses but would also limit the ability of sole proprietors to claim legitimate losses. Another approach would improve IRS's estimates of the extent to which activities not engaged in for profit, such as hobbies, are contributing to noncompliant sole proprietor losses. Expenses associated with these activities are not deductible, but IRS's research on the causes of sole proprietor noncompliance has not used available data to estimate the extent of this type of noncompliance.

Our objectives were to  (1) describe the population of sole proprietors who file losses, their  patterns of losses over time, and their level of noncompliance; (2) assess  whether IRS compliance programs are able to correct a significant portion  of sole proprietor expense and loss noncompliance; and (3) identify what  additional options are available for IRS to close the tax gap for sole  proprietor expenses and losses.", "We used several approaches to analyze sole proprietor expense  noncompliance and to identify options for reducing this noncompliance.  Principally, we analyzed data from IRS\u2019s 2001 National Research Program  (NRP) to identify the extent of sole proprietor loss and expense  noncompliance. We also used IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) program data  to profile profits and losses for sole proprietors in 2006 and combined  these data with other IRS data to form panels of sole proprietor tax  returns from 1998 to 2006 in order to describe patterns of losses over time.

These  business profits or losses are combined with income, deductions, and  credits from other sources that are reported elsewhere on Form 1040 to  compute a taxpayer\u2019s overall individual tax liability.

Two types of  payments\u2014costs of goods sold and capital improvements\u2014must be  distinguished from other types of payments because they are treated  differently under tax rules. To identify the cost of goods sold, businesses  that manufacture or resell merchandise must follow tax rules that require  valuing their inventory at the beginning and end of the tax year. Payments  for capital improvements, such as start-up costs, business assets, and  improvements, usually are not fully deducted in the current tax year but  instead must be depreciated over a multiyear period. Expenses that are  used partly for business and personal purposes can be deducted only to  the extent they are used for business. For example, business use of the  taxpayer\u2019s home or car requires allocating the costs between business and  personal use.", "The general standard for measuring taxable income is to match receipts  and expenses as they occur, that is, their recognition should not be limited  or postponed. However, under certain conditions, the tax code limits the  extent to which losses can be deducted from other categories of income.  One of these limits is that an individual may not deduct losses from  activities that are not engaged in for profit against other income. There are  also limits when an individual did not materially participate in the activity  or for funds that the individual did not put at risk.", "Regulations specify a nine-factor test to help identify activities that are not  engaged in for profit. The losses an individual incurs from activities not  engaged in for profit are sometimes called hobby losses. No single factor is  determinative, and the regulations state that factors other than the nine  cited can be taken into account when identifying a profit objective.  However, taxpayers may still deduct these expenses up to the limit of the  income earned from an activity not engaged in for profit.

Examination at the  taxpayer\u2019s place of business, which is often also the taxpayer\u2019s residence,  expedites the determination of whether unallowable personal expenses  have been deducted on the sole proprietorship return. Examining sole  proprietor expenses often involves complex auditing and legal issues, such  as identifying which payments qualify as \u201cordinary and necessary,\u201d which  requires the high skill levels of revenue agents (rather than those of the  less skilled and less trained correspondence examiners) and interaction  with the taxpayers to understand their books and records.

We estimated that at least 91 percent of such  noncompliance is in expense categories not reported on information  returns. Only one expense item, mortgage interest, is included in AUR.

The extent  would depend upon the specifics of how the rule is structured, as  discussed below.

These rules are structured in several ways,  including absolute ceilings, ceilings linked to AGI or other information  from the return, and carrybacks and carryforwards that allow deductions  over the limit to be carried back or forward to previous or future returns  to be used as deductions. For example, only $3,000 of capital losses over  the amount of capital gains may be deducted from income. In addition,  losses from passive activity are normally deductible only against passive  income. The legislated limits have been enacted for a variety of  compliance reasons, including preventing taxpayers from manipulating the  timing of realizing gains and losses to reduce tax owed, in the case of the  capital loss limitation, and addressing the prevalence of tax shelters, in the  case of the passive income limitation. Appendix II provides additional  examples of loss limitations rules.", "A rule limiting the deduction of sole proprietor losses could contain  various mechanisms to mitigate some of the disadvantages. The  possibilities include the following:    Targeting. A rule could limit the ability to deduct sole proprietor losses  deductions from other, non-sole proprietor income. This limit could either  be an absolute amount (e.g., up to $3,000 from other income) or an amount  determined by formula (e.g., filers may only deduct sole proprietor losses  up to a certain percentage of their other income). Our analysis showed  that targeting could improve the fairness of a loss limitation rule by better  focusing the rule on noncompliance. For example, while 70 percent of sole  proprietor returns with losses were estimated to be noncompliant, 82  percent of returns in 2001 that would have been affected by a $3,000 limit  on sole proprietor loss deductions were noncompliant. Further, while 53  percent of the dollars of sole proprietor losses in 2001 were noncompliant,  55 percent of the dollars that would have been affected by a $3,000 limit  were noncompliant losses.", "Carry forward or back rule. A carry forward or back rule would allow  taxpayers reporting sole proprietor losses to offset sole proprietor income  earned in other years. This would prevent taxpayers from deducting  noncompliant losses against other income, but would allow sole  proprietors with profits in other years to deduct their losses.", "A carry forward or back rule could mitigate both the risk to business  formation and the inequities that can arise from the loss limitation. A  significant proportion of sole proprietors who reported losses could avail  themselves of a carry forward or back rule, but analysis of IRS data  showed that these sole proprietors were not less likely to be  noncompliant. An estimated 36 percent of sole proprietorships reporting  losses on returns in 2001 would have been able to use their entire loss to  offset either previous or future sole proprietor income, and another 10  percent would have been able to use part of their loss.", "Elective document review or examination. A rule limiting sole  proprietor loss deductions could include an option for sole proprietors to  request an IRS review of documents provided by the taxpayer, either pre-  or postfiling. For example, new sole proprietors could include their  business plans and other evidence of their intent to make a profit. The IRS  staff could review these documents in the relatively lower-cost compliance  center environment. IRS does something similar in its Innocent Spouse  program, which makes a complex determination regarding liability for a  tax debt based on a document review, in most cases, in the compliance  center environment. If IRS judges it to be helpful (for example, to ensure  that documents are valid and supportable), this option could require the  sole proprietor extend the statute of limitations for the returns filed with a  sole proprietorship loss so that IRS would have more time to examine the  taxpayer.", "Elective reviews would create administrative costs for IRS and some  compliance burden for taxpayers, but targeting might reduce the number  of reviews significantly. Assuming that only sole proprietors with  compliant losses of $100 or more would apply for review and assuming  that the compliance rate in 2006 is the same as in 2001, we estimated that  there were 3 million sole proprietor returns with compliant losses of at  least $100 in 2006. Targeting the rule to those with losses above about  $7,000 (the top 25 percent of loss filers by the size of filed loss in 2001)  could reduce the number of affected returns for which taxpayers might  apply for review to about 870,000. Targeting the rule further to only affect  those who filed previous losses or exempting those who have gone  through a recent review could further reduce the number of reviews.

Without adding this code to RGS, IRS  cannot use the NRP sample to estimate the extent of noncompliance with  the activities not engaged in for profit and the extent to which such  improper losses contribute to noncompliant sole proprietor losses.", "The same problem exists for IRS\u2019s regular examination program. The  examination program, which also uses the RGS system, does not collect  data on the how often issues related to activities not engaged in for profit  were classified during examinations or how often those issues resulted in  an adjustment to a return. A minimal RGS system update could include a  specific code for activities not engaged in for profit classification and  adjustment issues. More detailed revisions could include specific reasons  why activities not engaged in for profit issues were examined or not  examined, such as likely strength of the case or likely tax change when  compared to additional examination costs. Without these data, IRS cannot  monitor how often the current compliance program addresses activities  not engaged in for profit and the connection to noncompliant sole  proprietor losses, and will not have the data to improve its examination  program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The large number of relatively small sole proprietorships limits IRS\u2019s  opportunity to ensure their compliance through its regular compliance  programs.

However, such a rule would treat  all sole proprietors with losses, compliant and noncompliant, the same. In  considering such a rule, policymakers would have to trade off reducing  noncompliance against disallowing some legitimate losses. Because this is  a policy judgment, we are not making a recommendation to implement  such a rule.", "Short of such a policy change, however, there are steps IRS could take that  have the potential to help mitigate noncompliant sole proprietor losses.  Our review of IRS case files suggests that a portion of noncompliant filers  reporting sole proprietor losses that have been examined may have had  their losses disallowed because of activities not engaged in for profit.  However, because IRS does not estimate a compliance rate for activities  not engaged in for profit or how often these provisions are applied in  regular examinations, IRS lacks information that could be useful for  improving its enforcement approach and reducing the portion of the tax  gap caused by sole proprietor noncompliant losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to better assess whether changes are needed in the way IRS  administers activities not engaged in for profit provisions, we recommend  that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue take steps to    estimate the extent of activities not engaged in for profit noncompliance  from its ongoing research programs and    collect information on examinations of activities not engaged in for profit  issues from the compliance program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report IRS agreed to implement both  recommendations and stated that our report covers a timely and important  topic because of the potential for increasing sole proprietor losses.", "IRS\u2019s comment letter is reprinted in appendix III.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after the  report date.

Because line 12 of Form 1040 is a sum  of sole proprietorship income from potentially several sole  proprietorships, individual sole proprietorships could have had losses  while the net sole proprietorship income that we analyzed was positive, if  the other sole proprietorships on the return had profits.

In the data analysis in this report, the term sole  proprietor refers to a taxpayer who files a 1040 return with one or more  Schedule C forms attached regardless of the filing status of the taxpayer.  Therefore, for example, a joint return with two Schedules C forms  attached is considered a single sole proprietor.", "To examine sole proprietors\u2019 profits and losses over time, we created two  panel data sets based on tax return data from SOI\u2019s tax years 2006 and  2001 stratified random samples of taxpayers. The panels followed tax  returns with one or more Schedule C forms attached as the unit of  analysis. Because the SOI data are a random sample, returns that appear in  the 2006 or 2001 sample may not appear in the samples taken in other  years. Therefore, to construct the panel, we matched the returns in the  2006 and 2001 samples with the same taxpayers\u2019 returns in other years as  stored in another IRS database. Specifically, we obtained tax return data  from 1998 through 2006 from IMF, a copy of which is stored in IRS\u2019s  Compliance Data Warehouse (CDW) for access and analysis for research  purposes.

Regarding filing status, we found similar  percentages in the panel and sample data of taxpayers reporting the same  status. Approximately 54 percent of returns in the 2006 panel had joint  filers, while approximately 60 percent of returns in the 2006 SOI sample  had both a primary and secondary taxpayer.

Taxable income is  computed following this basic principle with some exceptions. In general,  gross income from all sources is included when computing taxable  income, with some exclusions, such as gifts, inheritances, and some death  benefits. Deductions are typically allowed only for expenses related to  activities intended to produce income, such as those related to a trade or  business, or nonbusiness investment expenses, though some personal  expenses can also be deducted to a limited extent.", "When expenses exceed income, the resulting loss can be disallowed,  limited to a certain amount, or deferred to other tax years. Losses have  been limited for several reasons, including preventing tax avoidance,  reducing noncompliance, restricting deductibility of losses against other  sources of income to reduce tax shelters, and disallowing personal  expenses or losses that are not related to the production of income (such  as activities not engaged in for profit or the loss of value on the disposition  of personal property, including residences).", "Several current tax rules limit losses to increase equity and reduce tax  shelters and noncompliance. In 1969, the activities not engaged in for  profit provisions were enacted, in part, because of the perception that  individuals invested in certain aspects of farm operations solely to obtain  losses to reduce their tax on other income. Before 1986, taxpayers could  realize losses in excess of their actual amounts at risk, typically through  limited partnerships, and deduct those losses from other sources of  income. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 included several provisions to limit  transactions that reduced income. Examples include the following:    Tax shelters. Passive activity losses were limited to prevent taxpayers  from using losses from real estate and other investments in which they had  minimal participation to offset other sources of income, such as wages,  salaries, and capital gains. Similarly, at-risk rules were enacted to limit  losses to the actual amount of money invested because of the prevalence  of tax sheltering.", "Limitations on interest. Another example is limiting the deduction of  investment interest to the amount of investment income to prevent  \u201ctaxpayers from sheltering or reducing tax on other, non-investment  income by means of the unrelated interest deduction.\u201d Personal interest  was disallowed as a deduction because it enabled taxpayers to avoid taxes  by purchasing consumables rather than purchasing assets that produce  taxable income.", "Capital losses. Limitations on capital losses were implemented to reduce  the reward for timing loss and gain transactions to avoid paying taxes.  Taxpayers can control when they realize a gain or a loss, thereby  minimizing tax liabilities. The limitations on deducting capital losses are  different for corporate and noncorporate taxpayers. For noncorporate  taxpayers, capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely, but corporate  taxpayers are limited to a 3-year carryback and 5-year carryforward, with  some exceptions. For corporations, capital losses can only be allowed up  to the amount of capital gains, and individuals are allowed an additional  $3,000 loss above the amount of capital gains.", "In some cases, taxpayers have losses that exceed their gross income,  resulting in a negative income flow or a net operating loss. When this  occurs, taxpayers do not owe income tax for that year and can deduct the  net operating loss against taxable income by carrying the losses back or  forward to profitable years in which they paid taxes or would owe taxes.  These deductions allow taxpayers to smooth out business income and  taxes over business cycles. Some taxpayers would attempt to avoid paying  taxes by purchasing stock or assets of a business that had incurred a net  operating loss and using the carryover loss to offset expected future  profits. To reduce such tax avoidance, Congress enacted legislation that  limited corporations from deducting net operating losses when there is a  change in ownership.", "Table 2 summarizes examples of common loss limitation rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kevin Daly, Assistant Director;  Michele Fejfar, Leon Green, Shirley Jones, Edward Nannenhorn, Karen  O\u2019Conor, Erin Saunders-Rath, Sabrina Streagle, and Ethan Wozniak made  key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
