Such modernizations can be guided by an enterprise architecture--a blueprint that describes an organization's current and target state for its business operations and supporting IT systems and a plan for transitioning between the two states. DOD has long sought to employ enterprise architectures and has defined an approach for doing so that depends in large part on the military departments developing architectures of their own. In light of the critical role that military department enterprise architectures play in DOD's overall architecture approach, GAO was requested to assess the status of the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy (DON) enterprise architecture programs. To do so, GAO obtained and analyzed key information about each department's architecture relative to the 59 core elements contained in stages 1 through 6 of GAO's Enterprise Architecture Management Maturity Framework."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While Air Force, Army, and DON each have long-standing efforts to develop and use enterprise architectures, they have much to do before their efforts can be considered mature. GAO's enterprise architecture management framework provides a flexible benchmark against which to plan for and measure architecture program maturity and consists of 59 core elements arranged into a matrix of seven hierarchical stages. The Air Force has fully satisfied 20 percent, partially satisfied 47 percent, and not satisfied 32 percent of GAO's framework elements. The Army has fully satisfied 12 percent and partially satisfied 42 percent of the elements, with the remaining 46 percent not satisfied. Finally, DON has satisfied 27 percent, partially satisfied 41 percent, and not satisfied 32 percent of the framework elements. With respect to stages 1 through 6 of GAO's architecture framework, the military departments have generally begun establishing institutional commitments to their respective enterprise architecture efforts (stage 1), not established the management foundations necessary for effective enterprise architecture development and use (stage 2), begun developing initial enterprise architecture content (stage 3), not completed and used their initial enterprise architecture versions to achieve results (stage 4), not expanded and evolved the development and use of their respective architectures to support institutional transformation (stage 5), and taken limited steps to continuously improve their respective architecture programs and use their architectures to achieve corporate optimization (stage 6). Officials at the military departments stated that they have been limited in their ability to overcome long-standing enterprise architecture management challenges, including receiving adequate funding and attaining sufficient senior leadership understanding. Nevertheless, DOD has been provided with considerable resources for its IT systems environment, which consists of 2,324 systems. Specifically, DOD receives over $30 billion each year for this environment. Without fully developed and effectively managed enterprise architectures and a plan, the Air Force, Army, and DON lack the necessary road maps for transforming their business processes and modernizing their hundreds of supporting systems to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability. What this means is that DOD, as a whole, is not as well positioned as it should be to realize the significant benefits that a well-managed federation of architectures can afford its systems modernization efforts, such as eliminating system overlap and duplication. Because DOD is provided with over $30 billion each year for its IT systems environment, the potential for identifying and avoiding the costs associated with duplicative functionality across its IT investments is significant."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the military departments each develop a plan for fully satisfying the elements of GAO's framework.

Further, DOD\u2019s enterprise architecture approach relies on  each level of its organization (e.g., DOD-wide, military departments, and  programs) to develop a meaningful architecture. Accordingly, the  development and use of a military department enterprise architecture is  critical for organizational transformation and systems modernization  across DOD and within each military department.", "In light of the critical role that military department architectures play in  DOD\u2019s enterprise architecture construct, you asked us to assess the  status of the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy\u2019s enterprise  architecture programs.

However, as we have previously reported, the DOD systems  environment that supports these business functions is overly complex and  error prone, and is characterized by (1) little standardization across the  department, (2) multiple systems performing the same tasks, (3) the  same data being stored in multiple systems, and (4) the need for data to  be entered manually into multiple systems.", "DOD currently bears responsibility, in whole or in part, for 14 of the 30  federal government program areas that we have designated as high risk.  Seven of these areas are specific to DOD and the department shares  responsibility for 7 other governmentwide high-risk areas. The lack of an  effective enterprise architecture is a key contributor to its having many of  these high-risk areas. DOD\u2019s business systems modernization, which is  to be guided by the DOD Business Enterprise Architecture, is one of the  high-risk areas, and is an essential component for addressing many of  the department\u2019s other high-risk areas. For example, modernized  business systems are integral to the department\u2019s efforts to address its  financial, supply chain, and information security management high-risk  areas. A well-defined and effectively implemented enterprise architecture  is, in turn, integral to the successful modernization of DOD\u2019s business  systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enterprise Architecture Is Key to Transforming Business and Mission Operations", "paragraphs": ["An enterprise architecture is a modernization blueprint that describes an  organization\u2019s (e.g., a federal department or agency) or a functional  area\u2019s (e.g., terrorism information sharing or homeland security) current  and target state in both logical and technical terms, as well as a plan for  transitioning between the two states. As such, it is a recognized tenet of  organizational transformation and IT management in public and private  organizations. Without an enterprise architecture, it is unlikely that an  organization will be able to transform business processes and modernize  supporting systems to minimize overlap and maximize interoperability.  For more than a decade, we have conducted work to help federal  agencies improve their architecture efforts. To this end, we developed the  Enterprise Architecture Management Maturity Framework (EAMMF),  which provides federal agencies with a common benchmarking tool for  assessing the management of their enterprise architecture efforts and  developing improvement plans.", "An enterprise can be viewed as either a single organization or a  functional area that transcends more than one organization. An  architecture can be viewed as the structure (or structural description) of  any activity. Thus, enterprise architectures are systematically derived and  captured descriptions depicted in models, diagrams, and narratives.", "More specifically, an architecture describes the enterprise in logical terms  (such as interrelated business processes and business rules, information  needs and flows, and work locations and users) as well as in technical  terms (such as hardware, software, data, communications, security  attributes, and performance standards). It provides these perspectives  both for the enterprise\u2019s current environment, and for its target  environment, and it provides a transition plan for moving from the current  to the target environment.", "Enterprise architectures are a basic tenet of both organizational  transformation and IT management, and their effective use is a  recognized hallmark of successful public and private organizations. For  over a decade, we have promoted the use of architectures, recognizing  them as a crucial means to a challenging end: optimized agency  operations and performance. The alternative, as our work has shown, is  the perpetuation of the kinds of operational environments that saddle  many agencies today, in which the lack of integration among business  operations and the IT resources that support them leads to systems that  are duplicative, not well integrated, and unnecessarily costly to maintain  and interface. Employed in concert with other important IT management  controls (such as portfolio-based capital planning and investment control  practices), an enterprise architecture can greatly increase the chances  that an organization\u2019s operational and IT environments will be configured  to optimize mission performance. Moreover, the development of agency  enterprise architectures is based on statutory requirements and federal  guidance. Further, DOD is required by statute to develop an enterprise  architecture to cover all defense business systems, and the business  transformation initiatives of the military departments are required to  develop a well-defined enterprisewide business systems architecture.", "There are several approaches to structuring an enterprise architecture,  depending on the needs of the agency. In general, these approaches  provide for decomposing an enterprise into its logical parts and  architecting each of the parts in relation to enterprisewide needs and the  inherent relationships and dependencies that exist among the parts. As  such, the approaches are fundamentally aligned and consistent with a  number of basic enterprise architecture principles, such as incremental  rather than monolithic architecture development and implementation,  optimization of the whole rather than optimization of the component parts,  and maximization of shared data and services across the component  parts rather than duplication. Moreover, these approaches are not  mutually exclusive and, in fact, can all be applied to some degree for a  given enterprise, depending on the characteristics and circumstances of  that enterprise. The approaches, which are briefly described here, are  federated, segmented, and service-oriented.", "Under a federated approach, the architecture consists of a family of  coherent but distinct member architectures that conform to an  overarching corporate (i.e., enterprise-level) or parent architecture. This  approach recognizes that each federation member has unique goals and  needs as well as common roles and responsibilities with the members  above and below it. As such, member architectures (e.g., component,  subordinate, or subsidiary architectures) are substantially autonomous,  but they also inherit certain rules, policies, procedures, and services from  the parent architectures. A federated architecture enables component  organization autonomy while ensuring enterprise-level or enterprisewide  linkages and alignment where appropriate.", "A segmented approach to enterprise architecture development and use,  like a federated approach, employs a \u201cdivide and conquer\u201d methodology  in which architecture segments are identified, prioritized, developed, and  implemented. In general, segments can be viewed as logical aspects, or  \u201cslivers,\u201d of the enterprise that can be architected and pursued as  separate initiatives under the overall enterprise-level architecture. As  such, the segments serve as a bridge between the corporate frame of  reference captured in the enterprise architecture and individual programs  within portfolios of system investments.", "Under this approach, functions and applications are defined and designed  as discrete and reusable capabilities or services that may be under the  control of different organizational entities. As such, the capabilities or  services need to be, among other things, (1) self-contained, meaning that  they do not depend on any other functions or applications to execute a  discrete unit of work; (2) published and exposed as self-describing  business capabilities that can be accessed and used; and (3) subscribed  to via well-defined and standardized interfaces.

For example, each level of the  federation is responsible for developing its respective architecture and  imposing constraints on the levels below. Accordingly, the completeness  of the DOD federated enterprise architecture depends on each level of  the federation developing its own respective enterprise architecture.

We issued an update to the framework (version 1.1) in  2003 and a new version (version 2.0) in 2010. Version 2.0 expands on  prior versions based on our experience in using them in evaluating  governmentwide and agency-specific enterprise architectures and our  solicitation of comments from federal agencies and other stakeholders on  the usability, completeness, and sufficiency of the framework. The latest  version provides a more current and pragmatic construct for viewing  architecture development and use. In this regard, it provides a flexible  benchmark against which to plan for and measure architecture program  management maturity that permits thoughtful and reasonable discretion to  be applied in using it. Restated, the framework is not intended to be a  rigidly applied \u201cone size fits all\u201d checklist, but rather a flexible frame of  reference that should be applied in a manner that makes sense for each  organization\u2019s unique facts and circumstances. Specifically, depending on  the size, scope, and complexity of the enterprise, not every framework  core element may be equally applicable, not every assessment has to  consider every element, and not every assessment has to consider every  element in the same level of detail. Moreover, the framework is not  intended to be viewed as the sole benchmarking tool for informing and  understanding an organization\u2019s journey toward architecture maturity.", "Version 2.0 of the framework arranges 59 core elements into a matrix of  seven hierarchical stages. Figure 3 presents a depiction of the seven  stages of maturity.", "Each maturity stage includes all the core elements that are resident in the  previous stages. Each stage is described in detail here. Appendix II  provides a list of core elements arranged by their respective EAMMF  stages.", "At this stage, either an organization does not have plans to develop and  use an enterprise architecture or it has plans that do not demonstrate an  awareness of the management discipline needed to successfully develop,  maintain, and use an enterprise architecture. While Stage 0 organizations  may have initiated some enterprise architecture activity, their efforts are  largely ad hoc and unstructured and lack the institutional leadership  necessary for successful development, maintenance, and use as defined  in Stage 1. Therefore, Stage 0 has no associated core elements.", "At this stage, an organization puts in place the foundational pillars for  treating its enterprise architecture program as an institution and for  overcoming traditional barriers to its success. For example, the  organization grounds enterprise architecture development and  compliance in policy and recognizes it as a corporate asset by vesting  ownership of the architecture with top executives (i.e., lines of business  owners and chief \u201cX\u201d officers). As members of a chartered architecture  executive committee, these individuals are provided with the knowledge  and understanding of the architecture concepts and governance  principles needed to lead and direct the enterprise architecture effort.  Through the enterprise architecture executive committee (hereafter  referred to as the Executive Committee), leadership is demonstrated  through the approval of enterprise architecture goals and objectives and  key aspects of the architecture\u2019s construct, such as the framework(s) to  be used and the approach for establishing the hierarchy and structure of  organization components (e.g., federation members, segments, etc.).  Also during this stage, the central figure in managing the program, the  Chief Architect, is appointed and empowered, and the integral and  relative role of the enterprise architecture vis-\u00e0-vis other enterprise-level  governance disciplines is recognized in enterprise-level policy.  Organizations that achieve this maturity stage have demonstrated  enterprise architecture leadership through an institutional commitment to  developing and using the enterprise architecture as a strategic basis for  directing its development, maintenance, and use.", "This stage builds on the strategic leadership foundation established in  Stage 1 by creating the managerial means to the ends\u2014an initial version  of the enterprise architecture (Stages 3 and 4) and an evolving and  continuously improving enterprise architecture (Stages 5 and 6) that can  be used to help guide and direct investments and achieve the  architecture\u2019s stated purpose. For example, at this stage the organization  establishes operational enterprise architecture program offices, including  an enterprise-level program office that is headed by the Chief Architect,  who reports to the Executive Committee. Also at this stage, the Executive  Committee continues to exercise leadership by ensuring that the Chief  Architect and subordinate architects have the funding and human capital  needed to \u201cstand up\u201d their respective program offices and have acquired  the requisite architecture tools (development and maintenance  methodologies, modeling tools, and repository). Organizations that  achieve this stage have largely established the program management  capacity needed to develop an initial version of the enterprise  architecture.", "At this stage, an organization is focused on strengthening the ability of its  program office(s) to develop an initial version of the enterprise  architecture while also actually developing one or more of these versions.  Among other things, steps are taken to engage stakeholders in the  process and implement human capital plans, to include hiring and training  staff and acquiring contractor expertise. During this stage, these  resources are combined with earlier acquired tools (e.g., framework(s),  methodologies, modeling tools, and repositories) to execute enterprise  architecture management plans and schedules aimed at delivering an  initial enterprise-level version of the architecture that includes current and  target views of the performance, business, data, services, technology,  and security architectures, as well as an initial version of a plan for  transitioning from the current to the target views. Also during this stage,  one or more segment architectures or federation member architectures  are being developed using available tools and defined plans and  schedules, and progress in developing initial architecture versions is  measured by the Chief Architect and reported to the Executive  Committee. Although an organization at this maturity stage does not yet  have a version of an enterprise architecture that is ready for  implementation, it is well on its way to defining an enterprise architecture  of sufficient scope and content that can be used to guide and constrain  investments in a way that can produce targeted results.", "At this stage, an organization has developed a version of its enterprise- level architecture that has been approved by the Executive Committee, to  include current and target views of the performance, business, data,  services, technology, and security architectures, as well as an initial  version of a plan for transitioning from the current to the target views. In  addition, one or more segment and/or federation member architectures  have been developed and approved according to established priorities.  Moreover, the approved enterprise-level and subordinate architectures  are being used to guide and constrain capital investment selection and  control decisions and system life-cycle definition and design decisions.  Also during this stage, a range of factors are measured and reported to  the Executive Committee, such as enterprise architecture product quality,  investment compliance, subordinate architecture alignment, and results  and outcomes.

Moreover, this suite of architecture  products is governed by a common enterprise architecture framework,  methodology, and repository, thus permitting the products to be  appropriately integrated. Also at this stage, the architecture products are  continuously maintained, and major updates of the enterprise-level  architecture are approved by the head of the organization, while  subordinate architecture product updates are approved by their  corresponding organization heads or segment owners. In addition,  architecture product quality (i.e., completeness, consistency, usability,  and utility) as well as enterprise architecture management process  integrity are assessed by an independent agent, and the results are  reported to the Chief Architect and the Executive Committee. An  organization that achieves this level of maturity has established a full  suite of architecture products that can be employed as a featured  decision support tool when considering and planning large-scale  organizational restructuring or transformation initiatives.", "At this stage, an organization is focused on continuously improving the  quality of its suite of enterprise architecture products and the people,  processes, and tools used to govern their development, maintenance,  and use. By achieving this stage of maturity, the organization has  established a truly enterprisewide blueprint to inform both \u201cboard room\u201d  strategic planning and decision making and \u201con-the-ground\u201d  implementation of these changes through a range of capital investment  and maintenance projects and other enterprise-level initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior Reviews of Federal Department and Agency Enterprise Architectures", "paragraphs": ["In 2002 and 2003, we reported on the status of enterprise architectures  governmentwide, including for the Departments of the Air Force, Army,  and Navy.

Accordingly, we made recommendations to  OMB to improve enterprise architecture leadership and oversight.

Other challenges reported were ensuring that  the architecture program had adequate funding (89 percent), obtaining  staff skilled in the architecture discipline (86 percent), and having  department or agency senior leaders that understand the importance and  role of the enterprise architecture (82 percent).

DON  officials stated that a human capital plan is not necessary due to their  small number of staff and lack of a large centralized program office. Air  Force officials stated that the department does not plan to develop such a  plan because enterprise architecture is not a formally established career  field within the federal government.

This  performance gap analysis should also identify the business process  activities or steps that need to be changed to achieve the future  performance expectations. As such, these gap analyses identify  necessary changes or adjustments in the current environment to achieve  business goals and mission outcomes expected in the future  environment, thereby serving as the support for related investments and  activities, and also as a basis for prioritization; integration; and  synchronization of decisions across the spectrum of these investments  and activities.", "Using an enterprise architecture methodology: None of the military  departments has fully satisfied the element associated with developing its  enterprise architecture products according to a defined methodology.

To address this  objective, we asked each department to identify responsible architecture  officials and requested that the identified officials self-assess their  respective department\u2019s architecture programs relative to the 59 core  elements contained in version 2.0 of our Enterprise Architecture  Management Maturity Framework (EAMMF). Specifically, we asked the  officials to indicate whether their respective department architecture  programs fully satisfied, partially satisfied, or did not satisfy each core  element. We also asked the officials to provide documentation in support  of their self assessments. To instruct the officials in preparing their  assessments, we provided the following guidance:  To fully satisfy a core element, sufficient documentation must be provided  to permit us to verify that all applicable aspects of the core element are  met. To partially satisfy a core element, sufficient documentation must be  provided to permit us to verify that at least some aspects of the core  element are met. Core elements that are applicable and are neither fully  nor partially satisfied will be judged to be not satisfied.", "Subsequently, we independently assessed each department\u2019s  architecture program relative to the 59 EAMMF core elements using the  self assessments and supporting documentation as a starting point. We  then corroborated the assessment with supporting documentation, sought  additional information as necessary through interviews with the  departments\u2019 architecture officials, obtained and reviewed additional  documentation as appropriate, and refined our determinations about the  degree to which each core element was satisfied. In performing our  analyses, we used the same criteria for determining whether a given core  element was fully satisfied, partially satisfied, or not satisfied that we had  instructed the departments to use. Finally, we shared with the military  departments the preliminary versions of the analyses that appear in this  report as appendices III, IV, and V, and made further adjustments, as  appropriate, based on additional discussions and supporting  documentation. We also solicited information from each department on  long-standing challenges to the success of enterprise architecture in the  areas of funding, cultural resistance, senior leadership, and staff skills.", "The results presented in this report reflect the state of department and  agency architecture programs as of August 1, 2011.", "In performing our analyses, we interviewed officials and supporting  contractors from the Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy,  including the Offices of the Chief Information Officer. To gain additional  insights into the military departments\u2019 enterprise architecture programs,  we also interviewed officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense.", "We conducted our work in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area from  October 2010 through September 2011, in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that  we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: EAMMF Table", "paragraphs": ["Table 8 summarizes the framework elements in version 2.0 of our  Enterprise Architecture Management Maturity Framework (EAMMF)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Department of the Air Force", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Air Force fully satisfied 12, partially satisfied 28,  and did not satisfy 19 of the 59 elements described in our EAMMF.
