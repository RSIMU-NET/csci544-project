The creation of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (known as CFPB) in 2010 added a significant new player, with offices devoted to financial education broadly and to educating servicemembers, older Americans, and students specifically. The multiagency Commission, created in 2003, coordinates among federal agencies and between federal agencies and state, local, nonprofit, and private entities.

To help avoid unnecessary overlap, CFPB has further delineated its role in financial literacy efforts, discussing respective roles with federal agencies that have overlapping responsibilities and signing agreements on cooperation and areas of focus.", "Evaluation tools. The Commission and CFPB have helped develop and disseminate evaluation tools to assess outcomes and effectiveness of financial literacy programs. CFPB also contracted with a company to develop metrics and outcome measures and with a nonprofit to evaluate and report on financial education programs and activities.", "However, further progress is needed to help ensure effective allocation of federal financial literacy resources and avoid unneeded overlap. In 2012, GAO concluded the Commission was best placed to consider consolidating federal efforts, which could help ensure the most efficient and effective use of federal resources. The Commission's national strategy could serve as a mechanism to identify those resources and how they might be allocated, but has not yet done so.

The Office  of Servicemember Affairs helps educate servicemembers and their  families to make better-informed decisions on consumer financial  products and services, monitors complaints, and coordinates efforts  among federal and state agencies regarding consumer protection  measures. The Office of Financial Protection for Older Americans  develops goals for programs that provide financial literacy and counseling  to help seniors recognize the warning signs of unfair, deceptive, or  abusive practices.

While progress has been made in  coordinating with federal agencies that have overlapping financial literacy  responsibilities, we noted in 2012 that the creation of CFPB signaled an  opportunity for reconsidering more broadly how federal financial literacy  efforts are organized. In particular, some consolidation of these efforts  could help ensure the most efficient and effective use of federal  resources.
