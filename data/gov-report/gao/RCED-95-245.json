The act required USEC, which began providing enrichment services on July 1, 1993, to develop by July 1995 a plan to privatize the corporation. On June 30, 1995, USEC issued its privatization plan and formally notified the Congress of its intent to implement the plan. Implementation could result in the sale of USEC\u2019s stock in early 1996. If and when this sale takes place, it will represent the largest and most important privatization transaction involving the U.S. government since the government sold its equity interest in Conrail for over $1.6 billion through a public stock offering in 1987.", "Under the act, before the plan can be implemented, (1) the Congress must have at least 60 days to review the plan, (2) the President must approve it, and (3) USEC must consult with the appropriate federal agencies and make several statutory findings. For example, USEC must determine that privatization will (1) result in a return to the United States at least equal to the net present value of the corporation and (2) not result in control or ownership by a foreign corporation or government.", "The act also requires the Comptroller General to report to the Congress on the extent to which (1) the revenues gained by the government under the plan would represent at least the net present value of the corporation and (2) the plan would result in any ongoing obligation or undue cost to the federal government. In this report, we evaluate the net present value of a privatized corporation. However, the act does not state whether the net present value is intended to be (1) the net present value of the expected cash flows for a privatized corporation or (2) the net present value of the expected cash flows for the corporation if it stays in the government. Therefore, in appendix II, we also develop an estimate of the net present value of USEC as a government corporation. Similarly, because the act does not define \u201congoing obligation or undue cost,\u201d this report will identify the government\u2019s major costs and liabilities.", "Because the act required us to issue our report shortly after USEC gave its notice of intent to implement the plan, much of our report is based on data and assumptions that could change before the planned sale occurs next year. Also, we note that calculating the net present value of estimated future cash flows is only one method of determining the value of a company; therefore, the net present value numbers discussed in this report do not represent estimates of the corporation\u2019s value. Because no specific transaction (i.e., stock sale, merger, or acquisition) has provided a basis for comparison with an estimate of the corporation\u2019s net present value, we focused our review on the plan\u2019s estimated sale price, the net present value analyses used in part to develop the price, and the process that will be used to review and approve the final sale. We plan to continue assisting the Congress as it reviews the privatization of USEC and considers the sale of other federal assets and programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the 1940s and 1950s, the federal government built three large uranium enrichment plants for national defense purposes. In 1969, it began enriching uranium at these plants for the emerging commercial nuclear power industry. Until the mid-1970s, the U.S. government supplied nearly 100 percent of the free world\u2019s enrichment requirements. By the early 1980s, however, foreign competitors began eroding the program\u2019s market share, and DOE found it more and more difficult to recover costs in an increasingly competitive market.", "The Energy Policy Act of 1992 (the act) restructured the uranium enrichment program to make it more competitive with foreign enterprises. The act created USEC and exempted it from many of the operating restrictions imposed on the former DOE program. For example, USEC does not derive its spending authority from annual appropriations and is exempt from some federal procurement requirements. Under the act, DOE leases the two operating enrichment plants to USEC at cost excluding depreciation and imputed interest. DOE also manages two long-term power purchase contracts that provide low-cost electricity for which USEC pays.The act also required USEC to issue 100 percent of its common stock to the U.S. Treasury and required the Secretary of the Treasury to annually assess the value of the stock. In response to the Department of the Treasury\u2019s request that USEC provide an estimate of the value of the stock, the corporation engaged J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. (Morgan).", "At the end of fiscal year 1994, its first full year of operations, USEC reported gross revenues of about $1.4 billion and a net income of about $377 million after accruing funds to pay for waste disposal and other liabilities. It supplied about 88 percent of the domestic market and 40 percent of the world market, making USEC the world\u2019s largest supplier of enrichment services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USEC\u2019s Privatization Plan", "paragraphs": ["On June 30, 1995, USEC issued its privatization plan, which recommends that a \u201cdual path\u201d process be followed to help ensure the sale of the corporation in early 1996 by either (1) a public offering of its stock or (2) a merger with or an acquisition by a single buyer or group of buyers. According to the plan, USEC\u2019s preliminary assessment of the merger and acquisition market indicates that relatively few companies have both the strategic interest and the resources necessary for a transaction of this size. The final approach will depend upon which option is determined to better meet the act\u2019s requirements.", "The plan, citing analyses performed by Morgan, USEC\u2019s financial adviser, projects that USEC\u2019s stock could be sold for $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion (less about $100 million in expected transaction fees). The plan also projects that the government will retain $600 million to $800 million of the approximately $1.2 billion that USEC expects will be in its Treasury account at the time of privatization. (USEC\u2019s plan calls the amount to be left with the government an \u201cexit dividend.\u201d We note, however, that because USEC is a government corporation, these funds already belong to the government. In addition, USEC\u2019s plan assumes that $400 million to $600 million will be transferred out of the Treasury when USEC is sold. This cash must be subtracted from the sale price to determine the net proceeds to the government.) Furthermore, after privatization, USEC would be a taxable entity that might produce additional tax revenue to the government.", "The privatization plan assumes that, to help realize these returns, the Congress will pass legislation that will, among other things, (1) assign to the government most of the known liabilities that USEC incurred as a government corporation, (2) transfer government contracts to a privatized USEC, and (3) ensure USEC\u2019s ability to dispose of low-level radioactive waste. The plan also assumes that new legislation will clarify USEC\u2019s ability to sell the natural uranium component of enriched uranium purchased under a 20-year contract with the Russians and that the Russian contract will continue to be implemented at current prices. This contract was signed in January 1994, after Russia agreed to sell the United States enriched uranium obtained from processing approximately 500 metric tons of bomb-grade uranium removed from Russian nuclear weapons.", "According to USEC, if all of the material is purchased at the prices currently specified in the contract, USEC will pay about $8 billion for Russian enrichment services and another $4 billion for the natural uranium contained in the enriched uranium purchased. After USEC takes title to the enriched uranium, the contract calls for prompt payment for the enrichment services upon delivery; however, payment to the Russians for the uranium component is made only when it is sold and/or used, or at the end of the contract. Because of existing trade restrictions, USEC cannot currently sell Russian natural uranium in the United States, and little, if any, market exists for it overseas. Moreover, according to USEC officials, it is not economically feasible to use the uranium in USEC\u2019s production processes. Since the Russians will not receive immediate payment for the natural uranium, they have threatened to terminate the contract.", "A number of solutions have been suggested. For example, the administration announced in early July 1995 that USEC had agreed, in a joint protocol with its Russian counterpart, to pursue steps that would eventually allow Russia to receive full and simultaneous payment for both natural uranium and enrichment services under the contract. These steps include pursuing administrative and legislative actions that would allow the introduction into the U.S. market of uranium purchased under the Russian contract. Another approach is proposed in Senate legislation, S. 755, which provides for a delayed and restricted entry of the uranium into the U.S. market. (For more information on the Russian contract, see app. I.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining the Value of USEC", "paragraphs": ["In developing its privatization plan, USEC relied on Morgan to determine the value of the corporation if it were privatized. According to an April 1995 presentation to USEC\u2019s board of directors, Morgan employed three valuation methodologies, one of which analyzed the net present value of projected cash flows, to estimate the value of USEC as a private corporation and forecast the proceeds resulting from a public sale. After considering the results of these analyses, Morgan used its judgment of investors\u2019 perceptions and management\u2019s credibility to project that the sale price of USEC\u2019s common stock would be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, less transaction fees of about $100 million. (See app. II for a more detailed explanation.)", "We did not independently value USEC as either a private or a government corporation. Rather, as we describe in the following section, we evaluated Morgan\u2019s model of a private USEC. In addition, as we describe in appendix II, we adjusted Morgan\u2019s net present value analysis to reflect our view of the activities of a government corporation. Because Morgan\u2019s analysis is subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties, our results are subject to the same uncertainties."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Needed Revisions to Morgan\u2019s Net Present Value Analysis of a Private USEC", "paragraphs": ["At this time, no specific transaction (i.e., stock sale, merger, or acquisition) has provided a benchmark for evaluating estimates of the net present value of the corporation; therefore, we focused our review on the plan\u2019s estimated sale price. In an April 1995 report provided to USEC\u2019s board of directors, Morgan calculated a range of net present values for USEC under two scenarios\u2014one that used only the existing enrichment plants and the other that assumed a plant using the atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) process would be built. We believe, however, that Morgan\u2019s net present value analysis needs revision because it (1) assumes that the current price of the Russian enriched uranium to be purchased by USEC under the long-term contract will not change, (2) may include more working capital than USEC will actually need, and (3) does not reflect, among other things, current market conditions and the administration\u2019s current estimate of the amount of cash USEC will take with it if it is privatized. Also, Morgan\u2019s analysis does not consider the value of USEC\u2019s excess inventory, which we estimate could be worth over $300 million. Furthermore, DOE may transfer additional uranium inventory to the corporation before it is privatized; this inventory could be worth up to $400 million. (See app. II for a more detailed explanation.)", "Finally, we note that any estimate of earnings from uranium enrichment operations is subject to major uncertainties because of the inherent difficulty in determining the amount and the selling price of uranium enrichment services. Important and unforeseen market developments, such as a change in existing trade restrictions, could cause significant changes in the estimates. Also, if USEC is sold, its final value will be determined by the merger and/or acquisition purchaser(s) or the market for the initial public stock offering at the time of privatization."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Expected Impact on the U.S. Treasury", "paragraphs": ["The total impact on the U.S. Treasury of privatization will depend on the proceeds from the sale, projected by Morgan to be between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion (less transaction fees), plus any additional tax revenues that a private USEC may pay in the future to the government, less the cash that USEC will take with it from its Treasury account when it is sold.", "Although future tax payments may increase the returns to the U.S. Treasury under the privatization scenario, the Treasury\u2019s cash will be reduced by the $400 million to $600 million that USEC will take with it when it is privatized. Thus, as shown in table 1, the total increase to the Treasury from privatizing USEC could be between $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion.", "Using the government\u2019s borrowing rate as the discount rate, we developed two estimates of the net present value of the taxes that a privatized USEC could pay to the Treasury. Under case A, which applies the maximum effective corporate federal tax rate of 35 percent to all of USEC\u2019s projected earnings under the existing plants scenario, USEC\u2019s taxes could be as high as $1.1 billion. Under case B, which applies an average effective federal tax rate of 20 percent to USEC\u2019s earnings under the AVLIS scenario for the period from 1996 to 2008\u2014the same period that Morgan used in its analysis of future taxes\u2014USEC\u2019s taxes would be $700 million. (According to Morgan officials, estimating taxes beyond 2008 is difficult because of potential changes in tax policy and other uncertainties.) However, projecting USEC\u2019s future taxes is very uncertain, and USEC\u2019s payments could be much lower than estimated in either case. For example, if the corporation were to merge with or be acquired by a private firm, rather than be sold through a stock offering, its taxes could be much lower, depending on the tax position of the acquiring company."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Privatization Process", "paragraphs": ["The process used to privatize USEC may lay the groundwork for future federal privatizations. Therefore, it is important that the process followed for privatizing USEC protect the American taxpayers\u2019 interests as fully as possible. In addition, the privatization of USEC carries with it important national security interests that must be addressed. Furthermore, it is a complex financial undertaking that may result in large future profits. For these reasons, the privatization process should be highly scrutinized and the taxpayers\u2019 financial interests protected. These goals can be accomplished by designating the Department of the Treasury as the lead agency in the privatization process. Moreover, safeguards will need to be considered to ensure that the taxpayers\u2019 interests are protected if, because of the complexity of the privatization effort, the corporation is undervalued when sold.", "Under the act, the Secretary of the Treasury and USEC are assigned different roles in the privatization. The Secretary is designated to hold the stock of the corporation for the United States; the stock cannot be sold except to carry out the purposes of privatization. The act also makes it clear that the role of the Secretary as sole shareholder does not impinge on the management responsibilities of the corporation\u2014all of the rights and duties pertaining to the corporation\u2019s management remain vested in the corporation\u2019s board of directors. Furthermore, the act makes the corporation responsible for preparing a strategic plan for transferring the ownership of the corporation to private investors and revising the plan, as needed. In addition, the act specifies that, subject to the necessary congressional review and presidential approval, the plan can be implemented if the corporation, in consultation with the appropriate federal agencies, makes certain statutory findings.", "The corporation\u2019s board of directors submitted the privatization plan to the Congress and the President on June 30, 1995. The board recommended that USEC follow a dual path to privatization by simultaneously pursuing an initial public stock offering and a negotiated sale, selecting the approach that better meets the act\u2019s statutory requirements. The board unanimously recommended that the President approve the plan and direct USEC, in consultation with the appropriate federal agencies, to act to fulfill all statutory requirements necessary for implementing the plan.", "Given USEC\u2019s statutory authority and the Treasury\u2019s shareholder responsibilities, the plan provides that USEC will consult on a regular basis with the Department of the Treasury and other appropriate federal agencies. After completing the plan, USEC and the Treasury acted to formalize their understanding of the unique role of the Secretary as the sole shareholder in the privatization process. According to corporation officials, the consummation of a public stock offering requires that the Secretary of the Treasury, as the sole shareholder, execute the underwriting agreement by which the price is set for the sale. Similarly, according to USEC, under state law the Secretary must approve any acquisition of USEC in a negotiated transaction.", "Because the Secretary of the Treasury is the sole shareholder of the corporation, the corporation\u2019s president and chief executive officer sent a letter to the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance specifying that the corporation will take certain key actions only with the concurrence of the Department of the Treasury. These actions include (1) deciding whether to finalize a public stock offering or merger and/or acquisition, (2) concurring on the terms contained in the underwriting agreement concerning a public stock offering, and (3) concurring on the terms contained in the sale agreement concerning a merger and/or acquisition. The letter was written with the concurrence of USEC\u2019s directors.", "Although the corporation recognizes the unique role of the Treasury in the privatization process, the corporation, not the Treasury, still maintains the lead role in the privatization effort. Moreover, the act requires the corporation, not the Treasury, to make the definitive statutory findings that will allow the privatization plan to be implemented. The plan anticipates that these statutory findings will be made by December 1995, several months after the congressional review period has passed and the President\u2019s approval is expected.", "We believe that to fully protect the American taxpayers, the Treasury, not USEC and its board, should be in charge of the privatization process. Not only is the Secretary of the Treasury the sole shareholder but also, more importantly, the Treasury\u2019s fundamental mission is to establish appropriate government financial policy. Furthermore, Treasury officials, unlike USEC\u2019s managers and its board, will not be affected by the privatization. While we do not find fault with the manner in which USEC is fulfilling its statutory role, the Treasury can better ensure that the highest degree of impartiality is brought to the privatization process.", "Thus, we believe that to protect the American taxpayers\u2019 interests as fully as possible, the Treasury should be in charge of the privatization and make the necessary statutory findings in consultation with the corporation. While the corporation would play a key role in the privatization, the Treasury would take the lead. In so doing, the Treasury would make the key decisions about when and how to sell the corporation. It might also consider other sales strategies, such as selling portions of the corporation\u2019s stock at intervals if it is determined that the market could not absorb such a large stock offering at one time. Such a phased, or \u201ctranche,\u201d sale is allowed under the act but would raise questions about how the corporation would be managed while it had both government and private owners.", "We also believe that safeguards should be established to ensure the taxpayers\u2019 share in any large profits that may accrue to the corporation within a reasonable time after privatization. Large profits may accrue, for example, from using the AVLIS technology or from selling excess inventory. We are aware of at least two mechanisms that have been used to ensure that a government shares in the profits resulting from its past investments. First, a \u201cclawback\u201d provision in a sales agreement gives the seller the right to share in the gains (or excess profits) made after the initial sale, thereby protecting the seller from an understated valuation. In Great Britain, such provisions were incorporated in government property sale agreements and could require payments to the government for up to 10 years after the sale.", "Second, to help accomplish the same objective, warrants issued to the government might be attached to the final sale agreement. Warrants represent options to purchase stock for a specified time and price. These instruments were used to give the government a share in Chrysler\u2019s future profits in return for the risks the government incurred in offering guaranteed loans as part of the Chrysler \u201cbailout.\u201d Similarly, warrants could be used to try to ensure a future return to the government from any large profits that might accrue from a privatized USEC\u2019s development of the AVLIS technology or from the sale of excess inventory."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Government\u2019s Ongoing Obligations and Costs", "paragraphs": ["The government will pay billions of dollars for ongoing obligations whether or not USEC is privatized. The privatization plan also assumes that liabilities of between $258 million and $540 million, incurred by USEC since it began operations in July 1993, will remain with the government after USEC is privatized. Under the act, DOE generally retains responsibility for liabilities resulting from its enrichment operations before they were transferred to USEC on July 1, 1993. These \u201cpreexisting\u201d liabilities, which DOE must pay regardless of whether USEC is privatized, were further clarified, initially by a July 1993 lease agreement between USEC and DOE, and later by a December 1994 memorandum of agreement between USEC and DOE. Many of these preexisting liabilities are undefined, but they could eventually cost the government $17.8 billion or more, depending on, among other things, how, when, and to what degree the aging enrichment plants are cleaned up.", "In addition, DOE retains certain responsibilities associated with the enrichment program\u2019s activities after July 1, 1993. For example, under the provisions of an April 1995 memorandum of agreement, DOE retains some liabilities associated with the AVLIS research and development facilities at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. DOE has not yet quantified these liabilities. DOE also manages the plants under a lease with USEC and continues to receive power under two favorable electricity supply contracts. DOE resells that power to USEC at cost. (The benefits of these contracts are included in the projected cash flows we and Morgan used; hence, their value is considered in the net present value analyses.)", "Furthermore, since July 1993, USEC has incurred liabilities that could cost between $258 million and $540 million. As long as USEC remains a government corporation, its costs and liabilities are the government\u2019s responsibility, although the act generally requires USEC to pay all of its costs without additional federal assistance. Nevertheless, it is not clear how these costs and liabilities would be apportioned between the government and USEC if USEC were privatized without new legislation specifically defining the responsibility for these costs and liabilities. According to USEC officials, legislation is needed to define these liabilities and thereby achieve the maximum return to taxpayers and ensure the corporation\u2019s viability. The officials believe that without a clear delineation of the government\u2019s costs and liabilities, private investors considering the purchase of USEC\u2019s stock would assume the worst and lower the price paid for USEC.", "The plan\u2019s valuation analyses assume that the Congress will pass legislation that will require the government to retain responsibility for the liabilities that USEC incurs before it is privatized. Currently, the Congress is considering several bills that would facilitate the privatization of USEC by clarifying certain issues, such as how enrichment contracts would be transferred, how the proceeds from the sale would be counted towards reducing the federal deficit, and how USEC\u2019s liabilities would be assigned. For example, on April 5, 1995, the House passed H.R. 1215, the Tax Fairness and Deficit Reduction Act of 1995. Title III of that bill, the USEC Privatization Act, would assign to the government the liabilities incurred by USEC from the time it took over the DOE program (July 1993) up to the date of privatization. On the Senate side, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is also considering a bill (S. 755) to privatize the corporation. However, this bill would not change the language in the act requiring the corporation to be responsible for any judgment resulting from its operations after July 1993.", "In addition, the corporation has provided the Congress with the administration\u2019s proposed bill on privatization. Under this proposal, the costs associated with the operation of the enrichment program up to the date of privatization would remain with the government except for those liabilities identified in a memorandum of agreement between the corporation and the Office of Management and Budget, to be entered into before privatization. According to USEC officials, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources may consider the administration\u2019s bill when it marks up S. 755.", "Table 2, which was prepared from the best available estimates, generally summarizes, in 1995 dollars, the government\u2019s preexisting liabilities associated with the enrichment program and the liabilities the government would retain under H.R. 1215 and the administration\u2019s bill. USEC\u2019s privatization plan assumes that most of the government corporation\u2019s liabilities will remain with the government.", "For more information on the government\u2019s costs and ongoing obligations associated with the enrichment program, see appendix IV."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["At this point, there are no defined revenues associated with the sale of USEC that can be compared with estimates of the net present value of the corporation; therefore, we focused our review on the plan\u2019s estimated sale price and the process that will be followed to privatize USEC. USEC\u2019s privatization plan states that a public sale of the corporation\u2019s stock would probably return between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion to the government before estimated transaction fees are considered. This range was derived by Morgan after it conducted various analyses, including net present value calculations of several possible USEC cash flow scenarios. After future taxes and the cash USEC expects to take with it from the Treasury are considered, the total return to the Treasury from privatizing USEC could be between $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion.", "However, we believe that Morgan\u2019s net present value analysis on which the plan\u2019s expected sale price is partly based needs revision for several reasons. For example, the analysis needs to be updated to reflect current market conditions and recent administration decisions. Because Morgan relied, in part, on other analyses and its expert judgment in determining the plan\u2019s estimated sale price, we cannot estimate the effect that these needed adjustments would have on the range of sale prices forecasted in the plan. In addition, Morgan\u2019s analysis does not consider the excess uranium inventory owned by USEC. If the privatization process will not provide a fair return for this inventory, DOE could retain an interest in the inventory until it is sold.", "We believe that Morgan\u2019s analysis should be revised to reflect needed updates and adjustments so that the Congress and key officials in the executive branch who are involved in making decisions about USEC\u2019s privatization will have the best available information. We also recognize that federal decisionmakers will not evaluate USEC\u2019s privatization on the basis of financial considerations alone; rather they will also consider other factors, including the national security implications of the sale and the desirability, given the program\u2019s past problems, of the government\u2019s staying in the uranium enrichment business.", "Because USEC\u2019s privatization may set a precedent for future privatizations, it needs to be accomplished in a manner that will set the standard for assuring federal taxpayers that their interests will be protected in such sales. Moreover, because of the national security implications and the financial complexity of the sale, scrutiny should be given to the process. While we do not find fault with USEC\u2019s performance, we believe that, to fully ensure the integrity of the process, the Secretary of the Treasury, not USEC\u2019s board of directors, should have the lead role.", "According to our estimates, the government could eventually pay $17.8 billion or more in costs associated with the former DOE program whether or not USEC is privatized.

Consequently, USEC says that our recommendation deserves further consideration, and Treasury does not object to the enactment of legislation that would give the Department the lead role in the privatization. However, Treasury indicated that the report should not give the incorrect impression that the Department has not undertaken a prominent role in the process to date. In addition, USEC and Treasury support a continuing evaluation of privatization issues, which could include considering the use of warrants to ensure against windfall profits at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.", "As discussed in our report, we recognize that under the privatization plan and a subsequent letter, the Department of the Treasury will play an active role in the privatization and will concur in key decisions. However, under current law, USEC\u2019s managers and board of directors have assumed the lead role in the process and will make the statutory findings required for privatization.

As Treasury notes in its comments, its fundamental mission is to establish appropriate government financial policy. Moreover, Treasury officials, unlike USEC\u2019s managers or board, will not be affected by the privatization.", "According to USEC and Treasury, our analysis of the value of USEC as a private corporation is flawed because future taxes are understated. As we point out in our report, projecting USEC\u2019s future taxes is very uncertain and there is no one correct way to estimate the amount of these taxes. We further note that USEC provided no estimate of taxes in its privatization plan and, in fact, indicated that the payment of any taxes by the private entity is not certain. However, we believe it reasonable to assume that some taxes will be paid by a privatized USEC, and we wanted to recognize that probability in our analysis. Therefore, for both of the cases we developed to project a privatized USEC\u2019s future taxes, we initially used the same methodology that Morgan used in its April 1995 presentation to USEC\u2019s board of directors. However, in response to Treasury\u2019s and USEC\u2019s comments, we extended our projection for one of the cases to include the taxes to be paid on revenues earned by the corporation throughout its expected operating life.", "USEC also commented that our analysis is flawed because it grossly understates the costs that USEC would incur if it remained in the government. We disagree and believe our estimate to be reasonable, although we recognize that the long-term cost and revenue projections for any scenario for USEC are subject to many uncertainties. However, in response to USEC\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s concern about the implications of comparing these numbers with Morgan\u2019s analysis of a privatized USEC\u2019s value, we moved our analysis of a government corporation\u2019s value to appendix II.", "Furthermore, we note that for our government corporation scenario, we started with the same cost estimates that Morgan used in its April 1995 net present value analysis of an \u201cexisting plants\u201d or non-AVLIS scenario, which was used, in part, to develop the privatization plan\u2019s valuation estimates. This net present value analysis incorporated cost projections provided by USEC\u2019s management plus tens of millions of dollars in additional costs that Morgan believed were needed to better reflect the true cost of maintaining the aging enrichment plants. Our model for a government corporation contains projections reflecting pessimistic assumptions that increase Morgan\u2019s cost estimates by hundreds of millions of dollars. Therefore, we believe that the costs included in our government corporation scenario are reasonable when compared with the projections Morgan used to develop the valuation estimates included in the privatization plan.", "Treasury also criticized our report for not reaching any preliminary conclusions about the privatization and implying that the net present value of the revenues from a government corporation would be greater than the return to the Treasury from a privatized USEC. Treasury also suggested that because our net present value estimates are based on the cash flow model developed by Morgan, they may be based on assumptions that may not be appropriate for calculations required under the act. In conclusion, Treasury noted that our report appears incomplete and that a fuller analysis and clearer explanation of our work is needed. Treasury also made several specific points, including the following: In our report, we identified several adjustments that are needed in Morgan\u2019s net present value analysis. Treasury believes that we applied these adjustments to our analysis of a government corporation, but not to our analysis of a private USEC, and that our analyses are therefore inconsistent.", "Treasury believes that we did not adequately consider the existing contracts that provide electricity to the existing enrichment plants at favorable rates.", "In response to these comments, we first note that we used the best available information to address the act\u2019s requirements that we evaluate the extent to which (1) the revenues gained by the federal government under the privatization plan would represent at least the net present value of the corporation and (2) the privatization plan would result in any ongoing obligations or undue costs to the federal government. Most of the information we used, by necessity, came from USEC and Morgan. Second, because the proposed sale of USEC is many months away, we could not determine whether the actual proceeds from the sale of USEC would at least equal the net present value of the corporation. Consequently, we had to start with Morgan\u2019s estimate of the gross proceeds from the sale to project the effect of the proposed sale on the Treasury.", "To estimate the net present value of the corporation, we first reviewed Morgan\u2019s calculation of the net present value of a privatized USEC. In doing so, we identified several weaknesses in Morgan\u2019s analysis. However, we did not identify the dollar effect of the needed adjustments to Morgan\u2019s analysis because (1) USEC raised concerns that doing so would involve sensitive proprietary issues and information and (2) a change in Morgan\u2019s net present value estimates would not necessarily affect Morgan\u2019s final estimate of the sale proceeds, which is based, in part, on other analyses and professional judgment. It is also important to note that most of the adjustments are not applicable to the government corporation scenario and would not necessarily affect the final estimate of the sale proceeds.", "To further aid the Congress as it considers the privatization plan we also looked at the net present value of a government USEC, and, for illustrative purposes, applied a wide range of potential private-sector discount rates to the government corporation\u2019s cash flows to show the sensitivity of the different rates. However, we know of no assumptions used in any of our work that are, as Treasury suggested, inappropriate to the calculations required by the act, nor did Treasury specifically identify any.", "Thus, we believe that we objectively and completely accomplished our legislative mandate, although we clearly recognize that the current, available information is subject to much uncertainty. Furthermore, we believe that our report presents the results of these analyses impartially, for informational purposes, and notes that other factors should be considered by federal decisionmakers when evaluating the privatization of USEC. We did not take a position on the privatization because there is no specific transaction to evaluate.", "When comparing our analysis of the impact on the U.S. Treasury of privatizing USEC with our estimate of the net present value of retaining USEC as a government corporation, one needs to consider the financial impact of the initial public offering discount, the fees paid to the underwriter(s), and the cash USEC will take with it. These factors associated with the privatization will likely cost the government several hundred million dollars; thus, any future taxes and the actual sale proceeds may not necessarily increase the total return to the Treasury to the same level as the net present value of a government corporation\u2019s estimated revenue stream. We would also point out that there are only three key differences between our net present value analysis of a government corporation and Morgan\u2019s analysis of a private USEC: (1) the government corporation scenario does not assume the building of an AVLIS plant, (2) the government corporation does not pay taxes, and (3) the discount rate for the government corporation scenario is lower than the discount rate for the private-sector scenario. Furthermore, it is also possible that, because of the weaknesses we identified in Morgan\u2019s model, the privatization plan\u2019s estimate of the sale proceeds should be raised.", "Finally, it appears that Treasury and some others may be unaware that the Secretary of Energy has determined that certain power purchase agreements related to the operation of the plants cannot be transferred from DOE to USEC under the agreements\u2019 terms. As authorized under the act, DOE continues to receive power under these contracts, and, through the lease and a memorandum of agreement, resells such power to USEC at cost. Thus, the effect of these favorable rates is already included in our (and Morgan\u2019s) net present value calculations for USEC.", "In conclusion, we believe our report fully and objectively responds to our legislative mandate, given the constraints mentioned above. However, we recognize that the privatization of USEC is an evolving process and that better and more complete information may become available. Therefore, we plan to continue to assist the Congress as it participates in the process and Treasury conducts it own analysis of the privatization.", "We performed a number of steps to obtain and analyze information for this report. To determine the government\u2019s costs and ongoing obligations associated with the uranium enrichment program and the proposed privatization of USEC, we interviewed DOE, Commerce, Treasury, USEC, and Office of Management and Budget officials and reviewed pertinent documents, such as the USEC privatization plan, the lease agreement for the enrichment plants, the uranium enrichment power contracts, and proposed legislation. To estimate the net present value of USEC\u2019s cash flows, we interviewed USEC and Morgan officials, reviewed Morgan\u2019s model and USEC\u2019s strategic planning documents, and spoke to DOE officials who formerly managed the program. Using available data from USEC and Morgan, we also constructed our own cash flow model for USEC if it remained a government corporation. Appendix V contains a more detailed discussion of our objectives, scope, and methodology. We conducted our review between March 1995 and August 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Energy, the President and Chief Executive Officer of USEC, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

The HEU is to be converted to low enriched uranium (LEU) suitable for use as fuel in commercial nuclear power reactors. The agreement, financed through the commercial sale of the converted uranium, is not expected to cost the U.S. taxpayers any money. Under the contract implementing the agreement, USEC, the designated U.S. executive agent, pays for approximately two-thirds of the LEU\u2019s value within 60 days of receipt; it pays for the remaining third after it resells or uses the natural uranium component. Based on the initial price established under the contract, the estimated value of the LEU is $12 billion.", "Existing trade restrictions limit the commercial sale in the United States of uranium imported from the Russian Federation (Russia). USEC officials state that from a business standpoint, it would be imprudent to pay for the natural uranium component upon delivery without a resale market for the uranium. If the corporation did so, the uranium would appear as an impaired asset on its balance sheet, compromising its attempt to privatize. The Russians, however, want to be paid upon delivery for the natural uranium component and have threatened to pull out of the agreement unless a satisfactory solution can be found.", "A number of possible solutions have been suggested. For example, the Senate legislative proposal, S. 755, introduces a framework to allow the introduction of Russian natural uranium into the U.S. market. Under this proposal, title to the natural uranium displaced under the HEU contract would be given to the Russians. Russia could sell the uranium now, but only for delivery in the United States after 2002.", "The administration made another suggestion. Recently, the U.S. Vice President met with the Russian Prime Minister to discuss the HEU agreement. Recognizing the importance of the agreement, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the accord in a protocol signed at the meeting. The protocol specifies that the United States will (1) take the necessary actions to allow the corporation to implement a tiered sales approach for the entry into the U.S. marketplace of the natural uranium component and (2) enact the legislation necessary to authorize the President to waive antidumping duties and other trade restrictions against LEU under the HEU contract.", "The Nuclear Energy Institute (NEI), a trade group representing the nuclear industry, has also proposed a solution to the HEU problem. NEI proposes, in a \u201ctalking points\u201d paper, that a government entity be named as the executive agent under the government-to-government agreement. USEC would have the right of first refusal to purchase the value of the enrichment services, measured in separative work units (SWU), at cost.

Additional annual amounts may be ordered, subject to mutual agreement in annual reviews.", "Although, the agreement contemplated that the initial delivery of converted HEU would be made by October 1993 if possible, implementation has been delayed. Three deliveries arrived just recently in Ohio. According to USEC officials, the delay was caused by technical problems encountered by the Russians in meeting commercial nuclear fuel specifications; these problems have apparently been resolved.

Under this bill, natural uranium displaced by LEU imported under the HEU agreement with the Russians would be deemed to be of Russian origin and title to such material would be given to the Russians. The uranium component could be sold immediately, but only for delivery after 2002 (i.e., as futures contracts). The Russians would be free to dispose of the uranium in one of four ways: (1) sell it for delivery in the United States as a matched sale, (2) sell/deliver it outside the United States as Russian uranium, (3) sell it to USEC for overfeed, or (4) sell it for delivery in the United States under futures contracts for delivery after 2002.", "For this provision to be workable, several issues would need to be addressed. The Russians would have to agree to it, since it would, more than likely, result in a modification of the implementing contract. Under the implementing contract, the Russians have the option of taking title to any uranium component that the corporation does not order. In addition, deliveries would have to be ensured to provide certainty in the futures market.", "Moreover, according to an analysis performed by J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc.

Morgan suggests that prepayments could be structured with other entities under certain terms and conditions. Banks or other financial investors would be interested in providing cash up front in the form of debt financing for uranium inventory, but, according to Morgan, they would have to be compensated (in the form of higher returns) for the substantial risk inherent in any prepayment structure. Because of the extended period when uranium cannot be sold, these risks, as well as the \u201cnormal\u201d discounting for the time value of money, could result in an estimated up-front cash payment that is significantly less than the current market price in any forward sales scenario.", "In testimony on the bill, the Uranium Producers of America (UPA), a trade association of domestic uranium mining and milling companies, as well as NEI, which represents more than 350 companies and organizations worldwide involved in the nuclear industry, gave support to the framework suggested in S. 755.

According to USEC officials, the sales approach envisions four basic tiers. Under the first tier, USEC would attempt to sell the uranium in foreign countries. Under the second tier, the corporation could accept futures contracts for delivery of the uranium after 2002. USEC officials state that since these options are not currently prohibited under the current suspension agreement, no further administrative action would be needed. Under the third tier, U.S. miners could purchase the natural uranium at cost from the corporation. This option would necessitate administrative action to modify the suspension agreement. The fourth tier would also require a change to the suspension agreement. Under this tier, the corporation would be allowed to sell any remaining uranium that is not sold in the first three tiers but not below spot market prices. The option under the fourth tier could be executed only after efforts had been made for 9 months to execute sales under the first three tiers.", "Aside from the administrative actions needed to implement the tiered sales approach, legislation would be required, corporation officials say, to ensure the continued operation of the Russian HEU contract. For example, USEC noted that if the suspension agreement fails (for reasons that may have nothing to do with the HEU agreement), the President must be able to waive the antidumping duties that would apply to Russian natural uranium and SWU.", "The corporation indicated that the tiered sales approach represents a compromise that would help the Russians by providing a market mechanism for the sale of the natural uranium component and, therefore, the payment upon delivery for the natural uranium component contained in the LEU. At the same time, according to USEC, it is responsive to domestic uranium mining companies\u2019 concerns that prices not be suppressed, and it is responsive to the maximum extent possible, in light of the national security interests served by implementing the Russian HEU contract, to concerns expressed by Canada.", "USEC officials informed us that the Department of Commerce is currently considering the administrative action necessary to implement the tiered sales approach. According to USEC officials, ITA can modify the suspension agreement if doing so is in the public interest. The corporation has also drafted legislation for the administration to consider. The drafted legislation is currently being reviewed by the appropriate federal agencies.", "In a recent talking points paper, NEI took issue with the administration\u2019s four-tiered approach from both a national security and a commercial perspective. NEI stated that the commercial interests of USEC are not identical to the national security objectives of the United States. Moreover, NEI suggested that the four-tiered approach vests undue market power in the corporation.", "According to NEI, nonproliferation and national security are government responsibilities and therefore a U.S. government entity, not a privatized USEC, should be the executive agent under the government-to-government agreement with Russia. NEI has proposed that a U.S. government executive agent negotiate the purchase of the Russian LEU at a price tied by a market indicator to a market price. Under this approach, the U.S. executive agent would pay the Russians for both components of the LEU (the natural uranium and the SWU) upon delivery to the United States. Payment for the LEU would be made from the \u201cexit dividend\u201d left to the United States after USEC was privatized. This \u201cexit dividend\u201d would be placed in a revolving fund set up to cover the HEU agreement.

In developing the plan, USEC hired Morgan as its financial adviser to determine the value of the corporation if it were privatized.", "According to an April 1995 presentation to USEC\u2019s board of directors, Morgan employed three valuation methodologies to estimate the value of USEC as a private corporation and forecast the proceeds resulting from a public sale: dividend yield, comparable price/earnings multiples, and the net present value of projected cash flows. Morgan officials said that public equity market investors would probably analyze dividend yield or comparable price/earnings multiples to estimate USEC\u2019s value while interested merger and acquisition buyers would probably analyze the net present value of cash flows.", "After considering the results of these analyses, Morgan used its judgment of investors\u2019 perceptions and management\u2019s credibility to project that the sale price of USEC\u2019s common stock in an initial public offering would range from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion (less transaction fees of about $100 million). Figure II.1 shows the ranges estimated for the various analyses Morgan performed in April 1995 to forecast the sale proceeds and demonstrates that no single analysis led to Morgan\u2019s estimate of the proceeds. We also note that Morgan\u2019s estimate of the gross proceeds does not appear to give much weight to the net present value computations for the scenario that assumes the building of a plant using the atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS) process.", "Morgan officials said that, under their valuation methodologies, they used the years 1996 through 1999 to estimate the market value of a privatized USEC using the comparable price/earnings multiples. However, during these years, the costs of developing the AVLIS technology reduce net income, lowering the corporation\u2019s market value below the value that would be expected without these costs. In projections for later years, Morgan shows improvements in net income resulting from AVLIS benefits. However, these improvements do not increase the expected market value because they occur after 1999. Nevertheless, according to Morgan and USEC officials, AVLIS is an important part of the USEC investment \u201cstory\u201d that will be told to public equity investors. As a new technology, AVLIS offers an important potential source of earnings growth, but, in Morgan\u2019s judgment, its promise should not be emphasized too strongly with investors because its benefits are, as yet, unproven.

DOE\u2019s share of the power plant cleanup costs plus this $6 million would bring the government\u2019s total obligation to about $21 million.", "Unamortized debt: According to DOE, USEC may contend that responsibility for projects undertaken at the power plant on USEC\u2019s behalf while USEC was a government corporation should remain with the government. For example, as part of its payment for power, USEC is amortizing the debt associated with an $80 million improvement needed to comply with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. USEC officials state that they will pay down this debt after privatization.", "Termination costs: If, before it is privatized, USEC cancels one or both agreements with the companies that supply power to the enrichment facilities, the government may have to pay the termination costs. According to DOE and USEC officials, termination costs (including unpaid debt) could amount to nearly $500 million. USEC says that it has no intention of canceling either of these agreements before privatization or in the near future. If USEC cancels the power agreements after privatization, then it is responsible for any termination costs.", "DOE retains the liability associated with the AVLIS facilities at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, including decontamination and decommissioning costs and certain termination costs.

In fiscal year 1994, the Secretary of Energy established a task force to review the Department\u2019s treatment of the discretionary payment authority. According to DOE officials, the Department was concerned about the apparent inequity in the treatment of DOE sites across the country.
