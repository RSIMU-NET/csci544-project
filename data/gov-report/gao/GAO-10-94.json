Government Accountability Office (GAO) was congressionally directed to examine (1) how BOP estimates costs when developing its annual budget request to DOJ; (2) the extent to which BOP's methods for estimating costs follow established best practices; and (3) the extent to which BOP's costs for key operations exceeded requested funding levels identified in the President's budget in recent years, and how this has affected BOP's ability to manage its growing inmate population.

BOP's methods for cost estimation largely reflect best practices outlined in GAO's Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. BOP followed a well-defined process for developing a mostly comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible cost estimate for fiscal year 2008. For example, BOP used relevant historical cost data and considered adjustments for general inflation when estimating costs for its budget request to DOJ. Moreover, BOP's methods for projecting inmate population changes were accurate, on average, to within 1 percent of the actual inmate population growth from fiscal year 1999 to August 2009. Still, BOP could strengthen its methods in two ways. First, BOP has not quantified the level of confidence associated with its cost estimate. While not required by the Office of Management and Budget or DOJ, conducting an uncertainty analysis of this kind is a best practice. By providing the results of such analysis to DOJ, BOP officials could share advance information on the probability and associated risks of operating expenses exceeding enacted funding levels. Second, during our review of documentation for BOP's fiscal year 2008 cost estimate, in some cases we required the guidance of BOP budget analysts to identify backup support because the documentation was insufficient to allow someone unfamiliar with the budget to locate detailed corroborating data. By documenting all steps, BOP would be better positioned to recreate its budget cost estimates in the event of attrition among those who initially developed them. According to BOP, from fiscal years 2004 through 2008, costs for non-salary inmate medical care and utilities exceeded funding levels in the President's budget request by about $131 million and $55 million, respectively. As a result, BOP has faced funding gaps in its operations account that has left it with limited flexibility to manage its continually growing inmate population."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 (BOP)  mission is to protect society by confining offenders in the controlled  environments of prisons and community-based facilities that are safe,  humane, cost-efficient, and appropriately secure. As of October 1, 2009,  BOP was responsible for overseeing a total federal inmate population of  approximately 209,000\u2014a population which has grown by 44 percent since  fiscal year 2000. In recent years, BOP has faced challenges in meeting its  operational workload responsibilities to manage this growth. In fiscal year  2008, DOJ reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that  BOP would be unable to operate at the funding levels in its appropriation  because costs for key operations were at risk of exceeding appropriated  funding levels. BOP reported that it again anticipated a funding gap in  fiscal year 2009, and in response, Congress provided appropriations above  the amount requested in the President\u2019s budget.", "This report responds to congressional direction in the explanatory  statement accompanying the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. In  accordance with this explanatory statement, and in consultation with the  House and Senate Appropriations Committee staff, we are reporting on  BOP\u2019s methods for cost estimation, including the pricing of utilities and  inmate medical care costs. Specifically, we address issues pertaining to (1)  how BOP estimates costs when developing its annual budget request to  DOJ; (2) the extent to which BOP\u2019s methods for estimating costs follow  established best practices or guidelines; and (3) the extent to which BOP\u2019s  costs for key operations exceeded requested funding levels identified in  the President\u2019s budget in recent years, and how this has affected BOP\u2019s  ability to manage its growing inmate population. On September 10, 2009,  we provided a briefing to staff of the House and Senate Appropriations  Subcommittees on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies.  Prior to this briefing, we provided a draft of the briefing to responsible  DOJ and BOP officials, who generally agreed with our findings. This report  (1) provides a summary of our briefing and (2) transmits  recommendations that we are making to the Attorney General of the  United States. The full briefing, including our scope and methodology, is  reprinted as appendix I. Written comments from DOJ are reprinted as  appendix II.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed BOP documentation to obtain  information on the guidelines and processes BOP used to estimate costs in  its annual budget submission, including annual DOJ and BOP budget  development guidelines and memorandum and OMB\u2019s Circular A-11. We  also analyzed available documentation, such as the formulas BOP used to  compute its fiscal year 2008 budget cost estimate, and compared the  documentation BOP used to develop its fiscal year 2008 budget cost  estimate to criteria for cost estimating best practices identified in GAO\u2019s  Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Developing  and Managing Capital Program Costs. Additionally, we reviewed BOP  documentation of operations costs for inmate medical care and utilities  and compared these costs to the amount of funding requested in the  President\u2019s annual budget submission to Congress for BOP (known as the  President\u2019s budget). Finally, we interviewed cognizant BOP and DOJ  budget development officials to obtain information about BOP\u2019s budget  cost estimating methods and the factors contributing to BOP\u2019s operational  costs exceeding funding levels, and how this has affected BOP\u2019s ability to  manage its growing inmate population. Through document reviews and  interviews with agency officials knowledgeable about controls in place to  maintain the integrity of BOP cost and inmate population data that BOP  reported using to estimate costs for its annual budget submission to DOJ,  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2009 to November 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the work to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BOP Estimates Costs for Its Annual Budget Using Three General Steps", "paragraphs": ["When developing its annual budget submission, BOP uses three general  steps to estimate costs for its two budget accounts\u2014the Salaries and  Expenses account (known as its operational budget) and its Buildings and  Facilities account. First, BOP estimates cost increases for maintaining the  current level of services for operations as provided in the prior year\u2019s  enacted budget. These include costs to address mandatory staff pay raises  and benefit increases, inmate medical care, and utilities. BOP primarily  analyzes historical obligations from the past five years to identify average  annual operating cost increases. BOP also considers economic indicator  information to estimate general inflationary cost increases, using data  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, among other  sources.", "Second, BOP projects inmate population changes for the budget year and  for several years into the future. BOP uses a modeling program that  identifies each inmate as a unique record tied to variables such as  conviction year, sentence term, and conviction type, with data obtained  from a variety of sources, including the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and the Executive Office for U.S.  Attorneys. The model identifies the number of inmates currently in BOP\u2019s  system and the length of those inmates\u2019 sentences, as well as the number  of inmates estimated to enter the BOP system and the length of their  sentences. For example, for the fiscal year 2010 annual budget submission,  BOP projected a net growth in its inmate population of 4,500 inmates.", "Third, BOP estimates costs to both house the projected number of new  inmates, including building and facility requirements, and fund any new  initiatives. According to BOP, a rising inmate population is the primary  driver of new service costs (see figure 1 for graph showing federal inmate  population growth from fiscal years 2000 through 2009). Thus, for any  budget year, BOP uses inmate population projections to determine the  necessary bedspace to house additional inmates. BOP estimates these  associated incarceration costs by (1) determining how to distribute the  incoming prisoners across newly activated facilities, existing facilities, or  contract facilities; and (2) calculating staffing and other operational costs  to manage the additional inmates at its facilities. BOP also identifies and  estimates costs for new initiatives, such as the activation of a new BOP  facility, by reviewing the proposals submitted by its divisions and regional  offices, as well as historical data on costs for implementing such  initiatives.", "For its Buildings and Facilities account, BOP identifies new program costs  associated with new construction and maintenance and repair of existing  facilities. Using its long-term inmate population projections, BOP  considers new construction proposals based on need, funding, and the  anticipated speed of construction. BOP estimates construction costs  largely by using analogous building costs for similar security level  facilities, as well as considering assumptions, such as the rate of inflation  and when potential construction would begin. BOP ranks maintenance  and repair proposals by assigning safety the highest priority and estimates  costs based on information it obtains from a construction cost estimation  company."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BOP\u2019s Methods for Estimating Costs Largely Reflect Best Practices", "paragraphs": ["BOP\u2019s methods for estimating costs in its annual budget requests to DOJ  largely reflect the best practices outlined in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide.

For example, we found BOP\u2019s projections were accurate,  on average, to within 1 percent of the actual inmate population growth  from fiscal year 1999 through August 20, 2009.", "We identified two areas where BOP could strengthen its methods for  estimating costs in its annual budget submission. First, according to best  practices described in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, it  is better for decision makers to know the range of potential costs that  surround an estimate and the reasons behind what drives that range rather  than just having a point estimate from which to make their decision. An  uncertainty analysis provides a range of costs that span a best and worst  case spread. While not required by OMB or DOJ in annual budget  development guidance, conducting an uncertainty analysis of this kind is a  best practice. BOP has not conducted an uncertainty analysis, and  therefore has not quantified the level of confidence associated with its  cost estimate. By providing the results of such analysis to DOJ, BOP  officials could share advance information on the probability and  associated risks of operating expenses exceeding enacted funding levels\u2014 a situation BOP faced in fiscal year 2008.", "Second, during our review of documentation for BOP\u2019s fiscal year 2008  cost estimate, we sometimes required the guidance of BOP budget  analysts to identify backup support. This was because the documentation  BOP provided was insufficient to allow someone unfamiliar with the  budget to locate detailed corroborating data. For example, in reviewing  BOP\u2019s fiscal year 2008 cost estimate for a health service initiative related  to expanding kidney dialysis treatment for inmates, we required a budget  official\u2019s assistance in locating supporting formulas used to calculate the  estimate. Best practices for cost estimation include providing enough  detail so that the documentation serves as an audit trail that allows for  clear tracking of cost estimates over time. By documenting all steps for  developing its budget cost estimate, BOP would be better positioned to  recreate its estimates in the event of attrition within its budget office  among those who developed initial budget cost estimates.", "In providing feedback on our initial findings, BOP budget officials  indicated that taking these steps would strengthen their methods for  estimating costs in their annual budget submission to DOJ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs for Key Operations Have Exceeded the Funding Levels Requested in the President\u2019s Budget in Recent Years", "paragraphs": ["BOP\u2019s costs for key operations to maintain basic services, such as those  for inmate medical care and utilities, exceeded the funding levels  requested in the President\u2019s budget from fiscal years 2004 through 2008,  limiting BOP\u2019s ability to manage its growing inmate population. During this  period, BOP\u2019s annual non-salary inmate medical care and utilities costs  exceeded funding levels in the President\u2019s budget request by a total of  about $131 million and $55 million, respectively, largely due to inflation  and inmate population growth.", "According to BOP, from fiscal years 2004 through 2008, BOP\u2019s annual  non-salary inmate medical care costs increased by a total of about  $146.5 million. In contrast, during this period, the President\u2019s budget  requested funding increases for non-salary inmate medical care  totaling approximately $15.4 million.", "According to BOP, from fiscal years 2004 through 2008, BOP\u2019s annual  utilities costs increased by a total of $87 million.

For example, one of  BOP\u2019s highest priorities is to increase staffing levels of corrections  officers. However, BOP officials reported using Salaries and Expenses  account funds initially planned for hiring additional corrections officers in  fiscal years 2008 and 2009 to instead cover base operations cost increases  related to inmate medical care, utilities, and personnel salary and benefit  adjustments that were unfunded in the President\u2019s budget requests.", "As with any other DOJ component, BOP\u2019s budget requests are governed by  DOJ and OMB budget development guidance. For example, DOJ budget  development guidance for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 required components  to limit cost growth for current services to no more than 4 percent greater  than prior year levels. DOJ reported that this guidance was a general  instruction given to all components, but recognized that BOP is different  because its costs are less discretionary since BOP does not control the  number of inmates for which it must care. In this way, DOJ reported that it  did not automatically reject budget submissions from BOP that exceeded  the cap, but instead required BOP to submit substantive information to  justify need.", "DOJ also reported that OMB does not automatically provide funds for  inflationary cost increases. DOJ cited OMB policy stating that inflationary  adjustments for discretionary costs (such as utilities) can include some,  all, or no allowance for inflation. DOJ officials reported that OMB typically  does not include general inflationary adjustments that DOJ submits on  behalf of BOP.", "Nonetheless, DOJ has reported to OMB that other DOJ components could  reduce operations, implement across-the-board hiring freezes, and  implement policy changes that would reduce costs if faced with funding  shortfalls similar to what BOP has faced in its operations budget.  However, DOJ reported that BOP has already implemented significant  reductions to programs and streamlined and centralized administrative  functions to eliminate 2,300 positions. DOJ also reported that BOP has  limited flexibility because almost all of BOP\u2019s operational costs are  devoted to staff salaries and provision of services. According to BOP data,  in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, 99.5 percent of BOP\u2019s Salaries and Expenses  budget was fixed for its operations for paying staff salaries and providing  services to house and care for the inmate population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In each of the last 2 fiscal years, BOP has needed additional funding to  meet its operating costs for managing its growing inmate population.  However, we found that BOP\u2019s cost estimation methods largely reflect  GAO\u2019s cost estimating best practices. Furthermore, BOP officials reported,  and DOJ officials acknowledged, that BOP has already implemented  significant reductions in operations costs, such as by eliminating positions  and centralizing administrative functions. Given BOP\u2019s unique  responsibility for managing this population, and its limited discretion  when costs for key operations exceed funding levels, it is especially  important for BOP to develop accurate cost estimates and clearly convey  to decision makers the potential risk of costs exceeding funding levels.", "In light of these circumstances, BOP\u2019s budget cost estimation practices  could be strengthened in two ways. First, although BOP is not required to  report in its annual budget submission the extent to which actual costs  may be expected to vary from cost estimates, we have identified the  provision of an uncertainty analysis as a best practice. If BOP identified its  level of cost estimation confidence and provided this information to DOJ,  DOJ could more fully understand the range of potential costs\u2014and the  potential need for more funding\u2014if estimating assumptions for key cost  drivers, such as inmate population growth, do not hold true.", "Second, by improving documentation of all steps for developing its cost  estimate, BOP would be better positioned to re-create its estimates in the  event of attrition within its budget office among those who developed  initial cost estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve transparency in BOP\u2019s cost estimation process, as well as  DOJ\u2019s annual budget formulation and justification process, and to provide  DOJ with more detailed information to consider when deliberating its  budget proposal for BOP, we recommend that the Attorney General take  the following two actions:  instruct the BOP Director to require the BOP budget staff to conduct  an uncertainty analysis quantifying the extent to which operations  costs could vary due to changes in key cost assumptions and submit  the results along with budget documentation to DOJ so that DOJ could  be aware of the range of likely costs and BOP\u2019s associated confidence  levels; and  instruct the BOP Director to require the BOP budget staff to improve  documentation of calculations used to estimate its costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOJ for its review and comment.
