However, the federal government's own climate data\u2014composed of observational records from satellites and weather stations and projections from climate models\u2014are fragmented across individual agencies that use the information in different ways to meet their missions. GAO's February 2015 High-Risk update found that federal, state, local, and private sector decision makers may be unaware that climate information exists or be unable to use what is available.", "Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom have well-established climate information systems, although each country's system is organized somewhat differently. In each, the government provides direction and funding, and entities within and outside the government provide technical assistance to help decision makers understand how to use climate information in planning.", "Federal climate information efforts could be improved by incorporating key organizational and data elements, according to GAO reports, studies by the National Academies and other organizations, site visits to three countries with climate information systems, and interviews with stakeholders. Specifically, the key elements are (1) a focused and accountable organization, (2) authoritative data that define the best available information for decision makers, and (3) technical assistance to help decision makers access, translate, and use climate information in planning. Authoritative locally-focused information is crucial because it defines a common starting point for decision makers, and most decisions are made at the local level.", "Options to provide climate information and technical assistance to decision makers have strengths and limitations, according to studies, international site visits, and interviews with stakeholders. For example, a new federal agency would have a focused mission but could face turf conflicts with existing programs at other agencies. On the other hand, a national climate information system could be developed that would incorporate the best features and address the limitations of these options. Similar to the programs in Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, a national system to provide climate information to U.S. decision makers could have roles for federal and nonfederal entities. Based on GAO's review of systems in other countries, studies, and interviews with stakeholders, a key federal role in a national climate information system would be to provide authoritative data and quality assurance guidelines for how to use the data. A nonfederal entity would be better positioned to provide on-the-ground technical assistance and facilitate connections between decision makers and intermediaries with expertise."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Executive Office of the President (EOP) direct a federal entity to develop a set of authoritative climate change projections and observations and create a national climate information system with defined roles for federal agencies and nonfederal entities.

For  example, the federal government annually provides billions of dollars  through various mechanisms for infrastructure projects that state and  local governments prioritize, supervise, and own.

We also searched various  databases for studies from 2000 to 2014, focusing on peer reviewed  journals, trade and industry journals, government reports, and  publications from research organizations, advocacy groups, and think  tanks. In all, we identified and reviewed over 60 relevant reports and  studies.", "Second, we interviewed a nonprobability sample of over 40 U.S.  stakeholders, including current and former federal officials, local decision  makers, researchers, and consultants. We selected this nonprobability  sample of stakeholders based on whether they (1) participated in drafting  or reviewing National Research Council and other federal reports related  to climate information, and thus having relevant knowledge and expertise;  (2) were identified by other knowledgeable stakeholders we interviewed;  or (3) held positions at Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the  Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), USGCRP, or NOAA  because these are key federal agencies that provide climate information  to decision makers.

In the interest of efficiency, we  did not review every global example of a country with a well-established  system. During our international site visits, we gathered information  through interviews with government officials and international  stakeholders knowledgeable about the systems, observed some projects  that used climate information in planning, and reviewed related  documents.

Such assistance includes, for example, raising  river or coastal dikes to protect infrastructure from sea level rise, building  higher bridges, and increasing the capacity of storm water systems. One  way to reduce the potential impacts of climate change is to build the best  available climate information into existing federal, state, local, and private  sector planning processes. As discussed in our February 2015 High-Risk  update, a key role for the federal government is to provide technical  assistance to decision makers to help them translate available climate- related data into the information they need for such planning processes.  The President\u2019s June 2013 Climate Action Plan and November 2013  Executive Order 13653 drew attention to the need for improved technical  assistance.

Broadly  defined, risk management is a strategic process for helping decision  makers assess risk, allocate finite resources, and take action under  conditions of uncertainty. The International Organization for  Standardization standards on risk management recommend that  organizations such as federal agencies develop, implement, and  continuously improve a framework for integrating risk management into  their overall planning, management, reporting processes, and policies.  For risk management to be effective, these standards state that an  organization should comply at all levels with the following principles:", "Risk management is not a stand-alone activity that is separate  from the main activities and processes of the organization. Risk  management is part of the responsibilities of management and is an  integral part of all organizational processes, including strategic  planning and all project and change management processes.", "Risk management is part of decision making. Risk management  helps decision makers make informed choices, prioritize actions, and  distinguish among alternatives.", "Risk management explicitly addresses uncertainty. Risk  management explicitly takes account of uncertainty, the nature of that  uncertainty, and how it can be addressed.", "Risk management is based on the best available information. The  inputs to the process of managing risk are based on information  sources such as historical data, experience, stakeholder feedback,  observation, forecasts, and expert judgment. However, decision  makers should inform themselves of, and should take into account,  any limitations of the data or modeling used or the possibility of  divergence among experts.", "As summarized by a 2011 World Meteorological Organization report on  climate information, reducing the risks and realizing the opportunities of  climate change require making good decisions based on reliable and  appropriate information about past, present, and future climate, as well as  properly integrating that information into the decision-making process.  The report also states that appropriate use of climate information can help  individuals make more informed short- and medium-term decisions  relating to their livelihoods and can help organizations and businesses  reduce uncertainty in the long term.

To be useful, climate information must be tailored to meet the needs of  each decision maker, such as an engineer responsible for building a  bridge in a specific location, a county planner responsible for managing  development over a larger region, or a federal official managing a  national-scale program. Further complicating matters, decision makers  need climate information at different timescales corresponding to the  short, medium, or long-term nature of their planning processes. The 2011  World Meteorological Organization report stated that decision makers  need access to expert advice and support to help them select and  properly apply climate information.", "According to a 2010 National Research Council report on making  informed decisions about climate change and our October 2009 report  on climate change adaptation, most decision makers need a basic set of  information to understand and make choices about how to adapt to  climate change. This set of information includes the following:  Information and analysis about observed climate conditions. This  includes information on, for example, temperature, precipitation,  drought, storms, and sea level rise and how they may be changing in  the local area. This type of information can be most easily conveyed  by graphs and maps with some statistics on trends, variability, and  data reliability.", "Information about observed climate impacts and vulnerabilities.

However, as we found in our February 2015 High-Risk  update, federal, state, local, and private sector decision makers may be  unaware that climate information exists or unable to use what is available,  making it harder to justify the current costs of incorporating climate  change into planning efforts for less certain future benefits. For  example, in September 2014, we found that USDA has made few efforts  to quantify the costs and returns of actions that could help farmers make  both short- and long-term decisions in the face of a changing climate.  Without information that is readily accessible to farmers, they may be  reluctant to take action to become more resilient to climate change. We  recommended that USDA develop and provide readily accessible  information to farmers on the farm-level economic costs and returns of  taking certain actions in response to climate change.

For example,  in July 2015, USDA announced the Climate Hubs Tool Shed\u2014an online,  searchable database of tools designed to assist these farmers and others  in adapting their lands to the impacts of climate change and other risks.  Further, the participants in our July 21, 2015, Comptroller General\u2019s  Forum on Preparing for Climate-Related Risks: Lessons from the Private  Sector stated that the absence of consistent, authoritative climate  information made it hard for private sector entities to consider climate  information in planning.

For example, according to one  stakeholder we interviewed from academia, the federal government does  an excellent job collecting climate observations and archiving quality  climate data, but it does not communicate or translate this information in  ways useful for decision makers. As a result, according to this  stakeholder, decision makers do not understand how climate information  is relevant to them and do not know how to incorporate it into their  planning efforts.

Federal  efforts only recently transitioned to creating government-wide  infrastructure for providing climate information to decision makers,  according to these officials. They said that, in the current federal  structure, the provision of climate information is an inherently interagency  activity that relies on the cooperation and shared resources of many  agencies, but interagency coordination is weak by design with an  inconsistent mandate to use specific climate information in federal  decision making.

However, officials we interviewed in the  United Kingdom and Germany told us that they recognize the need to  produce such guidelines. For example, United Kingdom officials said they  recognized the need to develop a quality assurance process because the  government could be blamed if a contractor misuses government data.  Guidelines would help protect the integrity of government data by clearly  stating acceptable procedures and methods for using government climate  data. Another United Kingdom official noted that if you are to have a one- stop-shop for climate services, quality assurance and quality control will  have to be a key part of the system. German officials similarly noted the  need to move toward standardized quality assurance and quality control  processes to ensure the quality and consistency of climate information for  decision makers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonfederal Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["A nonfederal entity would be better positioned to provide technical  assistance in a national climate information system, according to various  studies we reviewed and interviews we conducted with knowledgeable  stakeholders. Nonfederal technical assistance would emphasize the  strengths of many of the options by being nimble and flexible, employing  existing relationships, and engaging a broad range of stakeholders.  Nonfederal technical assistance would also minimize the limitations of no  single agency having all necessary expertise, few links to on-the-ground  decision makers, and turf battles between existing agencies.", "The federal government cannot take on the climate services role,  according to officials within the Executive Office of the President, because  it does not have the resources to do the task, and there is no way that the  federal government can work with every decision maker. The federal  government also does not have the presence at the local level, or trust of  communities, to play this direct role, according to these officials. Similarly,  a stakeholder with experience coordinating federal climate information  issues stated that the federal government has to be a part of whatever  system is put in place\u2014particularly from a leadership perspective\u2014but  there is a false assumption that the federal government should do it all  and be all things to all people. It cannot, according to this stakeholder,  because it is too hard to match the rigor required of the federal  government with the flexibility needed to make the information relevant to  decision makers.", "A nonfederal entity would be better positioned to interact with existing  networks of decision makers and to facilitate connections between  decision makers and intermediaries with specialized expertise, according  to various stakeholders. For example, according to some federal officials  who manage climate information programs, a nonfederal organization to  teach, promote, and transfer climate information would likely be more  effective than government agencies. Officials within the Executive Office  of the President made a similar point, noting that there needs to be an  intermediary or intermediaries\u2014for example, nonprofits, the private  sector, or academic institutions\u2014to perform the technical assistance role  for the federal government. A nonfederal entity could facilitate  connections between decision makers and intermediaries while  employing existing networks of climate information expertise.", "Opinions varied on how a nonfederal entity or entities could provide the  technical assistance component of a U.S. national climate information  system, but certain stakeholders we interviewed called for a central hub  where decision makers could access technical assistance. Two of the  other countries with climate information systems have central hubs. For  example, the United Kingdom\u2019s Climate Ready Support Service leads  efforts to assist decision makers in using climate information. This service  provides tools, information, and practical advice to help businesses and  other organizations adapt to the effects of climate change and operates a  help desk to answer questions from the public or decision makers about  how to use climate information. A similar entity exists in the Netherlands  with more of a role for academia. Germany\u2019s system has multiple points  of contact for decision makers, reflecting its federated structure. While  climate information systems in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands  have central hubs, these systems also interact with decision makers at  multiple points by reflecting the value of existing networks and  established decision-making processes.", "Even if a nonfederal entity acts as the central hub for a national system,  this does not preclude the federal government from providing technical  assistance to decision makers. Programs like NOAA\u2019s National Integrated  Drought Information System already serve existing networks of decision  makers and will provide key information resources however a national  system is organized. Even if a nonfederal entity was designated as the  central hub in a national system, federal efforts would remain part of the  larger network providing technical assistance to decision makers. In  addition, according to several stakeholders, federal adaptation science  programs could continue to provide support to federal and nonfederal  technical assistance efforts, focusing on problems that affect all climate  information users and providers such as how to evaluate the  effectiveness of adaptation actions."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has begun to address its large and growing fiscal  exposure to changes in the climate. These exposures are partly driven by  state, local, and private sector decision makers responsible for planning,  constructing, and maintaining certain types of vulnerable infrastructure  paid for with federal funds, insured by federal programs, or eligible for  federal disaster assistance. However, because federal climate information  efforts are fragmented, these decision makers generally do not  understand how to access and use the best available authoritative  information they need to account for climate risk in planning processes,  according to principles of risk management. Germany, the Netherlands,  and the United Kingdom provide examples of how national climate  information systems can be structured with defined roles for federal and  nonfederal entities. Options to provide climate information to U.S.  decision makers have strengths and limitations, according to various  studies we reviewed and interviews we conducted with knowledgeable  stakeholders. A national climate information system with defined roles for  federal agencies and nonfederal entities could incorporate the best  features and address the limitations of different options to provide climate  information to decision makers. Specifically, a national climate information  system with federal leadership, authoritative federal data and quality  assurance guidelines, and a nonfederal provider of technical assistance  may make it easier for federal, state, local, and private sector decision  makers to justify the costs of incorporating climate change information  into planning efforts, thereby reducing long-term federal fiscal exposure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help federal, state, local, and private sector decision makers access  and use the best available climate information, we recommend that the  Executive Office of the President designate a federal entity to take the  following two actions: develop and periodically update a set of authoritative climate change  observations and projections for use in federal decision making, which  state, local, and private sector decision makers could also access to  obtain the best available climate information; and  create a national climate information system with defined roles for  federal agencies and nonfederal entities with existing statutory  authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the Director  of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Managing  Director (Acting Chair) of the Council on Environmental Quality.
