In 1994, to emphasize the importance of establishing such an office, legislation was enacted that required certain funds to be withheld from the United Nations until the President certified that it had an independent office to conduct and supervise objective audits, investigations, and inspections relating to the programs and operations of the United Nations. Over concerns that OIOS may have been unable to carry out its mandate due to resource and other constraints, the Congress required a similar certification for fiscal year 1997.", "This report responds to your request concerning the operations of OIOS. Specifically, our objectives were to determine whether OIOS (1) is operationally independent; (2) has the necessary resources to carry out its mission; and (3) has written policies and procedures in place for conducting its work, following up on its recommendations, and providing confidentiality to informants and protecting whistleblowers from possible reprisal.

In August 1993, the Secretary General formed the Office for Inspections and Investigations under an Assistant Secretary General. This office was not part of the Department of Administration and Management and carried more authority than the individual units because it reported to the Secretary General. In July 1994, the General Assembly created an oversight body with even more independence and authority\u2014OIOS\u2014to supersede the Office for Inspections and Investigations.", "OIOS is considered by the United Nations and its member states to be an internal oversight office and, therefore, part of the executive function of the United Nations. OIOS is mandated to exercise its oversight functions throughout the U.N. Secretariat, which covers the staff and resources of the Secretariat, including peacekeeping missions.

Investigation was a new oversight activity introduced in February 1994, and inspections were also a new function assigned to the Office for Inspections and Investigations. The functions of the other units had been performed within the Department of Administration and Management for years.

Operational independence is a concept rather than a discrete set of factors that can be tracked over time. Among other things, operational independence includes insulating the unit head from arbitrary removal from office; organizationally separating the unit from the programs it examines; and ensuring the unit has full and free access to relevant records, the authority to carry out work it sees fit, and the ability to report its findings without interference from the executive or the legislature. It is also important that the oversight unit\u2019s mandate and independent status be well understood among the community it oversees.OIOS has many of these characteristics, as noted below.", "The USG for Internal Oversight Services is appointed by the Secretary General, following consultations with member states, for a fixed 5-year term but must be approved by the General Assembly and may be removed by the Secretary General only for cause and with the General Assembly\u2019s approval.", "OIOS recently established an administrative unit within the USG\u2019s office.

Funds and programs are funded either completely or in part by voluntary contributions and have their own executive boards or governing bodies. According to OIOS officials, OIOS has provided oversight services primarily for those areas for which the funds and programs do not provide their own oversight coverage. For example, the U.N. Development Program has its own internal audit, but OIOS provides investigative services. For the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which does not have an internal audit unit, OIOS provides both audit and some investigative services.", "However, in recent sessions of the U.N. Committee on Administration and Budget\u2014commonly known as the Fifth Committee\u2014certain member states have made it clear that they do not accept the authority of the Secretary General to implement OIOS recommendations in the funds and programs without explicit direction from the executive boards of these entities. If OIOS is required to seek the concurrence of the various funds and programs executive boards before cognizant program officials can implement its recommendations, OIOS\u2019 operational independence would be compromised. According to State officials, the United States and several other delegations have made this point clear. They have emphasized that OIOS is an internal oversight mechanism and part of the U.N. Secretariat and, therefore, its recommendations are not subject to the review or approval of the General Assembly or the respective executive boards of the separately administered funds and programs.", "As noted in its comments on this report, the State Department has consistently taken the position that OIOS\u2019 jurisdiction extends to the separately administered funds and programs. State emphasized that the U.N. Legal Advisor confirmed this understanding of the relationship in July 1994. Additionally, at the request of the USG for Internal Oversight Services, the U.N. Legal Counsel specifically ruled in October 1997 that OIOS can make recommendations to program managers within the U.N. Secretariat, including the funds and programs, without the endorsement or approval of the General Assembly. While this decision did not explicitly refer to the funds and programs executive boards, the situation is analogous.", "At the time of this report, OIOS was continuing to provide internal oversight services to the funds and programs and reporting to the cognizant officials without seeking the approval of the respective executive boards.

However, we also noted that, as of September 1997, only 13 of 107 audit reports and 5 of 33 investigation reports were provided to the Secretary General and, subsequently, the General Assembly. This raises two questions: If only 18 of 140 audit and investigation reports met the mandate\u2019s criteria for being provided to the Secretary General, are OIOS\u2019 resources directed at those areas that would provide insight into the operations of the United Nations?", "On the other hand, if more OIOS reports actually provide the insight into U.N. operations intended in the mandate, why were they not provided to the Secretary General and the General Assembly?", "We were not permitted to review the reports that had not been provided to the Secretary General. Consequently, we could not address these questions. In contrast, we note that all U.S. inspector general reports are provided to the head of the respective inspector general\u2019s department or agency and many are also provided to the U.S. Congress.", "The USG for Internal Oversight Services acknowledged that few audit and investigation reports had been forwarded to the Secretary General and the General Assembly. He told us that if he is satisfied with the program officials\u2019 response to the report and is confident that appropriate actions are being taken, he does not send the report to the Secretary General. He also noted that sending all OIOS reports would place an additional paperwork burden on the General Assembly and that producing enough reports for each member state would be expensive. The USG for Internal Oversight Services said that beginning with the OIOS annual report due to be published in October 1997, he will list all OIOS reports and if a member state is interested in a particular one, OIOS will brief its representatives.He also said that previous annual reports have referred to the conclusions and findings in many of OIOS\u2019 reports and he has been willing to brief member states on the topics addressed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Informing U.N.

Department of Public Information distributed a U.N. publication describing OIOS\u2019 role and purpose.In April 1996, the USG for Administration and Management issued a note reminding Secretariat department heads that the General Assembly\u2019s resolution establishing OIOS makes it clear that OIOS shall have the authority necessary to carry out its functions. The note provided detailed information regarding the procedures to be followed to ensure that OIOS is given immediate access to all files and records required to perform its important functions. In early 1997, the Investigations Section published an investigations manual that is available to all U.N. staff.

In early December 1994, the USG for Internal Oversight Services described his vision for OIOS and the resource requirements necessary before the U.N.

He stated that he could not measurably enhance the internal control mechanisms in the United Nations without more resources. In particular, he pointed to the need to intensify the audit coverage and strengthen the new investigation function.", "The General Assembly reacted favorably, and OIOS, which had a total of 102 positions, was authorized 5 additional professional and 3 more general service positions against the revised budget estimates for 1995, bringing OIOS\u2019 total number of positions to 110, including extrabudgetary positions.", "Nevertheless, in early 1996, only 42 of 53 professional positions within OIOS\u2019 audit division were filled\u2014a vacancy rate of almost 21 percent. OIOS also noted that the accumulated and new cases in the Investigations Section constituted a workload that was too large for the unit to clear. Moreover, with the establishment of OIOS, the Central Monitoring and Inspection Unit\u2019s responsibilities expanded to address concerns of member states regarding the qualitative nature of program performance reporting and the need to enhance program management capability.", "At the beginning of the 1996-97 biennium and at the urging of some member states, particularly the United States, cuts in the overall U.N. budget were mandated by the General Assembly. While the OIOS 1996-97 budget included partial funding for an additional 12 positions, including  5 investigators, the USG for Administration and Management instructed OIOS to stay within its regular U.N. budget of $15 million, although OIOS had estimated it would need $15.725 million to fully fund its approved positions. (This did not directly affect extrabudgetary resources.) We were told by OIOS officials, and the USG for Internal Oversight Services noted in OIOS\u2019 1996 annual report, that OIOS should not be totally exempt from overall U.N. reductions. The USG for Internal Oversight Services said he took this position because it would be \u201cpolitically unwise\u201d to suggest that OIOS be treated differently than the rest of the organization.", "According to OIOS officials, because OIOS had to stay within its $15 million budget, it had to cut $725,000. To do this, OIOS did not fill its vacant positions for the first year of the biennium. This action saved about $603,000. The office also cut back expenditures for nonstaffing items for an additional savings of about $122,000.", "In January 1996, the General Assembly instituted a hiring freeze for the entire U.N. Secretariat. In March 1996, OIOS was granted a waiver as long as it followed through with its budget reductions. In February 1997, after the budgetary reductions had been achieved, OIOS began announcing its vacancies, and the recruitment and hiring process began.", "As part of U.N. efforts to maintain a flat, no-growth budget, the 1998-99 budget outline set OIOS\u2019 regular budget at $15.1 million\u2014about the same as the previous biennium. With that budget, OIOS could not have filled its vacancies. But after negotiations with the USG for Administration and Management, OIOS was granted an additional $3.5 million, including $1 million for exchange rate fluctuations and inflation, increasing OIOS\u2019 regular budget to $18.6 million.

Specifically, they questioned certain facts and were concerned that comments prepared by the inspected organizations were not considered in preparing the final products. These officials alleged that both reports contained factual errors that OIOS neither acknowledged nor corrected. We could not validate these assertions because we did not have access to the necessary working papers and related documents and files; however, OIOS officials told us the comments provided did not address the facts and were just a different point of view.", "OIOS has no requirement to acknowledge that comments were received or considered in finalizing its inspection reports. OIOS officials also noted that, because of U.N. page limitations on published materials, it would have been difficult to respond in detail to all the comments, much less reproduce them in the report. Nevertheless, in an attempt to address these concerns, the USG for Internal Oversight Services told us that for reports he sends to the Secretary General he now requires program officials\u2019 comments and OIOS\u2019 response to be sent to the Secretary General for his consideration. While this may help, systematically acknowledging in OIOS\u2019 reports that comments were received, summarizing the sense of them or reproducing them as part of the report, and describing how they were addressed by OIOS would, in our opinion, provide a further basis for the reader to judge the relevancy of the issues addressed and the recommendations made.", "In June 1997, OIOS compiled a document summarizing the quality assurance process used in OIOS for each of its reporting units.

These reports included allegations of serious crimes and noncriminal violations, suggestions for improvements, cases involving personnel matters or other grievances, and requests for investigations by officials. Only a few leads specifically categorized by OIOS as coming from a whistleblower have resulted in investigative reports. (OIOS would not permit us to divulge how many.)", "OIOS officials told us it has followed up in a number of instances where reprisal was suspected but has taken disciplinary action in only one instance to protect whistleblowers from reprisal. According to OIOS\u2019 second annual report, the section had initiated an investigation based on allegations by staff, who publicly identified themselves, that two senior staff were interfering with the decision-making process of the local committee on contracts. A senior staff member retaliated against the staff by accusing them of falsifying bid documents and recommending that charges be brought against them. The Investigations Section investigated the senior staff member\u2019s allegations and found them to be false.

However, it can do more to help ensure that the information it presents, the conclusions it reaches, and the recommendations it makes can be relied upon as accurate, fair, and balanced. To this end, we discussed with the USG for Internal Oversight Services several ways to enhance OIOS\u2019 future operations.", "First, we suggested that the USG for Internal Oversight Services clarify the criteria for providing OIOS reports to the Secretary General and the General Assembly. In response, he said he will begin publishing a listing of OIOS reports in his annual report and provide briefings to member states on request. While this will help publicize OIOS reports, it may not satisfy OIOS\u2019 mandate to make reports available to the Secretary General and the General Assembly that \u201cprovide insight into the effective utilization and management of resources and the protection of assets.\u201d", "Second, we suggested that the USG for Internal Oversight Services develop more formal written procedural guidance for the Central Monitoring and Inspection Unit and the Central Evaluation Unit. He agreed that an inspections manual and evaluation manual for U.N. department self-evaluations would be helpful and has taken initial steps to begin developing them. However, he disagreed that additional guidance is needed for the in-depth evaluations OIOS conducts at the direction of the Committee for Programme and Coordination.", "Third, we suggested that the USG for Internal Oversight Services develop formal procedures for addressing program officials\u2019 comments in each OIOS report. The USG for Internal Oversight Services said he is beginning to send program officials\u2019 comments and OIOS\u2019 analysis of them to the Secretary General for reports forwarded to the Secretary General and the General Assembly. While this is a step in the right direction, systematically addressing program officials\u2019 comments in all OIOS reports would help the reader judge the relevancy of the issues discussed and the recommendations made and lend credibility to the reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["Although OIOS has made considerable progress in resolving some initial operational problems, the USG for Internal Oversight Services can do more to help maintain OIOS\u2019 independence and establish the office as the authoritative internal oversight mechanism the General Assembly intended OIOS to be.

It noted that it has a vested interest in implementing steps to ensure that OIOS functions effectively through the provision of adequate resources and the maintenance of a highly skilled and competent professional staff. State reiterated its position that effective oversight of U.N. programs is of primary importance to the United States and looks forward to building on the significant progress that OIOS has made in this area.", "The USG for Internal Oversight Services said that, while OIOS has become an important and effective component of the U.N. management culture, its operations can be fine-tuned. However, he disagreed with our suggestions that OIOS revisit its criteria for sending reports to the Secretary General and the General Assembly and that OIOS should treat program officials\u2019 comments more formally in its reports.", "With respect to OIOS report distribution, the USG for Internal Oversight Services reiterated that OIOS only provides its reports to the Secretary General and the General Assembly when the program officials disagree with the recommendations. As already stated, this criteria does not seem to satisfy a strict reading of the mandate. We also believe such limited report distribution is counter to one of OIOS\u2019 intended purposes, which is to provide more visibility over management\u2019s use of U.N. resources. In its publication on OIOS, the U.N. Department of Public Information states that, OIOS supports the need \u201cfor a more transparent assignment of responsibility and accountability.\u201d It goes on to say that \u201cOIOS puts great emphasis on transparency of procedures and full consultation with management.\u201d Making more reports available to the member states would help enhance the desired transparency by publicizing reported problem areas, the steps taken to resolve them, and who is accountable. Such publicity, in turn, may also help prevent similar problems from recurring.", "The USG for Internal Oversight Services also said that providing more reports would only overload the General Assembly\u2019s agenda and be an expensive burden. We believe the General Assembly should be allowed to judge for itself whether receiving a larger number of audit and investigative reports would be too burdensome. We also believe that the costs of reproducing copies of reports can be kept to a minimum by publicly announcing their availability, but only providing copies to those member states that request them or by making reports obtainable through the U.N. intranet.", "With respect to the treatment of program officials\u2019 comments on OIOS reports, the USG for Internal Oversight Services said that these comments are transmitted to the Secretary General, but to reproduce dissenting views that the Secretary General does not endorse would be inappropriate. We disagree. We believe that treating program officials\u2019 comments more openly and formally provides OIOS the opportunity to demonstrate that it is fair and evenhanded and that its conclusions and recommendations are appropriate. To do less leads to speculation and, perhaps, unwarranted criticism that program officials\u2019 comments were not adequately considered and addressed in the final report.", "Both State and OIOS provided technical comments that have been incorporated in the report as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine whether OIOS is in position to be operationally independent, we reviewed its mandate and procedures and related U.N. documents and met with the USG for Internal Oversight Services and other OIOS officials to determine how OIOS has implemented these provisions.
