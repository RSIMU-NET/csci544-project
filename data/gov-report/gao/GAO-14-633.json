Under this model, rather than holding refunds until completing all compliance checks, IRS issues refunds after conducting selected reviews. While there are no simple solutions, one option is earlier matching of employer-reported wage information to taxpayers' returns before issuing refunds. IRS currently cannot do such matching because employers' wage data (from Form W-2s) are not available until months after IRS issues most refunds. Consequently, IRS begins matching employer-reported W-2 data to tax returns in July, following the tax season. If IRS had access to W-2 data earlier\u2014through accelerated W-2 deadlines and increased electronic filing of W-2s\u2014it could conduct pre-refund matching and identify discrepancies to prevent the issuance of billions in fraudulent refunds.", "Accelerated W-2 deadlines. In 2014, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) proposed that Congress accelerate W-2 deadlines to January 31. However, IRS has not fully assessed the impacts of this proposal. Without this assessment, Congress does not have the information needed to deliberate the merits of such a significant change to W-2 deadlines or the use of pre-refund W-2 matching. Such an assessment is consistent with IRS's strategic plan that calls for analytics-based decisions, and would help IRS ensure effective use of resources.", "Increased e-filing of W-2s. Treasury has requested authority to reduce the 250-return threshold for electronically filing (e-filing) information returns. The Social Security Administration (SSA) estimated that to meaningfully increase W-2 e-filing, the threshold would have to be lowered to include those filing 5 to 10 W-2s. In addition, SSA estimated an administrative cost savings of about $0.50 per e-filed W-2. Based on these cost savings and the ancillary benefits they provide in supporting IRS's efforts to conduct more pre-refund matching, a change in the e-filing threshold is warranted. Without this change, some employers' paper W-2s could not be available for IRS matching until much later in the year, due to the additional time needed to process paper forms."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Congress should consider providing Treasury with authority to lower the annual threshold for e-filing W-2s.

As shown in figure 1, taxpayers with wage  income typically receive a Form W-2 from their employer by late January.  Taxpayers copy the information from the W-2 to prepare their returns.  Taxpayers filing paper returns are required to attach a copy of the W-2 to  the return. Taxpayers filing electronically (e-file), as most do, are not  required to send W-2s to the IRS. Most taxpayers entitled to a refund,  along with many identity thieves attempting refund fraud, file early in the  filing season\u2014many in February. During return processing, IRS performs  some compliance checks and issues refunds, but at this time it cannot  verify the W-2 information for all returns (paper W-2s can be forged and  fictitious wage information can be entered on a tax return). By the end of  March, employers are also required to send a copy of the W-2 to SSA,  which performs verification checks before sending the information to  IRS. However, IRS only begins matching W-2 information from  employers to tax returns in July. This gap between when IRS issues  refunds and when IRS matches W-2s to tax returns creates the  opportunity for fraudsters to file returns using a stolen identity and to  receive a tax refund.", "Issuing refunds before fully verifying the information on tax returns is an  example of what IRS officials refer to as a \u201clook-back\u201d compliance model:  rather than holding refunds until all compliance checks can be completed,  IRS issues refunds after doing some selected, automated reviews of the  information the taxpayer submits to verify identity (e.g., name and SSN  matching); filtering out returns with indicators of fraud such as a  mismatched name and SSN; and correcting obvious errors, such as  calculation mistakes and claims for credits and deductions exceeding  statutory limits.

These  changes could include lowering the e-file threshold for employers,  delaying refunds, or delaying the start of the filing season. IRS has not yet  undertaken efforts to understand the full costs of implementing earlier,  pre-refund W-2 matching, and the costs associated with these other  changes.", "Lowering the E-File Threshold for Employers  Because of the additional time and resources associated with processing  paper W-2s submitted by employers, SSA officials told us that a change  in the e-file threshold would be needed to sufficiently increase the number  of e-filed W-2s. Reducing the e-file threshold would allow IRS to obtain  timely, accurate data from a significant number of employers and would  enhance the benefits IRS could obtain from the accelerated W-2 deadline  and pre-refund W-2 matching. Currently, employers who file 250 or more  W-2s annually must e-file those forms. Low-volume filers (filing fewer  than 250 information returns annually) can file on paper, and for tax year  2011 these employers sent about 27.6 million paper W-2s (13 percent of  all W-2s filed), according to IRS data. Because of the additional time SSA  needs to process paper W-2s before sending them to IRS, changes in the  e-file threshold would be necessary for earlier W-2 deadlines to have the  intended effect. Without a change in the e-file threshold, backlogs in  paper W-2s could result in IRS receiving W-2 data after the end of the  filing season. For example, SSA officials said they can have a large  backlog of paper W-2s and can process some paper W-2s as late as  August or September. Having more e-filed W-2s would speed processing  time for SSA (as compared to paper W-2 processing time) and would  enable IRS to receive a larger percentage of W-2 data earlier, according  to SSA officials.", "More than 4.5 million establishments have fewer than 10 employees, and SSA officials estimated that the e-file threshold would need to be  reduced to 5 to 10 information returns for the change to result in a  meaningful increase in the number of e-filed W-2s.

Based on fiscal year 2013 data, SSA  officials stated that an e-filed W-2 costs about $0.002 to process, while a  paper W-2 costs about $0.53 to transcribe and process. officials said it is more difficult to ensure data quality with paper W-2s, as  transcription errors can occur while processing paper W-2s.", "Treasury recently requested that Congress expand legal authority to allow  a reduction of the 250-return e-filing threshold for a broad set of  information returns, including W-2s. According to Treasury, benefits  such as enhancing taxpayer compliance, improving IRS service to  taxpayers, and modernizing tax administration make this change  worthwhile. For example, expanding e-filing will help IRS focus its audit  activities, as IRS will receive information in a useable form, according to  Treasury. The cost savings described above, as well as compliance and  other benefits, could be realized before Congress decides on whether to  accelerate W-2 deadlines (as proposed by Treasury). The change would  support IRS\u2019s strategic objectives to encourage compliance while  minimizing costs and taxpayer burden. In addition, increasing e-filing is  consistent with internal controls, which require that information be  recorded and communicated to management and others within the entity  who need it and in a form and within a timeframe that enables them to  carry out their internal control and other responsibilities. For an entity to  run and control its operations, it must have relevant, reliable, and timely  communications relating to internal as well as external events.", "We did not verify SSA\u2019s estimates.", "Implementing a lower e-filing threshold would have the ancillary benefit  (described above) of supporting pre-refund matching.", "Delaying Refunds and Delaying the Start of the Filing Season  In conjunction with other strategies such as earlier filing of W-2s, delaying  the filing season or delaying refunds would provide more time for IRS to  receive W-2s, conduct pre-refund matching, and identify IDT refund fraud,  according to IRS and third-party officials.
