Instead, IRS officials stated that they held discussions to determine the modernization efforts that were of highest priority to meet IRS's future state vision and technology roadmap, and considered staffing resources and lifecycle stage. However, they did not use formal criteria for making final determinations. GAO concluded that establishing a structured process for prioritizing modernization activities would better assist Congress and other decision makers in ensuring that the right priorities are funded. Accordingly, GAO recommended that IRS establish, document, and implement policies and procedures for prioritizing modernization activities. IRS agreed with the recommendation and has efforts underway to address it.", "In the same report, GAO noted that IRS could improve the accuracy of reported performance information for key development investments to provide Congress and other external parties with pertinent information about the delivery of these investments. This included investments such as Customer Account Data Engine 2, which IRS is developing to replace its 50-year old repository of individual tax account data, and the Return Review Program, IRS's system of record for fraud detection. GAO recommended that IRS take steps to improve reported investment performance information. IRS agreed with the recommendation, and has efforts underway to address it.", "In a May 2016 report on legacy IT systems across the federal government, GAO noted that IRS used assembly language code to program key legacy systems. Assembly language code is a computer language initially used in the 1950s that is typically tied to the hardware for which it was developed; it has become difficult to code and maintain. One investment that used this language is IRS's Individual Master File which serves as the authoritative data source for individual taxpayer accounts. GAO noted that, although IRS has been working to replace the Individual Master File, the bureau did not have time frames for its modernization or replacement. Therefore, GAO recommended that the Department of Treasury identify and plan to modernize and replace this legacy system, consistent with applicable guidance from the Office of Management and Budget.

However, we have reported that prior IT expenditures have often  resulted in significant cost overruns, schedule delays, and questionable  mission-related achievements. In light of these ongoing challenges, in  February 2015, we added improving the management of IT acquisitions  and operations to our list of high-risk areas for the federal government.  This area highlights several critical IT initiatives in need of additional  congressional oversight, including (1) reviews of troubled projects; (2)  efforts to increase the use of incremental development; (3) efforts to  provide transparency relative to the cost, schedule, and risk levels for  major IT investments; (4) reviews of agencies\u2019 operational investments;  (5) data center consolidation; and (6) efforts to streamline agencies\u2019  portfolios of IT investments. We noted that implementation of these  initiatives has been inconsistent and more work remains to demonstrate  progress in achieving acquisitions and operations outcomes. Between  fiscal years 2010 and 2015, we made about 800 recommendations  related to this high-risk area to the Office of Management and Budget and  agencies.

Specifically, in March 2017, the administration  established the Office of American Innovation, which has a mission to,  among other things, make recommendations to the President on policies  and plans aimed at improving federal government operations and  services and modernizing federal IT. Further, in May 2017, the  administration established the American Technology Council, which has a  goal of helping to transform and modernize federal agency IT and how  the federal government uses and delivers digital services.

These reviews have identified a number of  weaknesses with the agency\u2019s reporting on the performance of its  modernization investments to Congress and other stakeholders. In this  regard, we have pointed out that information on investments\u2019 performance  in meeting cost, schedule, and scope goals is critical to determining the  agency\u2019s progress in completing key IT investments. We have also  stressed the importance of the agency addressing weaknesses in its  process for prioritizing modernization activities. Accordingly, we have  made a number of related recommendations, which IRS is in various  stages of implementing.", "In our June 2012 report on IRS\u2019s performance in meeting cost,  schedule, and scope goals for selected investments, we noted that,  while IRS reported on the cost and schedule of its major IT  investments, the agency did not have a quantitative measure of  scope\u2014a measure that shows whether these investments delivered  planned functionality. We stressed that having such a measure is a  good practice as it provides information about whether an investment  has delivered the functionality that was paid for. Accordingly, we  recommended that the agency develop a quantitative measure of  scope for its major IT investments, to have more complete information  on the performance of these investments. In response, IRS started  developing a quantitative measure of scope for selected investments  in December 2015 and has been working to gradually expand the  measure to other investments.", "In April 2013, based on another review of IRS\u2019s performance in meeting  cost, schedule, and scope goals, we reported that there were  weaknesses, to varying degrees, in the reliability of IRS\u2019s investment  performance information. Specifically, we found that IRS had not  updated investment cost and schedule variance information with actual  amounts on a timely basis (i.e., within the 60-day time frame required by  the Department of Treasury) in about 25 percent of the activities  associated with the investments selected in our review. In addition, the  agency had not specified how project managers should estimate the cost  and schedule performance of ongoing projects.", "As a result of these findings, we recommended that IRS ensure that its  projects consistently follow guidance for updating performance  information 60 days after completion of an activity and develop and  implement guidance that specifies best practices to consider when  estimating ongoing projects\u2019 progress in meeting cost and schedule  goals. IRS agreed with, and subsequently addressed, the  recommendation related to updating performance information on a timely  basis. However, the agency partially disagreed with the recommendation  to develop guidance on estimating progress in meeting cost and schedule  goals for ongoing projects. In this regard, we had suggested the use of  earned value management data as a best practice to determine projected  cost and schedule amounts. IRS did not agree with the use of the  technique, stating that it was not part of the agency\u2019s current program  management processes and that the cost and burden to use earned  value management would outweigh the value added.", "We disagreed with the agency\u2019s view of earned value management  because best practices have found that its value generally outweighs the  cost and burden of its implementation (although we suggested it as one of  several examples of practices that could be used to determine projected  amounts). We also stressed that implementing our recommendation  would help improve the reliability of reported cost and schedule variance  information, and that IRS had flexibility in determining which best  practices to use to calculate projected amounts. For those reasons, we  maintained that our recommendation was warranted. However, IRS has  yet to address the recommendation.", "We reported in April 2014, that the cost and schedule performance  information that IRS reported for its major investments was for the  fiscal year only. We noted that this reporting would be more  meaningful if supplemented with cumulative cost and schedule  performance information in order to better indicate progress toward  meeting goals. In addition, we noted that the reported variances for  selected investments were not always reliable because the estimated  and actual cost and schedule amounts on which they depended had  not been consistently updated in accordance with Department of  Treasury reporting requirements as we had previously recommended.", "We recommended that IRS report more comprehensive and reliable cost  and schedule information for its major investments. The agency agreed  with our recommendation and said it believed it had addressed the  recommendation in its quarterly reports to Congress. We disagreed with  IRS\u2019s assertion, however, noting that, while the report includes cumulative  costs, they are cumulative for the fiscal year, not for the investment or  investment segment as we recommended and they therefore do not  account for cost variances from prior fiscal years. We therefore  maintained our recommendation.", "In February 2015, after assessing the status and plans of the Return  Review Program and Customer Account Data Engine 2, we reported  that these investments had experienced significant variances from  initial cost, schedule, and scope plans; yet, IRS did not include these  variances in its reports to Congress because the agency had not  addressed our prior recommendations. Specifically, IRS had not  addressed our recommendation to report on how delivered scope  compared to what was planned, and it also did not address guidance  for determining projected cost and schedule amounts, or the reporting  of cumulative cost and schedule performance information. We  stressed that implementing these recommendations would improve  the transparency of congressional reporting so that Congress has the  appropriate information needed to make informed decisions. We  made additional recommendations for the agency to improve the  reliability and reporting of investment performance information and  management of selected major investments. IRS agreed with the  recommendations and has since addressed them.", "In our most recent report in June 2016, we assessed IRS\u2019s process  for determining its funding priorities for both modernization and  operations. We found that the agency had developed a structured  process for allocating funding to its operations activities consistent  with best practices, which specify that an organization should  document policies and procedures for selecting new and reselecting  ongoing IT investments, and include criteria for making selection and  prioritization decisions.", "However, IRS did not have a similarly structured process for prioritizing its  modernization activities, to which the agency allocated hundreds of  millions of dollars for fiscal year 2016. Agency officials stated that  discussions were held to determine the modernization efforts that were of  highest priority to meet IRS\u2019s future state vision and technology roadmap.  The officials reported that staffing resources and lifecycle stage were  considered, but there were no formal criteria for making final  determinations. Senior IRS officials said they did not have a structured  process for the selection and prioritization of business systems  modernization activities because the projects were established; and there  were fewer competing activities than for operations support.", "Nevertheless, we stressed that, while there may have been fewer  competing activities, a structured, albeit simpler, process that is  documented and consistent with best practices would provide  transparency into the agency\u2019s needs and priorities for appropriated  funds. We concluded that such a process would better assist Congress  and other decision makers in carrying out their oversight responsibilities.  Accordingly, we recommended that IRS develop and document its  processes for prioritizing IT funding. The agency agreed with the  recommendations and has taken steps to address them.", "Further, we found that IRS had reported complete performance  information for two of the six selected investments in our review, to  include a measure of progress in delivering scope, which we have been  recommending since 2012. However, the agency did not always use best  practices for determining the amount of work completed by its own staff,  resulting in inaccurate reports of work performed. Consequently, we  recommended that IRS modify its processes for determining the work  performed by its staff. The agency disagreed with the recommendation,  stating that the costs involved would outweigh the value provided.  Specifically, IRS stated that modifying the use of the level of effort  measure would equate to a certified earned value management system,  which would add immense burden on IRS\u2019s programs on various fronts  and would outweigh the value it provides. However, we did not specify the  use of an earned value management system in our report and believe  other methods could be used to more reliably measure work performed..  In addition, we believed that it is a reasonable expectation for IRS to  reliably determine the actual work completed, as opposed to assuming  that work is always completed as planned since, as noted in our report,  22 to 100 percent of the work for selected projects was performed by IRS  staff. Accordingly, we maintained that the recommendation was still  warranted."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS Faces Challenges with Managing Its Aging Legacy Systems", "paragraphs": ["Our work has also emphasized the importance of IRS more effectively  managing its aging legacy systems.

For example, the  Gartner Group, a leading IT research and advisory company, has  reported that organizations using COBOL should consider replacing the  language and, in 2010, noted that there should be a shift in focus to using  more modern languages for new products. The use of COBOL presents  challenges for agencies such as IRS given that procurement and  operating costs associated with this language will steadily rise, and  because fewer people with the proper skill sets are available to support  the language.", "Further, we reported that IRS\u2019s Individual Master File was over 50 years  old and, although IRS was working to modernize it, the agency did not  have a time frame for completing the modernization or replacement.  Thus, we recommended that the Secretary of the Treasury direct the  Chief Information Officer to identify and plan to modernize and replace  legacy systems, as needed, and consistent with the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s draft guidance on IT modernization, including  time frames, activities to be performed, and functions to be replaced or  enhanced. The department had no comments on our recommendation.  We will continue to follow-up with the agency to determine the extent to  which this recommendation has been addressed. In addition, we have  ongoing work identifying risks associated with IRS\u2019s legacy IT systems,  and the agency\u2019s management of these risks.", "In summary, IRS faces longstanding challenges in managing its IT  systems. While effective IT management has been a prevalent issue  throughout the federal government, it is especially concerning at IRS  given the agency\u2019s extensive reliance on IT to carry out its mission of  providing service to America\u2019s taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations.  Thus, it is important that the agency establish, document, and implement  policies and procedures for prioritizing its modernization efforts, as we  have recently recommended, and provide Congress with accurate  information on progress in delivering such modernization efforts. In  addition, we have emphasized the need for IRS to address the inherent  challenges associated with aging legacy systems so that it does not  continue to maintain investments that have outlived their effectiveness  and are consuming resources that outweigh their benefits. Continued  attention to implementing our recommendations will be vital to helping  IRS ensure the effective management of its efforts to modernize its aging  IT systems and ensure its multibillion dollar investment in IT is meeting  the needs of the agency.", "Chairman Buchanan, Ranking Member Lewis, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
