We reported, for example, that tuition increased 234 percent from school year 1980-81 through 1994-95, in contrast to median household income, which rose 82 percent during this period. Recent sharp increases in the annual volume of new federal student loans suggest that the cumulative amounts of student debt may be rising as well. In response to this concern, you asked us to answer the following questions:", "What changes have occurred in recent years in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate/professional students who borrow and in the cumulative amount of their borrowing?", "What changes have occurred in the percentage of undergraduate and graduate/professional students who work and the number of hours they work?", "How do undergraduate borrowing and work patterns differ by type of school, year in school, dependency status, family income, and race/ethnicity?", "What information is available concerning the amounts of education debt parents incur?", "Our review was based in large part on our analysis of data collected by the Department of Education as part of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS). We focused our analysis primarily on two academic or student years: 1992-93 and 1995-96. We focused on 1995-96 because it was the most recent year for which data were available. We chose 1992-93 for a comparison because it (1) predated the most recent round of increases in maximum limits on the amounts of loans available through the government\u2019s major student loan programs, and (2) like 1995-96, was a year in which the Department identified students who had graduated from their academic programs. The use of these survey data allowed us to estimate averages for the student population as a whole, as well as narrow the comparison to groups that had completed their educational programs.

In 1995, more than 34 percent of all 18- to 24-year-old U.S. residents were attending postsecondary schools, compared with slightly less than 28 percent in 1985. Many who attend also plan to stay longer: Two-thirds of college freshmen now intend to go beyond a baccalaureate degree, compared with about half in 1980. In part, this interest in postsecondary education likely reflects students\u2019 recognition that such education is associated with higher incomes later in life. Bureau of the Census statistics indicate that, on average, households headed by persons with bachelor\u2019s degrees have average incomes nearly 70 percent higher than households headed by persons with no more than high school diplomas. Households with a member that has a professional degree have incomes that average about three times those of households in which members\u2019 highest certificate is a high school diploma.", "As the number of students has increased, so has the size of the government\u2019s student loan programs. By the end of fiscal year 1996, the estimated outstanding amount of loans provided by the Department of Education\u2019s two largest loan programs, the principal sources of loans for postsecondary education, had reached $112 billion, up from $91 billion a year earlier and from $65 billion in 1990, in constant 1995-96 dollars. The Higher Education Amendments of 1992 increased the maximum amount that students could borrow.

Figure 1 shows how an \u201caverage\u201d full-time student met the cost of his or her education at various types of postsecondary institutions in school year 1995-96. Together, borrowing and working constituted more than half of the amount of funds students needed to pay their cost of attendance at all types of schools, except private 4-year schools.", "While this \u201caverage\u201d view is instructive as a way to see the general role of student borrowing and working patterns, it does not show the wide range of methods students use to finance college. Some students do not borrow or work at all, while others earn more than enough to cover the cost of attending college.

Not surprisingly, the most influential factor that emerged from our analyses was the cost of the school attended. However, this factor accounted for only about 11 percent of the difference in the amounts of borrowing that occurred, after controlling for other factors. Several factors that helped account for smaller portions of the variation in amounts borrowed were the student\u2019s class level (freshmen, sophomore, junior, or senior), the amount of grant aid received, and whether the student was independent. Other factors included in the analysis (type of school, race/ethnicity, adjusted gross family income percentile, expected family contribution, and hours worked per week while enrolled) accounted for little, if any, variation.
