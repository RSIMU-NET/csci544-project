The United States and Japan planned to reduce the U.S. military presence on Okinawa by relocating approximately 9,000 Marines. DOD had originally planned to move the Marines only to Guam, but revised its plans in 2012 to include other locations in the Pacific. Congressional committees have directed GAO to examine DOD's initiatives in the Pacific, focusing on planning and costs. This report discusses the extent to which DOD has (1) developed a comprehensive cost estimate for the realignment of Marines, (2) planned for and synchronized other movements to coincide with the realignment, and (3) identified plans to sustain the force until all initiatives are implemented. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed relevant policies and procedures, reviewed and analyzed cost documents related to the realignment initiatives, interviewed DOD officials, and conducted site visits at U.S. military installations in the Pacific."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense's (DOD) preliminary cost estimate for its current realignment plan is not reliable, because it is missing costs and is based on limited data. According to DOD officials, DOD has not yet been able to put together a more reliable cost estimate because it will not have specific detailed information on the plan's requirements until the completion of environmental analyses and host nation negotiations. Currently, DOD estimates that it would cost approximately $12.1 billion to implement its realignment plan--not including the Australia segment of the realignment. Still, GAO found that DOD did not include some up-front practices that could have provided a more reliable estimate that are not dependent on the completion of the environmental analyses and host nation negotiations. Specifically, DOD omitted any costs associated with mobility support, a critical component of the implementation, from its cost estimate. Furthermore, although DOD based its cost estimate on several assumptions, there was no evidence DOD conducted analysis needed to determine the reliability of those assumptions. Without a reliable estimate, DOD will not be able to provide Congress and other stakeholders with the information Congress needs to make informed decisions regarding the realignment.", "DOD has not developed an integrated master plan for its current realignment plan, and it has not developed a strategy to support the development and oversight of the Japanese construction projects associated with other realignment initiatives. DOD has taken initial steps to develop an integrated scheduling document based on currently known data, but indicated that specific requirements, schedules, and costs cannot be formalized in an integrated master plan until several studies and host nation negotiations are completed, which will take several years. Developing a master plan could enhance the management of the realignment by creating a systematic approach to planning, scheduling, and execution. In addition, DOD has not developed a strategy that identifies the resources needed to support the development of and oversight for these projects. According to best practices, a strategy identifies goals and resources and supports the implementation of a program. Without the information contained in an integrated master plan and a construction support strategy, Congress will be unable to make informed decisions about the order in which it needs to provide funding to support the realignment.", "DOD has taken some steps to plan for the sustainment of U.S. forces on Okinawa and Guam, but it has yet to fully identify sustainment needs and costs for both locations during this period. At several installations on Okinawa, some of the infrastructure has severely deteriorated. DOD facilities planning guidance calls for updated facility master plans that capture requirements and propose solutions. On Guam, DOD has been maintaining an inventory of unoccupied family housing that could potentially be used for Marines relocating to Guam. However, DOD has not determined all the costs and benefits of maintaining this housing or the Marines' potential housing requirements--information needed to perform an economic analysis. Without an estimate of the sustainment requirements for Okinawa, the costs for maintaining housing, and the potential Marine requirements for housing on Guam, DOD will be unable to make informed decisions on whether continued investment in sustaining these facilities is warranted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD develop more reliable cost estimates and an integrated master plan for the realignment of Marines, develop a mechanism to share annual updates on the status of each, and identify sustainment requirements for affected facilities until realignment initiatives are complete.

The Department of Defense (DOD) has  stated that it would tailor its global presence and posture by rebalancing  toward the Asia-Pacific region, emphasizing existing alliances and  expanding networks of cooperation with emerging partners throughout the  region to ensure collective capability and capacity for securing common  interests. One of the United States\u2019 most important allies in the Asia- Pacific region is Japan, which serves as the United States\u2019 most  significant forward-operating location in the region, accommodating  approximately 39,000 U.S. military personnel, 43,000 dependents, and  5,000 DOD civilian employees. The majority of this presence resides in  Okinawa, an island prefecture south of the Japanese mainland that  represents less than 1 percent of Japan\u2019s entire land mass. Although it is  small, Okinawa currently hosts over 25 percent of the U.S. bases in  Japan, and Okinawa\u2019s bases house approximately 8,000 Air Force  personnel and up to 19,000 Marine Corps personnel on any given day. To  balance the importance of this forward presence to both the United States  and Japan with the stated need to reduce the burden on the Okinawa  community, attempts to realign, consolidate, and increase the  sustainability of this presence have been ongoing for nearly two decades.  Most recently, after 6 years of unsuccessful attempts to implement a  realignment plan to move approximately 8,000 Marines and 9,000  dependents from Okinawa to Guam, representatives from the U.S. and  Japanese governments announced in a joint statement issued in April  2012, that they would adjust the plan. The Marine Corps\u2019 current  realignment plan would relocate over 9,000 Marines from Okinawa and  realign Marine forces throughout the Pacific: 4,800 to Guam, 2,700 to  Hawaii, and 2,500 to Australia.", "Although the document developed by representatives from the two governments  concerning the original Guam realignment referred to approximately 8,000 personnel, the  Record of Decision for the Guam and Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands Military  Relocation referred to approximately 8,600 Marines.

This report examines DOD\u2019s plans and the  costs associated with the most significant of these posture initiatives, the  realignment of Marines off Okinawa, and the effects of this initiative on  the current and future landscapes of Okinawa and Guam. Specifically, we  report on the extent to which DOD has (1) developed comprehensive cost  estimates for the realignment of Marines off Okinawa; (2) planned for and  synchronized other U.S. defense posture movements on Okinawa and  Japan to coincide with the relocation of Marines off Okinawa; and (3)  identified plans to sustain the force until the Marine Corps realignment  and other initiatives are completed.", "For each of our objectives, we reviewed relevant policies and procedures,  and collected information by interviewing and communicating with officials  from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Policy) and Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); the Air Force; the Army;  the Navy; the Marine Corps; the Joint Staff; United States Pacific  Command; and the State Department. We conducted site visits at Pacific  Command and its service components in Hawaii; U.S. Forces\u2014Japan  and its service components; and the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Japan; the  U.S. Consulate on Okinawa; and military installations on Guam. To  determine the extent to which DOD has developed comprehensive cost  estimates for the realignment of the Marines, we reviewed DOD\u2019s cost  estimating methodology and planning assumptions and compared them  to the cost estimating guidance in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating Guide.  Furthermore, we interviewed relevant officials from the Marine Corps,  Pacific Command, U.S. Forces\u2013Japan, Joint Guam Program Office,  Office of the Secretary of Defense, and Office of Economic Adjustment to  determine the validity of the data. To determine the extent to which DOD  has planned for and synchronized other U.S. defense posture movements  in Okinawa and Japan to coincide with the Marine Corps realignment, we  collected relevant planning documentation and interviewed Marine Corps  officials in Washington, Honolulu, and Okinawa. Furthermore, we  compared the data we received from each component within the Marine  Corps to one another, and the data we collected from the Pacific  Command, U.S. Forces\u2013Japan, Joint Guam Program Office, and the  Office of the Secretary of Defense to determine the status of planning  consistencies and synchronization. Finally, to determine the extent to  which DOD has identified a strategy to sustain its current forces on  Okinawa and Guam, we reviewed sustainment planning documentation,  base master plans, and historical host nation support and U.S.  sustainment data for Okinawa. We also interviewed relevant Marine  Corps and Air Force officials in Okinawa to determine sustainment  planning needs and the status of future sustainment funding requests. For  Guam, we interviewed Navy officials to determine the extent to which they  have planned for the sustainment of family housing on Guam, and we  reviewed planning documentation and analyzed current DOD cost data  collection methodologies used by the service.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 to March  2013, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Pacific Command is one of six  U.S. geographic combatant commands. Pacific Command\u2019s area of  responsibility spans roughly half the earth\u2019s surface and encompasses 36  countries, including Australia, China, India, Japan, the Philippines, and  South Korea. The Pacific Command is supported by four service  component commands: U.S. Army Pacific; U.S. Pacific Air Forces; U.S.  Marine Forces, Pacific; and the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Each component  command is generally responsible for its service\u2019s actions and missions  within the Pacific Command area of responsibility and is supported by  subordinate commands, which help support the service\u2019s presence in the  region. For example, U.S. Marine Forces, Pacific, is supported by the III  Marine Expeditionary Force, a large Marine Corps unit forward deployed  to Japan and other parts of Asia, which stands ready to conduct  operations.

The alliance is supported by the 1960 Treaty of  Mutual Cooperation and Security and a related Status of Forces  Agreement which today covers about 51,200 U.S. servicemembers,  5,400 DOD civilian employees, and 42,200 dependents in Japan, as of  January 2013. As a result of the treaty, the Status of Forces Agreement,  and related agreements, U.S. forces have the use of nearly 90  installations throughout both mainland Japan and Okinawa, for the  purpose of contributing to the security of Japan and the maintenance of  international peace and security in the region. Under the treaty and Status  of Forces Agreement, the United States is granted the use of facilities and  areas in Japan, with specific facilities and areas to be determined by the  two governments. Generally, according to U.S. Forces\u2013Japan officials,  Japan constructs the facilities, while the United States bears the costs of  maintenance\u2014with each facility typically having a 50-year service life.", "One issue that remains at the forefront of the alliance is the realignment  of U.S. forces in Japan. Efforts to realign U.S. forces in Japan date back  to 1995. Discontent among the people of Okinawa regarding the U.S.  military presence led to the establishment of the Special Action  Committee on Okinawa in November 1995 by the Security Consultative  Committee, a bilateral group of high-ranking U.S. and Japanese officials  involved with overall bilateral policy regarding the security relationship  between the two countries. In December 1996, this committee approved  the final report of the Special Action Committee on Okinawa, which  included recommendations on how to consolidate, realign, and reduce  U.S. facilities and areas and adjust the operational procedures of U.S.  forces in Okinawa in order to reduce the burden on local communities.", "Realignment efforts did not gain much traction until the end of 2002, when  the United States and Japan launched an ambitious series of realignment  initiatives called The Defense Policy Review Initiative (DPRI). Under  DPRI, both countries were seeking to reduce the U.S. footprint in  Okinawa, enhance interoperability and communication, and better  position U.S. forces to respond to a changing security environment. The  major realignment initiatives under DPRI are outlined in the United  States\u2014Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation (2006  Roadmap) which was issued in May 2006 by the Security Consultative  Committee, reaffirmed and implemented in part in a 2009 bilateral  agreement, and recently adjusted in the April 2012 statement. There are  four initiatives under DPRI that are specific to the Marine Corps and its  current plans to realign its forces in the Pacific:  1. Futenma Replacement Facility,  2. Realignment of Marine Corps units,  3. Okinawa Consolidation, and  4. Carrier Air Wing Move from Atsugi to Iwakuni.", "As envisioned by the 2006 Roadmap, the U.S. government would return  to Japan the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Okinawa once the  government of Japan constructed a fully operational replacement facility  (Futenma Replacement Facility), including a runway, in a northern, less  populated area of the island. This facility was originally projected to be  complete by 2014. According to Marine Corps officials, some facilities  have been constructed at the planned site of the realignment\u2014Camp  Schwab; however, the construction of the replacement runway has  stalled. Those same officials stated that before construction of the  runway can proceed, the government of Japan has to issue an  environmental impact statement for the construction of the runway, and  the Okinawa government has to approve a landfill permit. According to  DOD officials, in December 2012, Japan\u2019s Ministry of Defense submitted  the environmental impact statement to the Governor of Okinawa.  Subsequently, in March 2013, DOD officials informed us that the  government of Japan submitted the application for the landfill permit to  the Governor of Okinawa. Figure 2 shows the planned location of the  runway at Camp Schwab. The Marine Corps estimates that its Operation  and Maintenance and Procurement costs for the Futenma Replacement  Facility will be approximately $178 million over the next 5 years; however,  this estimate does not constitute the total cost to the United States and,  according to Marine Corps officials, has not been approved.", "Because of the uncertainties surrounding the construction of the runway  at Camp Schwab and following direction from the Senate Armed Services  Committee, DOD has examined the feasibility of relocating air assets  from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to Kadena Air Base, as an  alternative to constructing the Futenma Replacement Facility at Camp  Schwab. However, DOD concluded that it was not a viable solution. In  the April 2012 statement, the representatives from the United States and  Japan reconfirmed their view that the Futenma Replacement Facility  remains the only viable solution that has been identified to date. In  addition, the April 2012 statement noted that both governments  expressed their commitment to contribute to refurbishment projects at  Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to sustain safe mission capability until  the Futenma Replacement Facility is fully operational and to protect the  environment. According to Marine Corps officials, as of February 2013, a  list of refurbishment projects to be funded by the U.S. government and  the government of Japan has been identified, and planning for these  projects is expected to be completed by April 2013. Though time frames  may vary, Marine Corps officials expect work on these projects could start  sometime in 2014.", "After several years of planning to move approximately 8,000 Marines off  Okinawa to Guam, DOD revised its plan in April 2012 to relocate some  units from Okinawa to Guam, Hawaii, and the Continental United States.  Additionally, the plan includes establishing a rotational Marine Corps  presence in Australia, a move that, according to DOD officials, stems  from a November 2011 agreement between the United States and  Australia. To date, the Marine Corps has established a small presence on  Guam to prepare for the Marine realignment, but it has not yet relocated  any units from Okinawa to Guam, nor has it been able to reduce its  presence on Okinawa as anticipated under the April 2012 statement.  According to Marine Corps officials, Marines cannot be relocated until  suitable replacement facilities are constructed and made operationally  capable on Guam and in other locations.", "The Marine Corps\u2019 current plan is to build facilities on Guam and live-fire  training ranges on Guam, Tinian, and Pagan\u2014members of the Mariana  Islands\u2014to support the realignment of approximately 5,000 personnel  (mostly rotational) and any dependents to Guam. Before any Marines  can relocate to Guam, DOD must examine the environmental effects of its  proposed actions, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of  1969. To address this requirement in the past, DOD performed an  environmental review of certain proposed actions under the original 2006  realignment plan and released the Guam and Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands Military Relocation Final Environmental Impact  Statement in July 2010. In September 2010, the Department of the  Navy announced in the record of Decision for the Guam and  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Military Relocation that it  will proceed with the Marine Corps realignment, but deferred the selection  of a specific site for a live-fire training range complex on Guam pending  further study.

As of June 2012, the United States had received $833.90 million from the Government of  Japan for this initiative; however, provisions in the National Defense  Authorization Acts for Fiscal Years 2012 and 2013 restricted the use of  funds provided by the government of Japan to implement the realignment  from Okinawa to Guam until DOD provided certain information to the  congressional defense committees. Although the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 restricts the use of funds, it  contains exceptions allowing DOD to use funds to complete additional  environmental analysis for proposed actions on Guam or Hawaii, initiate  planning and design of construction projects at Andersen Air Force Base  and on Andersen South, and to carry out certain military construction  projects as specified in the act.", "As part of the current realignment plan, DOD plans to move some Marine  Corps units to Hawaii and the continental United States.

According to  DOD officials, DOD has not yet been able to put together a more reliable  cost estimate for its current plan, because it will not have the information  needed to do so until the completion of several key studies, including  environmental analyses for Guam and Hawaii. In addition, host nation  negotiations\u2014specifically those with the government of Australia\u2014have  not been completed. As part of its preliminary rough-order-of-magnitude  cost estimate, DOD currently estimates that it would cost approximately  $12.1 billion to implement the current realignment plan\u2014not including the  Australia segment of the realignment. However, this estimate is not  reliable because it omits potentially critical cost elements and risk  parameters tied to the assumptions, and lacks detailed information on  requirements for several key cost components that are needed to capture  all costs related to the realignment. GAO\u2019s cost estimation guide specifies  four characteristics of a reliable cost estimate\u2014the extent to which an  estimate is comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible. We  found DOD\u2019s estimate only partially meets best practices for being  comprehensive, and according to best practices, when a cost estimate is  not comprehensive, it cannot fully meet the other characteristics of a  reliable cost estimate. As a result, we did not evaluate the other three  characteristics. According to DOD officials, specific requirements and  their associated costs cannot be developed for each cost component until  the necessary analyses and host nation negotiations have been  completed. Still, we found that DOD did not include some up-front  practices that could have provided a more reliable estimate and could  have been done despite the fact that the environmental analyses and  host nation negotiations are not complete. For example, DOD officials  identified mobility support as a critical component to the implementation  of the realignment; however, no costs associated with mobility support  were included in the estimate. Additionally, DOD based its estimate on  several assumptions, but there was no evidence that DOD identified risk  impacts or parameters for any of these assumptions. Overall, the cost  components not fully addressed in the current estimate include the Guam  physical layout and requirements; the housing requirements on Guam;  the requirements to upgrade utilities and infrastructure on Guam; the Joint  Training Range Complex in the Northern Marianas; the Marine Corps  requirements for Australia; the Marine Corps requirements for Hawaii and  other U.S. locations; and mobility support. In addition, DOD continues to  seek funding for utilities and infrastructure projects on Guam that once  supported the original Marine Corps realignment plan. DOD officials  believe that some of these projects should not be affected by the current  realignment plan. However, assessments to determine the extent to  which these projects remain valid for the current realignment plan have  not been completed. As a result, it is unknown to what extent these  projects need adjusting, if at all, to support the new realignment plan.

In 2010, DOD  developed a revised cost estimate, referred to as the Original  Realignment Plan Revised Cost Estimate (see table 1). This estimate is  based on planning, studies, and defined facilities requirements and  included additional cost elements, such as operation and maintenance,  procurement, overseas housing allowance, and family housing and  operations.  On the basis of this more detailed analysis, DOD\u2019s estimate  for the original realignment plan increased from $10.3 billion in 2006 to  $19 billion in 2010. Marine Corps officials told us they believed that not  having a full Marine Air-Ground Task Force capability on Guam, a feature  of the original realignment plan, would have hindered the Marines\u2019 ability  to properly train or deploy as a combined-arms force. Therefore, between  2010 and 2012, DOD examined different options for realigning Marines in  the Pacific. Although different options were considered, the costs  remained significant to the United States and no option was officially  adopted.", "In April 2012, DOD briefed its current realignment plan to the  congressional defense committees. The current realignment plan calls for  the establishment of Marine Air-Ground Task Forces in Guam and  Hawaii, and a rotational presence in Australia. In 2012, DOD officials  developed a preliminary rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimate for the  current realignment plan, which relocates fewer troops to Guam and  realigns Marines to other locations in the Pacific. This preliminary rough- order-of-magnitude estimate for the current plan, which was briefed to  congressional defense committees in the spring of 2012, is $12.1 billion;  however, this estimate does not include any potential costs for the  Australia segment of the realignment. Table 2 provides more location- specific information on cost estimates and personnel breakdown for the  current realignment plan.", "DOD officials informed us that the estimate for the current realignment  plan is lower than estimates for prior plans because of several factors.  One factor is that more Marines, approximately 1,300, will remain in  Okinawa than in previous plans, resulting in overall lower operation and  maintenance costs. For example, on Guam and Hawaii, the United States  will likely assume full responsibility for such things as labor and utilities  costs, whereas the government of Japan provides significant host nation  support for these two cost categories in Japan. Since more Marines will  remain on Okinawa, operation and maintenance costs will not be as  significant, causing the overall cost estimate to likely go down. Another  factor is a reduction in expected military construction costs on Guam.  According to DOD officials, since approximately 5,000 fewer Marines are  expected to relocate to Guam, and most of those who do will be deployed  on a rotational basis, there will be a reduced demand for additional  facilities and housing. Furthermore, DOD officials stated that the area  cost factor for Guam had declined in 2011, helping to reduce the overall  cost estimate.realignment plan will be lower than the estimates for previous plans.  However, DOD has not been able to apply the same rigor as was used in  developing previous estimates because, unlike for previous estimates,   DOD officials believe the cost estimate for the current  key studies, like environmental analyses, and host nation negotiations  that will affect requirements have not yet been completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Estimate for the Current Realignment Plan Is Not Reliable", "paragraphs": ["According to documentation attached to DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget,  DOD cannot continue the practice of starting programs that prove to be  unaffordable. Therefore, DOD plans to achieve program affordability by  working to ensure that programs start with firm cost goals in place,  appropriate priorities set, and necessary trade-offs made to keep them  within affordable limits. Furthermore, this documentation states that  understanding and controlling future costs from a program\u2019s inception is  critical to achieving the goal of affordability. According to GAO\u2019s Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide, whether or not a program is  affordable depends a great deal on the quality of its cost estimate. A  reliable cost estimate is critical to the success of any government  program, because it provides the basis for informed investment decision  making, realistic budget formulation and program resourcing, and  meaningful progress measurement. Office of Management and Budget  guidance containing best practices indicates that programs should  maintain current and well-documented estimates of program costs. In  addition, our research has identified a number of best practices that  provide a basis for effective program cost estimating and should result in  reliable cost estimates that an organization can use to make informed  decisions. These practices can be organized into the four characteristics  of a reliable cost estimate. The cost estimate should be comprehensive,  well-documented, accurate, and credible, as explained in table 3.", "Our assessment of DOD\u2019s preliminary estimate for the current  realignment plan is that it is not reliable, because it is missing costs and  based on limited data. To arrive at this conclusion, we assessed DOD\u2019s  preliminary estimate against one of the four characteristics of a reliable  cost estimate, comprehensiveness. As shown in table 4, we found that  the preliminary estimate only minimally met best practices for being  comprehensive. According to best practices, when a cost estimate is not  comprehensive, it cannot fully meet the other characteristics of a reliable  cost estimate. For example, because the cost estimate is missing some  cost elements, the documentation is incomplete, and since the  requirements for the realignment are still being determined, the estimate  cannot be considered accurate. Finally, the cost estimate is not credible  because it does not include a full risk and uncertainty analysis, and the  potential exists that some of the costs have been underestimated. Table 4  provides a summary of our assessment of DOD\u2019s preliminary cost  estimate.", "As discussed in table 4, we found that DOD\u2019s preliminary rough-order-of- magnitude estimate does not fully include requirements and associated  costs for all segments of the realignment plan, because this information  will not become available until several environmental analyses and  specific host nation negotiations are completed. While the reason for the  missing requirements and their associated costs is understandable, we  also found that DOD omitted specific costs and risk data that could have  resulted in a more reliable estimate and are not dependent on completion  of the environmental analyses and host nation negotiations. Most notably,  the estimate did not include any costs for mobility support, a component  that DOD officials said was necessary for the implementation of the  realignment. According to some DOD officials we spoke to, the potential  cost for additional mobility support could be considerable. In addition, we  found that the estimate was based on several assumptions, but there was  no evidence that DOD identified risk impacts or parameters for any of  these assumptions. For example, DOD assumed it would need $600  million to cover utilities and infrastructure costs for Guam. There were no  risk parameters put on this assumption indicating the estimate could be  higher or lower. Considering that historical data from previous  realignment plans estimated utilities and infrastructure costs for Guam at  over $1 billion, risk parameters could have identified the potential for  higher costs to DOD. Overall, we found that the preliminary estimate does  not adequately reflect the program because it cannot yet fully account for  the requirements and costs associated with the following seven cost  components:  1. Guam Physical Layout and Requirements.  2. Housing Requirements on Guam.  3. Requirements to Upgrade Utilities and Infrastructure on Guam.  4. Joint Training Range Complex in the Northern Marianas.  5. Marine Corps Requirements for Australia.  6. Marine Corps Requirements for Hawaii and Other U.S. Locations.  7. Mobility Support.", "We discuss each of the seven cost areas in more detail below.", "DOD does not yet know the full facilities requirements for Guam or  potential environmental mitigations; therefore, it does not have sufficient  information to determine the full costs of building the facilities and training  ranges needed to support the Guam segment of the realignment. The  cost estimate for the Guam segment of the current realignment plan\u2014 including the cost of establishing training ranges in the Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana Islands and investing in local civilian  infrastructure\u2014is approximately $8.6 billion, of which a portion will be  funded by the government of Japan. However, this estimate does not  fully capture the total costs of the Guam segment of the realignment,  because DOD has not determined the physical layout of the Marine Corps  presence on Guam, or fully identified specific infrastructure requirements  yet. To estimate the costs for the Guam portion of the realignment, DOD  officials assumed that the main Marine Corps installation, or cantonment,  would be constructed at Finegayan (an area in the northern part of Guam  just south of Andersen Air Force Base), and that the training range  requirements would not have changed from those in prior plans.  However, since the current plan calls for fewer Marines to relocate to  Guam, and the composition of the Marine units that will relocate has  changed, different locations might be selected for the main Marine Corps  cantonment and live-fire training ranges. Those locations under  consideration include military space at Andersen Air Force Base and  Naval Base Guam. As of January 2013, DOD is assessing alternatives  and the possible effects that the current plan might have on Guam\u2019s  infrastructure and on the environment in order to develop the  Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement. The results of DOD\u2019s  assessments could affect where DOD builds, what the facilities  requirements will be, and what environmental mitigations DOD might  take. DOD officials told us that they will wait until this environmental  impact statement is completed before proceeding with any further  planning and assessments that may be needed to identify specific  requirements.", "DOD does not know the minimum level of government-provided housing  needed to accommodate the relocated Marines and to inform its housing  investment strategies to ensure that the housing needs of  servicemembers and their families are cost-effective on Guam. Of the  $8.6 billion estimate for the Guam segment of the current realignment  plan, DOD includes approximately $400 million to construct military  housing for Marines on Guam; however, DOD has not performed the  necessary housing analysis to validate this estimate yet, nor has it  determined how Navy housing policies and Joint Region Marianas  housing practices will affect Marine Corps housing requirements.  According to Joint Region Marianas officials, Joint Region Marianas is  responsible for maintaining and sustaining housing on Guam. In 2010,  DOD performed an analysis to determine the minimum level of  government-provided military housing needed to serve both  unaccompanied and accompanied servicemembers on Guam. However,  this analysis was based on the original realignment plan and is no longer  valid. The current realignment plan involves a smaller population and will  consist primarily of rotational personnel. Navy officials told us that a  realistic housing analysis indentifying construction requirements for the  Guam segment of the realignment would not be able to be determined  until closer to the time when Marine Corps families are expected to move  to Guam, which is not expected for another 10 years. In the interim,  Marine Corps officials have said that they will plan to build to 100 percent  of the Marine Corps\u2019 housing requirement on Guam, an assumption that  will be used while completing necessary environmental reviews for the  Guam segment of the realignment. According to Joint Region Marianas  officials, their organization does not have the authority or responsibility to  determine how much housing the Marine Corps should build on Guam.", "Navy housing policy is to encourage and rely on private-sector housing  whenever possible. Along these lines, the practice of Joint Region  Marianas is to rely on the private sector for housing for servicemembers  whenever possible. A majority of the current Navy and Air Force  servicemembers choose to live in private housing on Guam. Joint Region  Marianas officials were uncertain what the effects would be if the Marine  Corps proceeds with building 100 percent of the housing it needs for the  relocated Marines, and whether the Marine Corps would attempt to  prohibit Marines from living in private, off-base housing. Furthermore,  according to DOD officials, if the decision is to house Marines on any  existing installations on Guam, such as Andersen Air Force Base or  Naval Base Guam, additional support infrastructure, such as dining  facilities and gymnasiums, will likely be required. Joint Region Marianas  also has a surplus of unoccupied military housing that could potentially be  used to house Marines (see fig. 7 for photographs of select unoccupied  military housing units on Guam). Unoccupied housing will be discussed in  greater detail later in this report.", "DOD has not updated its list of utilities and infrastructure requirements  that is tied to the current realignment plan; therefore DOD does not have  an accurate estimate of how much it will cost to upgrade Guam\u2019s utilities  and infrastructure to support the planned Marine Corps presence on the  island. These public infrastructure requirements include utilities and  infrastructure improvements, as well as projects to augment public health  and social services, and mitigate the social, economic, cultural, and  environmental effects of the Marine Corps realignment to Guam. In June  2009, we reported that DOD had determined that existing utilities and  infrastructure on Guam were near or at their maximum capacities already,  and would require significant enhancements to support the increase in the  island\u2019s population expected under the original realignment plan. In  addition, during the development of the 2010 Final Environmental Impact  Statement, DOD, the Guam Waterworks Authority, and the U.S.", "Environmental Protection Agency developed a list of water and  wastewater projects to address deficiencies in Guam\u2019s water and  wastewater infrastructure and respond to the increased population driven  by the original realignment plan. This list of projects, estimated to cost  approximately $1.3 billion, spanned the first 5 years of an overall 30-year  $5.3 billion capital improvement plan. The government of Japan was  expected to provide $600 million of the needed $1.3 billion, with the  remainder to be provided by DOD. Funding outside this 5-year timeframe  was expected to be covered by the government of Guam and non-DOD  federal government agencies. According to DOD Office of Economic  Adjustment officials, although other federal agencies, such as the  Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Insular Affairs, could help fund these  improvements on Guam, as of February 2013, there has been no  financial assistance for these projects from non-DOD agencies.", "Although $1.3 billion in water and wastewater projects were connected to  the original realignment plan, the Marine Corps, as part of the $8.6 billion  estimate for the Guam segment of the current realignment plan, only  identified $600 million for all utilities and infrastructure. According to  Marine Corps officials, this $600 million was to only fund water and  wastewater projects that the government of Japan was previously  expected to finance, but is no longer obligated to pay for as a result of the  adjustments to the 2006 Roadmap announced in April 2012. Marine  Corps officials also said that the decision to include only $600 million was  a planning decision and not based on any updated analysis of public  infrastructure requirements for the current realignment plan. These same  officials said that any updated analysis would not be available until the  Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for Guam was completed.  According to Office of Economic Adjustment officials, no matter how  many Marines relocate to Guam, significant improvements to the water  and wastewater infrastructure will be necessary; many of these  improvements are included in the $1.3 billion water and wastewater  infrastructure improvement estimate that was linked to the original  realignment plan.", "DOD plans and designs for a joint training range complex on Tinian and  Pagan in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands have yet to  be finalized, and the costs for this complex are not fully known. To  support the original realignment plan, DOD developed plans and designs  for live-fire training ranges on Tinian and Pagan, since not all training  could be accommodated by the proposed live-fire training ranges on  Guam. DOD also conducted several studies to identify training shortfalls  in the region and determined the Marine Corps training requirements for  units designated for realignment to Guam. According to Marine Corps  officials, these plans and requirement studies have been under review  since August 2012, and the studies have been updated to reflect the  changes made under the current realignment plan. Marine Corps officials  said that they intend to reexamine their plans and designs as they  prepare an updated environmental impact statement for this complex; this  environmental impact statement will be a separate effort from the Guam  Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, and, according to DOD  officials, will be entitled the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas  Joint Military Training Environmental Impact Statement. For the joint  training range complex environmental impact statement, Marine Corps  officials plan to examine alternatives and identify environmental  mitigations needed to proceed with the development of the complex.  Marine Corps officials anticipate issuing a Record of Decision by early  2016.", "As part of the $8.6 billion estimate for the Guam segment of the current  realignment plan, DOD identifies military construction costs for the  complex to be approximately $800 million. However, this estimate does  not include updated costs associated with environmental mitigations or  operation and maintenance associated with the current realignment plan.  For example, Marine Corps officials said that developing an amphibious  landing training area on Tinian could require coral realignment, which  could cost approximately $10 million (see fig. 8 for photographs of select  proposed amphibious landing training areas). According to these same  officials, the Marine Corps will need to wait until environmental analyses  are completed before fully determining the costs for environmental  mitigations associated with the complex. Additionally, the Marine Corps  estimated some operation and maintenance costs to maintain and sustain  the complex under previous realignment plans, but has not updated these  estimates based on the current plan. According to Marine Corps officials,  there are currently no permanent DOD training facilities on Tinian, but the  Marine Corps intends to build permanent facilities to store equipment and  house civilians and servicemembers deployed to the island to train.  Furthermore, DOD has not developed a Concept of Operations for the  complex, which could be used to determine other associated costs, such  as transportation to and from the island.", "DOD has developed some initial, rough-order-of-magnitude cost  estimates to establish a rotational presence of approximately 2,500  Marines in Australia; however, these cost estimates cannot be considered  comprehensive, because they are not based on finalized plans or  requirements. According to Marine Corps officials, facility requirements  for the Marine Corps have been provided to the government of Australia;  however, nothing has been finalized because there has yet to be a formal  agreement on host nation support options for the provided  requirements. In preparing to establish a rotational Marine Air-Ground  Task Force in Australia, the Marine Corps rotated approximately 200  Marines to Darwin, Australia, for 6 months beginning in April 2012. DOD  officials have also visited Australia to conduct site assessments and hold  discussions with their Australian counterparts. According to DOD officials,  DOD cannot finalize plans or fully determine facilities, housing, and  training requirements until negotiations with the government of Australia  have concluded. For example, Marine Corps officials said that the training  requirements for Marines in Australia will not differ from those of Marines  on Guam; therefore, officials did not know what additional infrastructure  and support facilities in Australia, if any, would be needed to address  these requirements. DOD officials acknowledged that the level of host  nation support has not been determined, including Australian preferences  for which Australian facilities will host the Marines, whether new facilities  need to be built and by whom, and how to coordinate training ranges for  exercises\u2014all of which could significantly affect the costs of rotating a  presence to Australia. Other details related to the Marine Corps presence  will also need to be negotiated. For example, according to Marine Corps  officials, the Marine Corps is considering prepositioning equipment in  Australia, since it may be cost-prohibitive to transport equipment with  each new deployment, given the costs associated with agricultural  quarantine inspections and transportation; however, Marine Corps and  Defense Logistics Agency officials we spoke with said it was too early to  determine any details related to prepositioned stock because no  requirements had been established yet.", "DOD has developed some initial, rough-order-of-magnitude cost  estimates to relocate Marines to Hawaii and the continental United  States; however, these cost estimates cannot be considered  comprehensive because they are not based on finalized plans or  requirements.

The Marine  Corps and Navy have conducted initial assessments of possible locations  to expand the Marine Corps presence in Hawaii, but facility, housing, and  training requirements to support the realignment remain undefined.

According to  Marine Corps officials, the current realignment plan was developed under  the assumption that sufficient mobility capabilities would be available to  support Marine Corps units stationed in the Pacific; however, as of  August 2012, although DOD officials said studies looking at lift in the  Pacific were underway, DOD had not completed any studies to determine  the implications for mobility of distributing Marines to multiple locations in  the Pacific. Marine Corps officials responsible for managing and  implementing the current realignment plan could not provide us with  information on how the Marines would travel to and from routine  operations, such as training events, and contingency operations once the  current realignment plan was implemented. As of August 2012, DOD  officials said that the Department of the Navy was conducting a study of  possible mobility solutions to support the current realignment. However,  at the time of our review, the study remained in draft format and under  review at DOD. Also, United States Transportation Command and its  subordinate commands have not assessed the implications of the current  realignment plan\u2019s mobility requirements for its current operations and  assets, because no request has been made to perform such a study.  According to United States Transportation Command Officials, they did  not assess mobility requirements associated with distributing Marines to  multiple locations in the Pacific in the command\u2019s last Mobility Capability  Requirements Study, and to their knowledge, mobility requirements  supporting the current realignment plan were not assessed for the  command\u2019s current study, due to be published in summer 2013.", "The Marine Corps uses a variety of assets to transport personnel and  equipment in the Pacific region. For example, the Marine Corps has in the  past chartered the Westpac Express, a commercial shipping vessel, to  transport personnel and equipment to various locations for training  exercises or contingency operations. Marine Corps officials stated that  they assumed that they would be able to use recently acquired Joint High  Speed Vessels to transport troops and equipment. The Marine Corps can  also use air and sea assets provided by U.S. Transportation Command.  Another option is the Amphibious Ready Group, which consists of a group  of Navy warships, including amphibious assault and dock landing ships,  and a landing force used to perform amphibious operations. The Navy  has one forward-deployed Amphibious Ready Group stationed in Sasebo,  Japan, that supports the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit.

The Futenma  Replacement Facility is an initiative in which Japan is constructing  facilities and a runway to replace Marine Corps Air Station Futenma on  Okinawa. Okinawa Consolidation is an initiative that involves returning  land to Japan that is currently occupied by U.S. military installations and  consolidating the remaining U.S. forces in less populated areas of  Okinawa once Japan has constructed necessary replacement facilities.  Under the 2006 Roadmap and the 2009 agreement, these initiatives,  along with the realignment of Marines to Guam, were directly linked  because progress on both Okinawa Consolidation and the realignment of  Marines was contingent on Japan making a certain level of progress  toward completion of the Futenma Replacement Facility and financial  contributions to fund development on Guam. However, as part of the  April 2012 statement, the Security Consultative Committee decided to  delink these initiatives, effectively no longer requiring that progress on  constructing the Futenma Replacement Facility be made before the other  initiatives could commence.

Marine Corps officials also told us that in its fiscal year 2011  budget, the government of Japan allocated $700 million for the design  and construction of facilities at Iwakuni (see fig. 9 for a photograph of the  ongoing Japanese construction at Marine Corps Station Iwakuni).  However, DOD and the Army Corps of Engineers were unprepared to  support an effort of this magnitude. According to officials at Iwakuni, the  Army Corps of Engineers did not have the resources to support an  accelerated buildup of this magnitude by the government of Japan and  questioned whether the Army Corps of Engineers could fully support the  entire DPRI initiative at Iwakuni, which will eventually cost Japan nearly  $3 billion to complete through 2017.", "The Marine Corps officials we spoke with in Okinawa agreed with the  officials at Iwakuni, suggesting that the Army Corps of Engineers did not  have the appropriate resources to oversee the design and construction of  the DPRI-related projects in Okinawa. Although less than 20 DPRI-related  projects have been designed and constructed to date, according to  Marine Corps officials several of these projects had errors that led to  unplanned budget expenditures by DOD. Marine Corps officials attributed  most of the errors to a lack of communication of proper requirements to  the government of Japan, and insufficient oversight during the  construction process. For example, the government of Japan designed  and constructed a bachelor enlisted quarters at Camp Schwab based on  requirements provided by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Marine  Corps. After construction was completed, the Marine Corps refused to  accept the building, because it discovered that the building\u2019s heating,  ventilation, and air conditioning systems did not meet Marine Corps  standards. Army Corps of Engineers officials said that they had not  identified the discrepancy between the Marine Corps\u2019 requirement and  the government of Japan\u2019s designs prior to construction, resulting in the  error. After about a year, the Marine Corps corrected the problem by  developing an ad hoc solution to the heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning systems issue at its own expense in order to bring the  building up to its standards. In another example, on the basis of  requirements provided by the Marine Corps and Army Corps of  Engineers, the government of Japan designed and constructed a new  police station with a fenced-in area to house military working dogs at  Camp Foster. After construction had been completed, it was discovered  that the fenced-in area had not met DOD standards for housing military  working dogs. As a result, the Marine Corps funded a corrective action.  See figure 10 for a list of additional DPRI-related construction errors in  Okinawa, as described by the Army Corps of Engineers.", "Army Corps of Engineers officials said they are aware of the setbacks  associated with the DPRI-projects in both Iwakuni and Okinawa; however,  Army Corps of Engineers officials told us that external factors associated  with its DOD counterparts (U.S. Forces\u2013Japan and the military services)  may have helped to contribute to these setbacks. For example, Army  Corps of Engineers officials told us that both a lack of proper master  planning and circumventing the DPRI project development process at  Iwakuni led to an expedited process that caused heightened risk. The  expedited process, according to Army Corps of Engineers officials, made  it difficult to catch and correct errors in the design phase of DPRI projects.  Army Corps of Engineers officials expressed concern that if DPRI projects  in Okinawa proceed in a similar, expedited manner as Iwakuni, similar  problems will occur, including heightened risk and an inability to  appropriately plan for resource requirements.", "In response to the setbacks related to DPRI projects in both Iwakuni and  Okinawa, the Army Corps of Engineers has requested funding to increase  staff at Iwakuni by 75 percent in fiscal year 2013 and have designed tools  intended to prevent such setbacks in the future. For example, Army Corps  of Engineers officials developed case studies of the errors and  disseminated the information throughout their organization to better  prepare their staff. In March 2011, Army Corps of Engineers personnel  and senior leadership held an internal meeting to review construction  project errors and discuss ways of improving their services. In addition, to  ensure that they have sufficient resources and staffing to support the  Marine Corps and the other services, Army Corps of Engineers officials  have told us that they have conducted analyses every 6 months since  July 2011 to forecast their future workload.

Joint Region  Marianas officials said that the low occupancy rate in their housing units  can be attributed to several factors. First, since many servicemembers  are eligible to live off base, many choose to do so to enjoy the benefits of  living in the local community. Many servicemembers also choose to  reside in private housing to take advantage of the high overseas housing  allowance and utilities stipend. According to the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service, in 2011 approximately 3,800 personnel from the Air  Force, Army, Navy and Marine Corps who were stationed on Guam  received a combined total of $96.1 million in overseas housing allowance.

To increase the  occupancy rate, Joint Region Marianas officials are assessing several  alternatives, including revising their housing policy to make more DOD- civilians eligible to reside in military housing, requiring more  servicemembers to reside in military housing, and reducing the number of  housing units in the inventory. However, Joint Region Marianas officials  informed us that, until the Marine Corps completes its requirements  determination, arrival dates, and housing policy, none of their alternatives  or plans will consider housing requirements associated with the current  Marine Corps realignment plan that will eventually send nearly 5,000  Marines to Guam.

They explained that delaying  action on meeting their housing needs could adversely affect their ability  to provide housing to servicemembers currently stationed on Guam.  Initially, Joint Region Marianas was making preparations to support the  Marine realignment. The Department of the Navy had conducted a  housing requirements and market analysis to identify the demand for  military housing on Guam based on the Marine Corps requirements  associated with the previous realignment plan. Joint Region Marianas had  identified surplus housing units that could have been used to provide  transitional housing for Marines relocating to Guam. However because of  the delay of the realignment and reduced number of troops relocating, the  Marine Corps data that the Navy used when it conducted its housing  requirements and market analysis were no longer valid.

Officials from Andersen Air Force Base estimated  that the average annual cost of maintaining an inactive unit on the Air  Force Base, including the cost of providing electrical power and ground  maintenance, is approximately $4,500 per house. However, Joint Region  Marianas officials said that similar data have not been calculated for Navy  housing on Guam. Joint Region Marianas officials told us that Navy  housing units on Guam can be found both on the military installations and  embedded in the local community and that, because different types of  costs are involved for the two types of housing units, it becomes difficult  to determine an average cost for maintaining inactive housing units. For  example, officials stated that certain services, like fire protection and  security, for Navy housing units located on military installations would be  incorporated into the base operating support expenses for that  installation; however, for certain Navy housing units embedded in the  local community, officials stated that Joint Region Marianas would pay for  these services from accounts other than base operating support, and it  may be difficult to isolate and merge this data.", "DOD guidance on economic analysis for decision making states that the  purpose of such an analysis is to give decision makers insight into  economic factors bearing on accomplishing a project\u2019s objectives and that  alternatives must be fully investigated and a determination made on  whether an alternative satisfies the functional requirements for the  project.

While DOD agreed with the content of  the report and the recommendations, the department expressed concern  with the report\u2019s title. DOD believes the title suggests the department  currently has the ability to produce comprehensive cost estimates and  complete planning for the realignment initiatives but has not done so. Our  report title Defense Management: More Reliable Cost Estimates and  Further Planning Needed to Inform the Marine Corps Realignment  Initiatives in the Pacific conveys that more reliable estimates and  comprehensive planning will be needed to inform decision makers. We  acknowledged in our report that DOD will not be in a position to provide  comprehensive cost estimates and complete planning documentation for  the realignment to Congress until the environmental studies and host  nation negotiations have been completed. However, it is important to  ensure that Congress is aware that current cost estimates provided to  them to date are not reliable because they are incomplete for the reasons  stated above and in our report. As a result, we did not change the title of  the report.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to update its current  cost estimate for the realignment to include additional estimates for  mobility support, and additional analysis that would quantify the risk  impacts and parameters to account for its various assumptions changing.  DOD stated that it is in the process of responding to requirements  contained in Section 2832 of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2013, which also requires an assessment of the necessary  strategic and logistical resources. However, the provision does not  specifically require DOD to include risk impacts and parameters.  Furthermore, DOD stated that estimates for mobility support will not be  available until the department completes the required environmental  planning documents. As our report states, we acknowledge that  comprehensive estimates for most costs tied to the realignment cannot be  completed until appropriate environmental analyses and host nation  negotiations are complete. However, we believe DOD should update its  current estimate to include risk parameters to produce a more reliable  cost estimate by accounting for potential cost fluctuations (if its  assumptions change) and include an initial estimate for mobility support,  a cost that DOD officials told us could be considerable.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation to update the cost estimate for  the realignment with comprehensive estimates as environmental analysis  and host nation negotiations are completed and consequently more  specific data becomes available on seven specific cost components  including Guam physical layout and requirements; housing and utilities  infrastructure on Guam; joint or Marine Corps training and other  requirements in the Northern Marianas, Australia, and Hawaii; and  mobility requirements. DOD stated that it plans to identify and incorporate  comprehensive cost estimates as they become available upon completion  of necessary environmental planning documents.", "DOD also concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy to provide annual updates on  the status of master planning efforts to the appropriate congressional  committees, until such time as master plans are completed for each  geographic segment of the realignment.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to require the Army  Corps of Engineers to coordinate with appropriate military service officials  to develop a strategy to identify how the design and construction process  of Defense Policy Review Initiative projects should be handled moving  forward, and the necessary resources needed to support any surge in  construction in both Iwakuni and Okinawa. DOD noted that it would take  these steps, but stated that the effort necessarily relies upon a detailed  master plan that has been coordinated among several organizations  within DOD in order to identify the necessary resources to support a  surge in construction. We agree that developing a master plan is the first  step, and coordination with the various DOD organizations will be  required to complete this task.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation to update Okinawa installation  master plans to include sustainment requirements and the costs to  sustain the U.S. presence on Okinawa until the Marine realignment and  Okinawa consolidation efforts are completed.
