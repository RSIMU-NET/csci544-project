The Public Printer and his leadership team understand the effects of this technological change on GPO and have begun an ambitious effort to transform GPO and reexamine its mission. Federal agencies are publishing more documents directly to the Web and are doing more of their printing and dissemination of information without using GPO services. At the same time, the public is obtaining government information from government Web sites such as GPO Access rather than purchasing paper copies. As a result, GPO has seen declines in its printing volumes, printing revenues, and document sales. To assist in the transformation process under way at GPO, GAO convened a panel of printing and information dissemination experts, who developed a series of options for GPO to consider in its strategic planning. The panel suggested that GPO (1) develop a business plan to focus its mission on information dissemination as its primary goal, rather than printing; (2) demonstrate to its customers the value it can provide; (3) improve and extend partnerships with agencies to help establish itself as an information disseminator; and (4) ensure that its internal operations are adequate for efficient and effective management of core business functions and for service to its customers. GPO can also use other key practices that GAO identified to help agencies successfully transform, such as involving employees to obtain their ideas and gain their ownership for the transformation. GPO fully applied one of these practices, related to ensuring that top management drives the transformation, and has partially implemented each of the remaining eight practices. To fully implement the remaining practices, GPO needs to take actions including establishing its mission and strategic goals and developing a documented plan for its transformation. GPO has taken some initial steps to adopt the best practices of other public and private sector organizations, most notably with respect to human capital management. GPO is actively implementing the recommendations GAO made in October 2003. For example, GPO reorganized the human capital office into customer-focused teams devoted to meeting the human capital needs of GPO's operating units. Continued leadership attention is needed to build on the initial progress made in information technology and financial management. For example, GPO should implement an information technology investment management process to help management choose, monitor, and evaluate projects, and GPO should train its line managers to effectively use financial data."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The transformation of the Government Printing Office (GPO) has begun.

The Subcommittee requested that the general  management review be done in conjunction with the committee\u2019s  mandated review. We have issued several products in response to and  based on the legislative mandate and request, including briefings on the  current printing and dissemination operations at GPO, the results of a  panel discussion on the future role of GPO and a survey of executive  branch agencies\u2019 use of GPO services, and selected approaches for  workforce restructuring at GPO.

First, in response to the Senate Committee\u2019s mandate, we  describe the current state of printing and dissemination of federal  government information, which is based on a survey of GPO\u2019s executive  branch customers and a panel of experts who discussed (1) trends in  printing, publishing, and dissemination and (2) the future role of GPO.  Second, our general management review focused on actions GPO\u2019s  leadership has taken and can take to transform itself and develop a  strategic plan, and how GPO can work towards building a world-class  organization.", "In completing the general management review, we used as the analytical  framework for collecting data and reviewing GPO\u2019s transformational  efforts the key practices and implementation steps for mergers and  organizational transformations that we had previously developed.", "We performed our work from March 2003 through June 2004. During this  time we worked cooperatively with GPO leaders, meeting regularly with  them about the progress of their transformation initiatives and providing  them with information that they plan to use to develop GPO\u2019s strategic plan  and strengthen management. For the general management review  examining GPO\u2019s transformational efforts, we followed generally accepted  government auditing standards. Because the nature of the work in  response to the mandate was future oriented and focused on technological  developments, not organizational management, we determined that it could  not be considered an audit subject to generally accepted government  auditing standards.

Under the public printing and documents  statutes of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO\u2019s mission is to fulfill the printing  needs of the federal government and to distribute those printed products to  the public. All printing for the Congress, the executive branch, and the  judiciary\u2014except for the Supreme Court\u2014is to be done or contracted by  GPO except for authorized exemptions. The Superintendent of  Documents, who heads GPO\u2019s Information Dissemination division,  disseminates these government products to the public through a system of  nearly 1,300 depository libraries nationwide (the Federal Depository  Library Program), GPO\u2019s Web site (GPO Access), telephone and fax  ordering, an on-line ordering site, and its bookstore in Washington, D.C.  The Superintendent of Documents is also responsible for classification and  bibliographic control of tangible and electronic government publications.", "Printing and related services. In providing printing and binding services  to the government, GPO generally dedicates its in-house printing  equipment to congressional printing, contracting out most printing for the  executive branch. Table 2 shows the costs of these services in fiscal year  2003, as well as the source of these printing services.", "Documents printed for the Congress include the Congressional Record,  hearing transcripts, bills, resolutions, amendments, and committee reports,  among other things. GPO also provides publishing support staff to the  Congress. These support staff mainly perform print preparation activities,  such as typing, scanning, proofreading, and preparation of electronic data  for transmission to GPO.", "GPO generally provides printing services to federal agencies through an  acquisition program that relies on the commercial sector by passing the  contractors\u2019 costs on to its government customers. Prequalified businesses,  small to large in size, compete for printing jobs that GPO printing experts  oversee to ensure that the contractors meet customer requirements for  quality. For this service, GPO attaches a 7 percent surcharge that GPO  officials have stated was established partly by what the market will bear  and partly by what is needed to cover GPO expenses. GPO procures about  83 percent of printing for federal agencies from private contractors and  does the remaining 17 percent at its own plant facilities. Most of the  procured printing jobs (85 percent for the period from June 2002 to May  2003) were for under $2,500 each.", "Besides printing, GPO provides a range of services to agencies including,  for example, CD-ROM development and production, archiving/storage,  converting products to electronic format, Web hosting, and Web page  design and development.", "Dissemination of government information. The Superintendent of  Documents is responsible for the acquisition, classification, dissemination,  and bibliographic control of tangible and electronic government  publications. Regardless of the printing source, Title 44 requires that  federal agencies make all their publications available to the Superintendent  of Documents for cataloging and distribution.", "The Superintendent of Documents manages a number of programs related  to distribution, including the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP),  which provides copies of government publications to libraries across the  country for public use. Generally, documents distributed to the libraries  are those that contain information on U.S. government activities or are  important reference publications. GPO evaluates documents to determine  whether they should be disseminated to the depository libraries. When  documents are printed through GPO, it evaluates them at the time of  printing; if documents are not printed through GPO, agencies are to notify  GPO of these documents, so that it can evaluate them and arrange to  receive any copies needed for distribution. A relatively small percentage of  the items printed through GPO for the executive branch are designated as  depository items.", "Another distribution program under the Superintendent of Documents is  the Sales of Publications Program, which purchases, warehouses, sells, and  distributes government documents. Publications are sold by mail,  telephone, and fax; through GPO\u2019s on-line bookstore; and at its bookstore  in Washington, D.C. In addition, GPO provides electronic copies of the  Congressional Record and other documents to the Congress, the public,  and the depository libraries in accordance with the Government Printing  Office Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993.", "The Superintendent of Documents is also responsible for GPO\u2019s Web site,  GPO Access, which is one mechanism for electronic dissemination of  government documents to the public through links to over 268,000  individual titles on GPO\u2019s servers and other federal Web sites. More than 2  billion documents have been retrieved by the public from GPO Access  since August 1994; almost 372 million downloads of government  information from GPO Access were made in fiscal year 2002 alone.

A major factor in this declining volume is the use of  electronic media options. The move to electronic dissemination is the  latest phase in the electronic publishing revolution that has transformed  the printing industry in recent decades. This revolution was driven by the  development of increasingly sophisticated electronic publishing (\u201cdesktop  publishing\u201d) software, run on personal computers, that allows users to  design documents including both images and text, and the parallel  development of electronic laser printer/copier technology with capabilities  that approach those of high-end presses. These tools allow users to  produce documents that formerly would have required professional  printing expertise and large printing systems.", "These technologies have brought major economic and industrial changes to  the printing industry. As electronic publishing software becomes  increasingly sophisticated, user-friendly, and reliable, it approaches the  ideal of the print customer being able to produce files that can be  reproduced on the press with little or no intervention by printing  professionals. As the printing process is simplified, the customer can take  responsibility for more of the work. Thus, the technologies diminish the  value that printing organizations such as GPO add to the printing process,  particularly for simpler printing jobs. Nonetheless, professional expertise  remains critical for many aspects of printing, and for many print jobs it is  still not possible to bypass the printing professional altogether.", "The advent of the Internet permits the instantaneous distribution of the  electronic documents produced by the new publishing processes, breaking  the link between printing and dissemination. With the increasing use of the  Web, the electronic dissemination of information becomes not only  practical, but also more economical than dissemination on paper.", "As a result, many organizations are changing from a print to an electronic  focus. In the early stages of the electronic publishing revolution,  organizations tended to prepare a document for printing and then convert  the print layout to electronic form\u2014in other words, focusing on printing  rather than dissemination. Increasingly, however, organizations are  changing their focus to providing information\u2014not necessarily on paper.  Today an organization may employ computers to generate both plates used  for printing as well as electronic files for dissemination. Tomorrow, the  organization may create only an electronic representation of the  information, which can be disseminated through various media, such as  Web sites.

In addition, federal agencies  are publishing more items directly to the Web\u2014without creating paper  documents at all\u2014and are able to print and disseminate information  without using GPO services. Similarly, individuals are downloading  documents from government Web sites, such as GPO Access, rather than  purchasing paper copies of government documents, thus reducing  document sales.

The sales program has had a net loss of $77 million over  the past 5 years, $20 million in fiscal year 2003 alone. According to GPO,  these losses are due to a downward trend in customer demand for printed  publications that has significantly reduced document sales revenues. For  example, according to the Superintendent of Documents, GPO sold 35,000  subscriptions to the Federal Register 10 years ago and now sells 2,500; at  the same time, over 4 million Federal Register documents are downloaded each month from GPO Access. The Superintendent also reported that the  overall volume of sales has dropped from 24.3 million copies sold in fiscal  year 1993 to 4.4 million copies sold in fiscal year 2002.

If they should be, GPO  can then add a rider to the agency\u2019s print contract to obtain the number of  copies that it needs for dissemination.

GPO\u2019s draft strategic plan is to be completed imminently;  however, its transformation efforts are at a critical juncture, and GPO  leadership will need to take further actions to strengthen and sustain GPO\u2019s  transformation by using the nine key practices that we identified to help  agencies successfully transform. One of these practices, related to ensuring  that top management drives the transformation, has already been fully  applied by GPO\u2019s leadership. Our recommendations, outlined in this report,  will assist GPO with the implementation of the eight practices where GPO\u2019s  efforts are still under way.", "GPO leadership has articulated a vision to transform GPO into a world- class organization and has taken some initial steps toward this objective.
