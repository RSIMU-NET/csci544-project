The tobacco industry agreed to pay about $368.5 billion (in 1997 dollars) over a period of 25 years\u2014subject to consumption or volume adjustment.Annual payments would range from $8.5 billion to $15 billion. Among other things, these payments would be used to fund an extensive federal enforcement program, including a state-administered retail licensing system to stop minors from obtaining tobacco products; an annual national counter-advertising and tobacco-control campaign; a nationwide smoking cessation program; and expenditures for states\u2019 health benefits programs. The proposed settlement would also impose substantial surcharges on the tobacco industry if underage tobacco use does not decline by at least 30 percent in 5 years, 50 percent in 7 years, and 60 percent in 10 years. In addition, the settlement clarifies FDA\u2019s authority to regulate tobacco products\u2014including regulating the level of nicotine in cigarettes\u2014under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and requires the tobacco industry to pay for FDA\u2019s oversight of the industry; bans all outdoor tobacco advertising and the use of cartoon characters and human figures, such as the Marlboro Man, in tobacco advertising; requires manufacturers to disclose internal research relating to the health effects of their products; establishes a minimum federal standard to restrict smoking in public places, with enforcement funding coming from the industry\u2019s payments; settles all punitive damages claims against the tobacco industry and places limits on future class-action suits against the industry; provides for the annual payments to be reflected in the prices that manufacturers charge for tobacco products; and treats all payments as ordinary and necessary business expenses, which makes them tax-deductible.", "Many of the elements of this proposed national tobacco settlement were included in a bill introduced by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, on November 7, 1997. Over the past several months, other Members of Congress have presented their own alternative settlement proposals. Comparing the provisions of all these various proposals is beyond the scope of this report, but we note that a common goal of many of the proposals we reviewed is to reduce smoking by youth, in part through a large increase in the price of a pack of cigarettes\u2014ranging from 62 cents to about $2.00 per pack.", "On September 17, 1997, the President announced five key goals that he believes should be included in any national tobacco settlement legislation: (1) reducing smoking by teens, through, among other things, a combination of industry payments and penalties; (2) granting FDA full authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products; (3) changing the way the tobacco industry does business, such as through restricting the marketing and promoting of tobacco to children, and requiring the industry to disclose scientific and health-related research; (4) addressing other related public health goals, such as promoting smoking cessation, researching the health consequences of smoking, and further restricting smoking in the workplace and in public areas; and (5) minimizing the impact of a national settlement on tobacco farmers and their communities.", "While the Congress has been deliberating the issue of a tobacco settlement, individual state lawsuits continue to move through the legal process, and to date, three have been settled, resulting in settlements totaling at least $28.8 billion.

However, if tobacco consumption were to fall, according to Warner\u2019s and USDA\u2019s studies, the money previously spent on tobacco products would be spent on other consumer goods and services, and, therefore, employment in other sectors would rise, offsetting part or all of the employment decline in the tobacco industry.", "Warner estimated the impact of decreasing tobacco consumption under two scenarios. (See table 2.) The first scenario assumes that all domestic spending on tobacco stops immediately (which is unlikely in the absence of an outright tobacco ban), while the second scenario assumes that annual domestic spending on tobacco decreases at twice the current rate, or at about 4 percent. This study also assumes that money previously spent on tobacco products would be reallocated to all goods and services in the U.S. economy in the same proportions as these goods and services currently contribute to the gross domestic product. As table 2 shows, under the first scenario, the U.S. economy would gain 133,000 jobs nationwide over a 7-year period and about 20,000 jobs under the second scenario. Job losses in the retail and wholesale trade, farm, manufacturing, and government sectors would be more than made up by job gains in the services and other private industry sectors. Warner explained the reason for this net gain by suggesting that most of the industries that produce the products that would replace tobacco are more labor intensive than the tobacco industry. However, because 91 percent of tobacco farming and manufacturing jobs are located in the Southeast Tobacco Region, this region could suffer net job losses in all sectors of the economy. These total losses are likely to be less than 1 percent of the region\u2019s total employment. (For more detailed information see app. I, tables I.4 and I.5.)", "In 1995, USDA also estimated the net impact of immediately ending domestic tobacco consumption. Under a scenario that USDA examined, the money currently spent on tobacco products would be reallocated to snack food and beverage products, and the U.S. economy would gain 156,000 jobs nationwide\u2014a result similar to that of Warner\u2019s scenario described above. USDA\u2019s study concluded that jobs in tobacco farming and tobacco manufacturing would be reduced considerably. However, the industries that produce the products that would replace tobacco are more labor-intensive, although, on average, lower paying, and thereby would more than offset the job losses resulting from reductions in tobacco consumption. The study also concluded that the general result does not change\u2014that is, an overall gain in jobs nationwide\u2014regardless of how tobacco expenditures are assumed to be reallocated.

(See fig. 1.) However, since 1992, the smoking rate has risen significantly, to about 25 percent in 1997. After initially decreasing from about $1.44 per pack of cigarettes in 1977 to about $1.23 per pack in 1981, the real price of a pack of cigarettes (in 1997 U.S. dollars) rose steadily, to a high of about $2.10 in 1992, before falling to about $1.95 in 1997. These two trends show an inverse relationship between the real price of a pack of cigarettes and the smoking rate for youths. The most recent estimates indicate that this inverse relationship remains strong, even when antismoking regulations and restrictions on youths\u2019 access are included in the analysis.

Since then, however, the data suggest that smoking by youths is on the rise\u2014reaching the rate of about 20 percent in 1994. From the data available, it is impossible to conclude with any certainty the reason for the higher 1994 rate. However, we believe two likely factors are (1) a possible reaction to the federal and provincial cigarette tax decreases enacted earlier that year, which suggests a relationship between smoking by youths and the price of cigarettes consistent with that observed for U.S. youths, and (2) Canadian youths\u2019 increasing access to contraband cigarettes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Tobacco Settlement Would Likely Reduce States\u2019 Tax Revenues", "paragraphs": ["National tobacco settlement legislation would likely result in a decline in state revenues from cigarette excise taxes.

Table 3 presents a range of estimated changes in consumption that could result from these price increases.

Currently, the states\u2019 cigarette excise taxes range from 2.5 cents per pack in Virginia to $1.00 per pack in Alaska. (See fig. 2.) According to the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), cigarettes are currently being smuggled across state borders to avoid the payment of state excise taxes. This activity can violate federal and/or state laws. A January 1997 study by the Washington State Department of Health estimated the extent of interstate smuggling activity in terms of packs per capita by state\u2014which we converted to the associated loss (or gain) of state tax revenue. (See app. IV, table IV.1.) According to our analysis of these data, some states are losing up to about $100 million annually in potential tax revenues. As expected, the Washington State study indicated that substantial smuggling occurs from states with low tax rates to states with high tax rates. For example, Washington and Michigan, states with among the highest tax rates, had estimated annual losses in tax revenues of $51 million and $105 million, respectively. On the other hand, exporting states\u2014such as Kentucky, North Carolina, and Virginia\u2014did not show revenue losses; however, at most, they showed only modest revenue gains because their tax rates are so low that extra sales to buyers in the high-tax states do not generate significant tax revenues.", "Recent experience demonstrates that international smuggling can occur when differences in cigarette tax rates are substantial. For example, international smuggling has occurred recently between Canada and the United States. From 1984 through 1993, the average real price of a pack of cigarettes in Canada\u2014in 1994 Canadian dollars\u2014increased from $2.64 in 1984 to $5.65 in 1993, as a result of sharp increases in Canadian federal and provincial cigarette taxes. According to a 1994 study for the National Coalition Against Crime and Tobacco Contraband, because of these price increases, Canadians found lower-priced alternatives on the black market. Organized criminal groups purchased Canadian cigarettes that had been exported tax-free to the United States and smuggled them back into Canada. The Canadian government estimated that, in 1993, contraband cigarettes made up over 60 percent of the Qu\u00e9bec market and from 15 to 40 percent of the market in other parts of the country. Violence increased, merchants suffered, and in 1 year alone, Canada and its provinces lost over $2 billion (in Canadian dollars) in tax revenues. The Canadian Prime Minister believed that Canadian tobacco manufacturers were aware that tobacco exports to the United States had been reentering Canada illegally and that these manufacturers benefited directly from this illegal trade. Canada responded in 1994 by sharply reducing federal and provincial cigarette taxes and increasing its enforcement efforts, among other steps. Since then, international cigarette smuggling has declined considerably. Available evidence also shows that international smuggling is currently occurring between the United States and Mexico; however, the extent of this activity is not known.

By evading the Canadian federal and provincial taxes, smugglers were able to earn huge profits from contraband cigarettes. According to the Canadian government, profits for smuggled cigarettes were an estimated $500 per case, or $500,000 per truckload, in Canadian dollars. The extent of this smuggling activity is indicated by the more than an 11-fold increase in U. S. cigarette imports from Canada from 1990 to 1993. (See fig. V.1.)

According to the Prime Minister, as the portion of the Canadian market supplied by smuggled tobacco increased, the average price paid for cigarettes dropped. Access to cheap contraband tobacco undermined the government\u2019s health policy objectives of reducing tobacco consumption, particularly among youths.", "In February 1994, Prime Minister Chr\u00e9tien addressed the smuggling problem by proposing, among other actions, strengthening enforcement at targeted smuggling areas, particularly along the U.S.-Canadian border; reducing the federal cigarette tax by $5 per carton in all provinces, effective February 9, 1994, and matching any provincial tax reduction over $5, to a maximum federal reduction of $10 (in Canadian dollars); imposing an export tax of $8 per carton (in Canadian dollars) to be paid by tobacco manufacturers, with an exemption provided for shipments in accordance with each manufacturer\u2019s historic level of exports; imposing a 3-year federal surtax on tobacco manufacturers\u2019 profits to fund a major public education program and other health measures; requiring manufacturers to clearly mark individual cigarettes to differentiate cigarettes manufactured for domestic and export use; and further restricting access to cigarettes by minors.", "From February 9 through April 15, 1994, federal and provincial taxes were significantly lowered in the five provinces\u2014including Qu\u00e9bec and Ontario\u2014where international smuggling was particularly troublesome.

Although taxes in these provinces have increased slightly since, once the initial tax cuts took effect, the contraband cigarette market dried up, according to the 1994 study for the National Coalition Against Crime and Tobacco Contraband. Consistent with the study\u2019s findings, U.S. cigarette imports from Canada dropped about 96 percent from 1993 through 1996. (See fig. V.1.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mexico", "paragraphs": ["With respect to international cigarette smuggling that may be occurring between the United States and Mexico, currently, there is no consensus among the authorities we interviewed on the extent of this activity. An official from California\u2019s Board of Equalization, which, among other things, is responsible for ensuring that state excise taxes are paid, told us that curtailing U.S.-Mexican smuggling of cigarettes is a priority for their agency. The California Board of Equalization estimates that California loses from $20 million to $50 million annually in revenues from state cigarette excise taxes because of tax evasion, most of which it believes is a result of smuggling between the United States and Mexico. In addition, officials from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) told us that such international cigarette smuggling activity is widespread, and they suspect the main source of the cigarettes is duty-free shops located along the border. They stated that instead of permanently leaving the United States through the export market, cigarettes are diverted mostly back to the Los Angeles area, where they are sold on the black market. Both California Board of Equalization and ATF officials told us that for the most part, the tobacco companies and the duty-free shops were not helpful in the government\u2019s attempts to stop the cigarette smuggling occurring between California and Mexico. These officials also said that the tobacco companies profit from the sales of their products whether or not federal and state taxes have been paid. An official from the Mexican Embassy in Washington, D.C., also told us that the Mexican government has recently become aware of cigarette smuggling occurring between the United States and Mexico. Although his government did not have any data on the extent of this activity, he believes it is increasing. He also told us that cigarettes are being brought into Mexico and then being smuggled back into the United States; however, he was not sure where the majority of these cigarettes came from.", "On the other hand, U.S. Customs Service officials at the ports of San Ysidro, California, and Otay Mesa, California, and U.S. Border Patrol officials at San Clemente, California, told us that they have not seen much evidence of cigarette smuggling between the United States and Mexico. Although Customs officials told us their number one priority is preventing the smuggling of narcotics into the country, this focus does not preclude them from finding other contraband products during their routine searches of vehicles. Customs officials at Otay Mesa\u2014a large border port in California for commercial vehicles entering the United States\u2014told us that their inspections of commercial vehicles over the last 4 years have yielded virtually no instances of cigarette smuggling. At San Ysidro\u2014a border port through which some 40,000 personal vehicles enter the United States each day, Customs officials also told us that they have found very little evidence of cigarette smuggling as a result of their inspections. Our discussions with U.S. Border Patrol officials in San Clemente yielded similar results. The Border Patrol conducts vehicle inspections to search for illegal aliens. These inspections could uncover a wide range of contraband goods. However, although the officials in San Clemente have discovered contraband cigarettes as a result of these inspections, to date, they have not found quantities sufficient to conclude such smuggling activity is widespread.", "Although the extent of U.S.-Mexican cigarette smuggling is unknown, a 1995 case in the Los Angeles area illustrates that this activity is occurring. A 1998 study by FIA International Research Ltd. (FIA), a Toronto-based investigative research firm, concluded that international cigarette smuggling is occurring between California and Mexico involving \u201cFor Export Only\u201d cigarettes. For example, FIA described a scheme in which a cigarette smuggling operation linked to Mexico was supplying contraband cigarettes to the Los Angeles and San Diego areas. Raids conducted in 1995 yielded 13 arrests and the seizure of seven vehicles and over 4,700 cartons of cigarettes. Authorities found that Mexican citizens had crossed into California and purchased cigarettes from duty-free stores and brought them back into Mexico. Once these duty-free cigarettes were in Mexico, smugglers concealed them in personal vehicles and smuggled them back across the border into California. Once in California, the cigarettes were consolidated at storage facilities before being distributed to the San Diego and Los Angeles areas, where they were sold in small convenience stores, on street corners, and out of catering trucks and the trunks of cars. This case illustrates that cigarette smugglers are profiting by evading federal, state, and local taxes through a variety of export- and duty-free-cigarette diversion schemes. Currently, the price of a carton of cigarettes in California is about $10.50 at duty-free stores\u2014as compared with a retail price of about $20. If a tobacco settlement increases the price of cigarettes, this differential could increase further, thus further increasing the profitability of obtaining these cigarettes for resale."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Resources, Community, and Economic Development Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of the Chief Economist, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Scott Smith, Assistant Director Daniel Coates, Senior Economist Kirsten Landeryou, Economist The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
