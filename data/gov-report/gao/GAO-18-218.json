In August 2015, DOD required the military departments to review their privatized housing portfolios and outline any effects of the reductions. Each military department reported that the reductions would decrease cash flows to their long-term sustainment accounts. However, the reports did not specify the significance of the reductions on each project's future sustainment or identify specific actions to respond to shortfalls at individual projects.

At the time, DOD estimated that it would  need about $20 billion in appropriated funds and up to 40 years to  eliminate the poor quality housing through new construction or renovation  using the traditional military construction approach. DOD became  concerned that the poor quality of its housing was having a negative  effect on servicemembers\u2019 quality of life and detracting from readiness by  contributing to servicemembers\u2019 decisions to leave the military. To enable  DOD to privatize its housing, Congress provided the department with a  variety of authorities to obtain private-sector financing and management  to repair, renovate, construct, and operate military housing. In more than  a decade since, the military departments have worked with private-sector  developers who have rebuilt and renovated the housing. These  developers now operate 99 percent of domestic military family housing,  as well as a limited amount of housing for unaccompanied military  personnel. The developers rely on servicemembers\u2019 basic allowance for  housing payments as a key revenue source for this privatized housing,  but DOD began reducing these payments in 2015.", "Since 1998, we have conducted various reviews related to military  housing privatization and the basic allowance for housing. In 2009, we  reported, among other things, that some privatization projects with  occupancy rates below 90 percent were challenged in generating enough  revenue to fund construction, make debt payments, and set aside funds  for future major renovations and rebuilds. We also stated that turmoil in  the financial markets had reduced available construction funds, resulting  in more renovations relative to new construction and reduced amenities at  some projects. We recommended, among other things, that DOD include  information in its reports to Congress on the effects that current financial  market conditions have on housing projects. DOD agreed with our  recommendations, and in its February 2010 semiannual status report to  Congress included more detailed information on the financial  performance of ongoing projects. In 2011, we reported that DOD uses a  data-intensive process to set housing allowance rates, but that  enhancements related to data collection and definitions for data  collection, as well as cost estimating for budget estimates, could enhance  the process. We recommended, among other things, that DOD assess  the benefits and drawbacks of revising its definition of \u201cavailable\u201d housing  for data collection purposes, and that it develop a communications  process for installations to share information on housing tools. DOD  generally concurred with our recommendations and took steps to  implement them. In 2014, we reported, among other things, that the  military services conducted several analyses and considered several  other factors to determine whether to privatize housing for  unaccompanied personnel. The Army and Navy concluded that  privatization could be used under a narrow set of circumstances at  specific installations, and the Air Force and Marine Corps concluded that  privatization was not suitable for meeting any of their unaccompanied  housing needs.

We also  reviewed DOD\u2019s annual report to Congress on privatized housing, as well  as data for privatized housing projects from fiscal years 2013 through  2016. We met with officials involved in the oversight and management of  privatized housing to discuss their oversight and management of the  financial condition of privatized housing projects. Additionally, we  examined the differences among and within the military departments in  determining the financial condition of their projects. We compared the  extent of DOD\u2019s actions to assess and report the financial condition of  each privatized housing project with DOD\u2019s housing policy and federal  internal control standards related to quality information.

We interviewed officials from each military department involved with  privatized housing, officials at the installations in our non-generalizable  sample involved in privatized housing, and officials of five leading  privatized housing developers for their perspectives on challenges to their  privatized housing and options to address them. We reported examples of  challenges that were identified by at least two of the three military  departments. Additionally, we interviewed officials at the Defense Travel  Management Office for information on the basic allowance for housing  calculations and military department officials for their perspectives on the  reductions in the basic allowance for housing.

The projects were generally  financed through both private-sector financing and funds provided by the  military departments. Specifically, projects obtained private-sector  financing by obtaining bank loans and by issuing bonds, which are held  by the public. In addition, the military departments provided additional  financing. The Army and the Navy generally structured their privatized  housing projects as limited liability companies in which the military  departments formed partnerships with the developers and invested funds  into the partnership. The Air Force generally provided direct loans to the  developers. Because privatized housing projects involve budgetary  commitments of the federal government, each project was scored at  inception by the Office of Management and Budget to determine the  amount of funds that needed to be budgeted for that particular project.", "The number of projects can change over time. For example, a project  may be sold, and new projects can be created. As of October 2017, there  were 82 privatized military housing projects, each of which can consist of  one or multiple installations. The Army has 35 projects, the Navy and  Marine Corps together have 15, and the Air Force has 32. Most of these  are family housing projects, but the Army and Navy have created a small  number of privatized housing projects for servicemembers without  families (that is, unaccompanied housing).", "The military departments have flexibility in how they structure their  privatized housing projects, but project structures share certain  similarities. For a typical project, a military department leased land to a  developer for a 50-year term and conveyed existing homes located on the  leased land to the developer for the duration of the lease. The developer  then became responsible for leasing renovated and newly constructed  homes, giving preference to servicemembers and their families.", "Each privatized housing project is a separate and distinct entity governed  by a series of legal agreements that are specific to that project. These  agreements include, among others, an operating agreement, a property  management agreement, and an agreement that describes the  management of funds in the project, including the order in which funds  are allocated within the project. However, while each project is distinct,  there are some common elements in how projects invest and utilize  funds. Every project takes in revenue, which consists mostly of rent  payments. Projects then pay for operating expenses, including  administrative costs, day-to-day maintenance, and utilities, among other  things. After that, projects generally allocate funds for taxes and  insurance, followed by debt payments. Figure 1 shows a typical funding  structure for a privatized housing project.", "In the typical privatized housing project depicted in figure 1, once debt  payments are made, funds are allocated to accounts that fund scheduled  maintenance. These accounts exist to fund repair and replacement of  items such as roofs, heating and cooling systems, and infrastructure.  After that, funds are allocated to a series of management incentive fees,  such as the property management fee. Finally, the project divides these  remaining funds according to a fixed percentage between accounts that  fund major renovations and rebuilds on the one hand and go the  developer on the other hand.

For example, the  Marine Corps\u2019 project comprising Camp Lejeune, North Carolina;  Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina; and Stewart  Air National Guard Base, New York was experiencing low  occupancy rates due to local market competition, and as such was  included on the watch list.", "Air Force: For the quarter ending June 30, 2017, the Air Force rated  27 of its 32 projects\u2019 current finances as acceptable or exceptional.  However, the Air Force rated 2 of its 32 projects as unacceptable, and  3 as marginal, for current finances, according to Air Force portfolio- wide reporting. For example, the Air Force rated the Nellis Air Force  Base project in Nevada as having an unacceptable current financial  condition as of June 2017. In March 2017, the Office of Management  and Budget approved the budgetary scoring of a financial  restructuring of the project. In the restructuring, the Air Force reduced  the interest rate on the government\u2019s direct loan to the project and  extended the loan\u2019s maturity date, redistributed residual project cash  flows, and reduced certain returns due to the developer. In another  example, the Air Force rated the Air Combat Command II project,  which comprises Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and Davis- Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, as having a marginal current  financial condition as of June 2017. Specifically, basic allowance for  housing rates for the project were only 85 percent of original  expectations, and the project was unable to compensate for that  shortfall by controlling expenses.

Debt coverage ratios are a key measure used by the military departments  to report on the current financial condition of privatized housing projects,  and the measures are also the main financial measure for privatized  housing projects that DOD has previously reported to Congress.  However, we found the following inconsistencies in the debt coverage  ratio data reported to ASD (EI&E):", "Adjustments made to income for the purposes of calculating debt  coverage ratios affect the ratios\u2019 consistency: The expenses that are  or are not included in a project\u2019s calculation of the debt coverage ratio  are dictated by each project\u2019s business agreements. ASD (EI&E)  defines debt coverage ratio as the project\u2019s net operating income\u2014 income remaining after all project expenses are paid, but before debt  service and depreciation\u2014divided by its required debt payments.  However, we found that in practice, projects make various  adjustments to net operating income for the purposes of calculating  debt coverage ratios. These adjustments may include adding or  subtracting from net operating income any of the following:  sustainment fund deposits; various types of management fees,  including performance incentive fees and asset management fees;  certain utility costs; and taxes. Military department officials stated that  the debt coverage ratios calculated using these adjustments, while  different for different projects, are accurate and appropriate. However,  while the calculation methods may be sufficient for any given project,  the differences in calculation methods reduce the comparability of the  data.", "Different project accounting methods affect the comparability of debt  coverage ratios: Some projects conduct financial accounting based on  the amount of cash received or paid during the period (referred to as  cash basis accounting), while other projects do so based on when  revenue is earned and when expenses are incurred, regardless of  when cash is received or paid (called accrual basis accounting).  These accounting differences can significantly affect the debt  coverage ratio. For example, a cash basis project may have cash on  hand to pay its debt obligations, but not enough to cover future  expenses that would have been recognized under an accrual project.  The specific accounting method used reflects each project\u2019s particular  business agreements, but the differences in accounting methods  reduce the comparability of the debt coverage ratios across the  projects.", "Moreover, as the program manager for all DOD housing, ASD (EI&E)  requested debt coverage ratio data across varying time frames for  required reports to Congress on privatized housing projects. Specifically,  ASD (EI&E) has alternated between requesting annual average debt  coverage ratio data and requesting data as of the end of the reporting  period, thus reducing the comparability of the data over time.

For example, we found that debt coverage ratios for a  single fiscal quarter can be significantly different from the ratio for the  same project for the full fiscal year. In some cases, a quarterly ratio  showed insufficient funds to continue operations and make required debt  payments, while the full-year ratio showed sufficient funds for that  purpose. Conversely, another project\u2019s ratios showed the single quarter  as having sufficient funds, but the full year as having insufficient funds.  ASD (EI&E) officials stated that data for previous reports were collected  by different staff in that office and that the current officials were not sure  why the time period for fiscal year 2015 data collection was different from  that of the other two fiscal years.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should use quality information and externally communicate  the necessary quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.  Information, among other things, should be complete and  understandable. This involves processing data into information and then  evaluating the processed information so that it is quality information. The  standards also state that management should obtain relevant data from  reliable sources, which provide data that are reasonably free from error  and faithfully represent what they purport to represent.", "However, in prior reports to Congress, ASD (EI&E) did not clarify the  differences in how debt coverage ratios were calculated, resulting in  information that lacked full context. Moreover, the information provided by  the military departments to ASD (EI&E) and to Congress to conduct their  oversight activities has not been consistent and comparable because  ASD (EI&E) has not revised its guidance on privatized housing to ensure  that data reported to Congress, such as data on debt coverage ratios, are  consistent in terms of time periods.

The Navy validates sustainment plans generated by the developers  managing its projects.

The Air Force then compares its analysis with that of  the developer. In most cases, according to Air Force officials, this  comparison has shown that the Air Force\u2019s estimates of sustainment  needs were greater than the developer\u2019s original estimates, which would  require additional sustainment funding beyond what the developer  estimated.", "Moreover, the military departments do not all use measures of future  sustainment for their internal portfolio-wide reports on privatized housing  projects.

This rating includes measures of  projected sustainment funding levels relative to projected needs,  among other measures.

For example, the  Air Force considered the Air Combat Command II project, which  comprises Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and Davis- Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, to have severely underfunded  planned maintenance funds and a projected inability to meet any  future needs for major renovations and rebuilds, due to lower-than- expected basic allowance for housing levels.", "DOD guidance states that because privatization creates a long-term  governmental interest in privatized housing, it is essential that projects be  attentively monitored. DOD has recognized that a lack of sustainment  funding can decrease the desirability of housing over time, thus reducing  occupancy and further jeopardizing financial stability. However, DOD has  not required the military departments to incorporate measures of future  sustainment into their assessments of privatized housing projects.  Measures of current financial condition, such as the ability to make debt  payments, do not necessarily indicate the ability of a project to fund its  sustainment accounts sufficiently to maintain housing quality in the future.

While the Army has a policy  that would allow individual projects to propose charging servicemembers  the out-of-pocket amount, subject to Army approval, the policy states that  the Army strongly prefers that projects not charge servicemembers.  According to Army officials, none of the projects had done so as of  August 2017. Further, according to privatized housing developers  representing Army projects, they have not proposed charging the out-of- pocket rate because doing so could result in a reduction in occupancy at  that project, as servicemembers would begin to look for other housing.  Unlike the Army, the Navy and Air Force do not have a policy that would  allow developers to charge the out-of-pocket amount. According to ASD  (EI&E), Navy and Air Force officials stated that their lack of policy is  based in large part on the fact that servicemembers from all three military  departments reside at nearly every installation, and that without having  written assurance that the other military departments will also charge the  out-of-pocket rate, the Air Force and Navy cannot agree to do so.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  management should analyze the identified risks to estimate their  significance, which provides a basis for responding to the risks, and  design responses to the analyzed risks so that risks are within the defined  risk tolerance for the defined objective.

Examples of these challenges include the following:", "Reductions in assigned personnel at installations have reduced  occupancy rates: Information from military department officials shows  that the loss of personnel assigned to an installation has reduced  occupancy at some projects. Reductions in assigned personnel can  occur at an installation because of large-scale troop reductions or the  inactivation of units. The decrease in occupancy at some projects has  led to revenue and cash flow challenges. For example, Army officials  noted that the occupancy rate dropped from about 95 percent to about  70 percent at the Fort Knox project in Kentucky in 2014 when a unit  was inactivated. This drop in occupancy resulted in challenges for the  privatized housing project because the number and type of housing  units originally built were determined on the basis of the unit\u2019s  remaining at the installation.", "Aging utility infrastructure has increased sustainment costs, resulting  in reduced cash flows for some projects: According to DOD and  officials representing the military departments, the costs of  maintaining infrastructure for utilities has reduced cash flows for some  projects. In some privatized housing agreements, the military  departments transferred responsibility for utility infrastructure to the  projects. According to DOD and military department officials, this  oversight and maintenance have been more costly than project  owners had expected. Air Force officials stated that aging utility  infrastructure is not something the projects are equipped to handle  because there is not enough revenue in their project structures to  cover the costs of maintaining the infrastructure. Air Force officials  said that they noticed the challenges related to transferring utility  infrastructure in the earlier projects and that they made a decision to  stop transferring infrastructure to developers in later projects.  Moreover, according to Air Force officials, some project owners are  now asking for the military departments to take back the  infrastructure. For example, the Air Force agreed to take back some  of the gas and electric infrastructure at the Air Force Academy project  in Colorado as part of a financial restructuring.", "Perceived disconnects between basic allowance for housing  calculations and market rates: Military department officials and  privatized housing developers perceive the Defense Travel  Management Office\u2019s basic allowance for housing calculations as  challenging because they believe that the calculations are  unpredictable and do not always reflect the realities of local markets.  Officials in each military department stated that the data used for the  calculations sometimes do not accurately reflect the local market  surrounding the project. For example, officials from the Navy\u2019s  Midwest project noted that the calculation for Millington, Tennessee\u2014 an area covered by the Midwest project\u2014was higher than that for the  Chicago area of the project in 2014\u2014an area that they felt should  have had the higher costs of the two. Additionally, according to  Army officials, basic allowance for housing rates fluctuate at certain  projects from year to year and do not reflect the local market. For  example, the average basic allowance for housing rate for Fort  Huachuca in Arizona dropped 11 percent from 2014 to 2015,  increased 4.6 percent in 2016, and dropped 9 percent in 2017. Army  officials stated that these fluctuations did not match rental costs in the  local market.", "Actual costs of utilities in some locations are not covered by the basic  allowance for housing utility rates: Officials representing two military  departments stated that the Defense Travel Management Office\u2019s  basic allowance for housing calculations do not accurately reflect the  actual costs of utilities. According to Army officials, the utility  component of the Defense Travel Management Office\u2019s calculations  does not cover the actual cost of utilities for project homes at some  locations. This difference can result when the surveys for utility costs  are from homes in the local community that are not comparable to  those on base. For example, in Fairbanks, Alaska\u2014where the  Army\u2019s Fort Wainwright/Greely project is located\u2014off-base homes get  the majority of their heat from wood stoves that report no cost element  to the surveys used by the Defense Travel Management Office. By  underreporting or not otherwise adjusting for these costs, according to  Army officials, the basic allowance for housing calculations fail to  account for the funds necessary to cover the costs of traditional,  metered utilities.", "Unexpected project expenses can reduce cash flows for some  projects: Officials representing two military departments stated that  unexpected expenses can be a challenge for some projects. These  expenses can occur because of unexpected events, such as weather  events, environmental damage, or unexpected litigation. For example,  the Navy\u2019s Mid-Atlantic project has experienced unexpected expenses  related to water intrusion and mold issues and the ensuing litigation,  causing fewer funds to flow to the project\u2019s sustainment accounts.  There are also expenses for snow removal, hurricanes, and flooding.  Navy officials stated that they did not anticipate a lot of sustainment  work in the first 5 to 10 years of the projects, but needs have arisen  due to these unexpected events. Additionally, according to information  from the Navy\u2019s New Orleans project in Louisiana, hurricane and  tropical storm damage may drain $1.5 million to $2 million from the  project\u2019s sustainment accounts every 3 to 4 years.", "Determining the amount DOD must budget for a project may affect  future expansions or changes to existing projects: Military department  officials also noted potential challenges with the way that the Office of  Management and Budget will be scoring future projects. Scoring  seeks to determine the cost that should be recognized and recorded  as an obligation of DOD for budgeting purposes at the time a contract  is signed. When the privatized housing initiative began, developers  sought private borrowing, knowing that only the government funding  would be scored because a 1997 Office of Management and Budget  memorandum established that private funds for the projects would not  be scored as government participation or activity. However,  according to a 2005 Office of Management and Budget memorandum,  as of September 30, 2010, new privatized housing projects and  expansions to existing projects using the limited liability or corporation  approach are subject to traditional scoring rules. These rules require  projects proposing the use of a purely private entity to be scored as a  private activity, and projects proposing the use of a co-owned limited  liability corporation to be scored as government activity. Some  military department and developer officials have expressed concern  with the uncertainties surrounding future scoring. Specifically, military  department officials and developers are concerned that the reversion  to traditional scoring will affect any plans for obtaining mid-term loans  and any potential expansions or other changes to existing projects.  Office of Management and Budget officials stated that any future  federal government contributions to privatized housing projects in the  form of direct loans or loan guarantees will be fully scored at the value  of the loan or loan guarantee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Privatized Housing Projects Have Various Options to Mitigate Financial Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Military department and developer officials have identified various options  to address financial challenges such as those previously discussed in this  report. These include actions to increase revenues, actions to reduce  expenses, and extraordinary measures to improve project financial  conditions. As the project manager, the developer may act unilaterally in  some cases, and other actions may require approval from the military  department, coordination with ASD (EI&E), or notification to the Office of  Management and Budget. Although these actions may improve a  project\u2019s financial condition, there are limitations, such as the potential to  reduce tenant satisfaction and therefore occupancy levels, or costs to the  government. The extent to which any of these options will be sufficient to  address a particular project\u2019s financial challenges depends on the degree  of the financial challenge and the effectiveness of the option. For  example, a project may seek to raise revenue by advertising to tenants to  increase occupancy, but the response may be insufficient. Likewise, a  project may engage in a financial restructuring to return the project to a  healthy financial footing, but ongoing low occupancy or unexpectedly high  expenses may continue to challenge the project financially."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Actions to Increase Revenue", "paragraphs": ["Developers and military departments cited several options for increasing  project revenues, including the following examples:  Renting to tenants other than active-duty servicemembers: The military  departments have the option to increase project revenues by allowing  projects to rent to tenants other than active-duty servicemembers. The  Navy and Air Force have policies that determine the priority ordering of  types of tenants to whom a project can rent. An Army official stated that  the Army does not have a department policy, but allows projects to rent to  tenants other than active-duty servicemembers based on project  agreements. For example, a project may offer to rent to tenant groups in  the following order: active-duty personnel, reserve-duty personnel, DOD  civilian employees, military retirees, and general public tenants. As of  June 2017, 33 of 35 Army privatized housing projects were renting to  tenants other than active-duty servicemembers; 14 of 16 Navy and  Marine Corps projects were renting to tenants other than active-duty  servicemembers; and 28 of 32 Air Force projects were renting to tenants  other than active-duty servicemembers. While renting to tenants other  than active-duty servicemembers can increase revenue, the usefulness of  this action is limited when a project is already operating at a high rate of  occupancy or when additional demand is limited.", "Other steps to increase occupancy: Developers can take other actions to  increase project occupancy, to include increased advertising, promotions,  or offering rent concessions. While these actions can increase  occupancy, advertising adds costs to project operations, and rent  concessions lower the per-unit revenue earned for the project. Figure 2  shows an advertisement by a privatized housing project seeking tenants  outside of Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia.", "Charging fees for services: Developers stated that they have considered  charging fees for services that had previously been provided free of  charge\u2014such as community center rentals and pet fees\u2014as another  means of increasing project revenue. However, a developer\u2019s ability to  charge fees varies based on project agreements and military department  policies. Developers also need to consider potentially negative effects on  tenant satisfaction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions to Reduce Expenses", "paragraphs": ["Developers and military departments cited several options for reducing  project expenses, including the following examples:  Reducing or eliminating services: Projects can reduce or eliminate project  services as a means of reducing operating expenses. Officials have taken  these steps at certain Army, Navy, and Air Force projects. For example,  Navy officials told us that the developer cut portions of the landscaping  program at the Navy\u2019s Midwest project in Illinois, Indiana, and Tennessee  and eliminated one 24-hour service desk at the Navy\u2019s Hampton Roads  Unaccompanied Housing project in Virginia in order to reduce  expenses. While these actions reduce operating expenses, providing  reduced or fewer services may make a project less marketable or  desirable to tenants and can lead to declines in tenant satisfaction and  occupancy.", "Deferring routine maintenance: In response to financial distress, projects  can curtail routine maintenance to realize savings. For example, when  Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada was facing cash flow challenges, officials  told us that the project curtailed its preventive maintenance program that  includes the inspection and repair of heating, ventilation, and air  conditioning systems; water heaters; plumbing and plumbing fixtures;  roofs; and carpeting. These expense-saving measures help operating  costs in the near term, but deferring maintenance can reduce the quality  of the housing, reduce tenant satisfaction, and increase expenses over  time by reducing the effective life of the items not being maintained.", "Delaying sustainment: Another option to reduce project expenses is to  delay certain sustainment actions. At the Army\u2019s Fort Knox project in  Kentucky, officials stated that the sustainment plan initially included the  demolition and rebuild of each unit or full renovation of historic units over  the 50-year project lease; however, they no longer project that there will  be funds to complete those improvements. Instead of full rebuilds,  officials stated that they expect to conduct piecemeal renovations. Over  time, deferred sustainment can lead to reduced housing quality, in turn  reducing occupancy levels and tenant satisfaction, and thereby reducing  project revenues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extraordinary Measures", "paragraphs": ["Developers and the military departments can also take various  extraordinary measures to improve the financial condition of a project.  Extraordinary measures are options that can alter project agreements or  project financial arrangements with the military department. These  options may require approval from the military department, coordination  with ASD (EI&E), or notification to the Office of Management and Budget.  Examples of such actions include the following:  Retaining and renting excess units: Projects can earn additional revenue  by retaining and renting units that were originally slated for demolition.  Some project plans included the transfer of existing housing units,  deemed in excess of project needs, to the developer with the intention of  demolishing them. For retaining and renting excess units to be an option,  a project must have some excess units slated for demolition and sufficient  demand for their rental.", "Reducing project scope: Projects may reduce the scope of planned work  to reduce potential expenditures or improve the project\u2019s financial state.  Reductions in scope may be in the form of the number of units to be built,  renovated, or demolished. For example, following the inactivation of a  brigade combat team at Fort Knox in Kentucky, the project made plans to  eliminate 280 units due to changes in servicemember housing needs from  when the project originally started construction.", "Deferring fees: Developers can defer project fees due to them, such as  fees for construction or management services, so that more funds are  available for other project needs. Developers agreed to defer fees for  several Navy and Air Force projects as a means to ensure adequate  funding for the completion of project construction. Projects can defer fees  to meet shortfalls in project funding, but the deferral can place additional  financial strain on a project, as funds later must be used to repay the  deferred fees.", "Making additional investment contributions: Developers can make  additional financial investments in the project to cover underfunded  project expenses. For example, Air Force officials stated that developers  have made additional financial investments at the Robins Air Force Base I  project in Georgia to ensure that the project had sufficient funds to make  debt payments. According to officials, the Air Force agreed to the  additional investment contributions on the basis that they be repaid from  any future excess cash flows.", "Returning assets: In some instances, project assets can cost the  developer more than anticipated due to the expenses necessary to  maintain the asset. To alleviate the resulting financial challenges, projects  can transfer ownership of the assets back to the military departments. For  example, the Air Force took back five historic units from the Robins II  project in Georgia that, according to officials, were not financially viable  within the project and that the Air Force wanted for purposes other than  housing. When assets are returned to a military department, the military  department may have to begin budgeting for their costs through its annual  budgeting process.", "Transferring assets: The military department can transfer assets to a  project that developers can sell to fund projects. For example, the Navy  transferred land and units to the Navy\u2019s Midwest project with the intention  that the developer would sell the land and units to supplement project  funding. Asset sales can be unreliable funding sources if assets sell for  less than the project expected.", "Financial restructurings: Military departments can seek to financially  restructure projects to improve their financial condition. This process  requires the military departments to renegotiate project agreements with  the developer to improve financial condition. For example, the Air Force  recently completed financial restructurings of the Nellis Air Force Base  project in Nevada and the Air Combat Command Group II project, which  comprises Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona and Holloman Air  Force Base in New Mexico. Air Force and developer officials stated that  the Nellis Air Force Base project began to have problems making debt  payments because of declines in basic allowance for housing payments  associated with falling local rental market prices. For Nellis, the Air Force  and the developer negotiated a financial restructuring whereby the Air  Force reduced the interest rate on the government\u2019s loan to the project  and extended the loan\u2019s maturity date. The Air Force also gave the  developer an additional portion of project profits. In exchange, the  developer agreed to forgive an outstanding balance of payments due to  them.", "An ASD (EI&E) official stated that financial restructuring agreements may  require notification to the Office of Management and Budget, which  scores changes to privatized military housing projects. Restructurings can  provide relief to projects that are facing imminent default or longer-term  sustainment funding shortfalls, but they can also add financial costs to the  military department. The ability to financially restructure also may be  limited by the willingness of the developer to give concessions during  negotiations and the ability to obtain the approvals necessary to complete  the restructure."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Defined When Project Changes Require Advance Notice or Defined Risk Tolerance Levels for Not Achieving Housing Goals", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not clearly defined in its policy the circumstances in which ASD  (EI&E), as the DOD-wide housing program manager, should receive  advance notice of changes to address financial challenges in privatized  military housing projects.

In addition, management  should obtain and internally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives, while communicating quality  information down and across reporting lines to enable personnel to  perform key roles. Moreover, the standards state that the oversight body  receives quality information that flows up from the reporting lines from  management and personnel that is necessary for effective oversight of  internal control. However, DOD\u2019s guidance does not clearly define the  types of project changes for which ASD (EI&E) requires prior notification  from the military departments, which could result in ASD (EI&E) not being  notified of project changes. ASD (EI&E) has draft guidance on oversight  and management of privatized military housing, which would define the  circumstances under which military departments should notify ASD  (EI&E) of project changes, but officials stated that they have not  established a time frame for issuing this policy. An ASD (EI&E) official  stated that the policy is being coordinated with the military departments,  and this has resulted in delays to its issuance.

For example, the projects are  frequently constructed on government land and they include government  financing in the form of direct investments or direct loans. However, the  military departments have not defined their risk tolerance levels for  privatized housing relative to the program\u2019s objective of providing quality  housing that reflects community living standards. Specifically, the Army  and Navy have not identified the level of risk they are willing to accept in  their ability to fund future sustainment. Army officials stated that the Army  is not responsible for taking any actions to restore a project\u2019s financial  condition. Navy officials stated that they do not use a risk model, and that  one is not required by DOD. The Air Force has not formally defined its  risk tolerance levels for future sustainment, but it has identified the  circumstances in which projected sustainment funding deficits will cause it  to take extraordinary measures\u2014specifically, to seek a financial  restructuring of the project. For example, if future planned maintenance is  funded at less than 85 percent of estimated needs within the next 5-year  period, the Air Force may seek a financial restructuring, according to Air  Force officials. Likewise, according to Air Force officials, if planned major  renovations and rebuilding are funded at below 30 percent of estimated  needs, the Air Force will seek a financial restructuring.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  agencies need to define risk tolerance relative to their program  objectives.

However, DOD  has not required the military departments to define their risk tolerances  regarding the future sustainability of the projects. ASD (EI&E) officials told  us that they are considering establishing parameters for risk tolerance for  the military departments, but have not yet done so. Officials also noted  that DOD had been focused on the initial development periods of the  privatized housing projects, whereas it is now shifting focus to  sustainment as the projects have moved from the initial development  stage. Given this focus on sustainment, if the military departments do not  define their risk tolerances regarding the future sustainability of their  privatized housing projects, they will lack a consistent basis on which to  determine when the risks to achieving their objectives require responses,  and the nature of those responses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s ability to maintain quality housing is critical, because housing can  affect retention, readiness, and servicemembers\u2019 quality of life. Since  Congress provided the department with authorities to do so, DOD has  worked with private developers to improve the quality of housing available  on military installations. The military departments regularly review the  financial condition of their privatized housing projects, but they calculate a  basic measure of current financial health\u2014the debt coverage ratio\u2014 differently among their projects, which limits the ability of ASD (EI&E),  and in turn Congress, to compare project financial health based on this  measure without additional information to give the data full context. DOD  has also previously reported such information for differing time periods in  different reports to Congress, further limiting the data\u2019s usefulness, and  has not issued revised guidance on privatized housing to help ensure  consistent reporting. The military departments also vary in the extent and  manner in which they oversee measures of future sustainment of their  privatized housing projects. DOD has not reported measures of future  sustainment to Congress, or issued a report on the financial condition of  privatized housing projects, since the report covering fiscal year 2014.  Without consistent and up-to-date information on the financial condition of  projects, DOD and Congress will not be able to conduct informed and  effective oversight of the projects.", "The military departments have identified the reductions in basic allowance  for housing as one of the various challenges affecting the financial  condition of privatized housing projects.

Without complete assessment of  the risks of the reductions in the basic allowance for housing on each  project, and developing any appropriate courses of action, DOD and the  military departments will not be able to know when to take action to  address deficits in the funding of long-term sustainment accounts that  could lead to diminishment in the quality of military housing. Additionally,  DOD and Congress will not be fully informed of the risks and possible  effects before making decisions that affect all of the privatized housing  projects\u2014such as approving any further reductions in the basic allowance  for housing.", "The military departments have various options for attempting to improve  the financial condition of their privatized housing projects, but some of  these options require prior notice to ASD (EI&E). The absence of clearly  defined requirements as to when this office should be notified of project  changes to address financial challenges has led to varied understandings  among the military departments about when notification should occur.  Without a clear identification of when ASD (EI&E) should be notified of  project changes, the military departments will not have consistent and  clear guidance as to when this office needs to be informed prior to an  action being taken by a military department regarding its privatized  housing projects, and thus, the oversight office may not be fully informed  on the projects it intends to oversee. In addition, DOD has not required  the military departments to define their tolerances for risk to the goal of  providing quality housing to servicemembers in line with community  standards, including its ability to fund future sustainment needs.
