Like most federal agencies, NNSA relies  on both federal employees and contractor personnel to carry out its  mission. NNSA spends a significant amount of its annual appropriations  on contracts, including support service contracts (SSC). SSCs are  typically multiple year contracts under which a contractor\u2019s personnel  perform functions in support of federal personnel. The contracts may  cover a broad range of activities, such as information technology support,  guard services, and food services.

However, we have previously found that the use of  contractors for many of the services categorized as professional and  management support increases the risk that contractors may  inappropriately influence the government\u2019s authority, control, and  accountability for decisions. Since 1990, we have designated DOE\u2019s  contract management\u2014which has included both contract administration  and project and program management\u2014as a high-risk area because  DOE\u2019s record of inadequate management and oversight of contractors left  the department vulnerable to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement.", "According to DOE\u2019s Office of Management, the use of SSCs can present  unique situations that require special diligence on the part of federal  employees to ensure that applicable statutes, regulations, and  management practices are followed. For example, under the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR), agencies are prohibited from using  contracts, including SSCs, for the performance of inherently  governmental functions. According to the FAR, inherently governmental  functions are those functions that are so intimately related to the public  interest as to mandate performance by a governmental employee.  Inherently governmental functions require discretion in applying  government authority or value judgments in making decisions for the  government; therefore, they must be performed by government  employees and not contractors. The FAR provides examples of inherently  governmental functions that include supervising federal employees,  determining agency policy, and drafting congressional testimony.", "NNSA presents information on its use of SSCs in its annual congressional  budget justification materials.

In December 2011, we found that while agencies increasingly  relied on contractors to provide professional and management support  services, agencies generally did not consider and mitigate risks of  acquiring such services, including the risk that contractors may  inappropriately influence the government\u2019s authority, control, and  accountability for inherently governmental decisions.", "Additionally, in September 2018, we found that contracts requiring  increased management attention, such as contracts for professional and  management support services, have posed contractor oversight  challenges for federal agencies. In that report, we found that there was  an increased risk that contractors may perform tasks reserved for the  government under contracts like those for management support services.  We also found that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) had  taken steps to help agencies reduce some of the risks associated with  contracts warranting increased management attention. For example, in  September 2011, OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy issued a  policy letter to executive agencies to provide guidance on managing the  performance of contractors performing work that is closely associated  with inherently governmental and critical functions. The letter directed  agencies to employ and train a sufficient number of qualified government  personnel to provide active and informed management and oversight of  contractors\u2019 performance where contracts have been awarded for  functions closely associated with the performance of inherently  governmental functions.", "The September 2011 policy letter also provided guidance intended to  clarify when governmental outsourcing for services is and is not  appropriate.

In addition, the policy letter calls for agencies to ensure that they  have sufficient internal capability to control their missions and operations  for managing critical functions.", "In 2013, NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Programs conducted an internal  review of its use of nonfederal personnel to accomplish its missions.  The study resulted in nine recommendations related to SSCs, including: developing policy on when to use each of the funding sources for  SSCs and policy and guidelines on roles and responsibilities for  federal employees; providing training for all NNSA employees on the proper use and  management of SSCs; and evaluating current practices for the appearance of inherently  governmental functions and terminating any inappropriate practices.", "As of July 2019, NNSA officials said the agency was working to finalize a  policy on when to use each of the funding sources for SSCs. To address  the recommendations on the two latter issues, NNSA developed training  and guidance documents intended to assist staff in managing and  working alongside contractors\u2019 staff. Specifically, with regard to training,  NNSA developed training for all NNSA\u2019s federal employees to ensure that  those employees understand the role of SSCs in the offices. This training  covers, among other things, appropriate behavior and activities for federal  staff who work alongside contractor personnel. With regard to guidance,  NNSA developed documents that explain appropriate interactions with  contractor personnel. For example, NNSA prepared a tip sheet for all staff  to assist with maintaining proper relationships with SSC personnel; the tip  sheet includes respecting the relationship between a contractor and its  employees. NNSA also developed a contracting guide in 2014 that  provides information on requirements, policies, and procedures, and that  covers contracts for different purposes, including SSCs. The guide also  includes descriptions of inherently governmental functions. In addition,  NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and Budget prepared a memorandum in  2014 for NNSA\u2019s program offices to clarify the process for approving the  funding source for SSCs.", "A July 2015 DOE Inspector General review of NNSA\u2019s use of SSCs also  found potential issues with the management of SSCs, particularly related  to contractors\u2019 performance of inherently governmental functions. For  example, the review found that half of the 20 contracts in its sample  included contracted services that approached being inherently  governmental. The Inspector General\u2019s review reiterated the  recommendations in the Office of Defense Programs\u2019 study and  recommended that NNSA track the corrective actions to respond to the  recommendations in that study to their completion.

These codes are arranged in five broad categories: (1) information  technology and telecommunications support; (2) environmental consulting  and legal support; (3) professional support; (4) administrative support;  and (5) management support. Within each category, there are codes for  specific activities, as well as a code for \u201cother\u201d support. For example,  within the administrative support category, there are specific codes for  word processing/typing, paper shredding, and transcription, and there is a  separate code for \u201cother\u201d administrative services that is for tasks that do  not fit within the other codes. According to several contracting officers and  CORs we interviewed, officials try to select the code that best addresses  all of the tasks included in the contract; however, most SSCs encompass  a variety of tasks, so contracting officers often select the \u201cother\u201d category.  Further, according to officials, if NNSA awards a task order under an  existing contract, the task order has the same product service code as  was assigned to the existing contract.", "As shown in figure 2, based on our analysis of FPDS-NG data, NNSA  used three of the 77 product service codes\u2014other professional services,  engineering and technical services, and other administrative services\u2014for  more than 80 percent of its obligations to SSCs in fiscal year 2018.", "Because the product service codes encompass a wide range of activities,  we reviewed the performance work statements for the 12 contracts in our  sample to gain a greater understanding of the types of activities these  codes may represent.

Similarly, the internal review by NNSA\u2019s  Cost Estimating and Program Evaluation office attributed the increase in  NNSA\u2019s use of SSCs since 2012 to an increase in appropriations through  the Weapons Activities account. According to an official from that office,  the increased appropriations were for additional work related to weapons  refurbishment and infrastructure modernization.", "Second, according to several NNSA officials, offices have increasingly  used SSCs because of a decline in federal FTEs. As figure 4 shows, the  number of NNSA\u2019s federal FTEs funded through the Federal Salaries and  Expenses account decreased from 1,897 in fiscal year 2010 to 1,608 in  fiscal year 2018, a decrease of 15 percent. According to an NNSA official,  this decline in federal FTEs is due, in part, to the annual statutory cap on  federal FTEs that was to be implemented by October 1, 2014.

From fiscal years 2013 through 2018, the number of  federal FTEs in offices that support programs funded through the Defense  Nuclear Nonproliferation appropriations account decreased, while those  that support programs funded through the Weapons Activities  appropriations account increased.

In contrast, the  number of federal FTEs in the Office of Defense Programs increased 4  percent during the time period. In general, the number of federal FTEs  supporting Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation activities has decreased,  while appropriations for that office\u2019s activities have remained consistent.  In contrast, appropriations for Weapons Activities account have increased  substantially, while the number of federal FTEs supporting those activities  has increased by about 1.5 percent.

Tasks included in the  performance work statements for SSCs vary widely and could present  unique risks for including inherently governmental functions. The purpose  of the determination form is to mitigate the risk of awarding an SSC that  includes inherently governmental functions.

However, these steps  may not allow NNSA to effectively manage the potential risks of  contractors performing inherently governmental functions throughout the  life of the contract. First, officials complete the required determination  forms prior to awarding an SSC, and NNSA does not take steps to ensure  that contracting officers document the steps that they plan to take to  oversee specific SSCs, including those the agency determined carry a  risk for the performance of inherently governmental functions. This is, in  part, because the determination form does not require the contracting  officers to include such information on the form.

Under  federal internal control standards, management should design control  activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, such as by  comparing actual performance to planned or expected results and  analyzing significant differences. By developing a process to verify that  the contracting officer has implemented the planned oversight steps for  SSCs that have a high risk of including inherently governmental functions  throughout the term of the contract, NNSA would have better assurance  that planned oversight was being carried out.

Collecting the information, as required by law, could provide Congress  and NNSA\u2019s own decision-makers with greater insight into how NNSA is  using its SSCs. Third, NNSA did not present the cost of its SSCs in terms  of obligations for 1 fiscal year. By reporting annual obligations data for  each SSC, NNSA could more accurately represent its annual budgetary  needs for the support needed to perform its missions. Fourth, NNSA did  not identify the specific appropriations accounts used to fund SSCs. By  identifying such accounts, NNSA would have more reasonable assurance  that Congress had insight into which programs the SSCs supported,  facilitating congressional oversight of NNSA\u2019s use of funds for SSCs by  account and assisting NNSA in workforce planning should Congress  reevaluate NNSA\u2019s FTE cap.", "Additionally, we identified two ways that NNSA could better manage the  potential risks of contractors performing inherently governmental  functions over the life of a contract. First, NNSA has not taken steps to  ensure that contracting officers document the steps that they plan to take  to oversee SSCs identified as at high risk of including inherently  governmental functions on the determination forms.", "Second, NNSA does not have a process to verify that contracting officers  are performing planned oversight for contracts that NNSA has identified  as more likely to have the potential of including inherently governmental  functions. By taking steps to document and verify that contracting officers  have implemented the planned oversight steps for SSCs that may include  inherently governmental functions throughout the term of the contract,  NNSA would have better assurance that planned oversight was being  carried out."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following six recommendations to NNSA:  The Associate Administrator for Acquisition and Project Management  should report information on all professional SSCs to which funds were  obligated during the fiscal year in its annual congressional budget  justification materials.

(Recommendation 2)", "The Associate Administrator for Acquisition and Project Management, in  coordination with NNSA\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, as  appropriate, should report annual obligations data by fiscal year, as part  of its reporting on SSCs in annual congressional budget justification  materials. (Recommendation 3)", "The Associate Administrator for Acquisition and Project Management  should report in NNSA\u2019s annual congressional budget justification  materials the program appropriations account\u2014Weapons Activities or  Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation\u2014used to fund each SSC and total the  amounts obligated by appropriations account. (Recommendation 4)", "The Associate Administrator for Acquisition and Project Management  should take steps to ensure that contracting officers document\u2014in the  required determination form or elsewhere in the contract file\u2014information  on the steps that the contracting officers plan to take to oversee SSCs  that NNSA has determined to be at high risk of including inherently  governmental functions.

In its  written comments, which are reproduced in full in appendix II, NNSA  generally agreed with the report\u2019s six recommendations and described  actions that it intends to take in response to them.", "With regard to the second recommendation to collect and report required  data on the number of full-time equivalent contractor personnel employed  under an SSC for more than 2 years, we recognize the difficulties in  collecting this information and appreciate that the agency intends to meet  with congressional staff to discuss ways to address this issue. We  continue to believe that collecting this information will provide NNSA and  congressional decision-makers with greater insight into how NNSA uses  its SSCs, including whether these SSCs display any of the characteristics  of personal services contracts.", "With regard to the fifth recommendation to take steps to ensure that  contracting officers document information on the steps the contracting  officers plan to take to oversee SSCs that are determined to be at high  risk of including inherently governmental functions, NNSA stated that it  considers the recommendation closed based on processes already in  place as well as the complementary activities discussed in response to  our sixth recommendation. We continue to believe that documenting  planned oversight activities in the contract files is important to ensure that  planned oversight is consistent throughout the duration of the contract,  particularly in light of OMB\u2019s call for agencies\u2019 ongoing review of the  functions performed by its contractors and the potential for contracting  officers to change over the life of the contract.", "The agency also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  into our report, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees, the Administrator of NNSA, and other interested parties.

For the  purposes of this report, we define professional SSCs to include contracts  for activities such as program management support, administrative  assistance, technical assistance, and engineering and technical services,  consistent with NNSA\u2019s definition of professional SSCs used to report the  required information in its annual congressional budget justification  materials. We excluded NNSA\u2019s Office of Naval Reactors from our  review because it is managed as a separate entity within NNSA.", "To address the first objective, we obtained and analyzed data on NNSA\u2019s  professional SSCs for fiscal years 2010 through 2018 from the Federal  Procurement Data System \u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG), including the  contract number, the amounts obligated to the contract in the fiscal year,  the funding source, and the product service code assigned to the  contract. We performed electronic testing of the data to identify missing  data, obvious errors, or outliers and reviewed documentation and  determined the data were sufficiently reliable to summarize the number of  SSCs, amounts obligated, funding sources, and product service codes for  NNSA\u2019s SSCs in fiscal years 2010 through 2018. Unless otherwise  specified, we report dollar figures as current dollars. In selected places,  we also report inflation-adjusted dollars that are in constant 2018 dollars  and were computed using a gross domestic product price deflator.", "To determine the kinds of tasks for which NNSA used its SSCs, we  reviewed performance work statements for a nongeneralizable sample of  12 contracts. We selected contracts from the 407 SSCs NNSA reported  in its annual congressional budget justification materials for fiscal years  2017 through 2019. We selected contracts that ranged in award amounts  and represented work performed for different NNSA offices. In addition, to  understand changes in NNSA\u2019s use of SSCs, we analyzed data on  NNSA\u2019s appropriations and the number of federal full-time equivalent  (FTE) employees for fiscal years 2010 through 2018. NNSA provided  data on FTEs as of the last day of the last pay period of each fiscal year.  We did not include federal FTE data by program office prior to fiscal year  2013 because NNSA restructured the organization, and the  organizational structure prior to 2013 was not comparable to the current  organization structure. We reviewed the data for obvious errors or outliers  and compared the federal FTE data to other sources and discussed the  data with officials and determined the data were sufficiently reliable to  show changes in the size of NNSA\u2019s work force over the time period.", "We also obtained and analyzed data by program office on the number of  FTE contractor personnel from fiscal years 2015 through 2018. According  to an NNSA official, NNSA did not collect data on FTE contractor  personnel prior to fiscal year 2015. We reviewed the data for obvious  errors or outliers and interviewed NNSA officials knowledgeable about the  process to collect the data and NNSA officials that completed an internal  study that, among other things, independently collected and verified the  number of FTE contractor personnel by program office. Although we  identified that NNSA did not report data on all of its SSCs, we determined  the data were sufficiently reliable to illustrate changes in the number of  FTE contractor personnel by program office for fiscal years 2015 through  2018. Further, to determine how NNSA uses its SSCs, we also reviewed  two NNSA workforce studies and interviewed agency officials in program  offices that used SSCs in fiscal years 2015 through 2018.", "To address the second objective, we compared the information on SSCs  in NNSA\u2019s annual congressional budget justification materials for fiscal  years 2017 through 2020 with the requirements in the NDAA for fiscal  years 2016 and 2017. We also reviewed documentation and interviewed  NNSA officials from the Office of Acquisition and Project Management to  determine how they prepared the information included in the annual  congressional budget justification materials. We compared NNSA\u2019s  process for reporting information on SSCs to DOE\u2019s information quality  guidelines, particularly the sections related to completeness and  usefulness of the information. Additionally, we compared the data on  SSCs included in NNSA\u2019s annual congressional budget justification  materials to data in FPDS-NG to determine whether NNSA included all of  its SSCs in the budget justification. To perform this analysis, we obtained  data from FPDS-NG on all of NNSA\u2019s active SSCs for fiscal years 2015  through 2018. We assessed the reliability for these data as described  previously.", "For each fiscal year, we included only the SSCs that met NNSA\u2019s  definition of professional SSCs using the 77 product service codes. We  also removed from the data any contracts listed that had $0 obligations or  negative obligations for the fiscal year. For the remaining contracts, we  compared the task order or contract numbers included in the FPDS-NG  data to the task order or contract numbers that NNSA reported in its  annual congressional budget justification materials. For those contracts  where there was not a match between the annual congressional budget  justification materials data and the FPDS-NG data on the task order or  contract number, we reviewed the data manually to ensure there was not  an error in the formula used or an error in the data that was easily  identifiable, such as a transposed or missing digit in the task order or  contract number. We discussed the list of contracts that was not included  in NNSA\u2019s annual congressional budget justification materials with  officials responsible for the reporting to determine why the contracts were  excluded.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed documents, such as  applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions and NNSA  policy documents, and interviewed officials from NNSA\u2019s Office of  Acquisition and Project Management, Office of Management and Budget,  and Office of General Counsel to determine how NNSA oversees its  SSCs. We also reviewed performance work statements for the  nongeneralizable sample of 12 contracts discussed above to identify  oversight activities and determine whether they included examples of  tasks that could have characteristics of inherently governmental  functions. We reviewed determination forms for eight of the 12 SSCs in  our sample for which NNSA could provide the forms. We also interviewed  NNSA\u2019s contracting officers or contracting officer\u2019s representatives and  representatives from 11 of the 12 contractors in our sample to learn how  NNSA and the contractors manage the contracts.
