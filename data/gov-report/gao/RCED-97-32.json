The volume of infrastructure assets is immense\u2014over 8 million lane-miles of highways; more than 576,000 bridges; and, for transit operations, nearly 130,000 vehicles, 7,439 miles of rail track, 2,271 rail stations, and 1,172 maintenance facilities. Management systems are tools that provide information to assist state and local decisionmakers in selecting cost-effective policies, programs, and projects to improve the efficiency and safety of the nation\u2019s infrastructure and protect the public\u2019s investment in it.", "In 1991, ISTEA required the states to develop and implement systems for managing (1) the pavement of federal-aid highways, (2) bridges on and off federal-aid highways, (3) highway safety, (4) traffic congestion, (5) public transportation facilities and equipment, and (6) intermodal transportation facilities and systems. Before this legislation, many states had begun developing some of these systems. Management systems for pavement, for example, were first developed in the late 1960s, and the concepts of bridge and highway safety management systems were introduced in the early 1980s. Very few states, however, had experience with congestion, public transportation facilities and equipment, and intermodal management systems before the ISTEA mandate.", "The legislation required DOT to, among other things, issue regulations for the states to develop and implement each system. The legislation also authorized DOT to withhold up to 10 percent of federal highway and transit funds, beginning in fiscal year 1996, from states that failed to implement the management systems. ISTEA called for the states to develop and implement the systems in cooperation with metropolitan planning organizations in urbanized areas and the affected agencies receiving assistance under the Federal Transit Act. In addition, to help ensure that large urban communities focus on congestion management and relief, ISTEA specifically required that the planning process in transportation management areas include a congestion management system.", "ISTEA required DOT to issue its regulations on management systems by December 18, 1992, one year after the date of enactment. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking for the management systems in June 1992, a proposed rule for the management systems in March 1993, and an interim final rule in December 1993. The interim rule included technical requirements and compliance schedules for each system and required the states to be implementing all systems beginning in fiscal year 1995. Table 1 provides a general description of each of the six management systems, as defined by DOT.", "DOT received over 200 sets of comments\u2014primarily from state transportation departments and metropolitan planning organizations\u2014on the proposed and interim rules. Many of the comments on the interim rule expressed concerns that (1) the data requirements would be too burdensome; (2) the rule was too prescriptive, not allowing states enough flexibility to tailor the systems to their individual circumstances; and (3) the time frames for compliance were too short. However, despite their concerns, many commenters supported the concept of management systems.", "Because of concerns such as those described above, the Congress reconsidered the mandate for management systems. In 1995, the NHS Act made the six management systems optional for the states and prohibited the Secretary of Transportation from withholding funds from the states that elected not to implement the systems. The act did not affect the provisions for congestion management systems in transportation management areas.

Two states\u2014Wyoming and South Carolina\u2014decided to implement only three systems. Wyoming was going forward with the pavement, bridge, and safety management systems; South Carolina reported it was developing or implementing the pavement, bridge, and congestion management systems. South Carolina, however, planned to develop a safety management system beginning in fiscal year 1997.", "As shown in figure 2, nearly all states reported they were developing and implementing a pavement management system, a bridge management system, a safety management system, and a congestion management system. Pavement and bridge management systems may be easier for the states to develop and implement than other management systems because many states had established inventories or a form of management system for these assets before ISTEA. Similarly, the states have had experience with establishing systematic approaches to resolving highway safety problems since the mid-1960s. Most states were developing and implementing congestion management systems, which continue to be required in transportation management areas. Congestion management systems were being developed by state or local agencies for all transportation management areas. Moreover, several states that did not have transportation management areas were developing this system. About two-thirds of the states reported they were developing and implementing the public transportation management system and the intermodal management system. According to transportation officials, fewer states may be proceeding with these two systems because (1) the systems are newer and the states are less familiar with them and (2) the states generally lack jurisdiction over the assets covered in these systems.

When ISTEA was enacted, these states already had certain transportation management systems (see figure 3). To meet the mandate and DOT\u2019s interim rule, these states needed to enhance their existing management systems and develop some new ones. New York, for example, had existing management systems for pavement, bridges, safety, congestion, and public transportation. To meet the new requirements, the state began developing an intermodal management system with separate components for passengers and freight and began modifying the other systems. For example, the state expanded its public transportation inventory from buses and bus-related items to include bus facilities and was developing a condition-rating system and performance measures for these assets. Michigan, on the other hand, had only a pavement management system and a bridge inventory; it had to modify these systems, adding pavement condition information, such as ride quality, to the pavement management system and adding analytical capabilities to its bridge inventory.

Among our case-study states, Michigan was the only one that decided to implement the six management systems with no change in scope to the plans it had developed on the basis of DOT\u2019s interim rule. Michigan transportation officials viewed the management systems as an opportunity to improve decision-making and as a way to address other departmental objectives.", "The other six states scaled back their coverage of certain systems. For example, ISTEA required the states to incorporate all federal-aid highways, which included some roads under local jurisdiction, in their pavement management systems. After the NHS Act made the systems optional, five of the states we reviewed\u2014Maryland, Montana, New York, Oregon, and Texas\u2014decided to include only state-maintained roads and the National Highway System in their pavement management system, at least initially. New York intends to include all federal-aid highways by 1998. North Carolina scaled back the coverage of its pavement management system to include state-maintained roads and only those portions of the National Highway System maintained by the state. Our case-study states also scaled back the coverage of other systems, to varying degrees, after the passage of the NHS Act. For example, North Carolina and Texas decided that their congestion management systems would cover only their transportation management areas. In earlier plans for their congestion management systems, both states had intended to have statewide coverage.", "Finally, Maryland, North Carolina, and Texas decided to discontinue certain management systems once they were no longer mandatory. North Carolina decided not to develop the intermodal management system; Texas and Maryland decided not to implement the public transportation and intermodal management systems.

Officials in these five states found ISTEA\u2019s and DOT\u2019s initial time frames unrealistic and replaced them with more accurate estimates for completing the initial work on the management systems. This work has often entailed hiring staff or consultants to develop new systems or enhance the existing ones. In addition, implementing the systems has involved training staff and inspectors on new software and, in states with a decentralized transportation department, delivering the systems to regions or districts within the state. Before ISTEA, Montana\u2019s pavement management system, for example, provided information to decisionmakers that was often outdated by 3 to 4 years. To meet ISTEA\u2019s and DOT\u2019s requirements for a pavement management system, state officials determined that improvements to the existing process were needed. The state hired a consulting firm to develop and implement a state-of-the-art system that could be tailored to the state\u2019s needs and also hired additional staff so that pavement inspections could be conducted each year. The system is expected to be delivered to district offices for their use in conducting pavement inspections within 1-1/2 years.

In addition, some states have realized that to obtain the most uses from the systems, they need to be integrated with one another so that, for example, users can combine information from several systems to analyze the overall transportation needs in a geographic area. Integration raises additional, cross-cutting issues\u2014such as establishing common data definitions\u2014beyond those that arise in developing individual systems.

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials surveyed its membership in May 1996 and found that all 37 states that responded intended to integrate the systems within their planning processes. With respect to our seven case-study states, each was using or intended to use the management systems in its planning process. For example, North Carolina\u2019s transportation department used a ranked list of pavement projects from its pavement management system in developing its 7-year transportation improvement program. Maryland\u2019s transportation department has used its congestion management system to analyze four highly congested highway corridors in the Baltimore-Annapolis-Washington, D.C., areas. Applying the state\u2019s congestion management process, transportation planners (1) evaluated the current level of congestion (using performance measures such as the time spent in delays), (2) identified strategies to reduce the congestion (such as improved traffic signal coordination, additional bus service, and new high-occupancy-vehicle lanes), and (3) projected levels of congestion in the year 2010 under the different strategies. The corridor studies were used in developing Maryland\u2019s long-range transportation plans.", "Transportation officials from our seven case-study states also were using or planned to use information from the management systems in making decisions involving day-to-day activities. For example, in North Carolina, state and county maintenance engineers use information on pavement condition from the pavement management system to determine maintenance needs and priorities. Similarly, district offices in Texas use the pavement management system to identify preventive maintenance and rehabilitation projects, to distribute funding within the districts, and to evaluate the condition of pavements after maintenance or rehabilitation.", "In January 1995, the Management Systems Integration Committee was established by several states to assist states and local agencies in using outputs from the transportation management systems in their decision-making processes. The committee\u2014consisting of several state, metropolitan planning organization, and FHWA representatives\u2014was established with financial and technical support from FHWA. The committee has identified four general components in decision-making\u2014long-range planning, short-range planning, program implementation/daily decisions, and evaluation of implemented actions\u2014that can involve or benefit from management system information. It identifies best practices and offers recommendations to the states on how information from management systems can assist in making these decisions.

For example, in Montana, the developers of the pavement management system believed that their existing system\u2014a database of pavement condition surveys\u2014was not widely used or efficient. As a result, they developed a comprehensive marketing plan to expand the use of the new system. They identified potential users of the system within Montana\u2019s transportation department (such as engineering, planning, construction, and maintenance departments) as well as others (such as FHWA, metropolitan planning organizations, and counties). To achieve greater use of the pavement management system, they\u2014among other things\u2014planned to hold one-on-one meetings with prospective users, hire a consultant to train users, and provide necessary technical support. Their goals were to (1) have the system operational by the end of 1997, (2) expand the use of the system by state districts within 2-1/2 years, and (3) have the system recognized as an integral part of the statewide transportation management system within 5 years.", "Other states were also exploring ways to increase the uses of their management systems. In Oregon, for example, the systems\u2019 developers were preparing a users\u2019 guide. In New York, the systems\u2019 developers had prepared slide presentations of their systems, which they were using as a tool to market their systems to upper management, regions, metropolitan planning organizations, and counties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Integration of Systems Is Important to Their Usefulness but Poses Technical and Procedural Problems", "paragraphs": ["Some states that we reviewed planned to use the management systems as stand-alone tools to assist decisionmakers in their respective departments. Other states also planned to use or are using the systems in an integrated/coordinated manner, such as using the output from one system as input to another system. For example, in New York, safety evaluations suggested that resurfacing pavement with high-friction asphalt will reduce wet-weather accident rates by 50 percent at locations with high accident rates. Therefore, New York now matches the locations that are identified by the pavement management system as needing resurfacing with the locations identified by the safety management system as having a high number of wet-weather accidents to develop a list of projects that address both considerations.", "DOT\u2019s interim rule called for the states to integrate the management systems in terms of sharing common data and coordinating the outputs of the systems so that they provide timely information for use in developing transportation plans and programs. Although system integration is no longer required since the NHS Act made the systems optional, at least 26 states planned to integrate parts of their management systems, according to a May 1996 survey by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. Coordination and integration of the systems helps to eliminate duplication by identifying common features and data elements and enhances the usefulness of the systems by enabling decisionmakers to compare trade-offs at a program level or among transportation modes. In addition, the Management Systems Integration Committee takes the position that integration among the systems will provide decisionmakers with higher-quality information at less cost.", "Among the states that we reviewed, Michigan, Oregon, New York, and Texas were actively pursuing the integration of their systems in various ways. Michigan, for example, was redesigning all of its data and placing them into a single integrated database for use by the six management systems as well as a maintenance management system that is being developed to identify nonconstruction activities to extend the lives of pavement and structures. Oregon, on the other hand, had a pilot project that was beginning to address integration issues as the individual systems were being developed. The pilot had identified 70 to 80 data elements that were shared by two or more systems and will use this information to develop a common geographically based database. Texas and New York were developing geographical information systems that will provide a basis for integrating information among systems.", "Integrating the management systems raises numerous issues, such as establishing common definitions for data and common geographical referencing systems. To handle these issues, Michigan, New York, and Oregon have established special committees and dedicated resources beyond those that are needed to develop and implement the individual systems. For instance, New York has established an executive steering committee and working groups to oversee the administrative and technical coordination and integration of the systems. Oregon has dedicated full-time staff to a pilot project to identify and resolve such issues as establishing common definitions for shared data elements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Variety of Factors Has Influenced Implementation of Management Systems", "paragraphs": ["Several factors have affected the states\u2019 development and implementation of the transportation management systems, including (1) the high-level support and top priority that the systems received after they were mandated and (2) the potential benefits expected to accrue from the systems.

For instance, in New York we were told that the mandate provided a \u201cjump start\u201d to the overall development and implementation of the systems. This effort became one of the state transportation department\u2019s top priorities. The state provided additional resources and technical support for enhancing the pavement, bridge, congestion, safety, and public transportation management systems and for developing an intermodal management system. State transportation officials met with an assistant commissioner on a monthly basis, and an executive steering committee oversaw the efforts to implement the systems. Officials from Michigan\u2019s transportation department also stated that the mandate served as a catalyst and provided the state with an opportunity to enhance what they had already begun. Before ISTEA, the state had started a pavement management system and used the mandate to begin developing the other systems. In addition, the state appointed a steering committee to oversee the systems\u2019 development and integration. Montana transportation officials told us that the mandate provided the push they needed to develop a better pavement management system.", "Although implementation of the management systems is now optional, many states see the potential benefits associated with the systems and have continued supporting their further development and implementation. First, several states commented that the systems reduce redundancy and provide more complete, accurate information in one location. For instance, Missouri\u2019s transportation department views the systems as providing \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d for decisionmakers, as compared with the current method of gathering information from several different sources, which often takes several weeks.", "Second, states view the management systems as a way to improve the planning process by providing objective, timely information to decisionmakers. For example, a Colorado state transportation official stated that in the past, decisions were often made without much data and analysis and that management systems are now providing better information on which to base decisions. New York transportation department officials believe that the management systems are a mechanism to better manage the transportation system and can be tailored to the state\u2019s decision-making environment. Montana transportation officials told us that the management systems provide the state with a better idea of the budgetary and economic impacts of various transportation decisions.", "Finally, many states found that in developing several systems, benefits accrued from forging new relationships and improving coordination and cooperation within and outside of their state transportation departments. A February 1996 Transportation Research Board survey of the states found that over half of the respondents indicated that the safety management process \u201copened new and increased lines of communication\u201d among various organizations. We found similar results with our case-study states. For instance, in New York, representatives from 45 agencies or groups now participate on a technical advisory committee. We were told that the safety management system process brought together traditional and nontraditional safety-related agencies to improve highway safety. For example, as a result of input from motorcyclists, the state recently modified its policy on sealing pavement cracks. The state now fills cracks flush with the pavement surfaces rather than applying heavy layers of crack-sealing materials. Similarly, North Carolina, Oregon, and Florida believe that their safety and/or congestion management systems have facilitated lasting and valuable interagency coordination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Removal of Mandate and Lack of Clear Federal Guidance Hindered Systems\u2019 Implementation in Several States", "paragraphs": ["In several states, the removal in 1995 of the ISTEA mandate lessened support for the development and implementation of transportation management systems and resulted in some systems\u2019 being dropped. For instance, several Florida transportation officials told us that there was substantial initial support for developing and implementing the systems not only because of the federal mandate but also because Florida law calls for the development and implementation of the six management systems. However, since the NHS Act made the implementation of the systems optional in 1995, support for the systems has lessened. Florida is still going forward with all six systems but has scaled back on their scope and has extended some implementation time frames. In Colorado, the lack of a mandate has decreased the level of support for implementing all but the pavement and bridge management systems.", "Some states reported that DOT\u2019s failure to issue a clear and timely rule following the enactment of ISTEA on developing and implementing the management systems has caused difficulties, particularly in terms of the congestion, public transportation, and/or intermodal management systems. Although pavement and bridge management systems have been around for several decades, the other systems mandated by ISTEA were new to many states\u2014thus prompting concern and uncertainty about how to implement them. Some states commented that DOT\u2019s interim rule was untimely and did not clearly specify what was expected of them. For instance, Maryland state officials noted that the concept of an intermodal management system was not clearly spelled out in either ISTEA or the interim rule. Maryland has chosen not to implement an intermodal management system. Some states also waited for the rule before developing some systems. For example, Montana transportation officials told us that the lack of a rule made the development of the systems risky for the state. The state officials wanted to make sure they were headed in the right direction before moving forward.", "Several states also indicated that they had received little or no assistance from FTA on implementing the public transportation management system. For instance, an Oregon transportation department official told us that the department had not received any guidance or assistance from FTA clarifying the interim rule, providing examples of a public transportation management system, or sponsoring workshops/training classes. Officials in other states told us that it had not been communicated to them that FTA had a role to play in providing assistance. A North Carolina state official told us that, while the state had received assistance from FTA on developing the public transportation management system, the assistance was limited. We were told that by the time FTA clarified what was expected of the states, many states had hired consultants or gone forward on their own. Montana, Oregon, and Texas hired the same consultant to assist them in complying with the interim rule\u2019s requirements for congestion, public transportation, and/or intermodal management systems. Oregon has since decided to scale back on the congestion management system, while Texas has opted out of the public transportation and intermodal management systems. Montana is implementing these systems according to the interim rule.", "FTA officials told us that they had, in fact, provided assistance on implementing public transportation management systems by issuing\u2014jointly with FHWA\u2014guidance on the systems in July and December 1994, cosponsoring several training classes in 1994 and 1995, and helping guide the development of the Transportation Research Board\u2019s Guidelines for Development of Public Transportation Facilities and Equipment Management Systems in 1995. In addition, in September 1995, FTA issued an enhanced version of its National Transit Analysis Tool software, which included a menu of management system data. According to FTA officials, the states\u2019 perception that the agency was not helpful in developing their systems is due largely to the fact that FTA has traditionally been oriented toward metropolitan areas rather than toward states and, consequently, does not understand states\u2019 needs very well. In addition, FTA does not have the staff, resources, and presence at the state level that FHWA has. FHWA, for example, has a division office for each state, while FTA has regional offices encompassing a number of states.

Specifically, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials believes that FHWA can do a great deal to help support the development and implementation of the management systems.", "Our case-study states indicated that FHWA generally met their needs by providing assistance in understanding the requirements of ISTEA and the interim rule. For instance, FHWA has (1) developed a catalog of pavement management software, (2) developed a video to introduce the states to safety management systems, (3) produced newsletters on congestion and intermodal management systems, (4) sponsored conferences and workshops on various systems, and (5) offered courses on the management systems (cosponsored with FTA through FHWA\u2019s training office\u2014the National Highway Institute). However, all seven states told us that they now need additional technical assistance\u2014such as technical conferences and workshops\u2014from FHWA that focuses on different areas, such as developing and implementing software, explaining geographic information systems technology, establishing performance measures for systems, and integrating the management systems.

Although FTA has provided assistance on implementing the public transportation management system, it has not adequately communicated the availability of this assistance to the states.

Unlike other management systems that have begun in recent years, pavement management systems were started two decades ago. By the end of the 1980s, more than half of the states were developing or implementing such systems. In 1989, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) issued a rule requiring all states to have a pavement management system that would cover the rural arterial and urban principal arterial routes under the states\u2019 jurisdiction; the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) expanded the scope to include all federal-aid highways. The Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) interim rule on management systems issued in 1993 required a pavement management system to cover all federal-aid highways, except those that were federally owned, and include three components: (1) data collection and management, (2) analyses, and (3) updates. The components under data collection include an inventory of physical pavement features; a history of construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance; condition surveys that include ride, roughness, and pavement distress; information on traffic volumes and vehicle types; and a compilation of this information into a database. The second component includes (1) network-level analysis that estimates the total costs of present and projected conditions and (2) project-level analysis that determines investment strategies, including a ranked list of recommended projects. The final component is an annual evaluation of the pavement management system, with updates as necessary.", "Because most states had had a pavement management system in place for a number of years, they used the ISTEA mandate to enhance what they already had. However, enhancing such a system still poses several challenges for the states. Most states do not have a complete project history (i.e., preventive maintenance, rehabilitation, and reconstruction data) for the National Highway System. Maintenance information is the weakest link. Many states have recently developed a file in the pavement management system for preventive maintenance activities. In cases for which it is impractical to resurrect the pavement\u2019s history because of time, labor, and cost, the states are now beginning to track the project\u2019s history. Other system enhancements could include developing a relational database and a multiyear list of projects that are justifiable and cost-effective, measuring the structural carrying capacity of pavement at the network level, and determining the remaining service life of various pavement sections. The states are using pavement management systems to help manage their pavement networks. Pennsylvania issues an annual state-of-the-interstate report that uses data on pavement condition and roughness and traffic counts to analyze the current and projected rehabilitation needs of the state\u2019s interstate system. Similarly, Maine\u2019s management system identifies deficient roadway sections; predicts deterioration; assesses current and future capital, preservation, and maintenance needs; and determines the consequences of various funding levels on all highways under the state\u2019s jurisdiction. Finally, Nevada\u2019s management system was developed to quantify the backlog of pavement repairs on the state highway network, identify project priorities, and monitor the state\u2019s progress toward eliminating the backlog of pavement work. The state also uses its management system to identify the long-range funding needed to maintain the highway network at a serviceable level.", "There is little or no uniformity among the states in the way they measure, collect, and report pavement condition. Because the states have been developing their pavement management systems independently, no two are the same. As of September 1996, all states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico were developing a pavement management system, but only six states were including all federal-aid highways\u2014including roads under local jurisdiction\u2014as originally called for in ISTEA.

In addition, prior to ISTEA, some states were already developing or using this management system. Nonetheless, many states face challenges in implementing the system. For example, although some of the data used in a bridge management system is already collected for the National Bridge Inventory, the analytic components of the system may require more detailed data on the condition of bridge elements (i.e., girders, bearings, columns, pier caps, decks, or joints) than are required for the national inventory. As a result, the states may face additional work (1) to update their bridge inventories with the new data on bridge elements and (2) to train bridge inspectors to conduct element-level inspections. In addition, a 1996 study found that few state departments of transportation have adequate data on which to base cost estimates for maintenance and repair actions needed for their bridge management systems, few states monitor actual expenditures in order to validate their cost estimates, and many states have no organizational mechanism or systems in place to uncover and solve problems in cost estimation.

The system was to be designed to be comprehensive, meaning that it should incorporate a combination of all safety elements (human, vehicle, and roadway). Formalized coordination and communication mechanisms among safety organizations were to be established to ensure cooperation and efficiency. Furthermore, the states were required to consider and include projects and programs identified by the safety management system in their highway safety plans and in their enforcement plans for their motor carrier safety assistance programs.

The most frequently mentioned positive outcomes include increased communication; improved coordination and cooperation; increased awareness of safety needs; and improved crash data collection, entry, and reporting.

In 1989, we reported that half of all urban interstate roads operate under congested conditions. FHWA estimates that congestion in the nation\u2019s 50 most populous urban areas costs over $39 billion a year in time and fuel wasted. Financial and environmental constraints limit the ability of the state and local governments to provide extensive new road capacity to reduce congestion. As a result, some of this congestion will have to be handled by better management and increased use of public transit. Congestion management systems are designed to address the problem of traffic congestion by providing a systematic process for obtaining information on transportation systems\u2019 performance and identifying alternatives for alleviating congestion and enhancing the mobility of both people and goods. In addition to requiring the states to develop congestion management systems, ISTEA specifically required transportation management areas to include congestion management systems in their transportation planning processes. ISTEA also placed restrictions on those transportation management areas classified as nonattainment areas for ozone or carbon monoxide under the Clean Air Act. These nonattainment areas may not program federal funds for any highway project that will result in a significant increase in single-occupant-vehicle capacity unless the project is part of an approved congestion management system.", "Under DOT\u2019s interim rule on management systems, the components of congestion management systems were to include (1) performance measures that define the extent of congestion and permit the evaluation of alternatives for reducing congestion; (2) data collection and system monitoring to identify the duration and magnitude of congestion and evaluate the effectiveness of actions to reduce congestion; (3) the identification and evaluation of strategies for more efficiently using current and future transportation systems; (4) implementation of strategies; and (5) evaluations of the effectiveness of implemented strategies. Among other things, a congestion management system was also to identify all transportation corridors and facilities with existing or potential recurring congestion and consider strategies that reduce single-occupant-vehicle travel. Although the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995 made implementation of this and other management systems optional for the states, it did not affect the provisions for transportation management areas to develop congestion management systems.", "As with other transportation management systems, implementing a congestion management system will be a challenge. First, states may experience difficulties in developing performance measures and obtaining the necessary information to support these measures. According to FHWA, several types of performance measures may be applicable to a congestion management system, including measures of congestion, mobility, accessibility (e.g., the ease or difficulty in accessing such areas as hospitals or shopping centers), and the system\u2019s efficiency. Although some measures, such as those based on traffic volume, have been traditionally used and are relatively easy to develop, others, such as those related to mobility (e.g., travel time, speed, and person-miles traveled) are more difficult and costly to develop, and the state of the art is not well advanced for these mobility measures. Second, the states may encounter difficulties trying to compare transportation projects across modes. This comparison will be important in developing strategies to reduce or control congestion. We reported in October 1993 on the need for better tools for making comparisons of transportation projects and indicated that such comparisons are critical for identifying the right mix of projects, regardless of mode, to address such problems as congestion and air pollution. Information from FHWA indicates that there continue to be significant problems and costs associated with developing measures that are sensitive to transportation choices and the impact of decisions among transportation modes.", "As of September 1996, 46 states and Puerto Rico were implementing a congestion management system.

Recognizing the largely urban nature of congestion, 17 states and Puerto Rico were developing the system only in transportation management areas, and another 5 states (California, New Mexico, North and South Dakota, and Virginia) were including these areas, if applicable, as well as other urban areas. Most of the remaining states that were implementing a congestion management system reported that the systems will have statewide coverage. Four states and Washington, D.C., do not plan to implement this system. Of the four states not implementing a congestion management system, two states (Vermont and Wyoming) have no transportation management areas.Although Arkansas reported that it was not implementing this system, the metropolitan planning organization for the Little Rock-North Little Rock area is developing a congestion management system. In addition, the state plans to monitor future traffic growth and potential areas of congestion.

Historically, the transportation planning process has been oriented more toward highways and mass transit than toward intermodal issues. As a result, FHWA and others have noted that planning tools and data sources on intermodal transportation and freight forecasting have not been well developed. FHWA and others have also noted potential difficulties in developing performance measures for this management system. FHWA has noted that current measures of mobility are largely geared toward the condition of a facility (e.g., vehicle capacity on highway segments) and traditional measures of congestion, such as volume and capacity, and not toward the mobility of people and goods or accessibility to facilities. Furthermore, it may be difficult to obtain data on intermodal transportation movements, particularly freight traffic flows.
