During the same period, Customs annually reserved from 75 to 87 percent of its reported CFP receivables in an allowance for uncollectible accounts. The primary reason for the growth in Customs' reported uncollected CFP debt from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000 was the bankruptcy of a Customs broker in fiscal year 2000. The broker's bankruptcy resulted in Customs assessing 422 claims for $566 million and recording CFP receivables totaling $484 million during fiscal years 1999 and 2000. The remaining $82 million of assessed amounts was eliminated through the CFP mitigation process, and accordingly these amounts were not recorded as receivables. Customs can strengthen some of its CFP debt collection policies and procedures both by enhancing them and better adhering to them. The Office of Management and Budget stated that it had broad oversight responsibility for monitoring and evaluating governmentwide debt collection activities, but that it is the specific responsibility of the agency's office of inspector general to provide oversight through audits of the agency's debt collection activities. In addition, the Financial Management Service (FMS) officials stated that they rely on agencies to determine what debt should be referred to FMS for collection and offset as required by the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996, and Customs refers certain delinquent CFP debts to FMS for collection action."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we review selected federal  agencies\u2019 management and collection practices related to civil fines and  penalties (CFP) debt.

Our purpose in selecting  these claims was to perform a walk-through to confirm our understanding  of Customs\u2019 processes for managing and collecting CFP debt.

We  sorted the population of CFP claims into four groups: Group 1 included 2,469 CFP claims for which Customs stopped collection  activities during fiscal years 1999 and 2000 and wrote off the receivable  amounts totaling approximately $41 million.  In addition, we included in  group 1 the 173 CFP claims, totaling approximately $28 million, that were  written off during fiscal year 1998, since this was the largest amount  written off from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2000.  From these 2,642  CFP claims, we selected all claims involving write-offs of receivable  amounts greater than $1 million.  The receivable total for the 8 selected  claims in this group equaled about $47 million, or just over two-thirds of the  $68 million written off during the 3-year period.  We used these 8 claims to  test various attributes of Customs\u2019 processes for collecting CFP claims at  each of the applicable FP&F offices.", "Group 2 consisted of 32,675 CFP claims for which Customs represented  that collection actions were not necessary or appropriate and had not been  performed.  According to Customs\u2019 records, these claims, totaling about $4  billion, or 57 percent of the total dollar value of the entire population,  involved cases in which (1) Customs decided that the alleged violation did  not occur, (2) there was insufficient probable cause to support an alleged  violation, (3) substantial mitigating factors caused Customs to decide to  remit (forgive) the penalty in full without payment of any mitigated  amount, or (4) system input errors occurred, typically resulting in  cancellation of the original case and its replacement with a new case.  We  statistically selected 36 claims from group 2 to confirm that Customs had  not performed any collection actions for the reasons noted above.  We did  not include any of the claims from this group in our population to be  selected for testing, since no collection actions were taken and the claims  were therefore outside the scope of our audit.", "Group 3 consisted of 2,052 CFP claims involving various violation codes  for which amounts were partially collected or the claims were closed  without payment.  These claims totaled about $36 million, or less than 1  percent of the total dollar value of the entire population.

We sorted the population of CFP claims in this group  into and performed certain steps for the following five strata:  Stratum 1 consisted of individual claims with a receivable amount  greater than $2.5 million.  The receivable total for the 33 claims in this  stratum was about $2 billion, or 68 percent of the receivable total for the  entire 147,702 claims in group 4.

These claims totaled about $406 million, or 14 percent of the dollar value  of the 147,702 claims in group 4.  We sorted these claims by FP&F office  and selected the four offices that managed the highest number of CFP  claims during fiscal years 1999 and 2000.

Customs assesses duties, taxes, and fees on  goods brought into the United States from foreign countries.  During fiscal  year 2000, Customs reported $22.9 billion in collections of duties, taxes,  and fees.  Part of Customs\u2019 collections consists of CFP, which are assessed  when Customs determines that an importer violated trade and importation  laws and regulations that Customs is responsible for enforcing.", "Fines and liquidated damages arise from importer/brokers\u2019 violations of  Customs\u2019 bond agreements or trade laws and regulations (e.g., late filing or  nonfiling of entry summaries).  Penalties arise from violations of the  federal laws and regulations governing the import and export of goods  (e.g., commercial fraud, gross negligence, negligence, and customs broker  and recordkeeping penalties).  These laws and regulations contain  guidelines for establishing the amount of fines and penalties to be assessed.   Customs regulations establish guidelines and criteria for negotiation or  mitigation to a lower fine or penalty amount to settle the case.  Also,  Customs regulations allow the violator and/or surety a period in which to  file petitions challenging the fine or penalty amount assessed.", "Initial assessments are typically at the maximum amount provided for by  law and vary according to type of violation.  For example, the CFP-assessed  amount for a violation under Commercial Fraud, Gross Negligence, and  Negligence Penalties (19 U.S.C. 1592) ranges from a minimum of two times  the loss of revenue for negligence to an amount not to exceed the domestic  value of merchandise for fraud.", "For fiscal year 2000, Customs reported about $119 million in CFP debt  collections and approximately $25.4 million of CFP debts that were written  off.  As of September 30, 2000, Customs reported about 7,180 outstanding  CFP debts that represented about $773.6 million in gross receivables.   Customs reduced this gross amount by about $36.4 million to adjust for  validity and designated $675.7 million as uncollectible, resulting in a net  receivable balance of about $61.5 million.", "In 1993, we reported that Customs did not effectively manage its collection  process to prevent or minimize delinquent receivables.  Factors that  increased the likelihood of delinquent receivables included delays in  finalizing amounts owed, poor monitoring of bond coverage, and delayed  processing of protested bills.  We also reported on the disparity between  Customs\u2019 gross receivables and the amounts expected to be collected.  We  noted during this review that Customs\u2019 assessment and mitigation  processes continued to be primarily responsible for the significant  reductions in the recorded CFP receivable amounts compared to the  amounts it expected to be collected.", "For the 4-year period covering fiscal years 1997 through 2000, Customs  reported the following CFP receivables activity:  $9.3 billion of recorded CFP assessments,  $8.4 billion of recorded adjustments to reduce the originally recorded  CFP assessments to reflect the postmitigation amounts that Customs  collected or intended to collect,  $257.0 million of CFP receivables balances that were collected, and  $74.5 million of CFP receivables that were written off from balances that  had typically been adjusted downward to the postmitigation amounts  that Customs intended to collect.", "The initially assessed amount for a CFP claim should not be viewed as the  actual postmitigation CFP receivable amount that Customs is likely to  pursue for collection from importers.  Certain Customs\u2019 processes and  practices typically result in significant reductions to initially assessed CFP  amounts before or after a receivable is recorded.  Customs records a CFP  receivable once it determines that it has a legal right to the claim, which  may or may not be the initial assessed amount of the CFP.", "Once a CFP claim is closed by either (1) payment, (2) termination of  collection activity and write-off of a postmitigated CFP amount, or (3)  cancellation of the debt, Customs records an adjustment to its CFP  receivables that is equal to the difference between the original amount  recorded as a receivable and the postmitigation amount that Customs  intends to collect.  Customs\u2019 processes that often result in significant  reductions to the initially assessed amounts or subsequently recorded  receivables are Option 1, mitigation through a petition for relief or an offer  in compromise, or cancellation of the CFP debt.", "Option 1.  When Customs knows all the facts concerning an alleged  violation at the time of the initial review and the harm to the government is  readily quantifiable and understood, an Option 1 resolution may be  possible.  Option 1 can be described as a \u201cparking ticket\u201d approach.  It  involves payment of a preset amount, which eliminates the mitigation  process and allows quick claim settlement.  Specifically, Customs\u2019 penalty  notice to a violator includes (1) a CFP amount assessed in accordance with  a Customs-related statute or regulation for the particular violation, which  the violator is given an opportunity to petition for mitigation, and (2) a  lesser, or Option 1, amount that the violator can accept in settlement of the  case.  The most common types of claims that can be resolved through  Option 1 are those related to filing late paperwork (late filing of an entry  summary, invoice, or other entry document).  An Option 1 resolution  generally results in a significant reduction of the amount initially assessed.", "Petition for Relief.  A person who receives a notice of violation from  Customs has 60 days to file a petition for relief or pay the amount initially  assessed.  Customs is not to establish a receivable until the petition period  expires or until it reaches agreement on the amount of the CFP claim with a  violator that has filed a petition.  Customs may also accept a petition after  the petition period expires.", "Petitioners may be granted mitigation for a number of reasons, including  contributory Customs error, extraordinary cooperation with the  investigation, immediate remedial actions, inexperience in importing, and  prior good record.  Mitigation of initial assessments may be substantial.   For example, we reviewed a CFP claim involving delivery of restricted  merchandise without Customs approval for which the violator was  assessed $500,000.  The violator filed a petition that explained that a  clerical error had been made on the entry form.  Based on the facts of the  case and the additional information in the petition, Customs granted  mitigation and reduced the amount of the claim to $250.  In turn, Customs  recorded a receivable amount of $250 and subsequently collected that  amount.", "Offer in Compromise.  An alleged violator may make an offer in  compromise to settle a CFP claim at any time after the violation.  Customs  has specific authority under 19 U.S.C. 1617 and 19 CFR 161.5 to  compromise claims, and Customs bases its decisions on whether to  compromise claims on many factors, including, but not limited to, the  following:  (1) risk that the government may not recover a significant  portion of the assessed amount if the claim is litigated and (2) the alleged  violator\u2019s financial inability to pay the initially assessed amount or the  amount established through the petition for relief.  The compromises  generally result in significant reductions of the amounts initially assessed.", "An example of an offer in compromise that reduced an initial CFP  assessment is a case in which Customs claimed gross negligence.  Customs  alleged that an importer made false statements and omitted costs such as  development costs and royalty payments associated with video game  cartridges.  Customs issued a penalty notice to the alleged violator in the  amount of $90,376 (four times the lost revenue of $22,594).  The importer  made an offer in compromise, proposing the payment of the lost revenue  and a penalty of $2,295 in monthly installments with interest at 8 percent  per annum.  After Customs\u2019 Regulatory Audit Division concluded that the  importer might not be able to pay the full amount of CFP assessed,  Customs accepted an offer in compromise of $28,543, which included  interest of $3,654.", "Cancellation of a CFP Debt.  After an initiating officer (discoverer of the  alleged violation) makes a CFP assessment and the claim is forwarded to  an FP&F office, the FP&F officer or other deciding official can decide to  cancel a CFP debt and close the claim without attempting to collect any  amount.  The majority of cases closed without collection (canceled) in  accordance with law and Customs guidance are closed for one of the  following reasons:  The penalty case is remitted in full without payment.  The FP&F officer  determines that a violation occurred, but the presence of substantial  mitigating factors causes the officer to remit the penalty in full.  The  discretion to remit in full is provided in Customs\u2019 mitigation guidelines  and is based on a finding that a violation resulted from circumstances  beyond the control of the violator or that the violator is without  culpability.", "The automated record is canceled when there is an error in the input of  a case into SEACATS that cannot be corrected by the case initiator.  The  canceled SEACATS record is usually replaced with a new case.", "The case is closed because there was no violation.  The FP&F officer or  other deciding official determines that the alleged violation did not  occur or there was insufficient probable cause to support an alleged  violation.  According to a Customs official, such determinations occur  because the receivables are recorded by the initiating officer who is  responsible for sending notices to alleged violators before the cases are  forwarded to the FP&F offices for review.  After a notice is sent and a  case is forwarded to an FP&F office, the deciding official determines  whether the alleged violation occurred or can be sufficiently supported.   In addition, the Customs official stated that when case initiators are  determining whether a violation occurred, they often do not have the  benefit of additional documentation and information presented with  petitions for relief.  Moreover, additional documentation is often only  obtained through the course of discovery if a case goes to litigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Broker\u2019s Bankruptcy Is the Primary Reason for the Increase in Uncollected Customs CFP Debt", "paragraphs": ["Customs\u2019 gross CFP receivables increased by about $556 million from the  beginning of fiscal year 1997 to the end of fiscal year 2000.  According to  Customs officials, claims resulting from the bankruptcy of a Customs  broker, who handled a significant amount of import business on the U.S.- Canadian border, were primarily responsible for the increase in CFP  receivables during the 4-year period.  Such claims represented about 87  percent of the increase.  Customs identified 422 CFP claims against  importers associated with this broker and, in most cases, recorded the  initial CFP assessments as CFP receivables.  At the time of the bankruptcy  in June 1999, Customs had not received entry filing summaries, payments  of estimated duties, or both from numerous importers who had previously  relied on the broker to handle such activities on their behalf.", "According to Customs officials, the bankruptcy of this broker was a unique  situation for Customs, but it provides a clear illustration of the significant  adjustments that can result from Customs\u2019 assessment and mitigation  processes.  During fiscal years 1999 and 2000, Customs assessed numerous  importers a total of about $566 million of CFP relating to the bankruptcy of  the broker and recorded CFP receivables totaling about $484 million for  these 422 claims.  Customs records indicated that the remaining $82 million  of assessed amounts was mitigated and thus these amounts were not  recorded as CFP receivables.  Postmitigated CFP amounts were nominal,  consistent with Customs\u2019 guidance.  As of September 30, 2000, almost all of  these receivables remained uncollected, and about $481 million had been  recorded in a reserve account as amounts deemed uncollectible.  The  uncollected CFP receivables arising from the bankruptcy represented  about 66 percent of Customs\u2019 total reported gross CFP receivables and  about 72 percent of Customs\u2019 allowance for uncollectible CFP accounts as  of that date.  As of June 2001, Customs reported that 237 of the 422 CFP  claims had been closed and that the outstanding related receivable balance  was about $268.3 million.", "According to Customs officials, in examining the available entry records  for each of the 422 alleged violations that resulted from the broker going  out of business, Customs initially assessed each claim at the value of the  affected merchandise or, in the case of restricted merchandise, up to  three times the value of the merchandise when the value of the  merchandise was known.  If the value of the relevant merchandise was not  known, Customs assessed each claim at $2.5 million, the amount of the  bond posted by the broker.  According to a Customs official, Customs\u2019  assessment process and the Option 1 and mitigation processes generally  resulted in Customs collecting considerably less than the CFP amounts  initially assessed for the claims related to the bankruptcy of the broker.", "As discussed earlier, Customs\u2019 guidance includes a range of mitigation  amounts for each type of violation, as well as the authority to modify the  assessed amount based on the particular facts and circumstances of any  case.  Customs based its mitigated CFP amounts for these claims on the  CFP amounts suggested in its guidance for the late filing of an entry  summary-\u2013$100 to $200-\u2013and gave consideration to the fact that the late  paperwork resulting from the broker going out of business was out of the  importers\u2019 control.", "As of September 30, 2000, Customs\u2019 records showed collections of $19,792  on 129 of the 422 CFP claims associated with the bankrupt broker.   According to a Customs official, 5 of the 129 CFP claims totaling about  $6,500 involved carnet violations in which the merchandise was not  destroyed or exported.  The assessments for these claims were collected in  full.  The other 124 CFP claims, which totaled about $67 million in  assessed amounts, were mitigated, and the total remaining CFP receivable  amount of about $13,200 was collected.  The $19,792 collected on these 129  claims was relatively small because postmitigated CFP amounts were  nominal, consistent with Customs\u2019 guidance.  At the end of fiscal year 2000,  293 claims remained open, of which the entire CFP receivable amount, net  of the $2.5 million surety bond amount, was reserved in the allowance for  uncollectible accounts.", "As of June 30, 2001, Customs\u2019 records showed that 185 of the 422 CFP  claims still remained open, meaning that from October 1, 2000, through  June 30, 2001, Customs closed 108 CFP claims.", "Forty-seven of the 108 CFP claims were closed without collections because  of errors.  Customs attributed these errors to the broker going out of  business and the unique efforts required by Customs to identify and assess  CFP for all of the entries resulting from this bankruptcy.  These closed CFP  claims, representing a total assessed value of about $80.3 million, were  canceled without any collections for the following reasons:  Eighteen claims, valued at about $7.8 million, were subsequently  deemed invalid because no violation occurred.  Customs subsequently  found entry summaries that were not entered into its Automated  Commercial System (ACS) timely.", "Twenty-nine claims, valued at about $72.5 million, were subsequently  deemed invalid and not violations because they were duplicates of  already existing claims.", "Five of the 108 closed CFP claims, valued at $12.5 million, were reissued  under new case numbers for fiscal year 2001 because the type of violation  was incorrectly identified when the CFP was initially assessed.  For each of  the 5 cases, Customs closed the initial CFP claim and established a new  claim that reflected the correct type of violation.", "The remaining 56 of the 108 CFP claims were closed for the following  reasons after collections were made by Customs:  Fifty of the 56 CFP debts were reclassified from violations for not filing  entry summaries to violations for filing late entry summaries, once the  importer subsequently filed the entry summary.  In addition, according  to a Customs official, the debts involved duty-free merchandise and  each claim was subsequently reduced to a nominal amount in  accordance with Customs\u2019 mitigation guidance.  Each claim was closed  after the violator paid a postmitigation amount of $50, resulting in a total  amount collected of $2,500.  Before mitigation, the total assessed  amount on these 50 CFP debts was $125 million.", "Six of the 56 CFP debts, initially assessed at a total of about $128,000,  reflected a receivable amount of $700 of which a total of $450 was  collected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist for Strengthening Customs\u2019 CFP Debt Collection Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Customs can strengthen its CFP debt collection and might improve its  collection efforts by enhancing and better adhering to existing policies and  procedures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Enhancing CFP Debt Collection Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["We found several CFP policies and procedures that can be strengthened  through enhancements.

Customs has designated the U.S. Council for International Business as the  issuing and guaranteeing association in the United States for carnets.  If the  1-year period covered by a carnet expires and the covered merchandise has  not been exported or destroyed, a CFP claim arises.  Establishing a CFP  claim is time critical because, under Customs guidance, Customs may not  make a CFP claim against the council more than 1 year after the expiration  of a carnet.  For properly established claims, the council must pay the  claim unless it furnishes Customs with proof within 6 months of the date of  the claim period that the merchandise was returned, exported, or  destroyed.", "During our review, we found that Customs does not always obtain  documentary evidence that the council received CFP claims related to  carnets within the 1-year period.  As stated in Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government, all transactions and other significant  events need to be clearly documented, and documentation should be  readily available.  For the eight CFP claims we reviewed involving  carnets, we found that Customs did not maintain the necessary  documentation.  Customs had records indicating that the CFP claims were  issued within the required 1-year period.  However, Customs could not  prove that the council received the CFP claims within the required 1-year  period and did not have evidence that it contacted the council as a follow- up to the issuance of the CFP claim within the 1-year period.  The contact  helps ensure that CFP claims were received by the council or enable  Customs to provide a copy of the claim before the 1-year period expires.

Customs stated that the council alleged it  did not receive violation notices for these claims within the 1-year period  and therefore has declined to pay the claims.  Customs also stated that  since it could not prove that the council received the notices within the  required 1-year time frame, collections would be minimal on these claims.", "Customs officials instituted a process in fiscal year 2000 requiring that  notices of carnet violations be sent by registered mail so that Customs  would have proof of the council\u2019s receipt of the notices.  In February 2002,  Customs stated that the outstanding CFP claims involving carnet violations  were canceled without payment.  Without documentation to prove that the  council received these claims, Customs determined there was a reasonable  likelihood that the port office did not issue them timely.

In one case, Customs originally  stated that it attempted to obtain waivers of the statute of limitations from  three sureties after the dissolution of the importer and the completion of its  investigation, which was 4 years later.  Only one surety granted a waiver,  and the statute of limitations expired without any collections from the  other two sureties.  In the other case, Customs stated that it had filed a  complaint with the Court of International Trade to prevent the expiration of  the statute of limitations.

For these cases, Customs was unable to  collect original duties that totaled about $74,000 and CFP that totaled about  $136,000.

The statute of limitations for the entries filed in  the first 3 of the 7 years under this CFP claim had expired.  In this  nonstatistically selected CFP fraud case, Customs assessed $21 million of  CFP against an importer for allegedly using false invoices to undervalue  entries.  While engaged in settlement talks with Customs, the importer  made distributions totaling about $6 million to its two principal  stakeholders.  Before the expiration of the statute of limitations for the  remaining 4 years of entries, Customs was granted a waiver and  subsequently accepted an offer in compromise to settle the CFP claim for  $700,000, consisting of $688,025 to cover the amount of the duties owed to  Customs and $11,975 of the $21 million assessed CFP.  Other factors that  contributed to Customs\u2019 acceptance of this offer in compromise were its  determination that (1) the corporation was unable to pay the CFP debt  after $6 million was distributed to stockholders and (2) Customs might not  be able to hold the principals personally liable for the debt.", "In general, Customs paralegals cited both a lack of a tracking system and  human error for the poor tracking of the statute of limitations\u2019 expiration  dates.

These entries involved fraud violations where the  importer allegedly undervalued the entries in an effort to avoid paying  duties.  Customs issued the penalty notice on April 6, 2000, at the value of  the merchandise, which was about $20.1 million.  The investigation relating  to this claim occurred from 1995 through 1998, but the proceedings did not  commence until March 2000.

During the Likas proceedings, another  significant issue arose: Has Customs defined a conditional release period  for the FDA context?  The government essentially argued that the  conditional release period automatically began when Customs delivered  articles subject to FDA approval to the importer.  The surety argued that  Customs had never by regulation defined a conditional release period in the  FDA context.

We have revised the report to clarify Customs\u2019 policy regarding when to  request a waiver. 4. We fully considered the previous comments provided.  We revised the  discussion of the two CFP claims to focus on the issue of timeliness for  requesting waivers of the statute of limitations.  We augmented our  discussion in the report related to the two cases for which Customs did  not timely request waivers of the statute of limitations and lost  opportunities for further collections. 5. Our discussion regarding eight high-dollar CFP claims that were  written off during fiscal years 1998 through 2000 focused on four cases  in which the expiration of the statute of limitations and Customs\u2019  decision to terminate collection activity were the primary reasons for  the write-off of the CFP debts.  We did not discuss the three cases that  involved penalties related to seizures of foreign-owned conveyances  used to smuggle narcotics that were seized, forfeited, and sold.  For the  four cases discussed in this report, the expiration of the statute of  limitations was one of Customs\u2019 cited reasons for deeming the debts  uncollectible and legally without merit, which led to writing off the  debts.  Even though we cited Customs\u2019 reason for these determinations  as the violators either subsequently filing for bankruptcy or going out of  business, we also identified lengthy collection efforts where Customs\u2019  investigations, petition process, and information gathering and review  prior to decisions on the petitions or referral took several years.  6. We agree that the expiration of the statute of limitations was not in  jeopardy as it related to the entries for the last 4 of the 7 years for this  case.  However, our report focused on the expiration of the statute of  limitations on the entries filed in the first 3 of the 7 years under the CFP  claim.  We also believe it was important to note that Customs only  collected $11,975 of the $21 million CFP assessment when it accepted  the offer in compromise and that $6 million was distributed to two  principal stockholders during Customs\u2019 collection efforts on this CFP  claim.  We moved this case from the section that discusses instances  where the approaching expiration of the statute of limitations was a  contributing factor in Customs\u2019 acceptance of lower mitigation  amounts for CFP claims to the section that discusses instances in  which the statute of limitations expired. 7. We reviewed and considered the information that Customs provided to  us regarding our preliminary findings.  For the two cases for which  Customs asserts the penalty notices were issued on the same day as the  case records were input into SEACATS, we were not provided adequate  documentation to support the assertion. 8. We have revised the report to reduce the number of exceptions from 17  to 16.  Since penalty notices should not be issued for cases involving  penalties related to the seizure of counterfeit trademark infringing  merchandise, we removed this case from the reported exceptions.  It  should be noted that during our fieldwork and subsequent follow-up  after our exit meeting, we had several discussions and were provided  additional explanations and documentation on this issue.  However,  until Customs\u2019 written response to the draft report, Customs had not  indicated that the Los Angeles case that was reported 456 days late  should not have been included. 9. As our report states, we found that in 25 of 100 claims involving  petitions, Customs did not comply with its requirement to respond  within 90 days of receipt of the petition.  We estimated that for 22.3  percent of open and 26.6 percent of closed CFP claims managed by the  four selected FP&F offices, Customs did not respond to the petitions  within the 90-day period.  We do not believe such results demonstrate  only inadvertent noncompliance with the 90-day requirement.   However, we have revised the report to clarify that Customs did not  consistently respond to petitions within 90 days of receipt. 10. While Customs\u2019 records indicated that it did not respond to petitions by  importers until after 90 days for all 29 cases, Customs stated it had an  informal process to extend the 90-day period for the number of days the  petitions were outside of the FP&F office.  In its response to a draft of  this report, Customs informed us that the Commissioner formalized  this process on January 21, 2002, in Customs\u2019 Seized Asset  Management and Enforcement Procedures Handbook.  Customs  subsequently provided us the four case numbers and documentation to  support (1) the number of days the cases were out of the FP&F offices  and (2) that Customs responded within the 90-day period, in  accordance with its informal process that was finalized in January 2002.   The four cases included the Los Angeles case that involved an FDA  refusal of admission.  As a result, we revised the report to reflect that  Customs did not respond to petitions by importers until after 90 days  for 25 cases. 11. We have modified the report to focus on the effect on the reduction in  CFP collections that may have resulted from delays in responding to  violators that filed petitions for relief.  As industry statistics show, the  likelihood of recovering amounts owed decreases dramatically as the  age of the delinquency increases.  12. We clearly stated that Customs did not consistently issue redelivery  notices to importers and that each of the selected cases reviewed  occurred prior to when Customs established its new guidance in fiscal  year 1999.  We also pointed out that Customs is currently addressing the  one outstanding legal issue that resulted from the lawsuits and  settlement.  In fact, our recommendation only addresses the need for  Customs to expeditiously establish a conditional release period."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Mario Artesiano, Rathi Bose, Sharon Byrd, Richard Cambosos, Perry  Datwyler, Mickie Gray, David Grindstaff, Marshall Hamlett, Fred Jimenez,  Eric John, Laurie King, Victoria Lin, Jon Ling, John Lord, Mel Mench,  Suzanne Murphy, and Maria Stortz made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to  support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve  the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American  people.
