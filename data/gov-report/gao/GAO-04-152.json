Outbreaks of anthrax infection were concentrated in six locations, or epicenters, in the country. An examination of the public health response to the anthrax incidents provides an important opportunity to apply lessons learned from that experience to enhance the nation's preparedness for bioterrorism. Because of its interest in bioterrorism preparedness, Congress asked GAO to review the public health response to the anthrax incidents. Specifically, GAO determined (1) what was learned from the experience that could help improve public health preparedness at the local and state levels and (2) what was learned that could help improve public health preparedness at the federal level and what steps have been taken to make those improvements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Local and state public health officials in the epicenters of the anthrax incidents identified strengths in their responses as well as areas for improvement. These officials said that although their preexisting planning efforts, exercises, and previous experience in responding to emergencies had helped promote a rapid and coordinated response, problems arose because they had not fully anticipated the extent of coordination needed among responders and they did not have all the necessary agreements in place to put the plans into operation rapidly. Officials also reported that communication among response agencies was generally effective but public health officials had difficulty reaching clinicians to provide them with guidance. In addition, local and state officials reported that the capacity of the public health workforce and clinical laboratories was strained and that their responses would have been difficult to sustain if the incidents had been more extensive. Officials identified three general lessons for public health preparedness: the benefits of planning and experience; the importance of effective communication, both among responders and with the general public; and the importance of a strong public health infrastructure to serve as the foundation for responses to bioterrorism or other public health emergencies. The experience of responding to the anthrax incidents showed aspects of federal preparedness that could be improved. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was challenged to both meet heavy resource demands from local and state officials and coordinate the federal public health response in the face of the rapidly unfolding incidents. CDC has said that it was effective in its more traditional capacity of supporting local response efforts but was not fully prepared to manage the federal public health response. CDC experienced difficulty in managing the voluminous amount of information coming into the agency and in communicating with public health officials, the media, and the public. In addition to straining CDC's resources, the anthrax incidents highlighted both shortcomings in the clinical tools available for responding to anthrax, such as vaccines and drugs, and a lack of training for clinicians in how to recognize and respond to anthrax. CDC has taken steps to implement some improvements. These include creating the Office of Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response within the Office of the Director, creating an emergency operations center, enhancing the agency's communication infrastructure, and developing databases of information and expertise on the biological agents considered likely to be used in a terrorist attack. CDC has also been working with other federal agencies and private organizations to develop better clinical tools and increase training for medical care professionals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the fall of 2001, letters containing anthrax spores were mailed to news  media personnel and congressional officials, leading to the first cases of  anthrax infection related to an intentional release of anthrax in the United States. Outbreaks of the disease were concentrated in six locations, or  epicenters, in the country\u2014Florida; New York; New Jersey; Capitol Hill in  Washington, D.C.; the Washington, D.C., regional area, which includes  Maryland and Virginia; and Connecticut\u2014where individuals came into  contact with spores from the contaminated letters. The anthrax incidents  caused illness in 22 people, 11 with the cutaneous (skin) form of the  disease and 11 with the inhalational (respiratory) form. Five people died,  all from inhalational anthrax. The anthrax incidents and the illness and  deaths they caused also had an impact on the country beyond the six  epicenters. Across the nation, even in areas far removed from the  epicenters, residents brought samples of suspicious powders to officials  for testing and worried about the safety of their daily mail.", "The public health response to the anthrax incidents was complicated by several factors. The incidents occurred in the turbulent period following  the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, when the focus of the nation  was centered on response to those events. In addition, the anthrax  incidents were unprecedented. The response was coordinated by the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), primarily through its  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and CDC had never  responded simultaneously to multiple disease outbreaks caused by the  intentional release of an infectious agent. Anthrax was virtually unknown  in clinical practice, and many clinicians did not have a good understanding  of how to diagnose and treat it. As a result, public health officials at the  federal, state, and local levels were basing their actions and  recommendations to government officials, other responders, and the  public on information that was changing rapidly. The response to the  incidents has been characterized by several public officials, academics,  and other commentators as problematic and an indication that the country  was unprepared for a bioterrorist event.", "An examination of the response to the anthrax incidents provides an  important opportunity to apply lessons learned from that experience to  enhance the nation\u2019s preparedness for bioterrorism and other public  health emergencies. Because of your interest in bioterrorism  preparedness, you asked us to review the public health response to the  anthrax incidents. Specifically, you asked us to determine (1) what was  learned from the experience that could help improve public health  preparedness for bioterrorism at the local and state levels and (2) what  was learned that could help improve public health preparedness for  bioterrorism at the federal level and what steps have been taken to make  those improvements.", "In studying the response of local and state public health departments, we  interviewed officials from the six epicenters. For a previous report, we  had conducted interviews about bioterrorism preparedness with officials  from seven cities and their respective state capitals. These interviews were  conducted from December 2001 through March 2002, and we used  information from these interviews to examine the public health response  to the anthrax incidents in localities that were not epicenters. To study  federal public health efforts, we interviewed officials from the Department  of Defense (DOD) and HHS. These officials included representatives from  DOD\u2019s Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Chemical Biological Incident  Response Force, Naval Medical Research Center, and U.S. Army Medical  Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and from HHS\u2019s  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), CDC, Food and  Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Office  of the Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness. To  determine the nature of the information provided by CDC during the  incidents, we examined the materials that CDC disseminated during  October 2001 through December 2001. For overall assessments of and  information on the local, state, and federal public health response, we  interviewed members of the academic community and officials of private  organizations representing groups affected by the incidents or involved in  the response, including the American Hospital Association, the American  Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, the American  Postal Workers Union, the American Public Health Association, and the  District of Columbia Hospital Association. We also reviewed media reports  of the incidents from television news services and newspapers,  retrospective analyses of the response published after the incidents,  relevant congressional hearings that were held between October 2001 and  December 2001, and materials provided to us by local, state, and federal  agencies and private organizations involved in responding to the attack. To  understand the scientific community\u2019s analysis of the anthrax incidents,  we searched the scientific literature using the National Library of  Medicine\u2019s PubMed service and reviewed relevant articles. To determine  what was learned from the experience that could help improve public  health preparedness for bioterrorism, we analyzed these materials for  common themes. We focused on what could be learned from the anthrax  incidents that could help improve public health preparedness not  specifically for anthrax or any particular locality but for bioterrorism in  general. To determine what steps have been taken to make those  improvements, we reviewed materials from relevant federal agencies  through October 2003. Although efforts to decontaminate affected  facilities are part of the public health response, they are outside the scope  of this report, as is the criminal investigation associated with the  incidents. We conducted our work from May 2003 through October 2003  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Anthrax", "paragraphs": ["Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-forming  bacterium called Bacillus anthracis. The bacterium is commonly found in  the soil, and its spores can remain dormant for many years. Although  anthrax can infect humans, it occurs most commonly in plant-eating  animals. Human anthrax infections have usually resulted from  occupational exposure to infected animals or contaminated animal  products, such as wool, hides, or hair. Both human and animal anthrax  infections are rare in the United States.", "Anthrax infection can take one of three forms: cutaneous, usually through  a cut or an abrasion; gastrointestinal, usually by ingesting undercooked  contaminated meat; or inhalational, by breathing airborne anthrax spores  into the lungs. After the spores enter the body through any of these routes,  they germinate into bacteria, which then multiply and secrete toxins that  can produce local swelling and tissue death. The symptoms are different  for each form and usually occur within 7 days of exposure. Depending on  the extent of exposure and its form, a person can be exposed to Bacillus  anthracis without developing an infection. There are several methods for  detecting anthrax spores or the disease itself, for example, nasal swabs for  exposure to spores, blood tests for infections, and wet swabs for  environmental contamination. CDC does not recommend the use of the  nasal swab test to determine whether an individual should be treated,  primarily because a negative result (no spores detected) does not exclude  the possibility of exposure. Confirmation of anthrax infection or the  presence of anthrax spores can require more than one type of test. The  disease can be treated with a variety of antimicrobial medications and is  not contagious. With proper treatment, fatalities are rare for cutaneous  anthrax. For gastrointestinal anthrax, between 25 and 60 percent of cases  have resulted in death. For inhalational anthrax, the fatality rate before the  2001 incidents had been approximately 75 percent, even with appropriate  antimicrobial medications. An anthrax vaccine is available, but it is  indicated for use in individuals at high risk of exposure to anthrax spores,  such as laboratory personnel who work with Bacillus anthracis.", "Because so few instances of inhalational anthrax have occurred, scientific  understanding about the number of spores needed to cause infection is  still evolving. Before the 2001 incidents, it was estimated that a person  would need to inhale thousands of spores to develop an infection.  However, based on some of the cases that occurred during the anthrax  incidents, experts now believe that the number of spores needed to cause  inhalational anthrax could be fewer than that, depending on a person\u2019s  health and the nature of the spores."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Health Response to a Bioterrorist Attack", "paragraphs": ["In the existing model for response to a public health emergency of any  type, including a bioterrorist attack, the initial response is generally a local  responsibility. This local response can involve multiple jurisdictions in a  region, with states providing additional support as needed. Having the  necessary resources immediately available at the local level to respond to  an emergency can minimize the magnitude of the event and the cost of  remediation. In the case of a covert release of a biological agent such as  anthrax, it can be days before exposed people start exhibiting signs and  symptoms of the disease. The model anticipates that exposed individuals  would seek out local clinicians, such as private physicians or medical staff  in hospital emergency departments or public clinics. Clinicians would  report any illness patterns or diagnostic clues that might indicate an  unusual infectious disease outbreak to their state or local health  departments. Local and state health departments would collect and  monitor data, such as reports from clinicians, for disease trends and  evidence of an outbreak. Environmental and clinical samples would be  collected for laboratorians to test for possible exposures and  identification of illnesses. Epidemiologists in the health departments  would use the disease surveillance systems to provide for the ongoing  collection, analysis, and dissemination of data to identify unusual patterns  of disease. Public health officials would provide needed information to the  clinical community, other responders, and the public and would  implement control measures to prevent additional cases from occurring.  The federal government can also become involved, as requested, by  providing assistance with testing of samples and epidemiologic  investigations, providing advice on treatment protocols and other  technical information, and coordinating a national response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC\u2019s Bioterrorism Response Planning Efforts", "paragraphs": ["As early as 1998, CDC had begun its planning efforts to enhance its  capacity to respond effectively to bioterrorism. CDC said it was  responsible for providing national leadership in the public health and  medical communities in a concerted effort to detect, diagnose, respond to,  and prevent illnesses that occur as a result of bioterrorism. In its strategic  preparedness and response plan, CDC anticipated that it would need to  collaborate with local and state public health partners and other federal  agencies in order to strengthen components of the public health  infrastructure. As part of this collaboration, CDC initiated a cooperative  agreement program in 1999 to enhance state and local bioterrorism  preparedness. CDC\u2019s planning efforts identified the importance of  coordination with the Department of Justice, including the FBI and the  National Domestic Preparedness Office. In addition, CDC said that there  was ongoing coordination with the Office of Emergency Preparedness  within HHS, FDA, NIH, DOD, the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA), and many other partners, including academic institutions and  professional organizations. At the time of the anthrax incidents, some of  these collaborative efforts were in the planning stage, some were in the  form of working groups, and others were limited in scope to areas such as  laboratory preparedness, training, or new vaccine research.", "CDC was also working to make improvements in various aspects of  preparedness and prevention, detection and surveillance, and  communication and coordination. At the time of the anthrax incidents,  CDC was working on creating diagnostic and epidemiologic performance  standards for local and state health departments. In collaboration with  NIH and DOD, CDC was encouraging research for the development of new  vaccines, antitoxins, and innovative drugs. In addition, CDC had developed  a repository of pharmaceuticals and other supplies through the Strategic  National Stockpile. CDC was developing educational materials and  providing terrorism-related training to epidemiologists, laboratory  workers, emergency responders, emergency department personnel, and  other front-line health care providers and health and safety personnel.", "Through cooperative agreements, CDC was also working to upgrade the  surveillance systems of the local and state health departments and  investing in the Health Alert Network (HAN) and Epidemic Information  Exchange (Epi-X) communication systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fall 2001 Anthrax Incidents", "paragraphs": ["In October 2001, an employee of American Media Inc. (AMI) in Florida was  diagnosed with inhalational anthrax, the first case in the United States in  over two decades. By the end of November 2001, 21 more people had  contracted the disease, and 5 people, including the original victim, had  died as a result. Although the FBI confirmed the existence of only four  letters containing anthrax spores, by December 2001 the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA) had confirmed that over 60 sites, about one third  of which were U.S. postal facilities, had been contaminated with anthrax  spores.", "The cases of inhalational anthrax in Florida, the first epicenter, were  thought to have resulted from proximity to opened letters containing  anthrax spores, which were never found. (See table 1.) The initial cases of  anthrax detected in New York, the second epicenter, were all cutaneous  and were also thought to have been associated with opened anthrax  letters. The cases detected initially in New Jersey, the third epicenter,  were cutaneous and were in postal workers who presumably had not been  exposed to opened anthrax letters. Unlike the incidents at other  epicenters, which began when cases of anthrax were detected, the  incident on Capitol Hill, the fourth epicenter, began with the opening of a  letter containing anthrax spores and resulting exposure. The discovery of  inhalational anthrax in a postal worker in the Washington, D.C., regional  area, the fifth epicenter, revealed that even individuals who had been  exposed only to sealed anthrax letters could contract the inhalational form  of the disease. Subsequent inhalational cases in Washington, D.C., New  Jersey, New York, and Connecticut, the sixth epicenter, underscored that  finding. (For a list of key events in the history of the anthrax incidents and  the public health response to the incidents, see app. I.)", "Although the anthrax incidents were limited to six epicenters on the East  Coast, the incidents had national implications. Because mail processed at  contaminated postal facilities could be cross-contaminated and end up  anywhere in the country, the localized incidents generated concern about  white powders found in locations beyond the epicenters and created a  demand throughout the nation for public health resources at the local,  state, and federal levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Local and State Public Health Officials Identified Strengths in Their Responses as Well as Areas for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Local and state public health officials across the epicenters emphasized  the benefits of their planning efforts for promoting a rapid and  coordinated response, stressed the importance of effective communication  throughout the incidents, and reported that their response capacity was  strained and the response would have been difficult to sustain if the  incidents had been more extensive."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Local and State Public Health Officials Relied on Plans for Coordinating with a Wide Range of Entities and Identified Areas for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["Local and state public health officials were challenged to coordinate their  responses to the anthrax incidents across a wide range of public and  private entities, often across more than one local jurisdiction.

In one epicenter, for  example, a regional organization of local governments had developed  planning guidance that outlined collaborative networks between the  public health and emergency response communities needed to strengthen  the region\u2019s response to an event such as the anthrax incidents.", "In contrast, the need to link the public health response with the responses  of other public entities affected by the anthrax incidents, such as  environmental agencies, military response teams, and the U.S. Postal  Service, was less likely to have been anticipated in local response plans.  During the response, standard practices for clinical and environmental  testing and use of proper protective clothing and equipment needed to be  coordinated among public health officials, postal officials, police,  firefighters, environmental specialists, and teams from DOD. However,  officials reported that in some cases personnel from environmental and  military groups were meeting with public health officials for the first time  as the response unfolded. When the need for consistency in testing  procedures and standards for protective clothing and equipment had not  been anticipated, officials sometimes had difficulty agreeing on which  procedures and standards to follow. In addition, some plans had not  anticipated the need to forge quick relationships between public health  departments and local groups affected by the incidents but not expressly  mentioned in the plans. During the anthrax incidents, the absence of such  a measure proved to be a particular problem for postal officials and postal  union representatives. In part due to this absence of proactive plans,  coordination between public health and postal officials on many of the  details of the response was problematic, and there were difficulties  communicating critical information, such as decisions on how and when  to provide prophylactic, or preventive, treatment to postal workers.", "The need for coordination between public health and private groups  affected by the emergency\u2014such as the hospital community\u2014was also  not always fully anticipated in local response plans. Public health officials  in several areas had to work with local hospitals and other facilities to set  up screening and postexposure prophylaxis clinics rapidly, sometimes in  less than 24 hours. In this time they had to identify an appropriate site  location, design patient flow plans, outline staff needs and responsibilities  (medical, pharmacy, counseling, administrative, and facilities operation  components), and obtain medications (including dealing with the logistics  of breaking down and repackaging bulk medications). Few locations had  formally addressed all of these issues before the anthrax incidents, but  those that had addressed at least some of them reported being able to  respond more rapidly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Aspects of Response Plans Had Been Made Operational and Increased Officials\u2019 Ability to Coordinate a Rapid Response", "paragraphs": ["Officials relied on a variety of formal agreements, such as memoranda of  understanding and legal contracts, to address the needs identified in their  planning documents. These needs included coordination across disciplines  and jurisdictions, access to scientific information, and human resources  support. Local officials reported that putting agreements and contracts  into place to address these needs strengthened their preparedness both by  solidifying links with their public and private partners and by helping them  identify weaknesses that could be addressed prior to an emergency. When  systems had not been put into place to support plans, coordination of  response efforts was more difficult.", "Formal agreements had often been put into place to support coordination  among officials within communities and across jurisdictions, but some  aspects of plans that were important for coordinating the response had not  yet been made operational. For example, one official reported having  arranged to link surveillance and environmental health personnel with law  enforcement officials during criminal investigations in the event of an  anthrax attack. Another official had already established agreements with  local counterparts to provide access to prophylaxis. Officials reported that  when formal contacts between officials had not been established,  coordination with counterparts in their community and other jurisdictions  during the incidents often relied on personal relationships.", "While some public health departments reported having systems in place to  ensure ready access to the scientific information needed to make  decisions and provide information to the media and the public, many  reported that they did not. Officials reported that planning ahead and then  taking the necessary steps to compile available scientific information\u2014  including what was known about anthrax, procedures for testing exposure  to anthrax, treatment protocols, and standards for the types of protective  clothing and equipment that are appropriate for first responders\u2014were  important for responding rapidly and reducing confusion across the  parties involved in the response.", "Officials stated that during the response they relied on existing mutual aid  agreements or contracts that gave them access to staff for screening and  mass care clinics, allowed the state to pull local epidemiologists to support  the state response, and addressed licensure issues for staff brought in  from other states. However, these agreements were not always in place, or  only partially covered the needs of the situation, and some officials had to  spend time dealing with issues that could have been addressed before the  event. For example, an official in one epicenter reported that because a  state of emergency had not been declared in the jurisdiction, there was no  system to pay for food for staff who were working 24-hour shifts in  prophylaxis clinics. Several officials in other localities reported that  systems had not been put into place to authorize payment for overtime  work in both public health departments and laboratories. In addition, one  health department received offers of volunteer help from many physicians,  pharmacists, nurses, epidemiologists, and other concerned citizens.

These officials stated that  drills ranging from tabletop to full-scale exercises were useful for testing  coordination and response capacities both locally and regionally. Public  health officials also reported that their experience in dealing with hoax  letters and false alarms proved useful, particularly in supporting  coordination with the law enforcement community. In major metropolitan  areas, experience with large events, such as political conventions, forced  local public health departments to develop their emergency response  plans and put the necessary agreements in place to support those plans.  Experience with public health emergencies\u2014including natural disasters  and outbreaks of infectious disease such as West Nile virus\u2014also allowed  officials to work on coordinating their responses across multiple sites, test  their surveillance systems, and establish links with other public and  private entities.", "Where previous experience had not allowed officials to identify and  address shortcomings of their plans, the anthrax incidents tended to  uncover weaknesses. For example, one local public health official  reported that although the agency had planned how to set up a  prophylaxis clinic it had not actually exercised getting people through the  testing and prophylaxis process. During the anthrax response, it took  significantly longer than the agency had anticipated to obtain test results  from overwhelmed laboratories. This official said that if the agency had  known how long it was going to take to get laboratory results, it would  have provided the first doses of prophylaxis for a longer duration to take  into account the additional time required to obtain test results. Another  official reported that the agency\u2019s experience with setting up a prophylaxis  clinic during the anthrax response taught the agency how to select more  appropriate sites for mass vaccination or prophylaxis clinics in emergency  situations. Experience also revealed shortcomings in regional  coordination. Several officials noted that although some plans for  coordination across jurisdictions were in place, they had not been  exercised, and so the relationships to support coordination had not been  formed or tested."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Communicating Effectively during the Incidents Was Challenging", "paragraphs": ["Local officials identified communication among responders and with the  public during the anthrax incidents as a challenge, both in terms of having  the necessary communication channels and in terms of making the  necessary information available for distribution.

Regular conference calls,  which were initiated during the incidents, were used to distribute  information, raise issues, and answer questions.", "In addition to telephone calls, local and state public health offices relied  on fax machines and the Internet to send and receive information during  the incidents. Most local health departments, however, noted that they did  not have backup communication systems that could be used in case  everyday systems became unavailable. In addition, public health workers  did not generally have cell phones, pagers, or laptop computers, which  could provide the means to keep working if it became necessary to vacate  a building during a crisis. In one epicenter, when an agency had to  evacuate its quarters during the incidents and workers could not be at  their desks, many of its communication systems (in addition to the  information stored in the office in electronic formats) became unavailable.  Several local agencies that did not have backup systems available at the  time of the anthrax incidents told us they have concluded that it is  important to invest in such systems to be prepared for any future public  health emergencies.", "Local response agencies generally got the information they requested from  other local agencies. For example, in one epicenter, police and fire  departments were given specific protocols for handling suspicious  samples and triaging them for the laboratory. However, there were  instances in which they did not get needed information. For example, a  local emergency response official stated that the local fire department did  not know what protective equipment (such as masks and gloves)  firefighters should wear when responding to a suspected anthrax incident.

They expected to be given rapid  and specific instructions from public health officials about how to  recognize and treat people who had been exposed. They wanted  guidelines, for example, on how to diagnose inhalational anthrax and how  to advise individuals who worked in post offices. Hospitals in one  epicenter reported receiving daily influxes of people with flulike  symptoms. Because these hospitals were seeking guidance on how to  distinguish between influenza and anthrax symptoms, the hospital  association in the area initiated daily conference calls with concerned  clinicians. The purpose of these calls was to collect questions to ask other  organizations, such as CDC, to coordinate consistent answers to questions  from the public, and to share information about clinical approaches.", "Some of the ways in which local public health agencies tried to  communicate with hospitals and physicians were regarded as relatively  effective by the agencies, but no method worked well for all targeted  recipients. Health departments used various means to make relevant  materials available to hospitals and physicians, including sending faxes or  e-mail messages, posting relevant information on their Web sites,  distributing CD-ROMs, and setting up hotlines. In one state, which had no  confirmed anthrax infections but numerous false alarms, the state public  health department faxed critical information to hospitals throughout the  state. Officials in the department reported that while this system was  useful in disseminating information it was insufficient because it did not  provide a means of receiving information from the hospitals. E-mail  worked well for institutions, but it was an ineffective way of  communicating with physicians, especially those who did not have a  hospital-based practice. Several local public health officials told us that  many private physicians did not have e-mail or Web access. Because  electronic messages were not a feasible way of communicating with many  clinicians, there was no way to get timely information about anthrax to  them. Some primary care physicians were difficult to reach by any mass  communication method or even individually because public health  officials sometimes did not have up-to-date rosters of their telephone  numbers. Officials in one state said they realized during the incidents that  they did not have a way to send information directly to dermatologists, a  group of specialists who were especially important for detecting the  cutaneous form of anthrax infection. Because localities were unable to  reach all physicians directly, government agencies relied on physicians  and associations who did receive the information to serve as conduits.

Several officials stated that the media  helped in publicizing sources of information such as hotlines and specific  information such as details about who should seek treatment and where to  go for it. However, media analysts have also noted that the media were  sometimes responsible for providing incorrect information. For example,  one official said that when the media reported that nasal swabbing was the  test for anthrax, individuals sought unnecessary nasal swab testing from  emergency rooms, physicians, and the health department, and thereby  diverted medical and laboratory resources from medical care that was  required elsewhere.", "Communication with the public was further complicated by the evolving  nature of the incidents and the local public\u2019s exposure to information from  other localities and the national media. Comparisons of actions taken by  officials at different points in time and in different areas caused the public  to question the consistency and fairness of actions taken in their locale.  For example, the affected public in some epicenters wondered why they  were being given doxycycline for prophylaxis instead of ciprofloxacin,  which had been heralded in the media as the drug of choice for the  prevention of inhalational anthrax and used earlier in other epicenters.  CDC\u2019s initial recommendation for ciprofloxacin was made because  ciprofloxacin was judged to be most likely to be effective against any  naturally occurring strain of anthrax and had already been approved by  FDA for use in postexposure prophylaxis for inhalational anthrax.  However, when it was determined that doxycycline was equally effective  against the strain of anthrax in the letters and following FDA\u2019s  announcement that doxycycline was approved for inhalational anthrax,  the recommendation was changed. This change was made because of  doxycycline\u2019s lower risk for side effects and lower cost and because of  concerns that strains of bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin could emerge if  tens of thousands of people were taking it. In epicenters where  prophylaxis was initiated after the recommendation had changed, officials  followed the new recommendation and gave doxycycline to affected  people. Local officials were challenged to explain the switch and address  concerns raised by affected groups about apparently differential  treatment. One local official described the importance of explaining that  the switch was also taking place even in locations that had started with  ciprofloxacin."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Response Capacity Was Strained and Would Have Been Difficult to Sustain", "paragraphs": ["Elements of the local and state public health response systems\u2014including  the public health department and laboratory workforce as well as  laboratories\u2014were strained by the anthrax incidents to an extent that  many local and state officials told us that they might not have been able to  manage if the crisis had lasted longer.

Officials from one state told us that its  laboratories did not have the capacity to handle the volume of work they  received.

Agency officials have said there were communication  problems between epidemiologic staff in the field and at headquarters,  which CDC attempted to address by holding \u201cmission briefings\u201d through  its emergency response center; however, these briefings were not  conducted regularly. CDC\u2019s efforts to manage all of this incoming  information and associated internal communication problems were  complicated by its concurrent responsibility for coordinating the day-to- day activities involved in the federal public health response to the  unfolding incidents.", "According to CDC, both clinical and environmental guidance was  developed during the incidents by using working groups of six to eight  employees who were subject matter experts. Keeping up with the influx of  new information that was being acquired daily proved to be a challenge for  these working groups.

For example, as  the epidemiologic investigation expanded, CDC had to revise its  assessment of the risk of developing inhalational anthrax from letters  containing anthrax spores. Early on, CDC was acting on the theory that  there was little risk of contracting inhalational anthrax from sealed letters.  The incidents in the Washington, D.C., regional area, the fifth epicenter,  represented a turning point in the epidemiologic investigation. The  discovery of inhalational anthrax in a postal worker who presumably had  been in contact only with sealed anthrax letters required CDC to revise its  assessment. From this point on, CDC presumed that any exposure would  put an individual at risk and changed its recommendation regarding who  should get prophylaxis accordingly. CDC began to recommend  prophylaxis for all individuals who had been in contact with sealed as well  as unsealed anthrax letters, whereas earlier the agency had not been  recommending such treatment unless an individual had been exposed to  an opened letter.", "Initially, CDC relied on the HAN communication system and its Morbidity  and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) publication to disseminate its  guidance and other information; however, during the incidents there were  difficulties with both of these methods. At the time of the incidents, all  state health departments were connected to the HAN system. However,  only 13 states were connected to all of their local health jurisdictions, and  therefore HAN messages could not reach many local areas. Some states  were satisfied with the information they received via HAN, but others  claimed they did not get much information from HAN and what they did  get was incomplete. During the incidents, CDC expanded its list of HAN  recipients to include additional organizations, including medical  associations. MMWR is issued on a weekly basis, and so the information in  the latest issue was not always completely up-to-date for incidents that  were unfolding by the hour. For example, information published in MMWR  on October 26, 2001, contained the notice that the information was current  as of October 24, 2001. In addition to these structural barriers to getting  information out quickly to those who needed it, CDC\u2019s internal process of  clearing information before issuance through HAN or MMWR was time- consuming. CDC has since changed its clearing process so that  information can get out faster. The agency also made a number of other  changes during the incidents to address some of the difficulties it  encountered in providing information to the public health departments  and clinicians. These included bringing in professionals from other  communication departments in CDC to help get information out quickly,  issuing press releases twice a day, and holding telebriefings. Since the  incidents, CDC has taken actions to expand its communication capacity,  including developing an emergency communication plan, increasing the  number of health experts on staff, and establishing a pressroom, in which  the Director of CDC gives press briefings on public health efforts.

In an  October 2001 nationwide poll, respondents indicated that they considered  the Director of CDC and the U.S. Surgeon General to be better sources of  reliable information about the outbreak of disease caused by bioterrorism  than other federal officials mentioned in the survey.", "Another problem CDC encountered in its efforts to communicate  messages to the public was difficulty in conveying the uncertainty  associated with the messages, that is, the caveat that although the  messages were based on the best available information, they were subject  to change when new facts became known. As a bioterrorist event unfolds  and new information is learned, recommendations about who is at risk  and how people should be treated may change, and the public needs to be  prepared that changes may occur. Local officials and academics have  criticized CDC\u2019s communication of uncertainty during the anthrax  incidents. CDC officials have acknowledged that they were unsuccessful  in clearly communicating their degree of uncertainty as knowledge was  evolving during the incidents. For example, although there were internal  disagreements at CDC over the appropriate length of prophylaxis, this  uncertainty was not effectively conveyed to the public. Consequently, in  December 2001, when many people were finishing the 60-day  antimicrobial regimen called for in CDC\u2019s guidance, the public questioned  CDC\u2019s announcement that patients might want to consider an additional  40 days of antimicrobials.

CDC reported that because of  the number of epicenters and calls for assistance from other localities, its  staff, both at headquarters and in the field, were spread thin. The level of  assistance provided by CDC depended on the needs of the local public  health departments and therefore varied considerably by location. For  example, while CDC epidemiologists augmented the staff of some local  and state health departments who would have been severely overtaxed  without CDC\u2019s help, the agency characterized its role in one epicenter as  supplementary to that epicenter\u2019s team of epidemiologists.", "The Laboratory Response Network proved to be an asset, and some state  and local officials told us they were satisfied with the laboratory response  during the anthrax incidents.

Public health laboratories other than those at CDC  tested 69 percent of these samples, DOD laboratories tested 25 percent,  and CDC laboratories tested 6 percent. In addition to testing samples at its  laboratories, DOD also assisted the epicenters by providing personnel for  laboratories in the epicenters and at CDC and operating portable  laboratories to support local investigations. In addition to testing samples,  CDC laboratories distributed chemicals needed for testing samples to  network laboratories and developed a new testing method that permitted  better diagnostics from biopsy samples.

Cutaneous  anthrax can be confused with cellulitis or a spider bite. Inhalational  anthrax is difficult to distinguish from other respiratory illnesses, such as  pneumonia or influenza. Routine laboratory and radiological testing did  not always clearly signal anthrax infection, and, even after physicians did  suspect it, the laboratory tests needed to confirm it were time-consuming,  laborious, and required that samples be sent to specialized laboratories.  Diagnostic tests that are more accurate and can yield results more quickly  are in development.", "Treatment for anthrax infection was available, but it was not effective in  almost half of the inhalational cases. Both inhalational and cutaneous  anthrax, once diagnosed, were treated with a combination of intravenous  antimicrobial medications. All of the patients with cutaneous anthrax  recovered, but 5 of the 11 patients with inhalational anthrax did not. The  drugs worked by killing the bacteria that develop from anthrax spores  following germination of those spores in the body. However, anthrax  bacteria produce toxins, and no treatments were available that could  destroy these toxins. For this reason, the antimicrobial drugs used to treat  inhalational anthrax were ineffective in those patients in whom the  bacteria had already produced too much toxin by the time treatment was  initiated. CDC is working with other agencies within HHS, such as NIH,  and other federal agencies, including DOD, to support the development of  new treatments for anthrax and other potential agents of bioterrorism.", "Methods of prophylaxis for people exposed to anthrax spores were  available and apparently effective, but there were several difficulties with  these methods. There was uncertainty about how to assess exposure to  determine who should be given prophylaxis; initially only one drug had  been approved for prophylaxis, and it was approved only for prophylaxis  of inhalational anthrax; the optimal length of prophylaxis for those  thought to have been exposed to anthrax spores was unknown;  prophylactic drugs had to be taken for months and had side effects; and  the anthrax vaccine requires more than one dose, had not been approved  for postexposure prophylaxis, and was in short supply. Nasal swabs and  blood tests were used early in the investigation to assess exposure, but  these were not reliable methods. When there was uncertainty about who  was exposed or how great their risk from exposure was, prophylaxis was  sometimes recommended for all workers in a facility with some  contamination, regardless of how close to the contamination the workers  had been. This prophylaxis often started with an initial supply of  medication while test results were awaited. For example, some people  were given a 10-day supply of drugs and asked to return within 10 days to  learn whether they needed to continue taking the drugs. Initially, CDC,  with advice from NIH, recommended prophylaxis for 60 days. The drugs  had side effects, and the rate of compliance with the regimen was typically  about 40 percent. Since the incidents, federal agencies have been  developing and evaluating tools for detecting anthrax spores. Such tests  could enable field workers to make better initial assessments of exposure  at particular locations to determine who should get prophylaxis. CDC is  working with other federal agencies to support the development of new  methods of prophylaxis for anthrax and other potential agents of  bioterrorism.", "HHS reported that at the time of the anthrax incidents no system or data  collection instruments existed for monitoring the nearly 10,000 people  who were receiving prophylaxis and thus it did not have a way to collect  information on the compliance with, adverse events from, or effectiveness  of prophylaxis.

In addition, local  public health officials in the epicenters were challenged to mount an  intensive response that included identifying and treating people already  infected with anthrax as well as people who had been exposed and could  become infected, identifying contaminated areas and preventing additional  people from being exposed, processing thousands of samples suspected of  containing anthrax, and responding to thousands of calls from concerned  members of their communities.", "The public health response to the anthrax incidents both demonstrated the  benefit of public health preparedness measures already in place or under  way at the local, state, and federal levels and emphasized the need to  reinforce or expand on those measures. The specific strengths and  weaknesses of the public health response identified by local and state  public health officials varied. Nonetheless, public health officials from all  locations identified general lessons learned for public health  preparedness. The lessons identified fall into three general categories: the  benefits of planning and experience; the importance of effective  communication, both among those involved in the response efforts and  with the general public; and the critical importance of a strong public  health infrastructure to serve as the foundation from which response  efforts can be mounted for bioterrorism or other public health  emergencies.", "CDC was instrumental in supporting local and state efforts throughout the  anthrax incidents, for example, by sending epidemic investigators into the  field and providing laboratory expertise. DOD resources and expertise  were also required to support several epicenters. CDC was challenged  with the unfamiliar task of coordinating the extensive federal public health  response efforts. Before the incidents began, CDC officials had recognized  that the agency was not fully prepared to coordinate a major public health  response effort and indeed had identified areas that needed improvement  in testimony before Congress on the day before it confirmed the first case  of inhalational anthrax in Florida. CDC officials have acknowledged that  the agency did not perform as well as it would have liked during the  incidents. The agency has taken steps to improve future performance,  including creating the Office of Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency  Response within the Office of the Director, building and staffing an  emergency operations center, enhancing the agency\u2019s communication  infrastructure, and developing and maintaining databases of information  and expertise on the biological agents the federal government considers  most likely to be used in a terrorist attack."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We obtained comments on our draft report from DOD and HHS.
