U.S. imports from countries eligible for AGOA, which we  generally refer to as AGOA countries, have increased since 2001,  although these countries\u2019 share of overall U.S. imports have remained  small and experienced declines in recent years. In 2013, 2 percent of  overall U.S. imports came from AGOA countries.

This assistance  may include support for addressing the regulatory environment for  business, trade, and investment; improving customs procedures; and  developing infrastructure, such as ports and roads. U.S. and African  officials have recognized the need for continued trade capacity building to  help sub-Saharan African countries make better use of AGOA. Most  recently, in conjunction with the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, held in  Washington, D.C., in August 2014, President Obama stated that in order  for countries to be able to utilize AGOA to its fullest, AGOA must be  linked to a comprehensive, coordinated trade and investment capacity- building approach.approach to expanding sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s capacity for trade and  investment.", "The President also called for a comprehensive U.S.", "As Congress deliberates reauthorization of AGOA, which is set to expire  on September 30, 2015, policymakers have expressed interest in  countries\u2019 ability to utilize AGOA and U.S. TCB assistance in support of  AGOA.

However, our report does in fact note  observations from our field work in Ghana and Ethiopia regarding  challenges resulting from lack of access to power.", "Finally, USAID explained that its trade hubs are designed as regional  programs and therefore often prioritize regional efforts over bilateral  strategy development.

We also  interviewed officials from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and  the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), agencies that do not  provide funding for U.S. TCB assistance but provided additional  contextual information on AGOA and TCB. We reviewed documents  including literature on AGOA and TCB; statements of work, evaluations,  and annual reports for the three USAID-funded trade hubs; program  documents for MCC activities in sub-Saharan Africa; and examples of  AGOA-specific and national export strategies. We also conducted  fieldwork in Ethiopia and Ghana, countries we selected because they  represented a cross section of U.S. TCB assistance and are in different  regions within sub-Saharan Africa, thereby also providing insight on two  out of the three trade hubs. In each country, we interviewed U.S. agency  officials, host government officials, representatives from the private sector  who had insights on U.S. TCB assistance, and contractors implementing  TCB activities. Our findings from these countries are not generalizable to  the universe of all U.S. TCB activities.", "To examine U.S. government TCB assistance in support of AGOA, we  reviewed documents from relevant U.S. agencies, including program  descriptions and evaluations, and analyzed data on U.S. TCB funding to  AGOA countries. We focused our analysis on the U.S. agencies that  provided the highest amounts of TCB funding for AGOA countries from  fiscal years 2001 through 2013. We analyzed data USAID provided on  annual U.S. TCB obligations for activities in all AGOA countries from  fiscal years 2001 through 2013 by year, agency, country, and TCB  category. These data are reported in the U.S. government TCB database,  but we requested data directly from USAID to facilitate our analysis of the  data for the purposes of this report. We also relied on the data and  information from the TCB database, such as TCB activity descriptions. In  our analysis of TCB funding data, we built upon information collected for  prior GAO reports on TCB that used data from the TCB database. Data  from the TCB database were deemed reliable for our prior reports on  TCB. For this report, we determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable to identify TCB funding by agency, country, category, and year.  Furthermore, in assessing the data, we interviewed key USAID officials  responsible for administering the database and reviewed supporting  documentation.", "To examine the extent to which USAID has made efforts to develop  strategic approaches to AGOA utilization, we reviewed documents from  relevant U.S. agencies, including program descriptions and evaluations,  and information on AGOA-specific and national export strategies from  U.S. agencies and host governments. In addition, we discussed the  development of these strategic approaches with U.S. and foreign  government officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2014 to January 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
