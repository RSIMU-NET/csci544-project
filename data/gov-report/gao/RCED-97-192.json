About 90 countries receive technical assistance, mostly through over 1,000 projects in IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation program. IAEA\u2019 s technical cooperation program funds projects in 10 major program areas, including agriculture, the development of member states\u2019 commercial nuclear power programs, and nuclear safety. The average cost of a member state\u2019s technical assistance project is about $60,000.", "IAEA provided about $800 million in technical assistance to its member states from 1958 through 1996, for equipment, expert services, training, and subcontracts (agreements between IAEA and a third party to provide services to IAEA member states). IAEA\u2019s training activities include fellowships, scientific visits, and training courses. Egypt was the largest recipient of IAEA\u2019s technical assistance overall. About 44 percent of the assistance was spent for equipment, and\u2014from 1980 through 1996\u2014about half of the funds were provided for assistance in three program areas\u2014the application of isotopes and radiation in agriculture, general atomic energy development, and safety in nuclear energy.

The proposals are appraised for funding by IAEA staff and IAEA member states in terms of the projects\u2019 technical and practical feasibility, national development priorities, and the projects\u2019 long-term advantages to the recipient countries. Because IAEA\u2019s full-scope safeguards, as embodied in the 1970 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), emerged after IAEA was established, all IAEA member states in good standing are eligible for the same privileges, including receiving technical assistance. IAEA does not bar technical assistance for member states that do not have IAEA\u2019s full-scope safeguards or are not parties to the NPT. For example, Pakistan, Israel, and Cuba receive IAEA\u2019s technical assistance but do not have full-scope safeguards and are not parties to the NPT.", "U.S. participation in IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation program is coordinated through an interagency group\u2014the International Nuclear Technology Liaison Office\u2014which is chaired by the Department of State and includes representatives from the Department of Energy (DOE), the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The United States also maintains a presence at IAEA through the U.S. Mission to the United Nations System Organizations in Vienna, Austria. U.S. contractors from Argonne National Laboratory and the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council support U.S. training and fellowship activities for the program. In addition to developing and coordinating U.S. policy towards IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation program, the interagency group (1) proposes and recommends U.S. support for specific projects\u2014known as \u201cfootnote a\u201d projects\u2014only in IAEA member states that are parties to the NPT or other nuclear nonproliferation treaties;(2) selects courses and participants for U.S.-hosted IAEA training courses and places IAEA fellows at U.S. institutions, such as national laboratories and universities; (3) facilitates purchases of U.S. equipment on behalf of IAEA; (4) recommends U.S. experts and consultants to represent the United States at IAEA meetings, conferences, and symposia; and (5) recruits U.S. nationals to provide expert advice to IAEA and to staff IAEA\u2019s operations.

A State Department document noted that the United States regarded support for the technical cooperation program to developing countries as the \u201cprice tag\u201d for safeguards.

However, representatives from six developing countries that have benefited from IAEA\u2019s technical assistance\u2014Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, and South Africa\u2014told us that their countries participate in IAEA primarily because their participation enables them to receive technical assistance.According to the representatives from India, Pakistan, and South Africa, IAEA would simply become an international \u201cpolicing\u201d organization for monitoring compliance with safeguards if IAEA did not provide technical assistance. A U.S. Mission official stated that several member states, including India and Pakistan, would be likely to withdraw from IAEA if its technical assistance were severely scaled back.", "According to IAEA officials, IAEA carries out its dual responsibilities and manages the competing interests of its member states by maintaining a balance in funding between providing technical assistance and ensuring compliance with safeguards. As figure 1 shows, in 1996, IAEA spent about $97 million on safeguards and about $89 million on technical assistance, accounting for approximately 30 percent and 27 percent, respectively, of IAEA\u2019s total expenditures of about $325 million.", "Technical assistance ($89.0)", "Other programs ($67.2)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns About the Effectiveness and Efficiency of IAEA\u2019s Technical Cooperation Program Led to IAEA Initiatives to Improve the Program", "paragraphs": ["In the past, officials in the United States and other IAEA major donor countries had concerns about the effectiveness and efficiency of the technical cooperation program. A 1993 State Department cable stated that the United States had long been concerned that \u201cfootnote a\u201d projects were devoid of significant technical, health, or socioeconomic benefit to the recipient country. Some of the evaluations that we reviewed indicated other deficiencies in the technical cooperation program. For example, an October 1993 special evaluation review of lessons learned from completed evaluation reviews noted that inadequate project plans and designs resulted in implementation problems and delays in 30 percent of the technical assistance projects reviewed from 1988 through 1993. Some of the negative effects IAEA cited that resulted from insufficient project planning included (1) approving a 2-year project without obtaining sufficient evidence about its feasibility; (2) planning research reactor activities that did not yield significant results because they were premature or ambitious in relation to local resources; and (3) conducting nuclear physics projects in Africa that lacked clear results and benefits to the recipient country.", "IAEA officials in the Department of Technical Cooperation told us they have not prepared a comprehensive report on the accomplishments of the program since its inception in 1958. Although IAEA has provided its member states with detailed descriptions of all of its technical assistance projects, it did not assess the success or failure of these projects in the past. According to the head of IAEA\u2019s Department of Technical Cooperation\u2019s Evaluation Section, evaluations of projects\u2019 impact were not required because IAEA was focusing on the efficiency of projects\u2019 implementation. Moreover, IAEA stated that in 1993, the technical cooperation program\u2019s priorities shifted from implementing research and infrastructure-building activities efficiently to designing projects that have an impact on the end-user and provide nuclear science and technology activities that contribute to national development. IAEA noted that it is unrealistic to expect impact analyses of projects designed and implemented according to standards that did not embody measures of impact at the time. In the year 2000, IAEA plans to review the program\u2019s performance against the criteria for success contained in IAEA\u2019s strategy for technical cooperation.", "We reviewed 40 reports prepared by IAEA\u2019s Department of Technical Cooperation\u2019s Evaluation Section and summaries of four audits of the program prepared by IAEA\u2019s Office of Internal Audit and Evaluation Support, which covered the period from 1985 through 1996, to determine whether they contained assessments of the program\u2019s effectiveness. We found that most of the 40 reports and audit summaries did not assess the impact of specific technical assistance projects, and no performance criteria had been established to help measure the success or failure of the projects. The evaluations and audits were also limited because insufficient travel funds generally precluded visits by IAEA staff to the recipient nations. We also reviewed the project files for four selected technical assistance projects in Iran, North Korea, Bulgaria, and Egypt that had been completed or canceled by IAEA. None of the project files we reviewed contained information on the project\u2019s accomplishments. Our review of other project files was limited by IAEA\u2019s policy on confidentiality, which regards information obtained by IAEA under a technical cooperation project as belonging to the country receiving the project. Under this policy, IAEA cannot divulge information about a project without the formal consent of the receiving country\u2019s government.", "Since 1992, IAEA\u2019s Deputy Director General for Technical Cooperation has taken steps to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the technical cooperation program. For example, IAEA is establishing a system for measuring the quality and performance of some of its technical assistance projects. However, in 1996, IAEA\u2019s Secretariat reported to the Board of Governors that outcomes were still clearly defined for only 25 percent of the 90 technical assistance projects whose results they had monitored from January through October 1996. The Evaluation Section of IAEA\u2019s Department of Technical Cooperation is also helping the department to establish criteria for measuring the results of a project while planning it. The United States and other IAEA major donor countries strongly support IAEA\u2019s efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the program, but U.S. officials are concerned that all of the improvements may not be fully implemented and made permanent in the 2 years before the term of the current Deputy Director General for Technical Cooperation ends. (App. I discusses the status of IAEA\u2019s efforts to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the technical cooperation program and the U.S. position on these actions.) According to a State Department cable describing the results of meetings held in September 1996, the major donors in attendance were highly supportive of IAEA\u2019s initiatives to improve the program. The donors concluded that they were under increasing pressure at home to demonstrate that their countries\u2019 contributions to IAEA were being well spent; supportive of the Deputy Director General for Technical Cooperation\u2019s efforts to make the entire technical cooperation program more efficient and effective; concerned because the technical cooperation program had not set priorities or established a schedule for accomplishing improvements to the program; and concerned that IAEA\u2019s Department of Technical Cooperation may not have the management skills required to accomplish these improvements.", "More recently, during the Board of Governors\u2019 June 1997 meeting, the members highly praised IAEA\u2019s efforts in carrying out its initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the technical cooperation program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cost of U.S. Participation in IAEA\u2019s Technical Cooperation Program", "paragraphs": ["Most of the funding for IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation program\u2014about 70 percent\u2014comes from voluntary contributions made by member states to IAEA\u2019s technical cooperation fund.

About $16 million of the $36 million U.S. voluntary contribution to IAEA went to the technical cooperation fund; this contribution represented about 32 percent of the fund, which totaled $49 million. The remainder of the U.S. voluntary contribution to IAEA\u2014about $20 million\u2014was spent on other forms of support for the technical cooperation program, including (1) U.S.-hosted IAEA training courses, (2) \u201cfootnote a\u201d projects, (3) placements of IAEA fellows at U.S. institutions, (4) the services of U.S. experts, and (5) support for other IAEA programs, including safeguards.

IAEA\u2019s data show that, as of August 1997, 52 of 124 member states had paid into the 1996 technical cooperation fund. The United States and Japan contributed the most, accounting for over half of the total payments to the fund. Seventy-two\u2014or 58 percent\u2014of the member states made no payments at all, yet 57 of these states received technical assistance. In a statement made to IAEA\u2019s Board of Governors in June 1996, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations System Organizations in Vienna, Austria, observed that the United States strongly believed that IAEA\u2019s technical assistance should go only to those member states that support technical assistance fully, by paying their fair share. The Ambassador further noted that, because many IAEA member states are not paying their designated share of the technical cooperation fund, some member states, including the United States and Japan, are carrying the program financially, by paying more than their share.

The Ambassador from South Africa also told us that many of the developing countries that are members of IAEA believe that funding for the technical cooperation program should be predictable and assured and have proposed that the program be funded through member states\u2019 contributions to IAEA\u2019s regular budget. The major donors do not support this proposal because they believe that the program will be adequately funded if all member states provide financial support for the program. Representatives of the major recipients of IAEA\u2019s technical assistance, including Argentina, China, Pakistan, and South Africa, told us that they are concerned that some major donors are considering reducing their voluntary contributions to IAEA, which fund the technical cooperation program. Canadian and German representatives told us that their countries may reduce their voluntary contributions to IAEA because of budget constraints. In a statement before the June 1997 meeting of IAEA\u2019s Board of Governors, the Ambassador from South Africa said that the members of the working group were deeply divided on whether to put the technical cooperation fund into IAEA\u2019s regular budget. She believed, however, that IAEA should take member states\u2019 records of payment to the technical cooperation fund into account in deciding upon requests for technical assistance.
