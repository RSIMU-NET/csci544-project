GAO's audit used a case study approach to focus on controls over three key areas: processes, people (human capital), and automated systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The processes and automated systems relied on to provide active duty pays, allowances, and tax benefits to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are so error-prone, cumbersome, and complex that neither DOD nor, more importantly, Army Reserve soldiers themselves, could be reasonably assured of timely and accurate payments. Weaknesses in these areas resulted in pay problems, including overpayments, and to a lesser extent, late and underpayments, of soldiers' active duty pays and allowances at eight Army Reserve case study units. Specifically, 332 of 348 soldiers (95 percent) we audited at eight case study units that were mobilized, deployed, and demobilized at some time during the 18-month period from August 2002 through January 2004 had at least one pay problem. Many of the soldiers had multiple problems associated with their active duty pays and allowances. Some of these problems lingered unresolved for considerable lengths of time, some for over 1 year. Further, nearly all soldiers began receiving their tax exemption benefit at least 1 month late. These pay problems often had a profound adverse impact on individual soldiers and their families. For example, soldiers were required to spend considerable time, sometimes while deployed in remote, hostile environments overseas, seeking help on pay inquiries or in correcting errors in their active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits. The processes in place to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers, involving potentially hundreds of DOD, Army, and Army Reserve organizations and thousands of personnel, were deficient with respect to (1) tracking soldiers' pay status as they transition through their active duty tours, (2) carrying out soldier readiness reviews, (3) after-the-fact report reconciliation requirements, and (4) unclear procedures for applying certain pay entitlements. With respect to human capital, weaknesses identified at our case study units included (1) insufficient resources allocated to key unit-level pay administration responsibilities, (2) inadequate training related to existing policies and procedures, and (3) poor customer service. Several automated systems issues also contributed to the significant pay errors, including nonintegrated systems and limited processing capabilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In November 2003, we reported on significant pay problems experienced  by mobilized Army National Guard soldiers, including 450 of 481 soldiers at  six case study units who had at least one pay problem associated with their  mobilization. Because of the severity of the problems identified for  mobilized Army National Guard soldiers, you asked us to examine the  accuracy and timeliness of payroll payments to mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. Specifically, the objectives of our audit were to (1) provide an in- depth perspective on the pay experiences of mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers and (2) assess the overall design of the processes, human capital,  and automated systems relied on to provide accurate and timely pays,  allowances, and tax benefits to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers.", "Our preliminary assessment of the internal control environment and the  design of key controls associated with payments to mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers indicated that the accuracy and timeliness of these  payments are highly dependent on inherently flawed processes and  controls. Active duty payments to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers rely on  many of the same Department of Defense (DOD) and Army policies and  procedures and automated systems used to pay mobilized Army National  Guard soldiers. Further, DOD has reported to Congress on major  deficiencies in the delivery of military payroll and related personnel  services, including those used to support both Army National Guard and  Army Reserve soldiers.", "Consequently, as was the case for our audit of payments to mobilized Army  National Guard soldiers, rather than statistically testing the effectiveness of  inherently flawed processes and controls, we relied primarily on a case  study approach to provide perspective on the pay experiences of mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers. We selected Army Reserve units mobilized at some  point during the period from August 2002 through January 2004 as case  studies to provide a more in-depth perspective on Army Reserve soldiers\u2019  pay experiences and their underlying causes. Our case studies included  seven Army Reserve units deployed overseas to carry out assigned combat  support missions as part of Operations Enduring Freedom or Iraqi  Freedom and one unit activated to perform services as part of critical  homeland defense operations under Operation Noble Eagle.", "We performed our work from November 2003 through June 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The  pay problems we identified were based on a comparison of soldiers\u2019 pay  records with available supporting documentation. Our audit was intended  to provide perspective on soldiers\u2019 pay experiences and may not have  identified all pay problems at our case study units. In addition, our audit  was not designed to result in an exact determination of the pay, allowances,  and tax benefits soldiers should have received. We provided the results of  our pay analysis to Army Reserve officials for an exact determination of  any amounts owed the government or soldiers related to the mobilizations  audited. A more detailed description of the scope and methodology is  included in appendix I.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of  Defense or his designee. We received written comments from the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), which are reprinted in appendix X."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Army Reserve is a partner with the active Army and the Army National  Guard in fulfilling the country's military and contingency needs. The Army  Reserve provides nearly half of the Army\u2019s combat support capabilities.  The Army Reserve has approximately 2,000 units that drill at 1,500 Army  Reserve Centers located in communities spread throughout the United  States and territories. As of May 2004, the Army Reserve reported that it  had about 328,000 members in the Ready Reserve.", "During peacetime, Army Reserve units report to the United States Army  Reserve Command (USARC), located in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Chief of  the Army Reserve, located in Washington, D.C. In addition, the Army  Reserve has established Regional Readiness Commands to provide  resource, logistics, and personnel management support for Army Reserve  units within their region. When not mobilized to active duty, Army Reserve  units are required to maintain readiness at a sufficiently high level to  facilitate prompt active duty mobilization. While in a reserve status, Army  Reserve soldiers are required to attend one drill weekend each month and  obtain a minimum amount of training (usually about 2 weeks) each year.  During national emergencies, the President has the authority to mobilize  the Army Reserve to active duty status. While mobilized, Army Reserve  units are accountable to the combatant commander of the theater in which  they are assigned to operate, and ultimately, to the President.", "On September 14, 2001, the President declared a national emergency as a  result of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon  and the continuing and immediate threat of further attacks on the United  States. Concurrent with this declaration, the President authorized the  Secretary of Defense to mobilize reserve troops to active duty pursuant to  10 U.S.C. Section 12302. The Secretary of Defense delegated to the  Secretary of the Army the authority to order Army Reserve soldiers to  active duty. Since September 2001, the Army has mobilized unprecedented  numbers of Army Reserve soldiers (as well as other reserve and national  guard forces) to active duty on lengthy tours. DOD reported that as of April  2004, about 96,000 Army Reserve soldiers have been mobilized to active  duty at some point since September 2001 to carry out critical missions.", "In contrast to the Army National Guard forces that may be assigned  traditional combat roles, Army Reserve forces are generally assigned  combat support missions. The Army National Guard and Army Reserve  both include military police and intelligence units. However, while the  Army National Guard has special forces and other units that have combat  mission assignments, Army Reserve units are generally limited to combat  support mission assignments, such as supply, medical, and transportation  operations.", "Army Reserve soldiers\u2019 mobilizations during the period of our audit were  also affected by two other Army actions. First, the Army issued a \u201cstop  loss\u201d order affecting Army Reserve soldiers in November 2002. The stop  loss order was authorized by statute and allows the Army to retain soldiers  in the service beyond their date of separation or retirement for an open- ended period. Second, in November 2003, the Army extended the orders  for all mobilized Army Reserve soldiers expected to return from active duty  on December 1, 2003, for an additional year.", "There have been three major contingency operations involving mobilized  Army Reserve soldiers since September 2001: Operation Noble Eagle,  Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In general,  missions to provide domestic defense were funded through Operation  Noble Eagle, missions to fight terrorism outside the United States were  initially funded under Operation Enduring Freedom. More recently,  missions related to the combat in Iraq and subsequent policing operations  in that region were funded under Operation Iraqi Freedom. For example,  Army Reserve soldiers participated in combat support missions in  Afghanistan that were carried out as part of Operation Enduring Freedom,  whereas Army Reserve soldiers participating in homeland security  missions, such as assisting in intelligence data analysis, were considered  part of Operation Noble Eagle.", "According to Army Reserve data, approximately 45,700 Army Reserve  soldiers were activated as of April 2004. At that time, Army Reserve  soldiers accounted for about 27 percent of all mobilized DOD reserve  components. Many of these Army Reserve soldiers were mobilized as  small units, including about 2,800 units with 10 or fewer soldiers and about  1,000 one-soldier units. The Army assigns a separate unit identification  number to each of these small groups or detachments of Army Reserve  soldiers (these units are known as derivative units). According to Army  Reserve data as of April 2004, the Army Reserve had soldiers assigned to  almost 6,000 different unit numbers.", "While on active duty, all Army Reserve soldiers earn various statutorily  authorized types of pays and allowances. The types and amounts of pays  and allowances that Army Reserve soldiers are eligible to receive vary  depending upon rank and length of service, dependency status, skills and  certifications acquired, duty location, and the difficulty of the assignment.  While Army Reserve soldiers mobilized to active duty may be entitled to  receive over 50 types of pays and allowances, we focused on 14 types of  pays and allowances applicable to the Army Reserve units we selected for  case studies. As shown in table 1, we categorized these 14 pay and  allowance types into two groups: (1) pays, including basic pay, medical and  dental and foreign language proficiency skill-based pays, and location- based hostile fire and hardship duty pays, and (2) allowances, including allowances for housing, subsistence, family separation, and cost of living  for the continental United States.", "Several of these types of pays and allowances have multiple subcategories  of entitlement. For example, there are eight different types of basic  allowances for housing that soldiers may be entitled to receive based on  individual circumstances and documentation (including documents  establishing dependency status or court documents). In addition, Army  Reserve soldiers may be eligible for significant tax advantages associated  with their mobilization to active duty. Mobilized Army Reserve soldiers  assigned to or working in a designated combat zone are entitled to exclude  from taxable income certain types of military pays that would otherwise be  taxable.", "In addition to the complexities of determining and documenting the  specific circumstances surrounding each individual soldier\u2019s initial active  duty pay, allowance, and tax benefit entitlements, these types of pays and  benefits are further complicated because entitlements vary depending on  soldiers\u2019 locations as they move through their active duty tours. That is,  maintaining effective accountability and paying mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers as they move from location to location during their active duty  tours require extensive close coordination among a variety of operational,  personnel, finance, and pay organizations throughout DOD. Key  components requiring closely coordinated efforts in this worldwide team  are the  mobilized soldier;  unit commanders and unit administrators for all mobilized Army   United States Army Reserve Pay Center located at Fort McCoy;  Army Reserve Pay Management Division at Fort McPherson;  12 Army Reserve Regional Readiness Commands;  U.S. Army Finance Command;  personnel and finance offices at Army mobilization stations;  Army area servicing finance offices assigned to support deployed units;   personnel and finance offices at Army demobilization stations;  Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) at Indianapolis,   DFAS at Denver, Colorado; and  DFAS at Cleveland, Ohio.", "As shown in figure 1, three key phases are associated with the pays and  allowances applicable to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers:   (1) mobilization: starting applicable active duty pays and allowances,   (2) deployment: starting and stopping applicable location-based active duty  pays while continuing other nonlocation-based active duty pay and  allowance entitlements, and (3) demobilization: stopping active duty pays  and allowances."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mobilization Phase", "paragraphs": ["During the initial mobilization, units receive an alert order and begin a  mobilization preparation program, Soldier Readiness Processing (SRP).  Among other things, the SRP is intended to ensure that each soldier\u2019s  financial records are in order. The initial SRP is to be conducted by the  unit\u2019s administrator at the unit\u2019s home station assisted by personnel from  the cognizant Army Reserve Regional Readiness Command or designee.  This initial SRP is to include a verification of the accuracy of records  supporting applicable active duty pays and allowances. The unit  commander, supported by the unit administrator, is responsible for  ensuring that all personnel data, such as birth certificates for dependents  or foreign language certifications, are current for all soldiers under their  command.", "During this phase, the unit administrator is required to gather all  supporting documents and send the documentation to the Reserve Pay  Center at Fort McCoy. Pay technicians at the Reserve Pay Center are  responsible for entering transactions to start initiating basic pay and  allowances for mobilized Army Reserve soldiers based on the active duty  tour information that appears on a hard copy of each soldier\u2019s mobilization  order. If transactions are entered correctly and on time, activated Army  Reserve soldiers will automatically start to receive basic pay and basic  allowances for housing and subsistence based on the entered active duty  mobilization start date.", "After soldiers complete their initial SRP, they travel as a unit to an assigned  active duty Army mobilization station. At the mobilization station,  mobilized Army Reserve soldiers are required to undergo a second SRP. As  part of this second SRP, finance personnel at the mobilization station are  responsible for confirming or correcting the results of the first SRP,  including obtaining the documentation necessary to support any changes  needed to the automated pay records. Pay technicians at the various Army  mobilization stations are required to promptly initiate appropriate active  duty pay and allowance transactions that were not initiated during the first  SRP.

The Army  area servicing finance office, which may be within the United States or in a  foreign country, is responsible for initiating pays earned while the soldier is  located in certain specified locations, such as location-based pays for  hostile fire and hardship duty. Pay technicians at these area servicing  finance offices are responsible for starting these types of pays for each  soldier based on documentation, such as annotated battle rosters or flight  manifests, showing when soldiers arrived at these designated locations.  Thereafter, hostile fire pay is automatically generated each pay period until  an established end-of-tour date is reached or a pay technician manually  stops the pay. In contrast, other location-based pays, such as hardship duty  pay, require manual entry of pay transactions each month by the assigned  Army area servicing finance office.", "While the designated Army area servicing finance offices have primary  responsibility for administering pay for deployed Army Reserve soldiers,  particularly starting and stopping location-based active duty pays (such as  hardship duty pay), finance personnel at the cognizant mobilization station  or at the Reserve Pay Center can also enter certain pay-altering  transactions that occur during deployments, such as those related to a  soldier\u2019s early separation from active duty.

These automated systems are  the Defense Joint Military Pay System \u2013 Reserve Component (DJMS- RC)\u2014a DFAS-operated system used to pay reserve soldiers;  the Defense Military Pay Office (DMO)\u2014data input system used to enter  pay transactions for processing;   the Army Reserve\u2019s Regional Level Application System (RLAS),  including its personnel order-writing functions;  the Total Army Personnel Database\u2013Reserves (TAPDB-R);  the Army\u2019s Tactical Personnel System; and   the Army\u2019s Transition Processing (TRANSPROC) System.", "Many of these systems were originally designed for other purposes, but  have been adapted to help support payments to mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. For example, DJMS-RC, a large, complex automated payroll  system application now used to pay Army and Air National Guard and  Army and Air Force Reserve soldiers, was originally designed to be used to  pay Reserve and Guard soldiers for monthly drills, short periods (30 days  or fewer) of active duty or training. DFAS has acknowledged that its  current military pay systems (including DJMS-RC) are aging, unresponsive,  fragile, and a major impediment to efficient and high-quality customer  service.", "DFAS has primary responsibility for developing guidance and managing  system operations for DJMS-RC. DFAS-Denver is responsible for designing,  developing, and maintaining customer requirements for all of DOD\u2019s  military pay services. Its Technical Support Office is responsible for  designing and maintaining the DJMS-RC core pay software. DFAS- Indianapolis is the central site for oversight of all Army military pay. As  such, DFAS-Indianapolis is responsible for maintaining an estimated   1 million Army soldier pay records, including those for Army Reserve  soldiers. DFAS-Indianapolis serves as a \u201cgatekeeper\u201d for DJMS-RC in that it  monitors the daily status of data uploaded to the system to ensure that all  received transactions are processed.", "After manual entry of the mobilization dates from hard copies of  mobilization orders into DJMS-RC, DJMS-RC is designed to automatically  generate most active duty pay and allowance payments based on the  mobilization date, twice a month, until the stop date is entered into the  system. Without additional manual intervention, DJMS-RC will  automatically stop generating these active duty payments to Army Reserve  soldiers as of the stop date recorded in DJMS-RC. This automated edit  control feature is intended to prevent erroneous payments to soldiers  beyond their authorized end of active duty date. Because pay and  personnel systems are not integrated, human intervention and additional  manual data entry are required when a pay or allowance error is detected  or an event occurs that requires a change in the soldier\u2019s pay-related  personnel and pay records. For example, a change in dependent status,  such as marriage or divorce; a promotion; jump pay disqualification; or  being demobilized before the active duty tour end date shown on a soldier\u2019s  original mobilization order would necessitate manual input to  appropriately change or eliminate some of the pays and allowances a  soldier would be entitled to receive.", "All Army Reserve soldier pays and allowances are to be documented in the  Master Military Pay Account\u2014the central repository for soldier pay  records in DJMS-RC. All pay-related transactions that are entered into  DJMS-RC, primarily through the DMO input application, update the Master  Military Pay Account.

DMO is used to manually enter  transactions to (1) initiate any Army Reserve soldier pay and allowances  that were not started at initial mobilization, as well as applicable location- based pays, such as hostile fire and hardship duty pays, (2) stop all  location-based pays when soldiers depart designated locations, and   (3) stop all active duty pays and allowances at demobilization.", "In addition to DJMS-RC and DMO, the Army Reserve relies on four other  nonintegrated automated systems as a basis for authorizing active duty pay,  allowance, and related benefit entitlements to mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers:  RLAS is operated at the Army Reserve\u2019s regional support locations and  contains multiple modules to support regional human resource,  resource management, and training operations for Army Reserve  soldiers. The personnel module within RLAS is used to process Army  Reserve personnel actions, including those that have an impact on pay,  such as promotions and discharges. Within the personnel module, there  is an order-writing sub-module used for writing and generating  mobilization orders for individual Army Reserve soldiers. Army Reserve  soldier data in the personnel module of RLAS is used by the RLAS order- writing sub-module to help create the individual orders for mobilized  soldiers.", "TAPDB-R is the central repository for Army Reserve-wide personnel  data.

Specifically, we identified 256 Army Reserve  soldiers who were overpaid their active duty pay and allowance  entitlements by about $247,000, 245 soldiers who received late pay and  allowance payments of about $77,000, and 294 soldiers who were  underpaid their pay and allowance entitlements by about $51,000. As  discussed in the following sections, we found that these pay problems were  associated with a series of processes, human capital issues, and automated  system deficiencies.", "The Army Reserve units we audited for our case studies had various  functions, including a Quartermaster (supply), dental services,  transportation, military police, and military intelligence unit. These units  were assigned a variety of combat support missions associated with the  global war on terrorism while mobilized on active duty in and around Iraq,  Afghanistan, Qatar, and Kuwait and in support of intelligence operations  here in the United States. The units we audited, their locations, and  information about their mobilizations are shown in table 2.", "Overall, 332 of the 348 soldiers (95 percent) in our eight case study units  that were mobilized, deployed, and demobilized at some time during the 18- month period from August 2002 through January 2004 had at least one pay  problem associated with their mobilization to active duty. Many of the  soldiers had multiple pay problems associated with their active duty  mobilizations. Problems lingered unresolved for considerable lengths of  time. For example, for some soldiers, problems lingered through the entire  period of their active duty mobilization and for several months after their  active duty tours ended. Table 3 summarizes the number of Army Reserve  soldiers at each of our case study locations that had at least one problem  associated with their pays and allowances during each of the three phases  of their active duty mobilization.", "We counted soldiers\u2019 pay problems as a problem only in the phase in which  the problem first occurred, even if the problems persisted into subsequent  phases. In addition, many soldiers had more than one problem associated  with their entitled pays and allowances. Further, our case study audits  reflect only the problems we identified. However, because our audits were  only intended to provide more detailed perspective on the types and causes  of any pay problems experienced by mobilized Army Reserve soldiers,  rather than an exact calculation of what soldiers should have received, we  likely did not identify all of the active duty pay and allowance problems  related to our case study units.", "In addition to pay and allowance problems, while we did not attempt to  fully quantify the tax withholding and tax filing effects, we also identified  problems with timeliness and accuracy of combat zone tax exclusion  benefits for soldiers with the seven case study units we audited that were  deployed overseas in Kuwait, Afghanistan, Qatar, or Iraq. Specifically, while  soldiers in these units were eligible to receive their pays and allowances  tax free when they first arrived in-theater, almost all failed to receive this  benefit until at least a month after arrival. Over- and underpayment of  active duty pays and allowances for soldiers deployed in designated  combat zones adversely impacted the accuracy and timeliness of soldiers\u2019  combat zone tax exclusion benefits.", "Establishing the exact amount owed and collecting overpayments of active  duty pays and allowances erroneously provided to soldiers placed an  additional administrative burden on both the individual soldiers and DOD.  Soldiers were sometimes required to spend considerable time and were  frustrated in their efforts to determine the exact sums owed or to establish  a repayment plan. For example, it took one soldier over a year and about 20  phone calls, e-mails, and faxes to identify and resolve the active duty  overpayments and related tax benefits he received. In other instances, we  identified soldiers who received extensive improper active duty payments,  sometimes for over a year, but who may not have contacted anyone within  DOD to stop these erroneous overpayments. These soldiers received  significant overpayments, but did not acknowledge their receipt or set  aside sufficient funds to repay these erroneous overpayments. In these  instances, the soldiers may be subject to criminal prosecution. For  example, we identified a soldier who did not mobilize with his unit, yet  received over $36,000 in active duty pay and allowances for over a year.  When questioned, the soldier stated he was not aware that he had received  $36,000 in erroneous pay and could not immediately pay back all the  erroneous active duty overpayments he received. We referred this, and  other similar cases, to the Army\u2019s Criminal Investigation Division for  further investigation into whether criminal prosecution of these soldiers  may be warranted for attempting to fraudulently convert government funds  to personal use.", "Further, these overpayment debts placed an additional labor-intensive  burden on the Army and DFAS. Determining the exact amounts soldiers  owed as a result of overpayments, particularly when the combat zone tax  exclusion benefits were involved, required labor-intensive efforts to gather  necessary supporting documentation (in some instances from multiple  locations) and compare these data with pay and tax withholdings,  sometimes spanning more than 1 year, to manually compute amounts owed  as a result of erroneous overpayments. In addition, DFAS was required to  track and monitor collections from soldiers against these debts. Collection  of these debts may become more difficult the longer they remain  outstanding. For example, Army auditors reported in 2003 that, to the  extent that soldiers leave the Army with outstanding debts, collection rates  are only about 40 percent.", "Examples of pay and allowance problems found through our audits of  soldiers\u2019 pay experiences at the eight case study units included the  following:  Forty-seven soldiers deployed overseas with the 824th Quartermaster  Company from North Carolina improperly received several months of  hardship duty pay, totaling about $30,000, for several months after they  left Kuwait.", "Nine soldiers of the 824th Quartermaster Company improperly received  family separation allowance payments totaling an estimated $6,250  while serving at Fort Bragg, their unit\u2019s home station.", "Forty-nine soldiers with the 824th Quartermaster Company did not  receive the hardship duty pay they were entitled to receive when they  arrived at their designated duty locations overseas until about 3 months  after their arrival. Subsequently, they continued to erroneously receive  hardship duty pay for 5 consecutive months after departure from their  overseas duty locations.", "Ten soldiers with the 443rd Military Police Company had problems with  their overseas housing allowance associated with their deployment in  Iraq, including five soldiers who were underpaid about $2,700 and seven  who did not receive their last allowance until more than 2 months after  their active duty tour ended.", "A soldier with the 443rd Military Police Company who demobilized from  an active duty deployment in August 2002, subsequently received  erroneous active duty payments of about $52,000 through May 2004.  These erroneous payments were not detected and stopped by DOD. The  soldier contacted us to ask for our assistance in resolving this matter.", "A soldier from the 965th Dental Company who received an emergency  evacuation from Kuwait as a result of an adverse reaction to anthrax  and antibiotic inoculations he received in preparing for his overseas  deployment, continued to receive about $2,900 in improper hostile fire  and hardship duty payments after his return from Kuwait.", "A soldier with the 3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment did not  receive an estimated $3,000 in family separation allowance payments  associated with his active duty mobilization.", "Further, seven of our eight units were deployed overseas during their  mobilization. Almost all the soldiers in these seven units had problems with  the timeliness of their combat zone tax exclusion benefits. All the soldiers  at our seven case study units who were deployed overseas experienced  problems with the late receipt of their combat zone tax benefits because  DJMS-RC could not simply stop withholding federal taxes, but instead had  to first withhold the taxes and then in the following month\u2019s pay  processing, reimburse the soldier the taxes previously withheld. As a  result, soldiers generally did not benefit from the tax exemption for at least  one month after their tax withholdings should have ceased. In addition to  this systemic issue, we identified other problems associated with these  benefits with respect to the soldiers at our case study units:  Twenty of the 20 soldiers with the 948th Forward Surgical Team waited  over 2 months after they arrived in Afghanistan to benefit from the  combat zone tax exclusion.", "It took nearly a year to identify and resolve a $1,100 overpayment  associated with one soldier\u2019s combat zone tax exclusion benefit.", "Several soldiers with Maryland\u2019s 443rd Military Police Company never  received the correct amount of reimbursement for taxes withheld,  which sometimes resulted in underwithholding taxes, and other times  resulted in overwithholding taxes.", "These pay mistakes were the source of many complaints, took  considerable time and effort to address, and were likely to have had an  adverse effect on soldier morale. In addition, soldiers at one of our case  study units told us that a delay in receiving their active duty pays and  allowances created financial hardship for them and their families.  Specifically, several of the unit\u2019s soldiers told us they could not pay their  bills when they were initially deployed overseas and were forced to borrow  money from friends and relatives in order to meet their financial  obligations.", "We provided data on the pay problems we identified to Army Reserve  officials.

To  effectively account for soldiers\u2019 movements during these transitions, unit  commanders, unit administrators, as well as individuals assigned to  personnel and finance offices across the Army Reserves, Army  mobilization stations, and in-theater Army locations must work closely and  communicate extensively to have the necessary data to pay Army Reserve  soldiers accurately and on time throughout their active duty tours.", "However, we identified several critical flaws in the soldier accountability  procedures in place during the period of our audit.

For example, an  Army Reserve soldier assigned to support Air Force operations did not  process through, or have any access to, an Army location that could  provide a manifest showing his arrival date in-country to local Army area  servicing finance office officials so that they could start his location-based  pays. In this case, the soldier did not receive his location-based pays until  he returned to his demobilization station and insisted that personnel at that  location take the actions necessary to start this payment.

As a result,  missing or outdated documentation required to support active duty pays  and allowances at the time of the 824th Quartermaster Company\u2019s SRP  contributed to some of the late payments we identified. For example, one  soldier with this unit who was certified as ready for mobilization as a result  of the SRP, did not receive entitled family separation allowance payments  because documentation necessary to start this allowance was not  submitted as part of the SRP process. Six months later, after the soldier  demobilized at Fort Bragg, the paperwork necessary to receive this  allowance was obtained and submitted for payment.

Personnel at the Fort Lee mobilization station did not carry out a  detailed review of Master Military Pay Account records, which would have  shown that soldiers with the unit would stop receiving their entitled  housing allowances and family separation allowances because there were  incorrect end dates for these payments entered into DJMS-RC. As a result,  several soldiers from the 443rd Military Police Company had their basic  allowance for housing switched to a rate less than the soldiers were  entitled to receive and had their family separation allowance stopped for a  period during their deployment because the Fort Lee mobilization station  finance personnel did not take action necessary to extend the end-of- eligibility dates for these two entitlements.", "In contrast, pay support documentation review procedures in place as part  of the SRP at the Army\u2019s mobilization stations at Fort McCoy and Fort  Eustis provided that, in addition to a unitwide finance briefing, finance  officials at those sites were to conduct one-on-one pay support  documentation reviews with each soldier.

However, the finance personnel at that location were unable to  help resolve the 948th Forward Surgical Team\u2019s pay problems because they  said they had not had training in this area and were not familiar with DJMS- RC processing requirements and procedures. All 20 soldiers with the 948th  Forward Surgical Team experienced pay problems associated with their  location-based payments related to their deployment in Afghanistan,  including hardship duty pay. These payments require manual entry every  month by the unit\u2019s area servicing finance office.", "Further, we saw little evidence that the unit commanders of our case study  units received any training for their role in supporting their unit  administrators in these important pay management responsibilities. For  example, at one of our case study units, the 965th Dental Company, the unit  commander informed us that he did not support the review of pay  management reports because soldiers had the capability to review their pay  online and would use this capability to identify and report any pay  problems.

Servicing  soldiers and their families with pay inquiries and problems is particularly  critical in light of the error-prone processes and limited automated system  processing capabilities. Ultimately, pay accuracy is left largely to the  individual soldier.", "Although there are several sources that soldiers can turn to for pay issue  resolution, soldiers at our case study units experienced problems in  accessing these sources. Sources that soldiers can contact include their  home unit, the military pay section of the cognizant RRC, the  mobilization/demobilization station, the designated active Army area  servicing finance office in-theater, the online myPay system, and the 1-888- PAY-ARMY (729-2769) toll-free number. However, mission requirements  and the distance between deployment locations and field finance offices  often impaired the soldiers\u2019 ability to utilize the in-theater customer service  centers. Also, soldiers did not always have Internet and telephone access to  use the myPay system or to contact customer service sources such as 1- 888-PAY-ARMY, the home unit, or the cognizant RRC. The lack of Internet  access for deployed soldiers was particularly problematic because it  limited soldiers\u2019 access to pay, allowance, and tax benefit data reflected in  their leave and earnings statements. Lacking leave and earnings  statements, soldiers had no means to determine the propriety of their  active duty payments. For example, soldiers with the 948th Forward  Surgical Team told us that their inability to access the leave and earnings  statements adversely affected their overall morale.", "Even when mobilized reservists were able to contact customer service  sources, their pay issues often continued because the office they were  instructed to contact was unable to address their inquiry or correct their  problem. In some cases, customer service sources failed to help soldiers  because they lacked an understanding of what was needed to fix the  problems. When representatives of the 948th Forward Surgical Team  contacted their parent company for help in correcting pay problems,  personnel with the parent company informed them that they could not fix  the unit\u2019s pay problems because they (incorrectly) believed that the unit  was paid through the Army\u2019s active duty Army system. Soldiers at other  units were redirected from one source to another. Soldiers were not aware  of which sources could address which types of problems, and more  significantly, the customer service sources themselves often did not know  who should correct a specific problem.", "An Army Reserve major\u2019s experience illustrates the time and frustration  that was sometimes involved with soldiers\u2019 attempts to obtain customer  service for correcting errors in active duty pays, allowances, and related  tax benefits.", "Individual Case Illustration: Extensive, Time-consuming Action  Required to Resolve Pay Issue A soldier from Maryland was mobilized in March 2003 from the Army\u2019s  Individual Ready Reserve to active duty to serve as a liaison between the  Army and Air Force to help coordinate ground and air combat operations  in Iraq. After completing his 2-month active duty tour and returning to an  inactive reserve status in May 2003, he contacted Army officials to inform  them that he was continuing to receive active duty payments and  volunteered to immediately repay these erroneous overpayments. In July  2003, he wrote a check for $6,150.75 after receiving documentation  showing his debt computation. However, he continued to receive Leave  and Earnings Statements indicating that he had an outstanding debt. He  contacted his Army demobilization finance office to determine how to get  the erroneous outstanding debt removed from his pay records. After  being referred by officials at that location to various DFAS locations  (including once being told, \u201cThere is nothing more I can do for you.\u201d), he  contacted us for assistance. After DFAS recomputed the soldier\u2019s debt as  a result of our inquiry, the soldier was informed that he owed an  additional $1,140.54, because the original debt computation did not fully  consider the erroneous combat zone tax exclusion benefits he received.  Overall, he spent nearly a year after his 2-month active duty tour ended,  and about 20 phone calls, faxes, and letters in contacting at least seven  different DOD representatives at five different customer service centers  to correct active duty pay and allowance overpayments and associated  combat zone tax exclusion benefit problems.", "Finally, soldiers expressed concern about the treatment they sometimes  received while attempting to obtain customer service. Soldiers felt that  certain customer service representatives did not treat soldiers requesting  assistance with respect. For example, one soldier who attempted to make  corrections to his DD Form 214, Certificate of Discharge or Release from  Active Duty, informed us that mobilization station personnel told him that  the citations and dates of service he was trying to add \u201cdidn\u2019t matter\u201d and  that he could fix them later. Additionally, some soldiers told us that while  they raised concerns about the quality of customer service they received  with respect to their pay inquiries and concerns, they were sometimes  ignored. For example, soldiers with Connecticut\u2019s 3423rd Military  Intelligence Detachment told us that while they contacted the local  Inspector General when they believed that finance personnel at their  deployment location had both actively tried to impair the payment of their  active duty entitlements and had tried to intimidate and discourage the  unit\u2019s soldiers from seeking help elsewhere, they were not aware of any  action taken as a result of their concerns. As a result, soldiers with the unit  told us they believed they had no recourse but to accept the poor treatment  they believed they received."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Automated Systems Deficiencies Constrain Accurate and Timely Payments", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in automated systems contributed significantly to the  underpayments, overpayments, and late payments we identified.

In addition, similar to the Army National  Guard, the Army Reserve\u2019s personnel and order-writing systems are not  integrated with the pay system. Consequently, many of the systems  problems experienced by mobilized Army Reserve soldiers were similar to  those that we identified in our report on pay issues associated with  mobilized Army National Guard soldiers.", "Because of the automated systems weaknesses, both Army Reserve and  active Army personnel must put forth significant manual effort to  accurately process pays and allowances for mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. Moreover, to compensate for the lack of automated controls over  the pay process, both DFAS and the Army place substantial reliance on the  review of pay reports to identify pay errors after the fact. Part of this  reliance includes the expectation that soldiers review their own leave and  earnings statements, even though these statements do not always provide  clear explanations of all payments made. Finally, because of DJMS-RC\u2019s  limitations, the system cannot simply stop withholding taxes for soldiers in  designated combat zone locations.

In an effectively integrated  system, changes to personnel records automatically update related payroll  records from a single source of data input. While not as efficient as an  integrated system, an automatic personnel-to-payroll system interface can  also reduce errors caused by repetitive manual data entry into more than  one system.", "Because of the lack of effective integration or interfaces among key  personnel and pay systems, pay-affecting data recorded in the personnel  system are not automatically updated in the pay system. Therefore, pay- affecting personnel changes recorded in the personnel system must be re- entered into the pay system from hard copies of documents, such as  soldiers\u2019 mobilization orders. We found numerous instances in which pay- affecting personnel information was not entered promptly into the pay  system, resulting in numerous pay errors.", "Individual Case Illustration: Overpayment due to Lack of  Integrated Personnel and Pay Systems A soldier assigned to an Illinois Military Police Company received a  mobilization order in December 2002 to report to Fort Dix, New Jersey.  Data from her individual mobilization order were entered into DJMS-RC  and she began receiving active duty pays and allowances based on the  active duty mobilization date shown in her mobilization order. However,  her mobilization order was revoked in early January 2003 after she was  found to be ineligible for mobilization. But, because of the lack of  integration or an effective interface between personnel and pay systems,  this order was not automatically processed in DJMS-RC to stop the  soldier\u2019s active duty pay. Consequently, the soldier was overpaid from  December 2002 through May 2004. Overpayments to the soldier totaled  over $24,000.", "We found several instances in which soldiers that were promoted while on  active duty did not receive their pay raises when they should have because  the promotion information was not promptly recorded in DJMS-RC. For  example, one Army Reserve soldier\u2019s promotion was effective on July 1,  2003. However, the soldier\u2019s promotion was not processed in the pay  system until October 2003, which delayed an increase in both his basic pay  and basic allowance for housing. The soldier finally received his promotion  pay, including back pay, in late October 2003, resulting in late payments  totaling over $2,700.", "Lacking an effective interface between pay and personnel systems, DOD  and the Army must rely on after-the-fact detective controls, such as pay and  personnel system data reconciliations, to identify and correct pay errors  occurring as a result of mismatches between personnel (TAPDB-R) and pay  system (DJMS-RC) data. In this regard, the Army Reserve has an automated  reconciliation tool\u2014the Participation Management and Reporting  Subsystem (PMARS)\u2014to help identify data inconsistencies between pay  and personnel systems. Specifically, the Army Reserve uses PMARS to  identify mismatches of soldiers accounted for in one system and not in the  other, and to compare the systems\u2019 information on individual soldiers, such  as their ranks and dates of service.

Therefore, hardship duty pay  had to be manually input every month for eligible soldiers. As previously  discussed, reliance on manual processing is more prone to payment errors  than automated processing.", "We found that nearly all soldiers in our case studies who were eligible for  hardship duty pay experienced problems with this pay, including late  payments, underpayments, and overpayments. For example, the 965th  Dental Company\u2019s soldiers at Seagoville, Texas, experienced both  underpayments and overpayments. Specifically, all 85 soldiers deployed to  Kuwait were underpaid a total of approximately $8,000 for hardship duty  pay they were entitled to receive during their deployment overseas.  Subsequently, 76 of the unit\u2019s soldiers were overpaid a total of almost  $47,000 because they continued to receive hardship duty payments for  more than 6 months after they had left the designated hardship duty  location.", "Both underpayments and overpayments, as well as late payments, of  hardship duty pay occurred largely because of the reliance on manual  processing of this pay every month. The errors often occurred because  local area servicing finance office personnel did not receive accurate or  timely documentation such as flight manifests or data from the Tactical  Personnel System indicating when soldiers arrived or left the designated  hardship duty location. As a result, finance personnel did not start these  payments on time, and did not stop these payments as of the end of the  soldiers\u2019 active duty tour date recorded in DJMS-RC.", "The DJMS-RC system processing limitation that led to using the systems\u2019  miscellaneous code to process hardship duty pay, also contributed to  overpayments of this active duty pay. That is, finance personnel mistakenly  continued to manually enter transactions to process hardship duty pay to  soldiers beyond soldiers\u2019 end of active tour dates because DFAS had no  way of implementing a system edit that could identify and stop erroneous  hardship duty pay while permitting other types of transactions processed  using this code to continue.", "Similarly, no edit was in place to prevent duplicate payments of hardship  duty pay. As a result, hardship duty pay could be entered more than once  for a soldier in a given month without detection. From our case studies, we  identified three soldiers who each received two hardship duty payments for  one month. None of these duplicate payments was identified or collected  until we submitted inquiries about these soldiers\u2019 payments to the Reserve  Pay Center. In addition, we were told that soldiers had difficulty  determining that they received duplicate hardship duty payments because  this type of payment was not clearly identified on their leave and earnings  statement.", "Use of the miscellaneous payment code also made it difficult for soldiers to  understand, and determine the propriety of, some of the payments  reflected on their leave and earnings statements. Hardship duty pay and  other payments that are processed using the miscellaneous payment code  are reported on leave and earnings statements as \u201cother credits.\u201d  Furthermore, the leave and earnings statements did not provide any  additional information about what the \u201cother credits\u201d were for unless pay  clerks entered additional explanations in the \u201cremarks\u201d section of the  statement, which they rarely did. As a result, soldiers often had no means  to determine if these types of payments were accurate.", "Unit commanders told us that they relied on soldiers to identify any pay  problems based on their review of their leave and earnings statements.

Soldiers are entitled to  the combat zone tax exclusion for any month in which the soldier performs active service in a designated combat zone area. For any applicable  month, this benefit applies to the entire month, rather than being prorated  based on the number of days the soldier was in the combat zone.", "However, because DJMS-RC was designed as a pay system for inactive  Army Reserve soldiers, it does not have the processing capability to  suspend withholding of federal and state income taxes applicable to pay  that is ordinarily taxable. Instead, as a workaround procedure to  compensate for this limitation, the system first improperly withholds taxes  applicable to payments made while soldiers are in a combat zone, then  later reimburses soldiers for these withheld amounts in the following  month. For example, when an Army Reserve soldier is assigned to a  location where he is entitled to receive tax-free active duty pays, DJMS-RC  (improperly) withholds taxes from at least the soldier\u2019s first one or two  active duty payments. Subsequently, during the first pay cycle of the  following month, DJMS-RC reimburses the soldier for the amount of taxes  improperly withheld during the previous month. As a result of this  workaround process, all Army Reserve soldiers who served in a combat  zone received their combat zone tax exclusion benefit at least one month  late.", "DJMS-RC processing limitations cause further delays in soldiers\u2019 receipt of  entitled combat zone tax benefits when soldiers arrived in a combat zone  after the midmonth cutoff, which is approximately on the 7th day of each  month. In these cases, entitlement to the tax exclusion is not recognized  until the following month, which then delays the soldier\u2019s receipt of his  combat zone tax benefit until the next month\u2014the third month the soldier  is deployed in the combat zone. For example, members of the 824th  Quartermaster Company that deployed to Afghanistan arrived in country  on July 14, 2003, but did not receive their first combat zone tax exclusion  reimbursements until early October, almost 3 months after they became  eligible for the exclusion."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Actions Should Result in Improvements", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the Army have reported a number of relatively recent positive  actions with respect to processes, human capital practices, and automated  systems that, if implemented as reported, should improve the accuracy and  timeliness of active duty pays, allowances, and related tax benefits  provided to mobilized Army Reserve soldiers.

One of the purposes of  this guidance is to eliminate any questions regarding which DOD entity is  responsible for resolving a soldier\u2019s pay issues or questions. Further, as of  January 2004, DOD reported establishing a new procedure under which  DFAS assumed responsibility (from the Army finance offices located in  various overseas locations) for all monthly manual entry of mobilized Army  Reserve and Army National Guard soldiers\u2019 location-based hardship duty  pay.", "DOD also reported completing several actions related to our previous  recommendations to improve the human capital practices related to  payments to mobilized Army soldiers. For example, the Army reported that  it had taken action to provide additional training for Army finance  personnel at overseas finance locations, mobilization and demobilization  stations, and for those Army finance personnel scheduled for deployment.  This training is directed at better ensuring that these personnel are  adequately trained on existing and new pay eligibility and pay processing  requirements for mobilized Army National Guard and Army Reserve  soldiers. DOD also reported establishing a new policy in January 2004  directed at more clearly affixing responsibility for addressing soldiers\u2019 pay  problems or inquiries. Under this new policy, the Army National Guard  established a pay ombudsman to serve as the single focal point for ensuring  coordinated, prompt customer service on all Army National Guard soldiers\u2019  pay problems.

For  example, in response to our recommendations in the Army National Guard  report, DOD reported taking actions to (1) automate manual monthly  hardship duty pay in April 2004, (2) eliminate the use of the miscellaneous  code for processing hardship duty pay and instead process these payments  using a unique transaction code to facilitate implementing a system edit to  identify and stop erroneous payments, (3) compare active duty release  dates in the Army\u2019s system used to generate Release From Active Duty  orders with soldiers\u2019 end of active duty tour dates shown in DJMS-RC to  identify and stop any erroneous active duty pays, and (4) increase the  reliability and timeliness of documentation used to support soldiers\u2019 arrival  at and departure from designated overseas locations.", "However, DOD has not yet fully addressed, and consequently we are  reiterating two of our previous recommendations directed at interim  automated system improvements and one of our longer-term system  improvement recommendations.

We also used the internal control standards provided in the Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government.", "We applied the policies and procedures prescribed in these documents to  the observed and documented procedures and practices followed by the  various DOD components involved in providing active duty pay to Army  Reserve soldiers. We also interviewed officials from USARC, RRCs, Army  Reserve Regional Readiness Commands, Army Central Command, Army  and DOD military pay and personnel offices, Army Finance Command,  DFAS, and unit commanders and unit administrators to obtain an  understanding of their experiences in applying these policies and  procedures. From these interviews, we also obtained information on  examples of recent mobilized Army Reserve pay problems they  encountered in the course of their work.", "In addition, as part of our audit, we performed a review of selected edit and  validation checks in DJMS-RC. Specifically, we obtained documentation  and performed walk-throughs associated with DJMS-RC edits performed  on pay status/active duty change transactions, such as those to ensure that  tour start and stop dates matched MMPA dates and that the soldier cannot  be paid basic pay and allowances beyond the stop date that was entered  into DJMS-RC. We also obtained documentation on and performed walk- throughs of the recently implemented personnel-to-pay system interface  process, the order writing-to-pay system interface process, and on the  process for entering mobilization information into the pay system. We did  not independently test DOD\u2019s reported edit and validation checks in DJMS- RC, but we held interviews with officials from U.S. Army Reserve  Headquarters, Army Finance Command, and DFAS-Indianapolis to  supplement our documentation and walk-throughs.", "Because our preliminary assessment determined that current operations  used to pay mobilized Army Reserve soldiers relied extensively on error- prone manual entry of transactions into multiple, nonintegrated systems,  we did not statistically test current processes and controls. Instead, we  used a case study approach to provide a more detailed perspective of the  nature of any deficiencies in the three key areas of processes, people  (human capital), and automated systems relied on to pay mobilized Army  Reserve soldiers. Specifically, we gathered available data and analyzed the  pay experiences of Army Reserve soldiers mobilized to and demobilized  from active duty in support of Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom,  and Iraqi Freedom during the period from August 2002 through January  2004. We audited the pay experiences of soldiers in the following eight  Army Reserve units as case studies of the effectiveness of the processes,  human capital practices, and automated systems in place over active duty  pays, allowances, and related tax benefits:  824th Quartermaster Company, Fort Bragg, N.C.   965th Dental Company, Seagoville, Tex.  948th Forward Surgical Team, Southfield, Mich.  443rd Military Police Company, Owings Mills, Md.", "FORSCOM Support Unit, Finksburg, Md.  629th Transportation Detachment, Fort Eustis, Va.  3423rd Military Intelligence Detachment, New Haven, Conn.  431st Chemical Detachment, Johnstown, Pa.", "From the population of Army Reserve units mobilized and demobilized  between August 2002 and January 2004, we selected units from various  specialties that represented the wide variety of missions performed by the  Army Reserve during wartime. These case studies are presented to provide  a more detailed view of the types and causes of any pay problems  experienced by these units as well as the financial impact of pay problems  on individual soldiers and their families.", "We used mobilization data supplied by the Army Reserve Headquarters  Operations Center to assist us in selecting the eight units we used as our  case studies. We did not independently verify the reliability of the  Operations Center database. We used the data to select RRCs that had a  large number of activated Reserve units that had mobilized, deployed, and  returned from their tour of active duty in support of Operations Noble  Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. From the list of units  assigned to these Readiness Commands, we selected our eight case studies  that had a variety of deployment locations and missions, including both  overseas and continental U.S. deployments. In addition to our case studies,  during our visits to Army mobilization locations, we interviewed small  numbers of soldiers currently in the process of returning from active duty  to obtain their perspectives on their experiences with active duty pays,  allowances, and related tax benefits.", "We also obtained testimonial data from soldiers at several of our case study  units. We asked numerous soldiers at these units to discuss pay-related  experiences during their deployment. The information we obtained during  these interviews is presented to provide further insight into the pay  experiences of Army Reserve soldiers who were mobilized under current  military operations, but is not intended to be representative of the views of  all soldiers in their units nor of those of Army Reserve soldiers overall.", "We used DJMS-RC pay transaction extracts for the period from August 2002  through January 2004 to identify pay problems associated with our case  study units. However, we did not perform an exact calculation of the net  pay soldiers should have received in comparison with what DJMS-RC  records show they received. Rather, we used available documentation and  follow-up inquiries with cognizant personnel at the Army Reserve  Command, Regional Readiness Commands, and the Reserve Pay Center at  Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, to determine if (1) soldiers\u2019 entitled active duty pay  and allowances were received within 30 days of their initial mobilization  date, (2) soldiers were paid within 30 days of the date they became eligible  for active duty pay, allowances, and entitlements associated with their  deployment locations, and (3) soldiers stopped receiving active duty pay  and allowances as of the date of their demobilization from active duty. For  the pay problems we identified, we counted them as problems only in the  phase (mobilization, deployment, and demobilization) in which they first  occurred even if the problems persisted into other phases. For purposes of  characterizing pay and allowance problems for this report, we defined  overpayments and underpayments as those that were in excess of  (overpayment) or less than (underpayment) the entitled payment. We  considered as late payments any active duty pay or allowance paid to the  soldier over 30 days after the date on which the soldier was entitled to  receive such payments. As such, these payments were those that, although  late, addressed a previously unpaid entitlement. We used available data  through February 2004, as well as dollar amounts reported by Reserve Pay  Center officials, to determine collections against identified overpayments  through February 2004. In addition, while we did not attempt to calculate  the exact impact of any soldier\u2019s over-, under-, and late payments on their  combat zone tax exclusion benefits, we did examine readily available data  to determine the extent to which our case study unit soldiers\u2019 received their  entitled combat zone tax exclusion benefits.", "Our audit results only reflect problems we identified. Soldiers in our case  study units may have experienced additional pay problems that we did not  identify. Further, our work was not designed to identify, and we did not  identify, any fraudulent pay and allowances to any mobilized Army Reserve  soldiers. However, to the extent we identified any problems with our case  study unit soldiers\u2019 active duty pays, allowances, tax benefits, and related  collections, we provided documentation showing the results of our analysis  to appropriate Army Reserve officials for a complete review of all soldier  pay records to determine whether, and take appropriate action if,  additional amounts are owed to the Army Reserve soldiers or to the  government.", "We briefed officials of the DOD Comptroller, Army Finance Command,  Army Reserve Command, Army Reserve Regional Readiness Commands,  Army Forces Command, and DFAS-Indianapolis on the details of our audit,  including our findings and their implications.

A total of 68 soldiers from the 824th Quartermaster Company  mobilized at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and went through in-processing at  Fort Bragg\u2019s mobilization station in the first few weeks of February. Over  the next several months, members of the unit performed their mission of  rigging parachutes for individual soldiers and large equipment drops at Fort  Bragg, in Afghanistan, and in and around Kuwait. On April 6, 2003, 44  members of the 824th Quartermaster Company deployed to Kuwait to assist  in parachute preparations. After completing their mission, the soldiers  returned to Fort Bragg 2 months later on June 19. Another 5 soldiers from  the unit deployed to Afghanistan on July 14 and performed similar  parachute rigging duties, returning to Fort Bragg on September 1, 2003. The  other 19 soldiers in the unit remained at Fort Bragg for the entire duration  of their tour of duty where they assisted in parachute rigging at the base.  Beginning on July 15, 2003, soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company  began to demobilize and return to their civilian jobs, and by the end of  September 2003, all but one soldier had been released from active duty. The  soldier that remained on active duty was receiving medical treatment for  injuries related to his military service. A time line of actions associated  with the unit\u2019s active duty mobilization is shown in figure 3.", "As summarized in table 4, at every stage of the unit\u2019s tour of active duty,  soldiers experienced a variety of pay problems. Fifty-eight of the 68  soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company experienced at least one pay  problem associated with their activation to, during, or deactivation from  active duty in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Specifically, (1) we  found that 11 soldiers experienced underpayments, overpayments, or late  payments during their initial mobilization; (2) 50 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, or late payments during their tour of active  duty at Fort Bragg, in Afghanistan, and in and around Kuwait, including in- theater incentives such as hostile fire pay; and (3) 13 soldiers experienced  underpayments, overpayments, and/or late payments associated with their  demobilization, with most of the problems relating to the continuation of  active duty pay after demobilization.", "The dollar amounts associated with overpayments, underpayments, and  late payments we identified were approximately $60,000, $10,000, and  $3,000, respectively. Of the overpayments we identified, about $2,000 was  subsequently collected from the unit\u2019s soldiers. Almost $18,000 of the  overpayments we identified was associated with one soldier, who  continued to receive active duty pay for more than 5 months after his  discharge from the Army."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mobilization Pay Problems", "paragraphs": ["As summarized in table 5, we found that 11 soldiers from the 824th  Quartermaster Company experienced underpayments, overpayments, or  late payments related to basic pay and associated entitlements when called  to active duty. For example, we identified several soldiers who received  their $250 per month family separation allowance even though they  performed their military duty at Fort Bragg, their home station, and were  not separated from their families as provided by the DOD FMR Volume 7A.  The soldiers were not informed by pay technicians at the unit or their  mobilization station that they were not entitled to the family separation  allowance if their home of record was within a reasonable commuting  distance, generally 50 miles, even though the soldiers were staying at Fort  Bragg.", "Prior to being mobilized, the soldiers in the 824th Quartermaster Company  attended a SRP at their unit\u2019s home station. The purpose of this review was  to ensure that all soldiers had all required administrative paperwork,  financial documents, and were physically fit for the ensuing mobilization.  Members of the 81st Regional Readiness Command and unit members of the  824th Quartermaster Company, who conducted the finance portion of the  SRP, were required to verify the soldiers\u2019 supporting financial  documentation, and, if necessary, submit transactions with the necessary  supporting documentation to the Reserve Pay Center at Fort McCoy to  update the soldiers\u2019 Master Military Pay Accounts to reflect their mobilized  status. After performing the SRP at the unit\u2019s home station, the 824th  Quartermaster Company reported to Fort Bragg, its active Army  mobilization station. Fort Bragg personnel conducted a second SRP that  was intended, in part, to verify each soldier\u2019s pay account with supporting  finance documents. However, instead of conducting the required review of  each soldier\u2019s pay record, Fort Bragg\u2019s finance personnel performed only a  perfunctory review of the soldiers\u2019 supporting documents. According to  finance personnel at Fort Bragg\u2019s mobilization station, the physical layout  of the in-processing station did not allow them to sit with each soldier \u201cone  on one\u201d to compare their pay account as shown in DJMS-RC with the  soldier\u2019s pay supporting documentation in real time.", "The perfunctory review and oversights during the SRPs at the home station  and mobilization station allowed several soldiers to receive FSA when they  were not entitled to receive it. A review by personnel at the SRP should  have identified that the soldiers were not separated from their families as  required, and therefore they would not have signed off as approvers of the  entitlement forms. A lack of adequately trained staff with enough time to  review the unit\u2019s pay forms may have caused this pay error.", "Missing or noncurrent documentation required to support active duty pays  and allowances at the time of the SRP contributed to some of the late pays  and allowance payments we identified. For example, one soldier did not  receive family separation allowance payments because documentation  necessary to start this allowance was not submitted as part of the SRP  process, although the soldier was certified as ready for mobilization as a  result of the SRP. It was 6 months later, when the soldiers were  demobilizing at Fort Bragg, that the paperwork necessary to receive this  allowance was submitted to the Fort Bragg finance office.

Most soldiers did  not receive the full amount of hardship duty pay payments while deployed.  In addition, they continued to receive their hardship duty pay well after  they had returned to Fort Bragg and demobilized. All 49 soldiers deployed  overseas were incorrectly paid for either hardship duty or hostile fire pay.", "Army area servicing finance officials, who had responsibility for initiating  these entitlements, did not initiate the unit\u2019s hardship duty pay payments  until several months after the unit had arrived. The delay resulted in the  deployed soldiers being underpaid for most of their time in the hardship  duty location.", "Local active Army finance officials also did not terminate payments of  hardship duty pay until 5 months after the soldiers had left the hardship  duty pay location, in most cases. This erroneous continuation of hardship  duty payments may have been the result of pay clerks continuing to  manually process these payments each month using a roster of soldiers in  the country that did not properly reflect the unit\u2019s departure from the  overseas deployment location. In addition, the DJMS-RC system processing  procedures in place at the time required that hardship duty pay be  processed using a miscellaneous payment code that could be used for a  variety of payments. The use of this miscellaneous code for hardship duty  pay precluded the system from identifying the payments as active duty pay  and therefore allowed these payments to continue after the soldiers were  demobilized. The use of the miscellaneous payment code also led to soldier  confusion because the Leave and Earning Statement did not identify the  nature of the entitlement.", "In addition, soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan told us that in some  cases, they had trouble finding in-theater finance officers willing to help  them with their pay problems. The soldiers stated that when they arrived in  Afghanistan, the finance office on duty at the time was preparing to return  to the United States because its tour in the country was ending. Several  weeks passed before the transition of finance offices was complete, and in  that time the Reserve soldiers did not have any local support that would  assist them with finance problems. This gap in a functioning supporting  finance office for the deployed soldiers could only have added to their  frustration and confusion over in-theater pays.", "In addition to the problems soldiers experienced related to their pay and  entitlements, they also experienced systematic problems related to their  combat zone tax exclusion benefits. All 49 of the soldiers from the 824th  Quartermaster Company who deployed overseas were eligible for this tax  benefit and all of them experienced some type of problem with their  combat zone tax exclusion. Specifically, we found that all 49 soldiers  received their combat zone tax exclusion late, totaling about $20,000. Five  soldiers did not receive all of the combat zone tax exclusion benefits they  were due during their deployment. Moreover, the soldiers who deployed to  Afghanistan did not have the combat zone tax exclusion applied to their  pay until nearly 3 months after they arrived in the country, and never  received their combat zone tax exclusion benefit for September 2003. The  error for the month of September caused over $1,300 of extra taxes to be  collected from these soldiers while in a combat zone."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pay Problems Associated with Demobilization and Release from Active Duty", "paragraphs": ["Soldiers of the 824th Quartermaster Company began to demobilize in July  2003. As summarized in table 7, during their demobilization and after their  release from active duty, soldiers continued to experience pay problems.  These problems were primarily overpayments associated with soldiers  receiving pay after their active duty demobilization dates.", "The largest pay problem related to the 824th Quartermaster Company\u2019s  demobilization involved a soldier who was put into a medical hold  company. The soldier initially mobilized with the unit in February, and was  in-processed by personnel at Fort Bragg. During the in-processing, it was  determined that the soldier had a medical condition that did not allow him  to mobilize with the unit and perform his duty. He was then transferred to a  medical holding company under the command of the Fort Bragg Garrison  Support Unit. In this unit, the soldier underwent treatment for his condition  and concluded that treatment in August 2003. On August 13, 2003, the  soldier was discharged entirely from the Army and his pay should have  stopped on that date. According to DFAS guidance, several locations can  initiate transactions to stop a soldier\u2019s pay. The primary location is the  demobilization station where the soldier receives his or her DD Form 214,  Certificate of Discharge or Release from Active Duty. As a secondary catch,  the Reserve Pay Center at Fort McCoy can also stop the soldier\u2019s pay on his  or her release date.", "Although the soldier did out-process through Fort Bragg and received his  DD Form 214, personnel at the demobilization station at Fort Bragg did not  amend the soldier\u2019s pay record to cut off pay on August 13. The unit also  did not take any action to stop the soldier\u2019s pay because the soldier should  have been off of its pay records and in the pay records of the medical hold  company. This had not been done and the result was that the medical hold  company could not view the soldier\u2019s pay records but knew he was  discharged. Meanwhile, the unit could view the pay records but, under  current procedures, did not receive a copy of the DD Form 214 showing the  soldier had been discharged. Ultimately, the soldier\u2019s pay and allowances  were stopped only as a result of actions we took. Specifically, in August  2003, the soldier contacted his old unit, the 824th Quartermaster Company,  and faxed them a copy of his DD Form 214. At this point the unit had all  necessary documentation to identify the overpayment to the soldier after  his discharge date of August 13, but did not review the pay records and  identify the problem. The soldier continued to get paid until the end of  January 2004 when we identified the error, which resulted in an  overpayment of almost $18,000.

However,  although unit personnel transferred the soldier to another unit that was not  mobilizing, no one canceled the soldier\u2019s original mobilization order in the  Army Reserve personnel system, or notified the Reserve Pay Center to stop  the soldier\u2019s active duty pay. In addition, unit personnel did not notify the  Fort Hood mobilization station that this soldier had received a mobilization  order so the mobilization station could confirm that the order had been  revoked and stop pay for this soldier.
