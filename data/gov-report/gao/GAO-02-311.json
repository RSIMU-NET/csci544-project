Yet, the demand for offers exceeded staff's capacity to process them. The extent to which IRS' current initiatives would reduce the OIC Program inventory and processing time is uncertain. The current initiatives are intended to separate the processing of less complex and more complex offers, with lower-grade staff using standardized procedures to process less complex offers and higher-grade staff specializing in more complex offers.

An offer in compromise is an agreement between a taxpayer and the IRS to settle or \u201ccompromise\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability for less than the full amount owed. Generally, IRS considers offers in cases in which taxpayers cannot afford to pay the full tax liability. In recent years, particularly since the enactment of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (Restructuring Act), the demand for offers has increased significantly. Even though IRS added staff to the program, the inventory of unresolved offers and the processing times have grown. IRS now takes about 10 months, on average, to make an offer determination.", "Because of your concern about the growing inventory and processing times, you asked us to review IRS\u2019s administration of the program. Specifically, you asked us to (1) determine why the inventory of cases and case processing times have continued to grow; (2) assess whether IRS\u2019s current initiatives for managing the OIC Program will reduce inventory and processing times; and (3) determine whether IRS is fulfilling the requirements of the Restructuring Act in terms of independently reviewing all proposed rejections of offers, considering the facts and circumstances of each case, and not rejecting offers from low-income taxpayers solely on the basis of the amount offered.", "You also asked us to review a recent change to IRS\u2019s installment agreement program. An installment agreement allows taxpayers to pay their tax liability over time. In 1998, IRS counsel determined that IRS did not have the authority to enter into an installment agreement that would not fully pay the tax liability within the time allowed by law. Because of concern that this decision would leave some taxpayers unable to qualify for either an installment agreement or an offer, you asked us to determine the extent to which IRS has information on how the counsel decision affects taxpayers and to evaluate IRS\u2019s legislative proposal for a new partial payment installment agreement program.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed program data from IRS statistical reports and program documents and reviewed offer policies and procedures and studies by an outside contractor and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA). We focused on fiscal years 1997 through 2001 because this was a period of enormous change in the OIC Program.

Our scope and methodology are discussed in greater detail in a separate section of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The OIC Program is one of IRS\u2019s collection programs to resolve delinquent tax accounts. Taxpayers who do not pay their taxes in full when they file their tax returns or when IRS determines that they owe additional taxes are subject to IRS\u2019s collection process. The collection process begins when IRS sends the taxpayer a bill demanding full payment. For taxpayers who are unwilling or unable to pay, IRS may take enforcement action through liens, levies, or seizures of property; place the account in a temporary inactive status; or refer the case to IRS counsel for litigation. By law, IRS has 10 years from the date of assessment to collect delinquent taxes from a taxpayer. Taxpayers who are willing to pay may qualify for an installment agreement, which allows payments to be made over time; taxpayers who cannot afford to pay their full liability may be eligible for an offer in compromise.", "Section 7122 of the Internal Revenue Code gives IRS authority to settle tax debts through compromises, that is, by accepting less than full payment. Historically, IRS\u2019s compromise authority has been limited to cases where there was doubt as to liability or doubt as to collectibility. In July 1999, IRS issued temporary regulations allowing for a third type of compromise when there is no doubt as to liability or collectibility but when compromising the taxes would promote effective tax administration. IRS can accept the following types of compromise.", "A compromise based on doubt as to liability can be accepted when there is a dispute that the tax liability is correct.", "A compromise based on doubt as to collectibility can be accepted when (1) it is unlikely that the tax liability can be collected in full and (2) the amount of the taxpayer\u2019s offer reasonably reflects collection potential\u2014the net equity of the taxpayer\u2019s assets plus the amount that IRS could collect from the taxpayer\u2019s future income. Because IRS\u2019s policy is to allow taxpayers sufficient resources to provide for necessary living expenses, if special circumstances exist, such as advanced age or serious illness of the taxpayer, IRS may accept an offer for an amount that is less than what could be collectible based on the taxpayer\u2019s financial condition.", "A compromise based on effective tax administration can be accepted only when (1) there is no dispute about the tax liability and (2) the taxpayer has sufficient resources to fully pay the tax but collection of the liability in full would either create an economic hardship or be detrimental to voluntary compliance.", "As illustrated in figure 1, the offer process starts when an offer application is submitted by a taxpayer or his or her representative. The offer must be supported by a current statement of the taxpayer\u2019s financial condition, including data on assets and liabilities and a monthly income and expense analysis. If the taxpayer has not filed all required federal tax returns or is in bankruptcy, the offer is not considered workable and will be returned to the taxpayer. If the offer is eligible for consideration and the offer package is incomplete, IRS will contact the taxpayer and attempt to obtain the missing information. If the taxpayer does not provide the requested information, the offer application will be returned to the taxpayer.", "Once an offer package is complete, IRS determines whether the offer is acceptable by reviewing and verifying the taxpayer\u2019s financial data. The verification includes a review of prior-year tax returns as well as records showing the taxpayer\u2019s assets, bank accounts, and personal and real property. The taxpayer may be asked to provide additional documentation to verify financial or other information. If the financial statement becomes older than 12 months while the offer is being processed, the taxpayer must be contacted to update the information.", "When an offer is unacceptable, IRS gives the taxpayer the opportunity to submit an amended offer, withdraw the offer application, or seek an alternative resolution to the case. When an offer is rejected, the taxpayer will be notified in writing after an independent administrative review of the proposed rejection. The letter will explain the reason for the decision and give instructions on how the taxpayer may appeal the decision. If an offer application is returned because the taxpayer did not provide all requested financial information, IRS\u2019s policy is to conduct an independent administrative review of the offer application before returning it to the taxpayer.", "After an offer is accepted by IRS, the taxpayer will be notified in writing and given instructions on how to make the agreed payments. IRS allows taxpayers three payment options\u2014an immediate payment (within 90 days of acceptance); a short-term deferred payment plan (after more than 90 days but within 2 years of acceptance); or a deferred payment plan (during the remaining statutory period for collecting the tax).", "Another way that IRS collects delinquent taxes is through installment agreements. Under an installment agreement, the taxpayer remains obligated to pay the entire tax liability and agrees to do so in installments over a period of time not to exceed the remaining statutory period allowed IRS by law to collect the tax liability, plus a 5-year extension. Interest continues to accrue on the unpaid balance.

Instead of returning an incomplete offer to the taxpayer, IRS started working with taxpayers to obtain the information needed to process the offer. This change in processability criteria increased the number of workable offers.", "Elimination of partial payment installment agreements. Prior to 1998, IRS allowed partial payment installment agreements with payment periods that could last 15 years and longer. In 1998, IRS counsel determined that IRS did not have the authority to enter into installment agreements that would not fully pay the liability within the 10-year statutory collection period plus a 5-year extension.

However, IRS officials told us they could not quantify the impact that this policy change has had on the demand for offers.", "Expanded bases for accepting offers to include effective tax administration. In response to the Restructuring Act, IRS expanded the bases for considering offers to include effective tax administration (ETA), which requires considering such factors as equity and hardship. Although the expansion had the potential to increase the demand for offers, IRS officials told us that they do not track the number of offers submitted on the basis of these factors. However, IRS data on the number of offers accepted by type showed that there were 261 ETA offers in fiscal year 2000 and 272 ETA offers in fiscal year 2001, suggesting that the impact on demand may have been small.", "More payment options.

This change had the potential to increase demand, but IRS officials could not quantify the impact.", "Three of the program changes that increased demand also increased the number of processing steps and staff hours needed per case. Changing the processability criteria resulted in IRS staff\u2019s spending time to work with taxpayers to complete offer applications. Expanding the bases for accepting offers means that before rejecting an offer based on doubt as to liability or doubt as to collectibility, IRS must determine whether the factors considered under ETA or special circumstances criteria apply.Making more payment options available increased the amount of staff time required to calculate offer amounts. However, IRS could not quantify the impact of these changes.", "According to IRS officials, other program changes also added the following steps to the process and increased staff hours per case.", "Independent administrative review. The Restructuring Act required that IRS establish procedures for an independent administrative review of any proposed offer rejection before notifying the taxpayer.

Consequently, the independent administrative reviews increased staff hours per case and added a step to the offer process for rejected offers and returned offers. However, IRS does not currently track the time spent on offers by the independent reviewers.", "Revised offer form. IRS had to revise the offer form to reflect changes required by the Restructuring Act.

Under quick hits, IRS would take an installment agreement for $5,000 and put the other year of delinquency or $15,000 in a currently not collectible status. The taxpayer would be expected to make payments on the installment agreement but not on the separate delinquency that was put in a currently not collectible status.", "Based on installment agreement data and professional judgment, IRS estimated that under quick hits, 4,600 cases could be closed from the existing inventory in fiscal year 2002 and future offer submissions could be reduced by up to 5 percent, primarily in the centralized sites. Also, IRS estimated that 5 percent of the future inventory could be closed more quickly, primarily in the centralized sites.", "Frivolous offers. To discourage offers aimed at delaying collection action, IRS is requesting legislative authority to establish a $5,000 penalty for frivolous offers. IRS developed its legislative proposal for frivolous offers to supplement its expanded return procedures (also discussed above). Based on professional judgment and offer experience, IRS estimates that this proposal, if approved, would generally discourage most abuse, reduce new offer submissions by as much as 15 percent, and close 5 percent of new cases more quickly, primarily in the centralized sites.", "Statutory period. IRS is also requesting legislative authority for the collection statute to be suspended when an offer is submitted. As discussed above, by law IRS has 10 years from the date of assessment to collect the delinquent taxes from the taxpayer. However, when a taxpayer files an offer, the collection statute does not stop while the offer is pending. This has encouraged some taxpayers to file offers as an attempt to delay collection action while the statutes of limitation on collecting their tax debts continue to expire. IRS officials believe this proposal would reduce the number of new submissions. However, IRS cannot quantify the potential reduction of future submissions that may have been submitted in order to delay collection action.", "Counsel review. To reduce processing time, IRS is requesting legislative authority to change the threshold for counsel review of offers. Section 7122(b) of the Internal Revenue Code requires counsel review in all cases where the total liability is $50,000 or more. According to IRS\u2019s quality review of a sample of closed offer cases, it took an average of 57.2 days for cases to be sent to and returned from counsel during fiscal year 2001. IRS questioned the added value of the counsel review for offers for liabilities less than $250,000 and has proposed that the threshold be raised from $50,000 to $250,000. If this authority is granted, it would reduce processing time for offers for liabilities between $50,000 and $250,000. An IRS official told us that 31.2 percent of the offers closed in fiscal year 2000 were for tax liabilities between $50,000 and $250,000 and 4.8 percent were for tax liabilities of $250,000 or more.", "User fee. To offset the cost of the direct staff hours used to process offers, IRS is requesting legislative authority to charge taxpayers a user fee. Although offers from low-income taxpayers and offers based on effective tax administration would be exempt, the taxpayer would need to pay a user fee when the offer is submitted and would be reimbursed later.

IRS\u2019s Office of Program Evaluation and Risk Analysis (OPERA) has agreed to conduct an evaluation, but a plan for the evaluation had not yet been developed. Program officials told us, however, that they had put in place measures for centralized processing and that program managers were continually collecting data and making changes as centralized processing was being implemented. Officials said that such monitoring would enable them to know whether centralized processing was meeting IRS\u2019s goals for closing cases within 6 months and for the percentage of cases closed within 6 months.", "An evaluation plan for the fast track program has been developed by OPERA. According to OPERA officials, the plan is designed to assess fast track as it has been implemented in the field and also to assess whether the offer program database includes sufficient information for effective program management. The planned evaluation is also intended to provide some information useful for deciding whether to expand fast track processing. OIC Program officials stated that they are considering whether to expand fast track processing to cover new, less complex cases, which are processed centrally. It is not clear whether centralized fast track would be the same as the fast track currently being implemented in the field. For example, the mix of high- and low-grade staff used in the field is different from the mix of staff being used centrally. In addition, the data being verified electronically in the field is not the same as the data being submitted in new cases. According to OPERA officials, the planned fast track evaluation is also intended to determine whether program results differ because of such variables.", "OIC Program officials said that they do not plan to develop evaluation plans for their other initiatives. Without such plans, it may be difficult to distinguish the impact of one initiative from that of another.", "Because actual inventory and processing time could be greater or less than projected, IRS managers may need to decide whether and how to make additional changes to the OIC Program. For example, if results are better than the projections, IRS may have opportunities to reassign some offer staff. If results are worse than projected, other approaches to managing inventory and processing time may need to be considered. Such decision- making would benefit from reliable, timely performance and cost data and evaluations. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 and IRS guidance both stress the benefits of first gathering and then evaluating data to help managers understand the factors that influence performance. While reliable, timely performance data and evaluations are always beneficial, the uncertainty about both the results and the costs of the offer initiatives highlights the importance of tracking and evaluating the initiatives\u2019 performance.", "Planning for data collection and evaluation is also important. Systematic attention to the design of data collection and evaluation efforts can help assure the usefulness of the efforts and safeguard against using time and resources ineffectively. Before information is collected, an evaluation plan should specify details, including the data to be collected, data sources, data collection methods, basis for comparing outcomes, and an analysis plan.", "We recognize that collecting performance data and conducting performance evaluations have costs. Consequently, the amount of data to collect and the scope and depth of evaluations should be based on the resources required and the benefits of the information.", "As noted earlier in this report, IRS did not track some data that might be useful for managing the OIC Program or determining the effectiveness of the initiatives. These data might include, for example, the total staff time devoted to the OIC Program, the time taken by the independent administrative review, and the percentage of taxpayers who failed to comply with the terms of their offer, by year of acceptance. Whether such data are worth collecting depends on the extent to which they contribute to better program management or to a better evaluation of the effectiveness of the offer initiatives. As noted earlier, OPERA\u2019s evaluation of fast track field processing includes an assessment of data needed for effective program management. Similar assessments of performance data needs for centralized processing and the other initiatives would also contribute to better program management.", "IRS measures processing time relative to a standard of six months, but empirical information has never been used to verify that standard as an appropriate measure of program performance. IRS officials said that the 6- month standard was based on their professional judgment about what IRS could achieve and what taxpayers would accept.", "In two recent reports, we discussed the benefits of setting service goals after evaluating taxpayer or customer needs, other benefits, and costs.More specifically, we discussed industry guidance for customer service that recommended setting goals based on how long customers are willing to wait for the service, the value of the service to the organization, and the costs of providing the service.

Because of the uncertainty, program managers will likely have to make adjustments to the program as actual performance diverges from projected performance in unpredictable ways. Several steps, if taken now, could better prepare offer program managers for making such decisions. Goals based on an evaluation of taxpayer needs, other benefits, and costs could provide criteria for judging the effectiveness of the initiatives. Timely data could allow program managers to routinely track progress. Evaluations could determine the effectiveness of the initiatives and the reasons for their effectiveness. Armed with such an understanding, program managers would have a better basis for making future adjustments to the program.", "The uncertainty about the effect of the initiatives on program performance also means that the future costs of the program could be higher than projected. OIC Program costs, measured by the numbers of staff or as a proportion of collection resources, have risen significantly in recent years. IRS recognizes that the proportion of collection resources devoted to the OIC Program may be negatively affecting other collection programs. Consequently, IRS\u2019s centralized and fast track processing initiatives are intended to increase the involvement of lower-grade collection staff in the OIC Program and to eventually free up higher-grade field staff for other collection activities. If projected results are not realized and costs continue to rise, however, Congress and IRS may need to address the question of the affordability of the OIC Program as it is presently constituted. The uncertainty about the costs of the present initiatives means that it may be premature to reconsider the program now. However, uncertainty about future program costs reinforces the importance of timely performance data and program evaluations. Such information will be critical for ongoing congressional oversight.", "IRS\u2019s proposal for a partial payment installment agreement program suffers from weaknesses similar to those in the OIC Program initiatives.
