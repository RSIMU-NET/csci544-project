Some outages are planned to perform routine maintenance or upgrades, while unplanned outages occur as a result of equipment failure or other unforeseen problems. GAO was asked to (1) evaluate the effect of refinery outages on wholesale gasoline prices and (2) identify gaps in federal data needed for this and similar analyses. GAO selected refinery outages from 2002 through September 2008 that were at least among the largest 60 percent in terms of lost production capacity in their market region and lasted at least 3 days. GAO developed an econometric model and tested a variety of assumptions using public and private data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While some unplanned refinery outages, such as those caused by accidents or weather, have had large price effects, GAO found that in general, refinery outages were associated with small increases in gasoline prices. Large price increases occurred when there were large outages; for example, in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. However, we found that such large price increases were rare, and on average, outages were associated with small price increases. For example, GAO found that planned outages generally did not influence prices significantly--likely reflecting refiners' build-up in inventories to meet demand needs prior to shutting down--while for unplanned outages, average price effects ranged from less than one cent to several cents-per-gallon. Key factors influenced the size of price increases associated with unplanned outages. One such factor was whether the gasoline was branded--gasoline sold at retail under a specific refiner's trademark--or unbranded--gasoline sold at retail by independent sellers. Our analysis showed that during an unplanned outage, branded wholesale gasoline prices had smaller price increases than unbranded, suggesting that refiners give preference to their own branded customers during outages, while unbranded dealers must seek out supplies in a more constrained market. Another factor that affected the size of price increases associated with outages was the type of gasoline being sold. Some special blends of gasoline developed to reduce emissions of air pollutants exhibited larger average price increases than more widely used and available conventional gasoline, suggesting that these special gasoline blends may have more constrained supply options in the event of an outage. Existing federal data contain gaps that have limited GAO's and Department of Transportation's (DOT) analyses of petroleum markets and related issues. For example: (1) Data linking refiners to the markets they serve were inadequate for GAO to fully evaluate the price effects of unplanned outages on individual cities, limiting the analysis to broader average effects. (2) Pipeline flow and petroleum product storage data were inadequate for DOT to fully address a January 2009 Congressionally mandated study to identify potential pipeline infrastructure constraints, and limited GAO's ability to identify re-supply options for cities experiencing outage disruptions. Federal agencies generally have continued to update their data collection surveys to meet their respective needs and emerging changes in the energy sector. However, in some cases the individual agency efforts have resulted in the collection of information that does not necessarily meet the data needs of other agencies or analysts who monitor petroleum product markets."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 150 refineries in the United States play an important role in the  nation\u2019s economy and energy security by supplying consumers and  industry with needed petroleum products. Unplanned refinery outages\u2014 such as those caused by hurricanes, fires, or refinery equipment failures\u2014 have raised questions about the stability and cost of U.S. gasoline and  other petroleum product supplies. In addition to unplanned outages,  refineries must periodically undergo planned outages, during which they  shut down major pieces of equipment to perform maintenance, overhaul,  and repair operations. In October 2008, we reported that, with the  exception of impacts in 2005 related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,  refinery outages across the United States generally did not show  discernible trends in reduced production capacity or in the frequency and  location of outages from 2002 through 2007. In addition, in March 2007, the  Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA)  reported that unplanned refinery outages can result in local supply  disruptions that result in temporary price increases; however, refinery  outages do not always affect prices. Moreover, analyses by EIA and the  California Energy Commission have described how an unplanned refinery  outage under certain conditions\u2014for example, a tight market supply and  demand balance for refined products coupled with low inventories or  other sources of re-supply to meet demand in the event of an unplanned  outage\u2014can trigger price increases. Still, the impacts on gasoline prices  due to refinery outages and other disruptions are not fully understood. In  particular, while it is well understood that extreme events that disrupt  crude oil or petroleum product supplies can have significant effects on the  prices of these commodities, the price effects of less dramatic disruptions,  such as routine refinery outages, are not well understood.", "Further compounding the potential impact of refinery outages, in recent  years prior to the current economic recession, global demand for crude oil  and petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel had  grown more quickly than available capacity to produce them.  Furthermore, some refiners had been running near capacity, particularly  during the peak-demand summer months. During tight market conditions,  unexpected refinery outages could stress the petroleum product supply  system, affecting operations at refineries, pipelines, and storage terminals.  In addition, the proliferation of special fuel blends\u2014gasoline that has  special characteristics designed to meet federal, state, and local air quality  requirements\u2014as well as the increasing use of biofuels such as ethanol as  a component of gasoline, have complicated the manufacturing and  distribution processes for petroleum products. Once produced, the various  blends of petroleum products must be kept separate throughout shipping  and delivery. Other disruptions, such as a pipeline break, can hamper the  ability of the supply infrastructure to deliver the steady supply of gasoline  and other petroleum products that U.S. consumers and businesses depend  on. In the past, local supply disruptions could be addressed more quickly  because additional fuel of the same formulation could be purchased from  numerous sources, but with the proliferation of special fuel blends,  replacement supplies of a special blend might not be as readily available,  and refineries with the capability to produce them could be hundreds of  miles away.", "A number of federal agencies\u2014including EIA, the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Transportation (DOT), and  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)\u2014have a role in  monitoring the effects of outages and ensuring the safe, efficient, and  adequate supply of petroleum products during and after those outages. In  this context, you asked us to study and evaluate (1) how refinery outages  have affected U.S. wholesale gasoline prices since 2002 and (2) to what  extent available federal data allow for the evaluation of the impacts of  refinery outages on petroleum product prices and reflect emerging trends  in petroleum product markets that may be important to future analytical  needs.", "To evaluate how refinery outages have affected U.S. wholesale gasoline  prices since 2002, we purchased data that included detailed information on  refinery outages from Industrial Information Resources, Inc. (IIR); data  estimating the quantity flows of gasoline and other petroleum products  produced at most U.S. refineries and then transported to those U.S. cities  that make up the main markets for those products from Baker & O\u2019Brien;  and weekly wholesale price data for 75 U.S. cities from the Oil Price  Information Service (OPIS). We also obtained and analyzed data from  EIA\u2019s monthly refinery production survey, form EIA-810, and other EIA  data collection surveys. We determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. Specifically, we determined these  data were sufficient to complete our analyses of the immediate average  wholesale price impacts associated with refinery outages on various  gasoline types, but they were neither sufficient to determine the effects  experienced by individual cities nor the longer term or dynamic effects of  outages on prices. We developed, and extensively tested, an econometric  model that examined the statistical relationship between refinery outages  and gasoline prices. We analyzed commercial data for 20 gasoline types  and distinguished between branded and unbranded gasoline to determine  if those factors influenced the price effect of an outage. We limited our  analysis to outages that were determined to be 1) at least among the  largest 60 percent of outages in terms of lost production capacity within  their market region and 2) that lasted at least 3 days. In our model, we  limited the effect of an outage on prices to one week, after which time we  assumed that petroleum products were supplied from an alternate source.  As a result, our analysis evaluated the short-term effects of outages but did  not evaluate the length of time those effects occurred. Limitations on  available public data on the production and supply of petroleum products  restricted our analysis to those cities for which Baker & O\u2019Brien had  collected and maintained data; these cities generally represented the  United States geographically, but might not have been representative of all  cities. To control for the effects on gasoline prices, our model  incorporated data on numerous factors\u2014such as gasoline inventory levels,  refinery capacity utilization, and gasoline specifications. Our modeling  results reflect a particular city\u2019s reliance on the refinery experiencing the  outage.", "To assess the extent to which available federal data allowed for the  evaluation of refinery outage impacts, we reviewed federal government  data collection surveys from federal agencies including EIA, EPA, and  FERC, as well as private companies. We reviewed the surveys for  comprehensiveness, utility, potential gaps or limitations, and to  understand the extent to which the surveys collect useful data to analyze  the impacts of disruptions. We reviewed past GAO reports and other  federal agency or intergovernmental agency studies on petroleum product  markets to identify data gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies. Furthermore,  we interviewed key industry and expert institution representatives  regarding data utility and limitations in their own work. Our work was not  a comprehensive evaluation of all federal energy data, but rather an  assessment of key data GAO used in this and past reports, and other select  data that we determined during the course of our review to have posed  limitations for GAO\u2019s or other agencies\u2019 evaluations of important policy  questions related to petroleum markets. See appendix I for a more detailed  description of our objectives, scope, and methodology.", "We conducted our work from October 2008 through July 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Refineries process crude oil into petroleum products through a  combination of distillation and other processes. A single barrel of crude oil  produces a varying amount of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and other  petroleum products depending on the configuration\u2014or complexity\u2014of  the refinery and the type of crude oil being refined.", "This report focuses on the production of finished gasoline. Finished  gasoline is primarily defined by three characteristics: blendstock, vapor  pressure, and oxygenate content. Blendstock is the designation for the  base gasoline produced so that other materials can be blended in to meet  various air quality or other local specifications. Vapor pressure, also  known as Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), measures the gasoline\u2019s evaporation  characteristics or volatility. Oxygenates are fuel additives, particularly  alcohols and ethers, which increase gasoline octane levels and reduce  carbon monoxide pollution associated with automobile emissions. The  most widely used oxygenate in the United States is ethanol, which may be  added to gasoline in varying percentages. Federal regulations specify that  no more than 10 percent ethanol can be blended into gasoline. Ethanol is  generally blended with gasoline at the terminal or wholesale \u201crack\u201d\u2014the  distribution center between refineries and retail fueling stations. For the  purposes of this report, conventional gasoline does not contain special  federal, state, or local blendstock, RVP, or oxygenate requirements unless  otherwise noted, while \u201cspecial fuel blends\u201d refer to blends of gasoline  that are designed to be cleaner burning and generally contain either a  certain blendstock, RVP, or oxygenate requirement to meet federal, state,  or local fuel specifications. An example of a gasoline used to meet a state  fuel specification is California Air Resources Board (CARB) gasoline,  which is designed to reduce harmful exhaust emissions that cause smog  and is used exclusively in California.", "Petroleum product markets are evolving in part as a result of the  increasing use of biofuels\u2014fuels derived from plant or animal products\u2014 throughout the country. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 generally required  that at least 7.5 billion gallons of biofuels be blended into motor vehicle  fuels in the United States by 2012. These targets were later amended under  the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which increased the  volume of biofuels to be blended with gasoline from 9 billion gallons in  2008 to 36 billion gallons in 2022. EPA was charged with implementing the  Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program and issuing regulations to ensure  that the annual volumes of biofuels specified by the legislation are being  blended into motor vehicle fuels. In addition, some states require the use  of biofuels. For example, in Minnesota all fuel must contain 10 percent  ethanol, while a number of other states offer consumers incentives\u2014such  as tax credits and rebates\u2014for purchasing ethanol or other biofuels. The  steadily increasing use of biofuels in the United States has complicated the  production and distribution of gasoline. Biofuels such as ethanol are  produced at dedicated biofuel production facilities\u2014not at refineries\u2014and  currently cannot be transported by most petroleum product pipelines.", "Therefore in order for ethanol to be blended with gasoline, it must be  shipped to the terminal by truck or rail, where it is then mechanically  mixed with gasoline as it is delivered into trucks for shipping to retail.", "Gasoline with or without biofuels is typically sold as either branded or  unbranded. Branded gasoline is that supplied from major refiners and sold  at retail stations under these refiner\u2019s trademarks, and often contains  special additives. Contracts for branded gasoline tend to be less flexible  than contracts for unbranded gasoline but guarantee a more secure  supply. Conversely, unbranded gasoline may be supplied by major or  independent refiners, but is not sold under a refining company\u2019s  trademark. Buyers of unbranded gasoline may or may not have a binding  contractual arrangement with a refiner.", "The supply infrastructure\u2014which includes pipelines and terminals that  hold supply inventories\u2014is a critical component of the nation\u2019s petroleum  product market in that it facilitates the flow of crude oil and petroleum  products from one geographic region to another. Crude oil pipelines  connect several large refining centers to crude oil sources, and petroleum  product pipelines connect these refineries to population centers all over  the country. Thus, a disruption in one geographic region can affect the  supply and prices in another geographic region. To help mitigate the  effects of potential supply disruptions caused by refinery outages or  sudden increases in demand and to facilitate smooth supply operations,  refiners, distributors, and marketers of petroleum products maintain  inventories of crude oil and petroleum products. Inventories represent the  most accessible and readily available source of supply in the event of a  production shortfall, such as one caused by a refinery outage, or increase  in demand.", "In October 2008, we reported that unplanned and planned refinery  outages across the United States did not show discernible trends in the  frequency or location of outages from 2002 through 2007, with the  exception of impacts beginning in 2005 related to Hurricanes Katrina and  Rita. During that study, however, we found that EIA does not collect  information on refinery outages directly and thus the information it  collects on its monthly refinery survey and uses to indirectly estimate  outages has a number of limitations. Specifically, EIA\u2019s method of using  EIA-810 data to estimate outages cannot distinguish between planned and  unplanned outages, which could have different impacts on petroleum  product prices for consumers. Also, as we reported, because the monthly  refinery survey data are monthly aggregate data, major outages that  straddle the end of one month and the beginning of the next may be  difficult to identify and the observable effects of those outages could be  diluted. We further reported that the exact date and length of an outage  may be difficult to determine from EIA\u2019s monthly refinery survey data,  making it difficult to use the data to determine whether a specific outage  had a significant effect on the production capacity for some petroleum  products as well as market prices.", "Several U.S. agencies have jurisdiction over and monitor the U.S. refining  and supply infrastructure industries and petroleum product markets.", "Within the Department of Energy (DOE), the Energy Information  Administration (EIA) collects and analyzes data, including supply,  consumption, and prices of crude oil and petroleum products; inventory  levels; refining capacity and utilization rates; and some petroleum product  movements into and within the United States. Much of the data that the  agency collects is obtained by surveys under EIA\u2019s Petroleum Supply  Reporting System (PSRS). The PSRS is comprised of 16 data collection  surveys and includes, among others, weekly and monthly surveys of  refiners, terminals, and pipelines. The purpose of the PSRS is to collect  and disseminate basic and detailed data to meet EIA\u2019s responsibilities and  energy data users\u2019 needs for credible, reliable, and timely information on  U.S. petroleum product supply. EIA generally updates its PSRS surveys  every 3 years and has issued such updates in 2003, 2006, and 2009. EIA  also conducts analyses in support of DOE\u2019s mission and in response to  Congressional inquiries. For example, EIA recently conducted its  semiannual forecast of planned refinery outage effects. EIA evaluates a  wide range of trends and issues that could have implications for U.S.  petroleum product trends and markets, and each year issues a publication  known as the Annual Energy Outlook.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), among other things,  develops and enforces regulations that implement environmental laws that  aim to control the discharge of pollutants into the environment by refiners  and other industries. The EPA, with the concurrence of DOE, can grant  waivers on fuel requirements that allow petroleum product markets to be  more easily re-supplied should an \u201cextreme and unusual\u201d situation\u2014such  as a problem with distribution of supply to a particular region, a natural  disaster, or refinery equipment failure\u2014occur. In addition, EPA oversees  the Reformulated Gasoline (RFG) program. This program was developed  in response to a requirement in the Clean Air Act that cities with the most  severe smog pollution use reformulated gasoline\u2014gasoline blended to  burn cleaner and reduce smog-forming and toxic pollutants in the air\u2014to  reduce emissions. EPA is also responsible for implementing and issuing  regulations to ensure that gasoline sold in the United States contains a  minimum volume of biofuels, such as ethanol or biodiesel, and its reports,  according to EPA officials, are geared toward collecting data on fuel  quality which is enforced at the refinery. Under EPA\u2019s Renewable Fuel  Standard (RFS) program, refiners, importers, and blenders are required to  use a minimum volume of biofuels each year, determined as a percentage  of the total volume of fuel the company produces, blends, or imports.  Entities that are unwilling or unable to meet this percentage standard may  purchase biofuel credits from other obligated parties in order to satisfy the  requirement. EPA monitors RFS program compliance and has the  authority to waive the standard if it determines that specified biofuel  volumes would cause severe harm to the economy or the environment in a  particular region, state, or the country or that there is an inadequate  domestic supply.", "The Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Pipeline and Hazardous  Materials Safety Administration focuses on pipeline safety and establishes  standards for transmission and distribution systems for crude oil and  petroleum product pipeline. Among other things, it oversees pipelines\u2019  design, maintenance, and operating procedures to maintain the safe,  efficient, and reliable delivery of petroleum products.", "The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) monitors energy  markets and regulates rates and practices of oil pipeline companies  engaged in interstate transportation of natural gas, oil and electricity.

Based on our  analysis of wholesale prices across 75 U.S. cities from 2002 through  September 2008, planned outages generally did not influence prices, while  unplanned refinery outages had generally small wholesale gasoline price  effects in the cities they serve. Price increases varied depending on  whether the gasoline was branded or unbranded and according to the  gasoline type affected by the outage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Extreme Outage Events Can Lead to Large Temporary Price Increases", "paragraphs": ["On rare occasions, refinery outages can have large temporary effects on  gasoline prices. For example, as we recently testified, petroleum product  prices increased dramatically following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. This  occurred in part because many refineries are located in the Gulf Coast  region and power outages shut down pipelines that refineries depend on  for crude oil supplies and to transport refined petroleum products,  including gasoline to wholesale markets. DOE reported that 21 refineries  in affected states were either shut down or operating at reduced capacity  in the aftermath of the hurricanes. In total, nearly 30 percent of the  refining capacity in the United States was shut down, disrupting supplies  of gasoline and other products. Two pipelines that send petroleum  products from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast and the Midwest were also  shut down as a result of Hurricane Katrina. For example, Colonial  Pipeline, which transports petroleum products to the Southeast and much  of the East Coast, was not fully operational for a week after Hurricane  Katrina due to large-scale power outages and flooding. Consequently,  according to the Federal Trade Commission, average gasoline prices for  the nation increased 45 cents-per-gallon between August 29 and  September 5, 2005; short-term gasoline shortages occurred in some places;  and the media reported gasoline prices greater than $5 per gallon in  Georgia. The hurricane came on the heels of a period of high crude oil  prices and a tight balance worldwide between petroleum demand and  supply, and illustrated the volatility of gasoline prices given the  vulnerability of the gasoline infrastructure to natural or other disruptions.", "While extreme outages can cause large temporary price increases, such  events were relatively uncommon during the period of our analysis. For  example, for unbranded prices, of the approximately 1100 unplanned  outages we evaluated, 99 percent of the time they were associated with  wholesale price increases of no more than about 32 cents-per-gallon, and  75 percent of the time they were associated with price increases of less  than 6 cents-per-gallon in the cities affected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "On Average, Price Effects Associated with Outages Are Relatively Small, and Depend on Key Factors", "paragraphs": ["Overall, our analysis indicated that planned outages\u2014where refineries  temporarily shut down to perform routine maintenance or equipment  upgrades\u2014generally did not have a significant effect on wholesale  gasoline prices. As we reported in October 2008, planned outages are  typically scheduled during periods of less demand and interspersed among  refiners and refineries. In addition, the equipment and labor are generally  booked months\u2014or even years\u2014in advance, and can be arranged with  those customers with whom the refiners have long-term contracts at a cost  less than would be required in an emergency or unplanned situation.  Industry representatives told us that because a refinery must draw on a  limited number of equipment makers and skilled laborers, the refinery\u2019s  plans for maintenance eventually become public knowledge. In this case,  the market \u201cexpects\u201d the outage to occur, therefore planned outages do  not generally trigger significant price responses, unless something  unexpected occurs or the market is disrupted elsewhere. Furthermore,  refineries stockpile petroleum products in preparation for planned outages  and therefore do not experience the same shortage of production  materials experienced during unplanned outages.", "Unplanned outages, on the other hand, were associated with gasoline  price increases but these increases were generally small and depended on  key factors, including whether or not the gasoline was branded or  unbranded and the type of gasoline being sold. With respect to the  distinction between branded and unbranded gasoline, our analysis showed  that in the event of an unplanned refinery outage, unbranded gasoline was  generally associated with greater wholesale price increases than branded  gasoline. Specifically, we found that for conventional gasoline\u2014the most  common and widely available gasoline blend\u2014unbranded gasoline had an  average 0.5-cents-per-gallon increase in price associated with unplanned  refinery outages, while branded gasoline had a smaller\u2014about 0.2-cents- per-gallon\u2014increase. The price effects observed in these cases reflect an  average increase in prices at the wholesale terminals in the 75 cities over  the study period. These results suggest that\u2014as some traders and other  market participants have told us\u2014during disruptions, refiners generally  choose to give priority in supplying those customers with whom they have  long-term supply contracts, which typically are for branded gasoline.  Therefore, in such conditions independent marketers\u2014which typically sell  unbranded gasoline\u2014may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain product  to sell. On the other hand, industry experts told us that unbranded sellers  may be able to buy wholesale gasoline at lower prices than branded sellers  during normal market conditions.", "With regard to the type of gasoline fuel blend being sold, our analysis  shows that the price increases associated with an unplanned refinery  outage were significantly greater for 8 of the 19 \u201cnon-base-case\u201d gasoline  types we identified than our \u201cbase case\u201d conventional clear gasoline, while  the price increases for other gasoline types were generally about the same  as those of conventional gasoline. In our analysis, we selected  conventional gasoline as our base case and used our model to determine  whether there were significant differences between this base case and  other fuel types with respect to the relationship between unplanned  refinery outages and price changes. We looked at 19 other non-base case  fuel types that were in use in the 75 cities we reviewed. We compared the  results of these 19 other fuel types to our conventional gasoline base case  and measured the price differences. The price increases associated with  unplanned refinery outages for various branded and unbranded gasoline  types that were higher than our conventional gasoline base case are shown  in table 1.", "The results suggest that some special fuel blends that include such  characteristics as unusual oxygenate requirements, lower RVP  requirements, or unusual oxygenate/RVP combinations may be more  sensitive to unplanned outages than other special fuel blends. For  example, for unbranded gasoline, the prices of some special fuel blends\u2014 such as CARB, conventional gasoline with oxygenate formulations such as  5.7 percent ethanol, or uncommon oxygenate/RVP formulations such as  conventional gasoline with 10 percent ethanol and a 7.0 RVP\u2014were more  sensitive to unplanned refinery outages than conventional gasoline  without such specifications. Specifically, the largest price differences  between our conventional gasoline base case and special gasoline blends,  were for CARB without oxygenate and conventional gasoline blended with  10 percent ethanol and a 7.0 RVP. In these instances, prices were about 10- cents and 8-cents-per-gallon higher than our base case. The results show  that the prices of unusual oxygenate/RVP combinations that are not  commonly produced at most refineries may be more sensitive to  unplanned outages than conventional gasoline, which can be more readily  re-supplied to a city experiencing an outage.", "Our analysis also shows that a number of other special fuel blends did not  experience significant price increases associated with unplanned refinery  outages above that of conventional gasoline, although the fuel types  affected depended partly on whether the gasoline was branded or  unbranded. These fuel types and the locations that require them are shown  in table 2.", "Finally, it should be noted that individual outages may have different  effects on prices depending on a variety of factors beyond those discussed  above. As discussed previously in this report, and in work by EIA and the  California Energy Commission, under certain conditions\u2014such as low  inventories, high seasonal demand, certain special fuel requirements, and  geographic conditions that may hinder easy re-supply to the market\u2014an  unplanned refinery outage could be expected to result in a price surge in  some cases. However, in some cases, unobserved factors can mitigate the  effects of outages, or even cause prices to fall, making it appear as if the  outage caused prices to fall. For example, a large shipment of a particular  special fuel blend located just offshore or beyond the Canadian border  could be a significant source of re-supply in the event of a disruption. In  addition, while our analysis examined the effect of about 1,100 unplanned  outages and 1,000 planned outages, our model did not differentiate  between the types of refinery equipment that went out of service, which  could have varying effects on wholesale gasoline prices. For example, an  unplanned outage of a fluid catalytic cracker\u2014a type of processing  equipment used to maximize the production of gasoline\u2014could be  expected to have a more significant effect on wholesale gasoline prices  than an unplanned outage on a piece of equipment\u2014such as a certain type  of hydrotreater\u2014that is designed to maximize production of distillates  such as diesel fuel or heating oil. Because our model does not distinguish  between the type of unit experiencing an outage, our results show average  impacts across different types of refining units, which means we tend to  underestimate the effect of an outage at a unit such as a fluid catalytic  cracker, and overestimate that of a non-gasoline producing unit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Gaps in Federal Data Constrain Analyses of Outage Effects and Other Related Issues", "paragraphs": ["Existing federal data contain gaps that limit analyses of refinery outages  on petroleum product prices and in some cases do not reflect emerging  trends\u2014although agencies continue to take steps to improve their data  collection.

Specifically, we were limited in this report in our ability to fully evaluate 1)  the price effects of unplanned outages at individual cities and 2) a city\u2019s  gasoline re-supply options in the event of an outage.", "Our ability to fully evaluate the price effects of unplanned outages at  individual cities\u2014for example, price effects in Atlanta, Georgia associated  with outages related to Hurricanes Ike and Gustav\u2014was limited because  federal data do not link refiners to the cities they serve.

Although we identified flow data collected at three agencies, the data were  of limited use because they did not show the volumetric entry, flow, and  exit of specific petroleum products through the pipeline.

Further, these data are not designed to show  the discrete movement of petroleum products through the pipeline  infrastructure.", "To help address these gaps in federal data, we purchased commercial data  for our analysis from the energy consulting company Baker & O\u2019Brien (see  app. I). These data estimate the quantity flows of gasoline and other  petroleum products produced at most U.S. refineries and transported to  those U.S. cities that make up the main markets for these products. While  we found the Baker & O\u2019Brien data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our analysis, these data are estimates only. Although we  determined the commercial data that we purchased to perform our  analyses were sufficient to describe the wholesale price impacts  associated with refinery outages on various gasoline types, the data were  not sufficient to accurately estimate the effects experienced by individual  cities. Further, the comprehensiveness of the data we purchased was  limited in part because private companies do not have the same ability as  the federal government to require refiners to provide comprehensive and  accurate information.", "Similar gaps in federal data also limited a recent effort by another federal  agency to fully address Congressional concerns regarding potential  pipeline constraints and agency concerns regarding refinery outages.", "In a January 2009 Congressionally mandated study to identify potential  pipeline infrastructure constraints, DOT was unable to fully address the  study\u2019s objectives due to the lack of appropriate federal pipeline flow and  petroleum product storage data. In its report, DOT noted that \u201ca need  exists to develop more robust metrics for such (pipeline flow)  measurements.\u201d The report also stated that \u201creliable data on storage  facilities is sparse\u201d and emphasized the need for additional data on oil and  petroleum product storage terminals, including the location, size, and  volumetric capacity of existing facilities to assess whether stored  petroleum products are sufficient to mitigate supply disruptions. In  addition, the study noted that additional data regarding the changing  location and arrangement of petroleum product pipelines would be  necessary to evaluate volumes of petroleum products transported. DOT  concluded that an analysis sufficient to address Congress\u2019s directives in  the 2006 law would require further quantitative and analytical modeling. In  particular, DOT officials told us the federal interagency effort to collect  data would need to result in more comprehensive data\u2014including  volumetric pipeline entry, flow, and exit information\u2014as well as more  reliable storage terminal and inventory data in order to more fully assess  the current and future reliability of the nation\u2019s pipeline infrastructure and  ability to respond to market disruptions.", "The absence of key data also limits the ability of federal agencies to  monitor the effect of emerging trends such as the use of biofuels\u2014for  example, ethanol\u2014in petroleum product markets. Specifically, we found  that gaps in federal data do not allow agencies to track where gasoline  blended with ethanol ultimately winds up in the fuel stream. Not having  this information may be at odds with consumer\u2019s interests. Since,  according to EPA, a gallon of ethanol contains two-thirds the energy of a  gallon of gasoline, when gasoline blended with ethanol is sold in areas  with no ethanol or oxygenate requirement, consumers may be purchasing  fuel that provides fewer miles-per-gallon without being aware of it. Our  analysis of gasoline sales data shows that from 2002 through 2008,  conventional gasoline blended with ethanol had been sold in areas with no  ethanol or other oxygenate mandates in at least 32 states. Agency and  industry officials told us that as the volume of biofuels to be blended with  gasoline continues to grow to 36 billion gallons in 2022, ethanol will  increasingly be distributed in locations that do not have requirements for  oxygenate content.", "Despite these gaps in federal data, individual agencies have generally  continued to take steps to update their data collection surveys to meet  their respective agency objectives or needs, and have often coordinated to  more efficiently obtain petroleum product data needed for a variety of  purposes at multiple agencies.", "In 2009, EIA began collecting data regarding the production, stocks at  production facilities, sales for resale, and end-use sales of biodiesel fuel.  Also, three existing EIA forms were expanded to collect biodiesel imports  and biodiesel blending and stocks at terminals and refineries. Our work  indicates this new survey will help analysts identify how and where  biodiesel is being used, a key emerging trend in the petroleum industry. In  addition, these data will be used by EPA to help monitor the volumes of  biofuel use specified in the RFS.", "Effective January 2009, EIA consolidated reporting of inventory  information at refineries, pipelines and terminals from two surveys to one.  This action will permit a more detailed and reliable analysis of petroleum  product terminal operations and provide a baseline for the volume of  petroleum products at various terminal locations that can potentially re- supply a city in the event of a major disruption. While this partially  addresses our need to have federal data that shows the re-supply options  in the event of a disruption, it neither shows the refiner-to-market link nor  does it provide detailed batch information on petroleum product flows  that would facilitate future analyses. Comprehensive inventory  information may be particularly useful to DOT should it be tasked with  completing another study to identify potential petroleum product  infrastructure constraints.", "EPA officials told us they have worked with the Department of Agriculture  and DOE in recent years regarding the recently issued 2007 Renewable  Fuels Standard program guidance. The aim of such guidance is to monitor  biofuel use\u2014a key emerging market trend\u2014and monitor compliance with  biofuels specified in the RFS.", "Nonetheless, in some cases the individual agency efforts have resulted in  the collection of information that does not necessarily meet the data needs  of other agencies or analysts who monitor petroleum product markets. For  example, federal reporting efforts have evolved such that EIA maintains  primary responsibility for collecting information on total gasoline supply,  including gasoline blendstocks, while EPA maintains primary  responsibility for capturing another key characteristic\u2014RVP\u2014of certain  gasoline blendstocks. Specifically, EIA\u2019s surveys are structured to collect  data on total gasoline supply, including blendstocks, on a monthly basis,  whereas EPA collects RVP information on each batch of reformulated  gasoline on a quarterly basis, and for all conventional gasoline supplied by  a particular refiner on an annual basis. This means that companies report  key information regarding gasoline components to two different federal  entities, and analysts who need information regarding the blendstock and  RVP of gasoline must go to two federal entities to obtain what is available;  in addition, the data are not comparable in terms of periodicity. Finally, as  described earlier, three different agencies collect a limited amount of  pipeline flow data to meet their specific agency\u2019s objectives, but  collectively these data do not allow analysts to fully monitor the flow of  petroleum product markets. This limited not only our ability to identify a  city\u2019s gasoline re-supply options in the event of an outage in this analysis,  but also DOT\u2019s efforts to fully address a Congressional mandate.

In our work we identified gaps in  public data, some of which we could address by purchasing privately  collected data, and some of which led to limitations to what our analysis  could address. Specifically, we were unable, with publicly available data,  to identify which refiners serve various cities across the country, and by  extension, which refineries produce special fuel blends designed to meet  federal, state, and local requirements. While the available public data,  along with the commercial data we purchased, allowed us to analyze the  broad impacts of refinery outages on various gasoline types on average;  during the initial week of the outage, the data were not sufficient to  determine the effects at individual cities. We also found an absence of  some data on emerging market trends in biofuels that is troubling, given  the rapid expansion of biofuel production and use in recent years. Some  data gaps we identified may exist because data collection efforts generally  reflect individual agency needs and, thus, may not necessarily consider the  broader needs of other federal agencies and analysts. We recognize that  agencies have a primary responsibility to perform their individual missions  and that these agencies face their own specific budgetary constraints.  However, we note the importance of each agency acknowledging that the  collection of individual pieces of federal data contributes to a larger data  universe and taking reasonable steps to ensure that the totality of these  data allow for meaningful understanding and oversight of petroleum  markets.

For the purposes of this report, we  define the various types of outages as follows:  Planned outages are p processing units or possibly the entire refinery to perform maintenance,  inspection, and repair of equipment or to replace process materials and  equipment that have worn out or broken, in order to ensure safe and  efficient operations. eriodic shutdowns of one or more refinery  Unplanned outages are events where an entire unit or refinery must be  brought down immediately and without advance notice and are caused by  unplanned circumstances such as a fire or a power outage.", "To determine trends in refinery outages over the time period from 2002  through September 2008, we purchased data from Industrial Information  Resources, Inc.

We believe the outages data from IIR are fairly  comprehensive but there are no federal requirements for refineries to  report outages or an effort by the federal government to collect these data  on a national basis. Consequently, some outages may not appear in the  data, though it is unlikely that any major outages were missed during our  study period. Further, we limited inclusion of outages to those that were at  least 3 days in duration and ranked in the top 60 percent in terms of  recorded capacity offline for a refinery\u2019s market region (as defined by IIR) Thus, we do not include every single outage but we have a broad  geographic range of the largest outages in the US. . inkage data between refineries and cities they serve.
