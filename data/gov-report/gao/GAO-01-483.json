Within the group of recidivists, the number of offenders reincarcerated for violating parole or other release conditions rose more than sevenfold from 1980 to 1998. Furthermore, such reincarcerations represent an increasing proportion of all prison admissions. The Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) 1997 survey found that most federal offenders (62 percent) were imprisoned for drug offense convictions, and almost half (47 percent) of all state offenders were incarcerated for violent offense convictions. Also, the majority of inmates in both correctional systems--federal inmates (73 percent) and state inmates (83 percent)--had some history of illegal drug use. BJS' survey also showed that 27 percent of both federal and state exit cohort inmates participated in vocational training programs, and 11 percent of federal and 2 percent of state exit cohort inmates worked in prison industry jobs. In addition, 33 percent of the federal inmates and 36 percent of the state inmates participated in residential in-patient treatment programs for alcohol and drug abuse. In the federal correctional system, an inmate's preparation for reintegration generally encompasses three phases--the prerelease, halfway house, and community supervision. Under the Offender Reentry Initiative, federal discretionary grants would be provided to help states and communities work together to improve offender supervision and accountability--and essential support services--to minimize public safety issues posed by high-risk or special-needs offenders released from state prisons, juvenile correctional facilities, and local facilities housing state prisoners.

If they were, the percentage of persons who are high when arrested would clearly be greater than 68 percent. \u201cWhen incarcerated in \u2026 state prisons and jails, these offenders are unlikely to receive appropriate substance abuse treatment, although the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment program operated by the Department of Justice is substantially increasing the availability of treatment in state prisons. Earlier this year SAMHSA\u2019s Office of Applied Studies issued a report analyzing whether treatment is provided in correctional settings.

As supporting evidence, BOP has cited the results of long-term evaluations of its drug treatment and work training programs. For example:   Drug treatment. In fall 2000, BOP reported that an evaluation of its residential drug abuse treatment program showed that offenders who completed the program and had been released to the community for 3 years were less likely to be rearrested or to be detected for drug use than were similar inmates who did not participate in the program.

One purpose of the series is to provide information to a supervision workgroup of probation officers, supervisors, and AOUSC officials. The workgroup, in turn, is to develop recommendations for updating pretrial services and postconviction supervision policies.

The 1994 BOP study was the most current study we identified that focused specifically on recidivism of prisoners released from federal prisons. The 1994 study, which now is somewhat dated, nonetheless was comprehensive in that it was based on a representative sample of federal inmates released in 1987. To reiterate, the 1994 study found that within 3 years of being released from BOP, about 41 percent of the 1987 releasees had either been rearrested or had their parole revoked. Regarding drug offenders in federal custody, the scope of our work did not include comparing current inmate populations and characteristics with those of the 1980s. We do note, however, that BJS data show that drug prosecutions constitute an increasing proportion of the federal criminal caseload, rising from 21 percent of defendants in cases terminating in U.S. district court during fiscal year 1982 to 36 percent during fiscal year 1999. Regarding BJS\u2019 1997 survey of inmates, we acknowledge that the survey is not a study of recidivism, per se.

NIJ anticipated that the evaluation would start in October 2001 and last about a year.", "In addition, some of the pilot reentry partnerships and pilot reentry courts have begun self-evaluation efforts. According to an OJP official, as volunteer participants, the pilot reentry partnerships and pilot reentry courts were not required to conduct self-evaluations, but OJP encouraged the pilot participants to track their progress so that mid-course corrections, if needed, could be made."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Legislative Proposals", "paragraphs": ["In the 106th Congress, two bills were introduced that addressed prisoner reintegration.

In February 2001, Senator Orrin Hatch introduced S. 304, the \u201cDrug Abuse Education, Prevention, and Treatment Act of 2001\u201d; Title VI of the bill is the \u201cProgram for Successful Reentry of Criminal Offenders into Local Communities.\u201d As of May 2001, neither of these bills had been enacted.", "These bills seek to address the public safety threats of offenders returning to communities by providing funding to   establish projects in several federal judicial districts, the District of Columbia, and BOP, using new strategies and emerging technologies to help successfully reintegrate released offenders into the community;   establish court-based programs to monitor released offenders, using court sanctions to promote positive behavior;   establish state offender reentry projects, using government and community partnerships;   establish intensive aftercare projects for juvenile offenders; and   evaluate these reentry programs to determine their effectiveness.", "S. 2908, H.R. 5563, and S. 194 would authorize, over 5 fiscal years (2001 through 2005), approximately $6 million to BOP, $18.7 million to the federal judiciary, and $23.6 million to the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency of the District of Columbia.
