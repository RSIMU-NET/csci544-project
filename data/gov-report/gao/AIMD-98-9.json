New federal accounting standards have been adopted to enhance financial statements by requiring that government agencies show the financial results of their entire operations and provide relevant information on agencies\u2019 true financial status. This report discusses one such requirement for valuable information related to the disposal costs of federal agencies\u2019 property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).

Using a due process and consensus building approach, the nine-member Board, which has since its formation included a member from DOD, recommends accounting standards for the federal government. Once FASAB recommends accounting standards, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Director of OMB, and the Comptroller General decide whether to adopt the recommended standards. If they are adopted, the standards are published as Statements of Federal Financial Accounting Standards (SFFAS) by OMB and by GAO. In addition, the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of 1996, as well as the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act, requires federal agencies to implement and maintain financial management systems that will permit the preparation of financial statements that substantially comply with applicable federal accounting standards.", "Issued in December 1995 and effective beginning with fiscal year 1997, SFFAS No. 5, Accounting for Liabilities of the Federal Government, requires the recognition of a liability for any probable and measurable future outflow of resources arising from past transactions. The statement defines probable as that which is likely to occur based on current facts and circumstances. It also states that a future outflow is measurable if it can be reasonably estimated. The statement recognizes that this estimate may not be precise and in such cases, it provides for recording the lowest estimate and disclosing in the financial statements the full range of estimated outflows that are likely to occur.", "SFFAS No. 6, Accounting for Property, Plant, and Equipment, which is effective beginning in fiscal year 1998, deals with various accounting issues pertaining to PP&E. This statement establishes several new accounting categories of PP&E, collectively called stewardship PP&E. Other PP&E is referred to as general PP&E. One of the new stewardship categories\u2014federal mission PP&E\u2014is defined as tangible items owned by a federal government entity, principally DOD, that have no expected nongovernmental use, are held for use in the event of emergency, war, or natural disaster, and have an unpredictable useful life. Federal mission PP&E, which includes ships, submarines, aircraft, and combat vehicles, is a major part of DOD\u2019s total PP&E.", "SFFAS No. 6 also provides information on how SFFAS No. 5\u2019s standard on liabilities should be applied to PP&E. Specifically, SFFAS No. 6 discusses how to recognize the liability for the clean up of hazardous waste in PP&E.

Our objectives were to determine (1) the status of DOD\u2019s efforts to implement the new federal accounting standard for disclosure of liabilities, such as aircraft disposal, and (2) whether an estimate of the minimum disposal liability for aircraft, including the removal and disposal of hazardous materials, could be made. The following was done to accomplish our objectives.", "To assess the status of DOD\u2019s efforts to implement SFFAS No. 5, we reviewed DOD regulations and interviewed officials from the DOD Comptroller\u2019s office. To gain an understanding of the procedures and the financial and logistical management information systems that can be used to accumulate and report on aircraft disposal costs, we (1) examined the management and financial reporting for these programs used by the services, (2) reviewed applicable DOD and service instructions and regulations, and (3) interviewed DOD, Air Force, Army, and Navy officials.", "To determine if the liability is reasonably estimable, we identified the financial and logistical management information systems and reporting mechanisms in place that contain information about the costs of aircraft disposal, including demilitarization and hazardous material disposal processes. We visited DOD\u2019s designated aircraft storage, reclamation, and disposal facility at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) where data were readily available for addressing removal and disposal costs of older, out of service aircraft systems. To determine if the liability could be estimated for newer aircraft, we selected five aircraft for review. The five aircraft selected were the Air Force\u2019s F-16 and B-1B, the Navy\u2019s F-14 and F-18, and the Army\u2019s AH-64 Apache Helicopter. We chose these five aircraft because they represent the primary fighter or attack and bomber aircraft for each of the services, have the largest number in their class, and represent about 17 percent of the services\u2019 combined active and inactive inventory.", "Because environmental costs are more variable and are likely to raise more complex estimation issues, we performed a more in-depth analysis of these costs. Using data initially obtained at AMARC, information in the DOD hazardous material disposal manual, and visits to maintenance depots, we prepared a list of hazardous materials associated with each of these aircraft. On a case-by-case basis, we then obtained depot level officials\u2019 concurrence that these items represent the primary hazardous material on each of these aircraft.", "To compute the cost of removing hazardous materials from each aircraft, we reviewed documents that stated a standard or estimated removal time for each of the hazardous material items from the depot responsible for program depot maintenance on the applicable aircraft and AMARC\u2019s hourly labor rate. We did not independently verify the data obtained from the inventory and financial systems or the reported removal times.", "We interviewed the services\u2019 environmental engineers to determine which hazardous materials require disposal. To determine the costs of disposing of these materials, we reviewed disposal and shipping records at AMARC and the various depots. For those materials that were not scheduled for disposal, we interviewed various depot personnel to determine their methods for reusing and recycling them. We also discussed disposal procedures with various offices of the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service.", "During our review, we contacted personnel and/or conducted work at various locations including the Army Aviation and Troop Command Headquarters, St. Louis, Missouri; Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center, Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona; Air Logistics Centers at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma; Office of the Chief of Naval Operations; Naval Aviation Depots at Jacksonville, Florida and North Island, California; Corpus Christi Army Depot, Corpus Christi, Texas; offices of the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, Battle Creek, Michigan; and applicable headquarters offices in the Washington, D.C., area.", "We conducted our review from July 1996 through June 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

On September 30, 1997, the DOD Comptroller\u2019s office posted revisions to the electronic version of DOD\u2019s Financial Management Regulation to include SFFAS Nos. 1 through 4, but SFFAS No. 5 was not included. In addition, the DOD Comptroller, who is responsible for developing and issuing guidance on accounting standards, and the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology), who is responsible for the operational activities associated with aircraft disposal, have not provided implementation guidance to the services to assist them in estimating the disposal costs for aircraft. Service officials stated that they are reluctant to estimate a liability for their aircraft until they receive DOD-wide guidance. Unless prompt action to implement this standard is taken, it is unlikely that DOD\u2019s fiscal year 1997 financial statements will include an estimate of aircraft disposal costs as required."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aircraft Disposal Liability Has Been Incurred", "paragraphs": ["One of the key criteria cited in SFFAS No. 5 for a liability to be reported is that a future cost is probable\u2014that is, the future outflow of resources is likely to occur. While the likelihood of a future outflow may be difficult to determine and an entity may have difficulty deciding whether to record a liability for certain events, DOD continually disposes of aircraft and has an amount for disposal costs in its annual budget. Thus, because it is known at the time of acquisition that costs will be incurred for the disposal of aircraft, the probability criterion for recording a liability is met. The Congress has also recognized that disposal costs will be incurred and has emphasized the importance of accumulating and considering this information. For example, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 requires the Secretary of Defense to determine, as early in the acquisition process as feasible, the life-cycle costs for major defense acquisitions, including the materials to be used and methods of disposal. The life-cycle cost estimates are required before proceeding with the major acquisition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aircraft Disposal Process", "paragraphs": ["All aircraft are eventually disposed of using the same basic processes. Any estimate of the disposal liability must take into account these processes and use them as the basis for determining costs. The disposal process starts with the decision to remove an aircraft from service, referred to as retirement (Army), decommissioning (Air Force), and striking (Navy) of military aircraft. Aircraft disposal consideration begins when the services prepare an updated force structure plan. The plan shows the projected requirements for each type of aircraft and includes new procurement and various attrition factors including crashes, programmed retirements, airframe stress tests, parts reclamation needs, and foreign military sales. Active aircraft not needed to meet the services\u2019 current and forecasted requirements are sent to AMARC, DOD\u2019s designated storage and disposal facility for aircraft for temporary or long-term storage and eventual disposal.", "Aircraft arriving at AMARC are either placed in a flyable or temporary hold status, prepared for foreign military sales, salvaged for parts, or placed into long-term storage awaiting either eventual disposal or reuse determination. AMARC officials stated that, in general, planes that undergo the storage process are not recalled and are ultimately disposed of through sales or salvage. Once the military services have determined no further need exists for the aircraft, they are released for disposal. These aircraft and related parts are subjected to demilitarization processes to prevent further military use before they are transferred to the Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service (DRMS) for sale as scrap.Demilitarization may take place at the air base, at AMARC, or at the local DRMS field office. Part of the demilitarization process involves removing all remaining hazardous materials from the aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inventory of Aircraft", "paragraphs": ["Aircraft acquired by the services are, in general, considered mission assets.

As shown in table 1, DOD reported about 18,000 active aircraft as of September 30, 1996, the most recent data available.", "The aircraft inventory serves as the basis for estimating the disposal liability although factors such as foreign military sales would have to be considered in adjusting the number of aircraft. According to a March 1997 AMARC report, about 4 percent of AMARC\u2019s inventory at any given time is scheduled for foreign military sales. Aircraft lost during operations, however, are generally replaced to maintain the inventory at certain levels. As a result, operational losses may not reduce the total liability for aircraft disposal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Aircraft Disposal Liability Could Be Estimated", "paragraphs": ["The second key criterion in SFFAS No. 5 for reporting of a liability is that an amount be reasonably estimable.

Although data were available for each of the disposal processes, we performed a more detailed analysis of the costs associated with the removal and disposal of hazardous materials because these costs are more variable and likely to present more complex estimation issues. The information in the following sections indicates the types and sources of information available for DOD to develop an aircraft disposal cost estimate. As stated in SFFAS No. 5, this process may result in a range of potential aggregate costs, the lowest of which should be recorded unless an amount within the range which is most likely to occur is estimable."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Estimated Demilitarization Costs", "paragraphs": ["Demilitarization includes removing weapons and other designated items from the aircraft and then taking the aircraft off line. Other demilitarization actions include removing equipment that has, directly or indirectly, a significant military utility or capacity, such as sensitive radar equipment. A salvage or residual value for the aircraft was deducted from the demilitarization costs, since historically the remains of aircraft are sold as scrap at the time of disposal. As shown in table 2, demilitarization costs varied considerably for the three aircraft in our review for which this information was readily available from program offices. Although the B-1B and the Apache Helicopter are newer aircraft for which demilitarization plans and costs have not yet been developed, disposal cost estimates could be based on cost experience for other aircraft with similar missions. AMARC officials stated that disposal tasks are generally similar among aircraft although the quantity and complexity of specific items may differ. For new weapons systems, including aircraft, the disposal costs, including demilitarization costs, are to be developed as part of the life-cycle costs required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995.", "Jacksonville Naval Depot officials stated that the demilitarization cost for the F-14 was significantly more than the other two aircraft because of the complexity of the disposal work effort and the related costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimated Cost to Maintain Aircraft in Storage", "paragraphs": ["Aircraft are stored at AMARC\u2019s long-term storage facility. All openings, cracks, and joints have to be sealed and delicate surfaces protected from the hot sun, wind, and sand. The preservation process is repeated every 4 to 5 years to ensure that each aircraft is adequately protected. According to AMARC\u2019s costing system, the maintenance costs of aircraft in long-term storage are about $400 per aircraft per year. According to an AMARC official, aircraft, on average, are kept in long-term storage for 20 years. They also stated that, in general, planes that undergo the storage process are not recalled and are ultimately disposed of through sales or salvage. Such storage costs could result in a significant liability. For example, if the current active inventory of 18,000 aircraft were all maintained in storage for the average of 20 years and AMARC\u2019s estimated maintenance cost of $400 per aircraft per year were used, the storage costs would be at least $140 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Removal and Disposal of Hazardous Materials", "paragraphs": ["All five aircraft types we reviewed contained hazardous materials that must be removed, and if necessary, disposed of when the aircraft are taken out of service. Some hazardous materials can be recycled and reused multiple times, but the materials may ultimately have to be disposed of appropriately. For the five aircraft, sufficient information was available in DOD\u2019s and the services\u2019 financial and management information systems to estimate a cost for the removal of hazardous materials contained in these aircraft. Costs associated with disposal of these materials are currently insignificant, but will need to be considered based on assumptions of final disposal methods.", "There are numerous sources available to DOD for identifying which materials used in aircraft are considered hazardous and have to be cleaned up before aircraft disposal. DOD Manual 4160.21-M, known as the Property Disposal Manual and 40 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) 261 identify which materials are considered hazardous. Environmental managers at the services\u2019 program offices and at the depots responsible for the aircraft, as well as maintenance personnel, are knowledgeable about the hazardous materials unique to specific aircraft. In addition, environmental managers at various Defense Reutilization and Marketing Offices (DRMOs) are familiar with the hazardous materials on aircraft. The aircraft we reviewed contain various hazardous materials, as shown in table 3. See appendix I for definitions of these materials.", "Some hazardous materials in aircraft are not shown in the above table. For example, there are many items on the aircraft, such as cadmium-plated bolts and other small items, that are too numerous to separately remove and account for during the disposal process. Because the cadmium plated items are sold for scrap and the specific items and quantities are not separately identified, they were not included in the sample aircraft analysis. However, DOD and the services would have to consider the significance of such items in the aggregate on a servicewide or DOD-wide basis.", "Information on the removal costs of hazardous materials in older aircraft is generally available at AMARC and is based on its experience in aircraft disposal. However, AMARC officials said they did not yet have significant experience in dismantling and disposing of the five aircraft in our review. Therefore, the officials suggested that a reasonable estimation approach would be to use removal times that are reported by the cognizant depots that perform maintenance on these systems. The removal times for each hazardous material can then be multiplied by AMARC\u2019s hourly labor rate. Using this estimation method, table 4 shows the estimated cost of removing hazardous materials from the five aircraft.", "The wide variance in hazardous material removal costs can be accounted for by differences in the size and complexity of the five aircraft. For example, the B-1B weighs about 190,000 pounds compared to the smaller F-16 which weighs about 18,000 pounds. Moreover, the B-1B has over 1,000 items associated with pyrotechnics that cost an estimated $92,000 to remove. The cost to remove pyrotechnics from the F-16 is only about $1,700 per aircraft. Similarly, it takes a significant number of staff hours, estimated at about $11,000, to remove the fuel from the B-1B tanks and fuel lines and to take the protective measures for the fuel system. For the F-16, the same procedures take just a few hours at an estimated cost of about $200. The fuel is removed from the aircraft because it can be reused.", "The Apache Helicopter hazardous material removal cost estimate is much less than for the other aircraft because it contains considerably less hazardous material. For example, it costs an estimated $68 per aircraft to remove pyrotechnics from the Apache compared to about $1,700 to remove pyrotechnics from an F-16. The F-16 cost estimate includes removing one or two ejection seats and canopies and related detonating cord devices, compared to removing only emergency escape explosive bolts and related material for the Apache\u2019s crew doors.", "For some mission assets, such as nuclear submarines, the actual hazardous material disposal costs are significant. However, unlike the removal costs, hazardous material disposal costs for the five aircraft in our review appear not to be significant because these materials are often reutilized, recycled, consumed (as is the case for fuel), or sold. Also, DOD does not track disposal costs by specific aircraft system since hazardous materials are disposed of in bulk. For example, AMARC transfers its nonrecyclable fuel to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, which then disposes of it along with the base\u2019s waste fuel through its bulk disposal contract. For the first 6 months of fiscal year 1996, AMARC paid Davis-Monthan less than $54,000 to dispose of all of its hazardous material. However, although recycling and reuse accounts for much of the hazardous material disposal costs, currently the possibility that reuse or recycling needs and capacity will change in the future must be considered in estimating the ultimate disposal costs for hazardous materials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reporting Total Disposal Costs by Future Time Periods Would Be Useful", "paragraphs": ["DOD officials have pointed out that the total disposal cost estimate for aircraft will result in a significant liability\u2014much of which would not require outlays in the current year. Thus, one way to provide a proper context for this reported liability and make it more meaningful to decisionmakers would be to, in a footnote to the financial statements, provide a breakdown of the liability based on the approximate time periods the aircraft are expected to be taken out of service. Table 5 is a simplified illustration of how the aircraft disposal liability could be reported by time period. For the purposes of this illustration, the following assumptions were used: (1) all aircraft had the same disposal costs, (2) 50 percent of the aircraft were currently awaiting disposal and the remaining aircraft were to be disposed of over the next 10 years, and (3) the total estimated liability was $500.", "This information could provide an important context for congressional and other budget decisionmakers on the total liability by showing the potential annual impact of the actions that have already occurred or are expected to occur during various budget periods including those outside the annually submitted Future Years Defense Program.

In addition, DOD stated that current disposal cost estimates can be reasonably determined for aircraft that have been in the active inventory for some time.
