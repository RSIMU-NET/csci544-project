Mexican officials stated that there has been extensive communication  with the United States on energy issues, in particular at the ministerial  and agency levels, which has led to activities to improve integration.", "Some officials also identified changes in the overall foreign policy context  that could affect cooperation in the future.", "Some Canadian and Mexican government officials we interviewed  expressed concern that the renegotiation of NAFTA and the  administration\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement could  create uncertainty among investors in the energy sector. U.S.,  Canadian, and Mexican officials , as well as private sector  representatives we interviewed, stated that they viewed NAFTA  renegotiation as an opportunity to improve the agreement and that  any changes to NAFTA should \u201cdo no harm\u201d to free-trade  arrangements in energy commodities. However, a Canadian official  told us industry representatives had expressed concern that the issue  of energy could be used as a pawn in NAFTA renegotiations, resulting  in harm to the sector. Furthermore, some Mexican officials stated that  they were particularly concerned that any change in Mexico\u2019s status  as a U.S. free-trade partner could complicate flows of natural gas from  the United States, which has assumed a more important role as an  energy source for Mexico.", "Some Canadian and Mexican officials we interviewed expressed  concern that the June 2017 announcement of the United States\u2019  intention to withdrawal from the Paris Agreement could create a  perception of an uneven playing field and uncertainty among energy  sector investors, given Canada\u2019s and Mexico\u2019s continued participation  in the accord. However, the officials noted that the commitment of  some U.S. states, cities, and private sector companies to adhere to  the accord\u2019s tenets may minimize any negative impacts of the U.S.  government\u2019s withdrawal on their countries\u2019 energy sectors. State and  DOE officials we interviewed said they did not expect the U.S.  renegotiation of NAFTA and withdrawal from the Paris Agreement to  have a significant impact and stated that the energy sector in North  America is already well integrated and well positioned to address  these changes.", "U.S. government officials we interviewed noted that the United States\u2019  energy sector is already extensively integrated with both Canada\u2019s and  Mexico\u2019s. The officials stated that most easily accomplished actions to  promote integration have already been taken and that they are primarily  looking for ways to enhance a system that is working well. They also  stated that it is important not to disrupt the advances that have already been made.

We conducted field work in Mexico City, Mexico, and in  Ottawa, Canada, where we met with government and energy sector  association representatives. We also collected information on activities  related to North American energy integration from U.S. agencies  implementing such activities. In addition, we obtained and analyzed data  from the U.S. Census Bureau regarding the extent of the United States\u2019  energy trade with Canada and Mexico.", "To examine the ways in which the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican  governments cooperate on North American energy integration, we  interviewed officials in each country who were responsible for energy- related cooperation, asking about the processes they follow to cooperate  on energy integration at the strategic and technical levels. In the United  States, we spoke with officials from the Departments of Energy (DOE),  State (State), Interior (Interior), Commerce (Commerce), the Treasury  (Treasury), Transportation (DOT), and Homeland Security (DHS); the  U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID); and the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). We also corresponded with  officials from the Environmental Protection Agency. In addition, we spoke  with officials of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.  Further, we met with Canadian and Mexican embassy officials in  Washington, D.C. In Canada, we met with officials from Natural  Resources Canada and Global Affairs Canada and spoke with officials  from the Alberta provincial government. In Mexico, we met with officials  from Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Energy; National Hydrocarbons Commission;  Energy Regulatory Commission; National Gas Control Center; National  Center for Energy Control; and Agency for Safety, Energy and  Environment. We also reviewed documents developed to formalize  bilateral and trilateral cooperation, such as the 2016 North American  Climate, Clean Energy, and Environment Partnership Action Plan;  documents related to the U.S.\u2013Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue;  and the \u201c2017 North American Energy Ministerial Joint Summary.\u201d", "To examine U.S. agencies\u2019 energy integration activities implemented  since 2014, we reviewed agency documents; interviewed DOE, Interior,  Commerce, State, DOT, FERC, USAID, and DHS officials; and  corresponded with officials from the Environmental Protection Agency.  Also, in May 2018, we contacted Treasury officials after learning about  recent Treasury activities related to North American energy integration.  In addition, we sent a survey to DOE, Interior, Commerce, State, DOT,  FERC, USAID, and DHS, asking them to, among other things, identify  their energy integration activities implemented from 2014 through 2017;  describe each activity, including its purpose; identify the type of activity  (e.g., joint research and development, trade mission, forum for technical  discussion, regulatory cooperation, technical assistance, other); and  identify other agencies participating in the activity. The survey also asked  whether the identified activities were bilateral with Canada or Mexico,  trilateral, multilateral, or unilateral. We followed up with the agencies to  ask for clarifications. We did not independently determine whether the  agencies had identified all relevant activities.", "In addition, we reviewed agencies\u2019 responses to identify any overlap and  duplication among federal energy integration efforts. We focused on the  goals and outcomes of energy integration activities as described in the  agency-provided descriptions and in background material, as needed. We  also focused on the activities\u2019 target populations, or intended  beneficiaries, since a bilateral U.S.\u2013Canadian activity would have a  different target population than a bilateral U.S.\u2013Mexican activity. We  compared activities within categories to look for evidence of duplication or  overlap based on the description provided by the agency or other  background material (i.e., agency website and documents). We  determined, in accordance with GAO\u2019s definitions of duplication and  overlap, that no two of the agency activities were duplicative or  overlapping because the activities did not have the same or similar goals  or the same or similar beneficiaries.", "To examine U.S. agencies\u2019 efforts to coordinate with each other on North  American energy integration, we conducted interviews with DOE, Interior,  Commerce, and State officials, asking them to identify and discuss any  mechanisms, such as interagency groups, offices, activities, or initiatives,  used for collaboration for the purposes of energy integration. To conduct  a more detailed analysis of interagency coordination on North American  integration, we interviewed participants in a National Security Council  (NSC)\u2013led interagency working group using a standard set of questions  about interagency coordination and collaboration. We selected the NSC  working group because it provides an example of very high-level  interagency collaboration, could address multiple aspects of energy  integration, and had a specific focus and effect on energy-integration  efforts. Although we had intended to interview NSC officials, as of April  2018, NSC had not responded to our requests for documents and an  interview. As a result, we were unable to include NSC views about the  interagency collaboration considerations discussed. However, we were  able to mitigate this limitation by interviewing and comparing the  testimonial evidence of officials from the four participating agencies. We  provided agency officials a structured set of questions about interagency  coordination and collaboration that were based on key considerations for  implementing interagency collaboration identified in a prior GAO report.", "To examine the ways in which U.S. agencies obtain feedback and input  from U.S. industry and civil society, we conducted several informational  interviews with industry associations and civil society organizations, such  as think tanks and other environmental groups. To identify these  organizations, we reviewed witness lists at relevant congressional and  agency hearings, panel lists at energy-related conferences, and  recommendations from agency officials. In addition, as we interviewed  representatives of these organizations, we asked them to identify other  groups that might provide further information. Using this approach, we  interviewed representatives from seven civil society groups and 10  industry associations, including organizations based in Mexico and  Canada. However, our sample was judgmentally selected and their  opinions are not generalizable to all private industry and civil society  stakeholders.", "To report on steps suggested by U.S., Canadian, and Mexican officials to  further facilitate North American energy integration, we interviewed  officials in each country who were responsible for energy-related  cooperation and asked them to suggest additional steps or options that  the United States, in collaboration with Canada and Mexico, could take to  facilitate building a more integrated and secure energy market in North  America. In the United States, we spoke with officials from DOE, Interior,  Commerce, State, DOT, FERC, USAID, Treasury, and DHS. We also  spoke with Canadian and Mexican embassy officials in Washington, D.C.  Additionally, in Canada, we spoke with officials from Natural Resources  Canada, Global Affairs Canada, and the Alberta provincial government. In  Mexico, we spoke with officials from Mexico\u2019s Secretariat of Energy,  National Hydrocarbons Commission, Energy Regulatory Commission,  National Gas Control Center, National Center for Energy Control, and  Agency Energy and Environment Safety. We analyzed responses  provided by officials in the three countries and identified four steps  suggested by one or more officials in each of the countries: (1) aligning  energy regulatory cooperation, (2) streamlining the presidential permitting  process, (3) facilitating cross-border movement of equipment and  workers, and (4) involving states and provinces in energy integration  efforts. After identifying these four steps, we elaborated on each one by  reviewing related documents and reports and discussing them with  private sector representatives and researchers in nongovernmental  organizations. We did not elaborate on steps suggested by U.S.,  Canadian, or Mexican officials that were not suggested by at least one  official in all three countries.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2017 to July 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
