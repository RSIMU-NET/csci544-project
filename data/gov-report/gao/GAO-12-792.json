However, few CAOs haveacquisition management as their primary duty; other areas of responsibilityincluded financial, information, and human capital management.", "Several CAOs noted that their additional responsibilities were not a detriment. Rather, they believe that performing multiple roles helps them positively influence acquisition management across their agencies. For example, the CAO at the Department of Commerce stated that his additional responsibilities gave him the ability to integrate planning, budgeting, risk management, human resources, and acquisition to achieve the agency\u0092s mission.", "CAOs reported varying levels of involvement in the acquisition management functions for which they are responsible. Generally, CAOs see their role as providing high-level oversight of the acquisition function as opposed to day-today management, which they typically delegated to the Senior Procurement Executive or other officials as permitted by the legislation. Many CAOs said that the amount of their involvement is related to several factors, such as the nature of goods and services that the agency buys and whether the agency has a centralized or decentralized acquisition function.", "Having clearly defined roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in the acquisition process is a key element of an effective acquisition function. Yet at many agencies, the statutory roles and responsibilities of the CAO position are not described in detail in acquisition regulations, policies, or other documentation. These agencies may be missing an opportunity to fully institutionalize the CAO position within their senior leadership structures.", "CAOs at the 16 agencies generally did not report facing significant challenges related to the CAO position, such as the level of influence they have in their agency\u0092s acquisition process, amount of control over acquisition budget resources, and access to agency leadership.

However, agencies have  historically faced significant acquisition management challenges that have  prevented them from getting the best return on their investments in goods  and services. To address these challenges, agencies must establish a  strong foundation for an effective, efficient and accountable acquisition  process, which includes proper organizational alignment and committed  agency leadership. To this end, the Services Acquisition Reform Act of  2003 (SARA) requires 16 federal civilian agencies to establish the  position of a Chief Acquisition Officer (CAO) to advise and assist agency  leadership to help ensure that the agency\u2019s mission is achieved through  the management of its acquisition activities.", "You asked that we review the implementation of the CAO position at  federal agencies. In response, we examined: (1) how agencies have filled  the CAO position; (2) the extent to which CAOs are involved in performing  the acquisition management functions set forth in the SARA legislation  and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, and (3) what  challenges, if any, agency CAOs report in fulfilling their responsibilities.  To address these objectives, we analyzed the SARA legislation and  directives from OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) to  identify the key roles and responsibilities of the CAO position. We then  administered a questionnaire by e-mail to the 16 civilian agencies within  the scope of our review. The questionnaire requested information on,  among other things, the CAOs\u2019 organizational reporting relationships,  tenure, involvement in acquisition management functions within the  agency, and challenges experienced in fulfilling their CAO responsibilities.  We received responses from all 16 agencies, though not all agencies  provided responses to each question. We also collected and reviewed  agency organizational charts, acquisition regulations and guidance,  applicable policies and delegation orders, as well as biographical  information, to identify the organizational placement, roles and  responsibilities, and professional background of the CAO position within  the agency. Finally, we conducted follow-up interviews to discuss the  CAO\u2019s roles and responsibilities with CAOs and acquisition officials at  seven agencies: Energy, the General Services Administration (GSA),  Commerce, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Interior,  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration (NASA). We selected a nongeneralizable  sample of agencies for follow-up interviews based upon the following  criteria: review of the questionnaire responses, the agency\u2019s procurement  obligations in fiscal year 2010, and whether the agency\u2019s Inspector  General had identified acquisition-related issues as a major management  challenge. Our review did not assess the effectiveness of individual CAOs  or individual agencies\u2019 acquisition functions.

The key functions of the  CAO we reviewed are listed below; additional information on these  functions is also available in appendix II: monitoring and evaluating agency acquisition activities; increasing the use of full and open competition; increasing performance-based contracting; making acquisition decisions; managing agency acquisition policy; acquisition career management; acquisition resources planning; and conducting acquisition assessments under OMB Circular A-123.", "The SARA legislation also established a Chief Acquisition Officers  Council that is chaired by OMB\u2019s Deputy Director for Management, and  whose activities are led by the OFPP Administrator.principal interagency forum for monitoring and improving the federal  acquisition system.

When asked to estimate the  amount of time spent on their CAO duties relative to their other  responsibilities, the average among the 14 agencies that provided a  response was about 27 percent. Furthermore, only 3 of the 12  permanent CAOs in place during our review had prior experience in  acquisition or procurement prior to serving as CAO.

Similar to the SARA  legislation, the legislation that created the Chief Human Capital Officer  (CHCO) and Chief Information Officer (CIO) positions required that  those respective functions be the primary duty of each position. We  have raised concerns in prior work about those positions having  additional significant responsibilities and whether an individual serving  in these positions can deal effectively with an agency\u2019s management  challenges. Although this could be a concern with respect to CAOs  who do not have acquisition management as their primary duty, the  Office of Federal Procurement Policy noted that an agency\u2019s Senior  Procurement Executive provides high-level attention to the  management of the acquisition function.", "Some CAOs and acquisition officials also pointed out that the SARA  legislation did not provide agencies an additional position specifically  for the CAO, which created a challenge for agencies to determine how  to fill the CAO position. For example, the NASA CAO noted in her  questionnaire response that the agency has a low allocation of  politically appointed positions. As a result, NASA gave the CAO duties  to the CFO. NASA\u2019s CAO stated that because the agency spends  such a large amount of its budget through obligations on contracts,  her role as the CFO is closely connected with her additional role as  the CAO to effectively conduct acquisition management at NASA.  Furthermore, the NASA CAO thought that having these two functions  integrated was a positive aspect of her current position and helped  her be an effective CAO, as opposed to having acquisition operate in  a separate stovepipe.", "The CAO at Commerce emphasized the positive aspects of the  agency\u2019s organizational structure and approach to implementation of  the CAO position. At Commerce, one individual serves in a number of  roles that includes the CFO, CHCO, and Chief Performance Officer as  well as the CAO. The CAO noted that this structure gave him the  ability to integrate planning, budgeting, risk management, human  resources, as well as acquisition to achieve the agency\u2019s mission. As  the individual who ties these functional areas together, he indicated  he has the authority to get other groups within Commerce to work  together. The Commerce CAO also stated that while he oversees the  department\u2019s budget as the CFO, he uses his CAO role to look at  whether components have demonstrated a sound acquisition  management approach in evaluating their budget requests. He also  stated that if he were only the agency CAO he would not have as  much authority in other functional areas to effectively manage the  agency\u2019s acquisition function.", "Likewise, the CAO at DHS said that he has oversight of many  different management functions such as finance, budgeting, human  resources, as well as acquisition. While this arrangement may appear  to be in conflict with the statutory requirement that acquisition  management be the CAO\u2019s primary duty, he stated that having a  larger area of responsibility gives him a fuller view of the entire  acquisition cycle from requirements development and contract funding  to service delivery.

Despite these responses and other issues raised in our report, almost all  the CAOs believed that they had the appropriate authority to fulfill their  acquisition management responsibilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["More than 8 years after the enactment of the SARA legislation, there is  wide variation in how agencies have implemented the CAO position. On  one hand, agencies have generally filled the CAO position with political  appointees who sit at relatively high levels within their agencies in a  position to ensure that acquisition is receiving attention from agency  leadership. Many CAOs and acquisition officials we met with cited this as  a key benefit of the CAO position. On the other hand, there are  inconsistencies in the implementation of the law across agencies, with  very few CAOs having acquisition management as their primary  responsibility, although many CAOs cited the benefits to integrating  acquisition management with their additional responsibilities. The CAO  position is only one factor of many in an efficient, effective, and  accountable acquisition function in agencies. Having an experienced  Senior Procurement Executive is another. There is no one-size-fits-all  approach to how to organize an effective acquisition function, and a  CAO\u2019s role should be suited to the nature and volume of an agency\u2019s  acquisition activities. Yet, agencies should ensure that they are  maximizing their chances for success by having CAOs that are in a  position to influence agency leadership and serve as a strong advocate  for acquisition management, which includes having clearly defined roles  and responsibilities for the CAO. Not all agencies have these, however,  and may be missing an opportunity to ensure that the CAO position is  fully institutionalized within agencies\u2019 acquisition management and senior  leadership structures. Given CAOs\u2019 short tenures, a lack of defined roles  and responsibilities could hinder a CAO\u2019s ability to maximize time in the  position and serve as an effective advocate for acquisition management."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen the functions of CAOs in acquisition management, we  recommend that the Administrator of the Office of Federal Procurement  Policy, working with the CAO Council, issue guidance to agencies  directing them to ensure that CAO roles and responsibilities are more  clearly defined in accordance with law and regulations, tailored to suit the  agency\u2019s acquisition activities, and documented as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We sent copies of a draft of this report to OMB and the 16 agencies within  the scope of our review.

Our review did not assess the effectiveness of  individual CAOs or individual agencies\u2019 acquisition functions.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed the SARA legislation and  directives from OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy to identify the  key roles and responsibilities of the CAO position. We also reviewed  previous GAO work on assessing the acquisition function and the  implementation of other chief officer positions in the federal government.  To learn more about CAOs\u2019 characteristics, as well as CAOs\u2019 involvement  in acquisition management functions and challenges faced in fulfilling  their responsibilities, we developed and administered a questionnaire by  e-mail in an attached Microsoft Word form to the 16 civilian agencies  within the scope of our review. We pretested the questionnaire to ensure  that the questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to understand.  We also solicited comments on the draft questionnaire from members of  the Chief Acquisition Officers Council. The questionnaire requested  information on, among other things, the CAOs\u2019 reporting relationships,  involvement in acquisition management functions within the agency, the  extent to which the CAO had delegated their acquisition management  responsibilities to other officials, and challenges identified by GAO that  CAOs may have experienced in fulfilling their responsibilities. We sent the  questionnaire to agencies in November 2011. All questionnaires were  returned by March 2012. We received responses from all 16 agencies,  though not all agencies provided responses to each question.", "To provide additional information on CAOs\u2019 characteristics, involvement in  acquisition management functions and challenges faced, as well as to  corroborate information provided in the questionnaire responses, we  collected and reviewed agencies\u2019 organizational charts that showed the  CAO\u2019s position relative to the head of the agency and other senior  officials; letters of delegation or other documents that formally designate  the appointment of the CAO, the CAO\u2019s resume or curriculum vitae  describing their qualifications and experience related to the CAO position;  applicable policies, guidance, position descriptions or functional  statements for both the CAO and Senior Procurement Executive  positions; applicable policies or orders that delegate the CAO\u2019s  responsibilities to other acquisition officials; agency acquisition function  assessments performed under OMB Circular A-123; Acquisition Human  Capital Plans or similar documents; agency strategic plans and  performance reports; agency-specific acquisition regulations and  acquisition manuals; and descriptions of acquisition metrics or  performance measures the agency tracks. We also asked each agency to  supply the name, time in office, and circumstances (whether they were in  an acting or permanent position and whether they were a career  employee or political appointee) of each of the individuals who had  served as agency CAO and Senior Procurement Executive since  enactment of the SARA legislation in November 2003.", "To complement information gathered through the questionnaire and  agency documentation, we conducted follow-up interviews to discuss the  CAO\u2019s roles and responsibilities with CAOs and acquisition officials at  seven agencies: Commerce, Department of Homeland Security (DHS),  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Interior, Energy, GSA,  and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). We used  a nongeneralizable sample of agencies based upon the following criteria:  review of the questionnaire responses, the amount of procurement  spending as a portion of the agency\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget, and  whether the agency\u2019s Inspector General had identified acquisition-related  issues as a major management challenge.
