Involuntary mobilizations are currently limited to a cumulative total of 24 months under DOD's implementation of the partial mobilization authority. Faced with some critical shortages, DOD changed a number of its personnel policies to increase force availability. However, these changes addressed immediate needs and did not take place within a strategic framework that linked human capital goals with DOD's organizational goals to fight the Global War on Terrorism. DOD was also considering a change in its implementation of the partial mobilization authority that would have expanded its pool of available personnel. This policy revision would have authorized mobilizations of up to 24 consecutive months without limiting the number of times personnel could be mobilized, and thus provide an essentially unlimited flow of forces. In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD stated that it would retain its current cumulative approach, but DOD did not elaborate in its comments on how it expected to address its increased personnel requirements. The Army was not able to efficiently execute its mobilization and demobilization plans, because the plans contained outdated assumptions concerning the availability of facilities and support personnel. For example, plans assumed that active forces would be deployed abroad, thus vacating facilities when reserves were mobilizing and demobilizing but reserve forces were used earlier and active forces had often not vacated the facilities. As a result, some units were diverted away from their planned mobilization sites, and disparities in housing accommodations existed between active and reserve forces. Efficiency was also lost when short notice hampered coordination efforts among planners, support personnel, and mobilizing or demobilizing reserve forces. To address shortages in housing and other facilities, the Army has embarked on several construction and renovation projects without updating its planning assumptions regarding the availability of facilities. As a result, the Army risks spending money inefficiently on projects that may not be located where the need is greatest. Further, the Army has not taken a coordinated approach evaluating all the support costs associated with mobilization and demobilization at alternative sites in order to determine the most efficient options for the Global War on Terrorism. DOD's ability to effectively manage the health status of its reserve forces is limited because its centralized database has missing and incomplete health records and it has not maintained full visibility over reserve component members with medical problems. For example, the Marine Corps did not send pre-deployment health assessments to DOD's database as required, due to unclear guidance and a lack of compliance monitoring. The Air Force has visibility of involuntarily mobilized members with health problems, but lacks visibility of members with health problems who are on voluntary orders. As a result, some personnel had medical problems that had not been resolved for up to 18 months, but the full extent of this situation is unknown."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) currently cannot meet its global  commitments without sizeable participation from among its 1.2 million  National Guard and Reserve members.

Furthermore, thousands of reserve component  members have volunteered for extended periods of active duty service,  according to DOD officials. During this period, the Army has had more  reserve component members mobilized than all the other services  combined.

Since the pace of reserve operations  is expected to remain high due to the Global War on Terrorism stretching  indefinitely into the future, it is critical that the services mobilize and  demobilize their reserve forces as efficiently as possible. Furthermore,  DOD has recognized that the treatment of these servicemembers is one of  the keys to the retention of a quality force. In addition, the health and  treatment of Guard and Reserve members when mobilized have been the  subject of recent media reports and congressional hearings.

Although we visited sites for all the services, we  focused our review primarily on the Army\u2019s mobilization and  demobilization processes, since more personnel from the Army have been  and are expected to be mobilized than from all the other services  combined. We analyzed personnel and facility data obtained during the  site visits and held meetings with military and civilian officials from OSD,  the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the service headquarters, reserve component  headquarters, and support agencies. In addition, we examined the  collection and processing of pre- and post-deployment health assessment  information, and spoke to officials responsible for collecting and  reviewing health assessment information at the mobilization and  demobilization sites we visited. We also interviewed the officer in charge  of the organization responsible for maintaining DOD\u2019s centralized health  assessment database, and obtained and analyzed information from the  database containing the health assessments of over 290,000 reserve  component members who were mobilized or demobilized from November  2001 through March 2004. We also interviewed reserve component  members with medical problems at the mobilization and demobilization  sites we visited, and interviewed hospital commanders and their staffs,  case managers and medical liaison officers, and officials from the service  Surgeons General offices.

For example, many air reserve  component units are required to be available to mobilize within 72 hours  while Army National Guard brigades may require months of training as  part of their mobilizations. Reserve component members\u2019 usage of accrued  leave can greatly affect demobilization times.

Because many Army units  undergo several months of training after being mobilized but before being  deployed overseas for 12 months, stop-loss periods can reach 2 years or  more.", "According to Army officials, a substantial number of reserve component  members have been affected by the changing stop-loss policies. As of June  30, 2004, the Army had over 130,000 reserve component members  mobilized and thousands more alerted or demobilized less than 90 days.  Because they have remaining service obligations, many of these reserve  component members would not have been eligible to leave the Army even  if stop-loss policies had not been in effect. However, from fiscal year 1993  through fiscal year 2001, Army National Guard annual attrition rates  exceeded 16 percent and Army Reserve rates exceeded 25 percent. Even a  16 percent attrition rate means that 20,800 of the mobilized 130,000 reserve  component soldiers would have left their reserve component each year. If  attrition rates exceed 16 percent or the thousands of personnel who are  alerted or who have been demobilized for less than 90 days are included,  the numbers of personnel affected by stop-loss policies would increase  even more. When the Army\u2019s stop-loss policies are eventually lifted,  thousands of servicemembers could retire or leave the service all at once  and the Army\u2019s reserve components could be confronted with a huge  increase in recruiting requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mobilization and Rotation Policies", "paragraphs": ["Following DOD\u2019s issuance of guidance concerning the length of  mobilizations in September 2001, the services initially limited most  mobilizations to 12 months, and most services maintained their existing  operational rotation policies to provide deployments of a predictable  length that are preceded and followed by standard maintenance and  training periods. However, the Air Force and the Army later increased the  length of their rotations, and the Army increased the length of its  mobilizations as well. These increases in the length of mobilizations and  rotations increased the availability of reserve component forces but  decreased predictability for individual reserve component members who  were mobilized and deployed under one set of policies but later extended  as a result of the policy changes.", "The Air Force\u2019s operational concept prior to September 2001, was based  on a rotation policy that made reserve component forces available for 3  out of every 15 months. After September 2001, the Air Force was not able  to solely rely on its normal rotations and had to involuntarily mobilize  large numbers of reserve component personnel. From September 11, 2001,  to March 31, 2004, the Air National Guard mobilized more than 31,000  personnel, and the Air Force Reserve mobilized more than 24,000  personnel. Although most Air Force mobilizations were for 12 months or  less, more than 10,000 air reserve component members had their  mobilization orders extended to 24 months. Most of these personnel were  in security-related occupations. Since September 2001, the Air Force has  not been able to return to its normal operating cycle, and in June 2004, the  Air Force Chief of Staff announced that Air Force rotations would be  increased to 4 months beginning in September 2004.", "Before September 2001, the Army mobilized its reserve component forces  for up to 270 days under the Presidential Reserve Call-up authority, and it  deployed these troops overseas for rotations that lasted about 6 months.  When it began mobilizing forces under the partial mobilization authority in  September 2001, the Army generally mobilized troops for 12 months.  However, troops that were headed for duty in the Balkans continued to be  mobilized under the Presidential Reserve Call-up authority. When  worldwide requirements for both active and reserve component Army  troops increased, the Army changed its Balkan rotation schedules. These  schedules had been published years in advance to allow poorly resourced  Guard and Reserve units time to train and prepare for the deployments. As  a result of the changed schedules, some reserve component units did not  have adequate time to prepare and train for Balkan rotations and then  deploy for 6 months and still remain with the 270-day limit of the  Presidential Reserve Call-up authority. Therefore, the Army mobilized  some reserve component units under the partial mobilization authority so  that they could undergo longer training periods prior to deploying for 6  months under the Presidential Reserve Call-up authority. The Army\u2019s  initial deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan were scheduled for 6 months,  just like the overseas rotations for the Balkans. Eventually, the Army  increased the length of its rotations to Iraq and Afghanistan to 12 months.  This increased the availability of reserve component forces, but it  decreased predictability for members who were mobilized and deployed  during the transition period when the policy changed. Because overseas  rotations were extended to 12 months and mobilization periods must  include mobilization and demobilization processing time, training time,  and time for the reserve component members to take any leave that they  earn, the change in rotation policy required a corresponding increase in  the length of mobilizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cross-Training Policies", "paragraphs": ["DOD has a number of training initiatives underway that will increase the  availability of its reserve component forces to meet immediate needs.

However, on the  basis of current and projected usage, it appears that DOD may face  difficulties achieving its goal within the Army\u2019s reserve components in the  near term. Since February 2003, the Army has continuously had between  20 and 29 percent of its Selected Reserve members mobilized. To  illustrate, even if the Army were to maintain the lower 20 percent  mobilization rate for Selected Reserve members, it would need to mobilize  one-fifth of its selected reserve members each year. DOD is aware that  certain portions of the force are used much more highly than others, and it  plans to address some of the imbalances by converting thousands of  positions from lower- demand specialties into higher-demand specialties.

In the  initial months following September 11, 2001, the Air Force used the partial  mobilization authority more than the other services, and it reached its  peak with almost 38,000 reserve component members mobilized in April  2002. However, by July 2002, Army mobilizations surpassed those of the  Air Force, and since December 2002, the Army has had more reserve  component members mobilized than all the other services combined.  Although many of the members who have been called to active duty under  the partial mobilization authority have been demobilized, as of March 31,  2004, approximately 175,000 of DOD\u2019s reserve component members were  still mobilized and serving on active duty.

For example, the Navy and  Marine Corps have mobilized 60 and 100 percent of their enlisted law  enforcement specialists and 48 and 100 percent of their intelligence  officers, respectively. The Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve  mobilized 64 and 93 percent of their enlisted law enforcement specialists  and 71 and 86 percent of their installation security personnel, respectively.", "As noted earlier, during our review, DOD was considering changing its  implementation of the partial mobilization authority from its current  approach, which limits mobilizations to 24 cumulative months, to an  approach that would have limited mobilizations to 24 consecutive  months to expand its pool of available personnel. However, in  commenting on a draft of this report, DOD stated that it would retain  its current cumulative implementation approach. Policies that limit  involuntary mobilizations on the basis of cumulative service make it  difficult for mobilization planners, who must keep track of prior  mobilizations in order to determine which forces are available to meet  future requirements. This can be particularly difficult now, when many  mobilizations involve individuals or small detachments rather than  complete units.", "In June 2004, DOD noted that about 30,000 reserve members had  already been mobilized for 24 months. Under DOD\u2019s cumulative  approach, these personnel will not be available to meet future  requirements.

The Army attempts to  take the necessary planning steps to support efficient servicemember  mobilization and demobilization. For example, installations that are  responsible for mobilizing and demobilizing reserve component forces  attempt to contact units or personnel prior to their arrival, so that both the  reserve component forces and the supporting installations can be  prepared to meet the Army\u2019s mobilization and demobilization  requirements. During these contacts, reserve component forces are told  what records, and equipment to bring to the mobilization and  demobilization sites and installation officials obtain information\u2014such as  the number of arriving troops and the anticipated time of their arrival\u2014 that is necessary for them to efficiently prepare for the arrival of the  reserve component forces. With this information, the installations can plan  where they will house, feed, and train the troops; how they will transport  the troops around the installation and to their final destinations; and when  they will send the troops for medical and dental screenings and  administrative processing.", "Army guidance, which states that units are to demobilize at the same  installation where they mobilized, can add to the efficiency of the  demobilization process. Efficiencies can be realized because many of  records created during the mobilization process or copies of the records  are kept at the installation and can be used to do advanced preparation  before the demobilizing unit arrives at the installation. Army officials told  us that since September 11, 2001, most units have demobilized at the same  installation where they mobilized, but there have been some exceptions.  For example, officials from the First U.S. Army told us that they had  mobilized a unit for Operation Iraqi Freedom at Fort Rucker, Alabama, and  were demobilizing the unit at Fort Benning, Georgia. They also told us that  troops who had mobilized at Fort Stewart, Georgia, were going to be  demobilizing at Fort Dix, New Jersey, after a deployment to Kosovo. To  accommodate shifts in demobilization sites, the new sites must, among  other things, obtain reserve component unit medical, dental, and  personnel records and must coordinate the return of individual equipment,  such as helmets, sleeping bags, packs, and canteens that were issued at  the original mobilization site. With adequate notice and planning,  alternate demobilization sites can demobilize reserve component units  without any major problems. However, officials at Fort Lewis,  Washington, told us that their support personnel had to reconstruct dental  records for 150 soldiers in an engineer unit that had originally mobilized at  Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. Because the Army\u2019s goal is to complete  demobilization processing within 5 days of a unit\u2019s arrival at a  demobilization site, the Fort Lewis personnel were not able to wait for the  arrival of the dental records, which had been sent from Fort Leonard  Wood via routine mail rather than overnight delivery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Planning Assumptions Were Not Accurate", "paragraphs": ["The Army\u2019s planning assumptions did not accurately portray the  availability of installations and personnel needed to fully accommodate  the high number of mobilizations and demobilizations.

Consequently,  installations sometimes lacked the support infrastructure needed to  accommodate both active and reserve component mobilizing and  demobilizing members in an equitable manner. The Army\u2019s mobilization  and demobilization plans assumed that active forces would be deployed  abroad, thus vacating installations when reserve component forces were  mobilizing and often demobilizing. These assumptions are important  because they served as a basis to help the Army determine which  installations would have the necessary support facilities to serve as its  primary and secondary mobilization sites. Most of the Army\u2019s primary  mobilization sites are installations that serve as home bases for large  active Army units. For example, three of the Army\u2019s primary sites that we  visited\u2014Fort Lewis, Washington; Fort Stewart, Georgia; and Fort Hood,  Texas\u2014are home to two active combat brigades, an active combat  division, and two active combat divisions, respectively, along with hosts of  other active forces. Fort Hood alone has about 42,000 active troops  assigned to the installation.", "Under the Army\u2019s plans, reserve component units were assigned  mobilization and demobilization sites so that units could plan in advance  for their mobilizations. Units often developed relationships with the  installations where they expected to mobilize and in many cases the units  trained at these installations. However, because active units had not  vacated many of the Army\u2019s major mobilization sites as planned,  mobilizing reserve component forces were moved to sites where they had  not trained and where they had not developed any relationships that could  have increased the mobilizations\u2019 efficiency. As a result, transportation  distances for personnel and equipment were increased, and extra  coordination was required with the mobilization sites and sometimes even  within units. For example, the 116th Cavalry Brigade from the Idaho Army  National Guard, which had planned to mobilize at Fort Lewis, Washington,  was mobilized at Fort Bliss, Texas, because, among other things, adequate  housing facilities were not available at Fort Lewis. Another Army National  Guard Brigade, which was mobilized at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, faced  increased coordination challenges because one of its battalions was  mobilized at Fort Drum, New York, and another at Fort Stewart, Georgia,  because of a lack of available facilities at Fort Bragg.", "At mobilization and demobilization sites where active forces remained on  the installations while reserve component forces were mobilizing or  demobilizing, competing demands sometimes led to housing inequities for  the reserve members. For example, at the installations we visited, single  active component personnel who were permanently assigned to the  installation were generally housed in barracks where two to four people  shared a room, but mobilized reserve component personnel were often  housed in open-bay barracks. At some installations, reserve component  personnel were housed in tents, gymnasiums, or older buildings that were  designed for short training periods rather than mobilization periods that  could last several months. The presence of large active duty and reserve  contingents on the same installations at the same time also strained  training and medical facilities. Fort Hood officials said that the  scheduling and rescheduling of training ranges presented major challenges  during 2003 when the installation was preparing to deploy both its active  divisions and a large group of reserve component forces at the same time.  To address these facility challenges, the Army has begun a number of  housing and facility construction and renovation projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assumptions Did Not Account for Long-term Needs for Reserve Component Support Personnel under a Partial Mobilization Authority", "paragraphs": ["The Army did not anticipate that its reserve component units that support  mobilizations and demobilizations would be needed beyond 24 months  under a partial mobilization authority.

The Army\u2019s plans called for  these support personnel to be among the first reserve component  members mobilized and the last demobilized. Army officials assumed that,  under a partial mobilization authority, these reserve component support  forces would be able to support large mobilizations and demobilizations,  or support mobilizations for long periods, but not large mobilizations for  long periods.", "As a result of the large requirements for the Army\u2019s reserve component  forces, many pieces of the reserve component support units were  mobilized for 12 months early in the Global War on Terrorism and then  later extended. Some support personnel were mobilized for 24 months  under the partial mobilization authority\u2014which, under DOD\u2019s current  implementation, limits involuntary mobilizations to 24 cumulative  months\u2014and then sent home.

However, as of May 2004 some units that are being mobilized  under the partial mobilization authority are still being mobilized with less  than 30 days advance notice. According to Army Reserve officials, each  member of these units signs a volunteer waiver stating that he or she  agrees to be mobilized with less than 30 days advance notice.

Typically, when an installation mobilizes a reserve  component unit, the installation planner records the length of unit  mobilization orders. Depending on the length of unit mobilization orders  and the resulting time available for leave at the end of the orders,  installation planners begin to anticipate the return of the unit up to several  months before the unit\u2019s orders expire. The planners said that they use a  variety of formal and informal means to try to ascertain the specific arrival  dates and times for demobilizing troops but that the arrival dates and  times are often uncertain right up until the time the troops arrive. This is  because their different sources of information sometimes provide  conflicting information.", "The planners generally begin their search for information about units  returning to their installation using the automated systems within DOD\u2019s  Joint Operations Planning and Execution System. A primary source of  information is the time-phased force and deployment data (TPFDD).  Installation planning officials told us that the TPFDD is most valuable in  providing them with information on large units with orders that have not  changed and that return as complete units. However, the planners stated  that it is not uncommon for the TPFDD to be incorrect or outdated  because changes are constantly being made to redeployment schedules,  particularly for small units or individuals.", "One source of such last-minute changes stems from changes in travel  arrangements. According to DOD officials, when there are empty seats  available on planes departing the theater of operations, small units are  often placed on the planes at the last minute to fill the empty seats.  However, these changes are not always captured in the TPFDD or DOD\u2019s  other automated systems. For example, while we were visiting Fort Lewis,  planning officials were trying to determine which unit or units might be  returning to Fort Lewis to go through demobilization processing along  with the 502nd Transportation Company and 114th Chaplain detachment that  were scheduled to arrive on March 1, 2004. Neither the TPFDD nor the  other automated tracking systems that were available to planning officials  at Fort Lewis provided definitive answers. As a result of contacts through  informal channels, at 11:20 a.m. on March 1, 2004, Fort Lewis officials  thought that 21 people from the 854th Quartermaster Unit were going to  arrive at McChord Air Force Base\u2014located adjacent to Fort Lewis, just  south of Tacoma, Washington\u201440 minutes later. Due to the lack of  reliable information, Fort Lewis officials could not finalize planning  arrangements. For example, because they did not know whether to expect  male or female soldiers, they could not finalize housing plans for the  soldiers. Nor did they know whether the unit was bringing weapons with  them or what types of weapons they might have, and thus transportation  personnel and personnel in the arms room at Fort Lewis were placed on  standby. A check with McChord officials at 11:50 a.m. revealed that there  were no inbound flights. At 3:53 p.m. Fort Lewis officials had confirmation  that the soldiers would be arriving at 9:35 p.m. and that there were 19  additional personnel from an unknown unit or units on the plane with the  21 soldiers from the 854th Quartermaster unit. By 4:12 p.m. on March 1,  2004, the Fort Lewis officials had canceled the scheduled demobilization  processing times for the 854th because information showed that the unit  would not arrive until 7:42 a.m. on the following day, March 2, 2004.  Planning officials had to make several other adjustments to planned  schedules before the Quartermaster unit finally arrived. Moreover, the  502nd Transportation Company and 114th Chaplain detachment, which had  been visible through DOD\u2019s formal systems, also arrived later than the  expected March 1 date.", "Sometimes, planning officials receive information from informal sources,  such as family members of deployed personnel. During our visit to Fort  Lewis, officials had begun tracking an inbound Army National Guard  military police unit on the basis of information received from an informal  information source. This unit became visible to the planning officials when  the wife of one of the soldiers, who also served as the unit\u2019s family  readiness coordinator, notified the officials that her husband and 11 other  unit personnel had left Iraq, were in Germany, and were scheduled to fly to  Washington state on a commercial airliner the next day. The coordinator  also provided the Fort Lewis officials with the names and social security  numbers for all 12 returning soldiers.

They  also noted that the rural nature of the area and lack of cultural amenities  makes it difficult to attract physicians and other highly paid specialists  who support the mobilization and demobilization process. Officials at Fort  Lewis had already replaced many of their medical support personnel at the  time of our visit but acknowledged that even with the large population of  the Seattle-Tacoma area to draw upon, they were still facing challenges in  the hiring of physician assistants and nurse practitioners. The commander  of the hospital at Fort Hood said that the hospital had issued a contract to  try to fill its nurse shortage, but the only result from the contract was that  civilian nurses at the hospital left the hospital to work for a contractor that  paid them more. Thus, the net result was that the hospital did not fill its  shortages, and it kept the same nurses but paid the contractor more for  their services.", "Even when civilian or contractor personnel are available to replace  reserve component personnel, the replacements may not be able to  provide the same capability or flexibility as reserve component support  personnel. During our visit to Fort Hood, officials told us that over the past  10 years, the Army had repeatedly looked at the option of using civilian or  contractor medical evacuation teams to replace reserve component  support personnel. However, the option has not been adopted because the  civilians would not be able to fly into live-fire training areas or under  blackout conditions without costly Army flight training. Fort Lewis  officials raised similar concerns about the limited abilities of civilian  helicopter rescue teams during our prior review. In addition, officials at  mobilization and demobilization sites said that reserve component support  personnel provided them with great flexibility in dealing with the  unexpected arrival of mobilizing or demobilizing soldiers. Reserve  component personnel are technically available 24 hours per day, 7 days  per week. Therefore, processing could be scheduled for any hour and any  day without regard to overtime considerations. During our visits, we  observed several cases where civilian personnel left their processing sites  at the end of their scheduled workday but reserve component personnel  stayed until all processing was completed.", "In addition to the civilian replacements for reserve component medical  support personnel, the Army is looking for replacements for the reserve  component personnel who performed administrative processing, logistic,  training, and other support functions within its garrison support units. The  Army\u2019s Installation Management Agency (IMA) is working with the Army  Contracting Agency to develop short- and long-term replacement  solutions. The long-term solution is an \u201cIndefinite Delivery/Indefinite  Quantity\u201d contract that will allow installation commanders to place task  orders to hire or contract workers for particular support functions.  According to contracting officials, this contract will be awarded on or  about October 1, 2004. IMA is programmed to receive $238 million for this  contract in fiscal year 2005. By July 2004, IMA had received $56 million  and had allocated $48.4 million to 12 different mobilization sites to cover  the transition period until the long-term contract is in place.

The differences between the mobilization  numbers and the pre-deployment health assessment numbers provide  indications that assessment forms may be missing for members of all six  of DOD\u2019s reserve components. However, because the mobilization and  health assessment data cover slightly different time periods and come  from different sources, we could not determine the exact extent of the  mismatch. When we investigated the cause of the large differences  between Marine Corps numbers, officials told us that the Marine Corps\u2019  guidance did not require them to submit pre-deployment health  assessments to AMSA.", "The officials cited guidance, in the form of two Marine Corps  administrative messages that directed responsible officials to submit post- deployment health assessments to AMSA. However, the administrative  messages neglect to direct the officials to submit pre-deployment health  assessments. Furthermore, no additional administrative messages have  addressed the requirement for pre-deployment assessments. As a result,  the AMSA database contained only 2,104 pre-deployment health  assessments but 11,499 post-deployment health assessments for Marine  Corps reservists.", "Another possible reason why the Marine Corps has not submitted pre- deployment health assessments to AMSA is because the Marine Corps  lacks a mechanism for overseeing the submission of these forms. There is  no current Marine Corps requirement for tracking and reporting the  submission of theses forms in the Deployment Health Quality Assurance  program. In a March 12, 2004, memorandum to the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Force Health Protection and Readiness, the  Marine Corps reported the number and percentage of post-deployment  health assessments that were completed but did not report any  information on pre-deployment assessments.", "Officials at Camp Lejeune told us that they would begin submitting pre- deployment health assessments to AMSA after we raised the issue during a  site visit in 2004 and the issuance of subsequent Navy Department  guidance.

In  such cases, the reserve center is required to send the reservists\u2019 completed  pre-deployment health assessment forms to AMSA. Therefore, Navy data  collection is only done centrally at the Navy Mobilization Processing  Stations in limited cases when a reservist arrives without a completed pre- deployment health assessment. We did not visit any individual Navy  Reserve centers to verify the submission of pre-deployment health  assessments. We did review Navy Quality Assurance program guidance  and found that it does not address the submission of pre-deployment  health assessments.

Nondeployable rates  ranged from less than 1 percent in the Air National Guard to more than 9  percent in the Army Reserve. Other data showed that most of the  nondeployable personnel had medical conditions that clearly made them  nondeployable, and which did not require medical referrals. According to  medical officials, some of these personnel, such as those who had suffered  multiple heart attacks, should have been discharged prior to the time that  they received their mobilization orders. Others had temporary conditions,  such as broken bones and pregnancies that did not warrant medical  discharges but made them nondeployable at the time of their assessment.", "Detailed referral information could assist the services in determining and  addressing the factors that cause reserve component members to be  nondeployable; however, these data were often missing in AMSA\u2019s  database. About 99 percent of the pre- and post-deployment assessments  we reviewed showed whether or not reserve component members had  been given a medical referral, but less than 44 percent of the records with  referrals contained detailed information about the type of referral that was  given to the member (eye, ear, cardiac, mental health, etc.).", "One reason for the incomplete health assessment records we found at  AMSA at the time of our data draw in March 2004 is that some of the  health assessments were entered into AMSA\u2019s database by hand.  According to the officer in charge of AMSA, records in the database with  detailed referral data had been submitted electronically rather than as  paper copies, which the installations are required to forward to the  centralized database. Generally, electronic data are sent to AMSA after  being collected in one of two different ways: (1) from applications that are  available at Army installations and over the Internet and (2) on stand-alone  laptop computers and hand-held personal digital assistant units, which  collect data in the theater and elsewhere. All electronic data are  transmitted to AMSA and updated immediately upon receipt. Because of  workload demands, when paper forms were received at AMSA, database  personnel captured only a data element indicating if a referral was needed,  not the specific type of referral indicated. In addition, when there was a  backlog of four page paper post-deployment health assessments to be  entered into the database, data entry personnel were entering only the first  and last pages of the form and not the middle two pages. Because of this,  at various times the data that have been collected from servicemembers  may not be available for analysis. However, as of June 2004, the officer in  charge of AMSA said that AMSA had no backlog of paper forms to be  entered into the centralized database and had 15 people working full-time  to process pre- and post-deployment health assessment forms.  Furthermore, he estimated that by the end of July 2004, they would be  caught up with the entries of the middle pages of the post-deployment  health assessments that had been skipped earlier. Still, there is a delay  between receipt of the form and its entry into the database. The AMSA  Chief said the paper forms take approximately 1 week for processing,  scanning, and entering data.", "All of the reserve components have the capability to submit the health  assessments electronically, including detailed medical referral  information. Many Army and Air Force servicemember health assessments  are now transmitted electronically, and detailed information is captured  into the database from those forms. The Army has been sending electronic  health assessment data for active and reserve servicemembers to AMSA  since July 2003. Although the Army is capable of transmitting all of its  forms electronically, only about 52 percent of its forms submitted from  January 1, 2003, to May 3, 2004, had been submitted electronically.

Even though electronic submission of the health assessment forms from  the mobilization and demobilization sites to AMSA\u2019s centralized database  would expedite the inclusion of key data for meaningful analysis, increase  accuracy of the reported information, and lessen the burden of sites  forwarding paper copies and the likelihood of lost information, DOD has  not set a timeline for the services to electronically submit the health  assessment forms to the centralized database."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Data Show Reserve Component Members Self- Reported Health Is Good", "paragraphs": ["Table 4 shows that 98 percent of the reserve component members  reported that they were in good to excellent health when they completed  their pre-deployment health assessments.

For example, our analysis of data from  the more than 239,500 pre-deployment health assessments collected in the  AMSA database from November 2001 through March 2004 showed that  over 15,100 members, or almost 7 percent, were not deployable; almost  14,800 of these members came from the Army\u2019s reserve components.  Prior to a change in Army policy in October 2003, personnel who were  mobilized and found to be non-deployable were kept on active duty until  (1) their medical problems had been resolved and they were returned to  full duty or (2) they had been referred to a medical board process and  discharged from the Army. (See appendix VIII for additional information  on the services\u2019 medical evaluation boards.)", "As a result of its October 2003 policy change, the Army was able to  demobilize personnel who were found to be nondeployable within the first  25 days of their mobilizations. This policy change helped to reduce the  inflow of reserve component personnel on active duty with medical  problems who were identified during the pre-deployment health-screening  process. However, the reserve component members who were already on  active duty with medical problems that had been identified during the pre- deployment health-screening process were not demobilized when the  policy changed. In addition, significant numbers of reserve component  personnel continued to experience medical problems as a result of injuries  or illnesses that occurred (1) after the members had been mobilized for 25  days and (2) as a result of problems that were identified during their post- deployment heath assessments. As a result, on July 14, 2004, the Army still  had over 4,000 reserve component personnel on active duty with medical  problems. Although Army officials said that the primary responsibility  that these soldiers had was to go to their medical treatment so they could  get well, many of the soldiers did not require daily medical treatment. As a  result, these soldiers often do other work ranging from temporary details  to maintain base facilities to longer-term jobs such as working at  mobilization processing sites or working as mechanics in installation  motor pools.", "Initially, issues associated with the care of Army personnel with medical  problems were usually dealt with at the Army installation where the  servicemember was mobilized or demobilized and at nearby medical  treatment facilities. As the numbers of reserve component personnel with  medical problems increased, the Army found that it had difficulty  maintaining visibility of such personnel, resulting in some housing, pay,  and other problems for the personnel.", "For example, at Fort Stewart, Georgia, reserve component soldiers with  medical problems were being housed in open-bay, cinder block barracks  that did not have heating or air conditioning. In addition, shower and  bathroom facilities were in separate, nearby buildings. These facilities  normally housed National Guard personnel during their 2-week annual  training periods. Following media attention to these conditions, the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued a memorandum  that established housing standards for personnel with medical problems in  October 2003. During our visit to Fort Stewart, in November 2003 we  found that the soldiers with medical problems were being housed in  accordance with the updated standards, which required climate-controlled  quarters that included integrated bathroom facilities. The Army also  created a servicewide medical-status tracking system during the summer  of 2003. This system generates regular weekly reports on the numbers of  reserve component members on active duty with medical problems, their  locations, and the length of time that they have been receiving medical  care.", "Following up on allegations in 2003 that medical treatment was taking too  long, and that soldiers were missing their scheduled medical  appointments, investigators at Fort Stewart also found that case  managers were needed to track the care of the soldiers with medical  problems and that a command structure was needed to manage the other  needs and duties of these personnel. At the time of our visit, Fort Stewart  had 15 case managers in place, and a new command and control structure  had been set up to manage the soldiers with medical problems. However,  officials told us that they still faced challenges with the management and  care of these soldiers because the group was so large. On November 19,  2003, there were 661 reserve component members with medical problems  at Fort Stewart; as of July 14, 2004, there were 349 members.", "The lack of visibility and tracking also caused problems for members with  medical problems at Fort Lewis, Washington. Army procedures called for  reserve component members on involuntary mobilization orders to be  switched over to voluntary active duty medical extension orders after a  long-term medical problem had been identified. The administrative  process for issuing these active duty medical extensions was cumbersome,  and mechanisms were not in place to effectively track requests for these  extensions, which had to be submitted from the units with  servicemembers experiencing medical problems to a central office in the  Pentagon. When we visited Fort Lewis in March 2004, we found that  medical extension orders had expired for 19 of 84 personnel in the medical  hold unit. When a servicemember\u2019s orders expire, the member\u2019s pay stops  and the member\u2019s dependents lose their health care coverage.  After our  visit to Fort Lewis, the Army changed its policy concerning active duty  medical extensions. On March 6, 2004, the Assistant Secretary of the Army  for Manpower and Reserve Affairs issued a policy that provides  installations with the ability to issue voluntary orders for up to 180 days  for reserve component members with medical problems without going  through the cumbersome active duty medical extension process. While the  authority to issue these voluntary orders has been delegated to the  installation level, the Army is still maintaining visibility over its reserve  component personnel with medical problems because these personnel are  assigned to units that must report their personnel numbers on a weekly  basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force", "paragraphs": ["In the Air Force, a lack of central visibility of some reserve component  personnel with medical problems who are serving on active duty has  resulted in delayed resolution to their medical problems.

Furthermore, indications exist that certain components and occupational  specialties are being stressed and the long-term impact of this stress on  recruiting and retention is unknown. Moreover, although DOD has a  number of rebalancing efforts under way, these efforts will take years to  implement. Because this war is expected to last a long time and requires  far greater reserve component personnel resources than any of the smaller  operations of the previous two decades, DOD can no longer afford policies  that are developed piecemeal to maximize short-term benefits and must  have an integrated set of policies that address both the long-term  requirements for reserve component forces and individual reserve  component members\u2019 needs for predictability.", "For example, service rotation polices are directly tied to other personnel  policies such as policies concerning the use of the IRR, and the extent of  cross training. Policies to fully utilize the IRR would increase the pool of  available servicemembers and would thus decrease the length of time each  member would need to be deployed based on a static requirement.  Policies that encourage the use of cross-training for lesser-utilized units  could also increase the pool of available servicemembers and decrease the  length of rotations. Until DOD addresses its personnel policies within the  context of an overall strategic framework, it will not have clear visibility  over the forces that are available to meet future requirements. In addition,  it will be unable to provide reserve component members with clear  expectations of their military obligations and the increased predictability,  which DOD has recognized as a key factor in retaining reserve component  members who are seeking to successfully balance their military  commitments with family and civilian employment obligations.", "The Army\u2019s mobilization and demobilization plans contained outdated  assumptions about the location of active duty forces during reserve  mobilizations and demobilizations. As a result, facilities were not always  available to equitably support active and reserve component forces that  were collocated on bases that serve as mobilization and demobilization  sites. Until the Army updates the assumptions in its mobilization and  demobilization plans and therefore recognizes that active and reserve  component forces are likely to need simultaneous support at Army  installations within the United States, it may not be able to adequately  address the support needs of both its active and reserve component  forces. The Army has a number of uncoordinated efforts under way to  correct the facility infrastructure shortage that has developed. However,  these projects are being conducted without considering the long-term  requirements and associated costs. In addition, when the Army created  medical, training, logistics, and administrative support units that relied  heavily on reserve component members, it did not anticipate that it would  have to support long-term mobilization requirements for a Global War on  Terrorism under a partial mobilization authority. As a result, the reserve  component force cannot continue to support mobilizations as DOD  currently implements the partial mobilization authority and the Army is  now planning to rely on civilians and contractors. However, the Army has  not determined the costs and availability of these civilian and contractor  personnel. Until the Army makes these determinations, it cannot plan to  conduct future mobilizations and demobilizations in the most efficient  manner.", "DOD\u2019s ability to effectively manage the health status of reserve component  members has been hampered by a lack of complete information and the  inability to track servicemembers with health issues. For example, the  AMSA database does not contain a large number of health assessment  records for the Marine Corps and lacks complete information from some  of the health assessment records that were submitted to the database in a  nonelectronic format. Consequently, the deployability status and related  health problems of some reserve component members were not  discoverable. Until the Marine Corps addresses its data submission  problems with updated guidance and a mechanism to oversee the  submission of health assessments to the centralized database and until  DOD establishes a timeline for the military departments to submit health  assessments electronically, DOD and the services will continue to face  difficulties in determining and addressing the factors that cause reserve  component members to be nondeployable. Moreover, until the Air Force  develops a mechanism to track its reserve component members who are  on voluntary active duty orders with health problems, it cannot determine  whether these personnel are having their health problems addressed in a  timely manner. Furthermore, the treatment of the nation\u2019s reserve  component members who have served their country and experienced  medical problems while on active duty is an important issue for DOD to  address.

In  partially concurring with our recommendation concerning the  development of a strategic framework, DOD stated that it has a strategic  framework for setting human capital goals, which was established through  its December 2002 comprehensive review of active and reserve force mix,  its January 2004 force rebalancing report, and other planning and  budgeting guidance. However, DOD agreed that it should review and, as  appropriate, update its strategic framework. Although the documents cited  by DOD lay some of the groundwork needed to develop a strategic  framework, these documents do not specifically address how DOD will  integrate and align its personnel policies, such as its stop-loss and IRR  policies, to maximize its efficient usage of reserve component personnel to  meet its overall organizational goals.", "In partially concurring with our recommendation to identify personnel  policies that should be linked within the context of a strategic framework,  DOD stated that its September 20, 2001, personnel and pay policy and its  July 19, 2002, addendum established personnel policies associated with its  strategic framework. DOD also stated that the department should review,  and as appropriate, update these policies. We agree that the Office of the  Secretary of Defense has issued personnel policies and various guidance  and reports concerning its reserve components. However, the policies  cited by DOD pre-date the 2002 comprehensive review and 2004 force  rebalancing report that were cited as part of the department\u2019s strategic  framework. The strategic framework should be established prior to the  creation of personnel policies. We continue to believe that DOD\u2019s policies  were implemented in a piecemeal manner and focused on short-term  needs. For example, our report details service changes to policies  concerning the use of the IRR, mobilization lengths, deployment lengths,  and service obligations.", "In partially concurring with our recommendation concerning oversight of  the Marine Corps\u2019 pre- and post-deployment health assessments, DOD  stated that system improvements are ongoing and that electronic  submission of pre- and post-deployment health assessments is possible  and highly desirable but may not be practical for every Marine Corps  deployment. However, our recommendation was directed at oversight of  health assessments regardless of how the assessments are submitted\u2014in  paper or electronic form. We continue to believe that the Marine Corps  needs to establish a mechanism for overseeing the submission of its pre-  and post-deployment health assessments. The other services have  established such mechanisms as part of their quality assurance programs.", "Finally, in commenting on a draft of this report, DOD stated that after  reviewing its implementation of the partial mobilization authority, it  decided to retain its \u201c24-cumulative month\u201d policy. DOD noted that it had  identified significant problems with changing to a 24-consecutive-month  approach but did not elaborate on those problems. The final decision  concerning the implementation of the partial mobilization authority was  not made until after our review ended, and the decision was counter to the  decision expected by senior personnel we met with during the course of  our review.  As noted in our report, with a 24-cumulative-month  interpretation of the partial mobilization authority, DOD risks running out  of forces available for deployment, at least in the short term. Regardless of  DOD\u2019s interpretation of the partial mobilization authority, the department  needs to have a strategic framework to maximize the availability of its  reserve component forces. For example, usage of the more than 250,000  IRR members can affect rotation policies because the use of these  reservists would increase the size of the pool from which to draw  mobilized reservists. Therefore, without a strategic framework setting  human capital goals, how DOD will continue to meet its large  requirements for the Global War on Terrorism remains to be seen. We  have modified our report to recognize the decision that DOD made  regarding its implementation of the partial mobilization authority.", "DOD\u2019s comments on our recommendations are included in this report in  appendix IX.

We also  collected and analyzed data on DOD\u2019s historical usage of the reserve  components and its usage of these forces since September 11, 2001. We  analyzed usage trends since the 1991 Persian Gulf War and compared  usage rates across services, reserve components, and occupational  specialties. We also reviewed DOD documents that addressed the  projected future use of reserve component forces and plans to mitigate the  high usage of forces within certain occupational specialties. We analyzed  the structure of the reserve component forces and evaluated the effects of  utilizing or excluding members of the Individual Ready Reserve from  involuntary call-ups. We discussed the implementation of mobilization  authorities and the effects of various personnel policies with responsible  officials from the    Joint Chiefs of Staff, Washington, D.C.;    Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs, Washington, D.C.;    Assistant Secretary of the Army for Manpower and Reserve Affairs,    U.S. Army Forces Command, Fort McPherson, Georgia;    Air Force Reserve Command, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia;    Commandant, Marine Corps (Manpower, Plans, and Policy), Quantico  Marine Corps Base, Virginia; and    U.S. Army Reserve Command, Fort McPherson, Georgia.", "During our visits to mobilization and demobilization sites, we also  interviewed reserve component members concerning the length of their  mobilizations, deployments, and service commitments.", "To determine how efficiently the Army executed its mobilization and  demobilization plans, we interviewed senior and key mobilization officials  involved with the mobilization and demobilization processes to document  their roles and responsibilities and collect data about the processes. We  visited selected sites where the Army conducts mobilization and  demobilization processing. At those sites, we observed mobilization and  demobilization processing and interviewed responsible Army officials as  well as soldiers being processed for mobilization and demobilization at  those sites. We collected and analyzed cost data for facility renovation and  construction projects. We also collected and analyzed available cost  information on the contracts to replace reserve component members with  civilian and contractor personnel. Finally, we documented problems that  the installations had tracking the arrival of mobilizing and demobilizing  troops though their automated systems. We visited five mobilization and  demobilization sites. These sites included four installations that supported  both active and reserve component troops and one site that supported  only reserve component troops. Four of the sites were among the largest  in terms of the numbers of reserve component members mobilized and  demobilized. One was among the smallest. Specifically we visited the  following sites:    Fort Stewart, Georgia;    Fort Hood, Texas;    Fort McCoy, Wisconsin;    Fort Lewis, Washington; and    Fort McPherson, Georgia.", "We also interviewed Army officials from the following locations:    U.S. Army Forces Command, Fort McPherson, Georgia;    First U.S. Army, Fort Gillem, Georgia;    Fifth U.S. Army, Fort Sam Houston, Texas;    Army Installation Management Activity, Arlington, Virginia; and    Army Contracting Agency, Fort McPherson, Georgia.", "As requested, we also visited sites where the other services conducted  mobilization and demobilization processing, but we did not report on the  efficiency of the other services\u2019 processes because the numbers of reserve  component members who were mobilizing and demobilizing through these  sites were insufficient for us to draw any conclusions about the services\u2019  processes.

We also walked through and compared facilities used to house  active and reserve component personnel, specifically focusing on the  facilities used to house personnel with medical problems. We interviewed  appropriate officials about facility capacities, and gathered and analyzed  information about facility renovations and new construction projects. We  obtained and reviewed additional documentation such as mobilization  orders, activation checklists, and demobilization processing checklists. We  also collected and analyzed reserve component mobilization data,  flowcharts, reports, plans, directives, manuals, instructions, and  administrative guidance. We reviewed relevant GAO reports and contacted  other audit and research organizations regarding their work in the area.  We reviewed congressional testimony by Navy officials in which they  described steps planned by the Navy to improve its demobilization  process, and we followed up on the status of those planned steps with  officials at the Navy Mobilization Processing Site Norfolk, Virginia.", "To examine the extent to which DOD can effectively manage the health  status of its mobilized reserve component members, we collected and  analyzed data from a variety of sources throughout DOD. We tracked  weekly data from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Reserve Affairs (OASD/RA), which showed the numbers of Army, Navy,  Air Force, and Marine Corps personnel on medical extensions, and the  numbers of Army personnel in medical statuses. We also collected,  tracked, and analyzed data from the Army\u2019s Office of the Surgeon General.  These data showed the numbers of reserve component personnel in  medical statuses by installation and by time spent in a medical status.

If retention is better than expected in a  particular year, then the reserve components may achieve their desired  end strengths without achieving their recruiting goals. While the services  can effectively meet their yearly programmed end strengths through a  wide range of recruiting and retention combinations, long-term  overreliance on either recruiting or retention can eventually cause  negative impacts for a service or service component.", "A service or component that repeatedly misses its recruiting goals will  need to retain a higher-than-planned percentage of its personnel each year.  This will eventually lead to a force that is out of balance. Either too many  people will be promoted and the component will end up with too many  senior personnel and not enough junior personnel or promotion rates will  decline. Decreased promotion rates tend to lead to increased attrition  rates, which would lead to end strength problems if a component were  already having problems meeting its recruiting goals.", "Appendix VI showed that the services have employed a variety of stop-loss  policies since September 11, 2001. Because these policies artificially  inflate retention rates, recruiting figures rather than retention or end  strength figures may be the best indicator of whether or not the  components will face difficulties meeting their future programmed end  strengths. Table 10 shows historical recruiting results. It shows that all the  reserve components met their recruiting goals in fiscal year 2002. But it  shows that the Army National Guard fell far short of its goal in fiscal year  2003 and was falling far short of its fiscal year 2004 monthly goals through  May of 2004. This dramatic drop in recruiting results occurred as the Army  was significantly increasing its involuntary mobilizations of Army National  Guard combat forces. The improving job market in the United States may  make it even more difficult for the Army National Guard to achieve its  recruiting objectives over the next few years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Service Medical and Physical Evaluation Board Processes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disabilities Evaluation System", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s Physical Disabilities Evaluation System consists of four main  elements:  1.  medical evaluation by Medical Evaluation Boards (MEBs),  2.  physical disability evaluation by Physical Evaluation Boards (PEBs) to  3.  servicemember counseling, and  4.  final disposition by appropriate personnel authorities.", "Figure 2 shows the steps of the disabilities evaluation system, which will  eventually lead to one of two outcomes. Servicemembers will either be  returned to duty or they will be discharged from their military service.  Members who are discharged sometimes, but not always, receive disability  compensation.", "Continuing to receive care throughout process Reserve component personnel who have been involuntarily mobilized,  along with members who are voluntarily serving on active duty, may end  up with medical problems for a variety or reasons. Some are injured  during combat operations; others become injured or sick during the  course of their training or routine duties; and others have problems that  are identified during medical appointments, physicals, or medical  screenings. Servicemembers on active duty or in the Ready Reserve are  eligible for referral into the Disability Evaluation System when they are  unable to reasonably perform the military duties of their office, grade,  rank, or rating as a result of a diagnosed medical condition.", "Servicemembers who have been diagnosed with medical conditions that  may render them unfit for military service enter into medical treatment  programs.", "The initial stage of the process, when medical professionals are  diagnosising servicemembers\u2019 problems, determining courses of  treatment, and evaluating the effectiveness of the ongoing treatments is  often the most time-consuming portion of the medical process. According  to service officials, this initial phase is intentionally long to give  servicemembers a good chance to get well and return to full duty. If,  however, the servicemembers have not returned to full duty within 1 year  of their diagnoses or if prior to a year they reach a point where they have  achieved the maximum recovery expected, and additional treatment is not  expected to materially affect their condition, their medical status and duty  limitations will be documented and referred to a MEB.", "The MEB documents full clinical information on all medical conditions  and states whether each condition is cause for referral into the Disability  Evaluation System. The duty-related impairment MEB package should  include a medical history; records from physical examinations; records of  medical tests and their results; and documentation of medical and surgical  consultations, diagnoses, treatments and prognoses. If the servicemember  meets retention standards, the disability processing ends with the MEB. If  the MEB concludes that the servicemembers do not meet retention  standards, the members\u2019 cases are referred to the PEB to determine fitness  for duty and possible entitlement to benefits.", "The first step in the PEB process is referral of the cases to informal PEBs  that review documents from the MEB and other administrative documents  without the presence of the servicemember. The informal PEB then issues  its initial findings and recommendations. If servicemembers are found to  be fit for duty, the disability processing ends with the informal PEB. If  servicemembers are found to be unfit for duty, they may request to  personally appear before the PEB during formal PEB hearings.  Servicemembers who do not agree with the decisions of the Formal PEB  have an additional opportunity to appeal the decisions.", "When a physician initiates an MEB, the processing time should normally  not exceed 30 days from the date the MEB report is initiated to the date it  is received by the PEB. For cases where reserve component members are  referred for solely a fitness determination on a non-duty-related condition,  processing time for conducting an MEB or physical examination should  not exceed 90 days. And when the PEB receives the MEB or physical  examination report, the processing time to the date of the final disposition  of the reviewing authority should normally be no more than 40 days.", "All servicemembers who enter the Disability Evaluation System receive  counseling. Counselors inform the servicemembers of the sequence and  nature of the steps in the process, statutory and regulatory rights, the  effects of findings and recommendations, and the servicemember\u2019s  recourse in the case of an unfavorable finding.", "It is not within the mission of the military departments to retain members  on active duty or in the Ready Reserve to provide prolonged, definitive  medical care when it is unlikely the member will return to full military  duty.
