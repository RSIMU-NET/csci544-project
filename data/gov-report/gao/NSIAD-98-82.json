Although the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) identifies 29 services as base support functions, DOD does not have a generally accepted definition of base support services, and the military services differ in how they define them. Without a common definition it is difficult to accurately determine the size and cost of DOD\u2019s base support workforce; however, DOD estimates that base support activities such as facilities and vehicle maintenance, food services, and local transportation cost more than $30 billion in fiscal year 1997.", "Numerous studies from the 1993 Bottom-Up Review through the recent Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Reform Initiative, and National Defense Panel have concluded that DOD could realize significant savings by outsourcing commercially available support services. Some studies have concluded that DOD could achieve the largest savings by using a single contract, rather than several smaller contracts, to encompass multiple base operations support services.", "Although a subject of increasing emphasis in recent years, federal agencies have been encouraged, since 1955, to obtain commercially available goods and services from the private sector through outsourcing, or contracting out, whenever they determine it is cost-effective. In 1966, OMB issued Circular A-76, which established federal policy for the government\u2019s performance of commercial activities and set forth the procedures for studying commercial activities for potential contracting. Later, in 1979, OMB issued a supplemental handbook to the circular that included the procedures for competitively determining whether commercial activities should be performed in-house, by another federal agency through an interservice support agreement, or by the private sector.

All of these contracting efforts, except one, were initiated in the 1980s. At the other three locations, officials told us that the decision to use a single contract for multiple services was made at the time that the installation or its current mission was established.", "Of the installations we visited, Laughlin Air Force Base was the one that most recently made a decision to use a single contract for multiple services in connection with a commercial activities study. A contracting official at Laughlin stated that the study had been done as a result of a DOD Management Review Directive. The study, conducted from April 9, 1992, to July 12, 1996, resulted in a contract awarded in 1996 pursuant to a small business set-aside. The contract initially is for about $5.4 million annually and will provide for functions dealing with supply, civil engineering, fuels management, and vehicle operation and maintenance.", "Naval Air Station Fallon went to a multiple service contract in 1987 following a commercial activities study that was conducted from May 1981 until January 1984. Officials at Fallon could not say for certain but believed the study was conducted because of the priority placed on contracting out at the time. The current contract is the third multiple service contract and is worth about $15 million annually. The contract covers such functions as food service, supply, pest control, custodial, housing, and airfield services, as well as operating a combined bachelor quarters facility.", "At the U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command in Michigan, we found that the Army had two contracts for multiple base operations support services that followed separate commercial activities studies conducted in 1981 and 1982. Each of the contracts covered services at separate locations that are approximately 20 miles apart. Each contract was competitively awarded until fiscal year 1989 when a decision was made that it would be in the best interest of the government to combine the requirements under a single multiple service contract and reduce overhead and contract administration costs. The current contract for approximately $15 million annually covers such functions as freight, supply, warehousing, facility engineering, housing, and administrative services at the two locations.", "At three installations\u2014Vance Air Force Base, Arnold Air Force Base, and Naval Submarine Base Bangor\u2014the decision to use multiple service contracts was made at the time the installation was established. The decision at Vance was based on an Air Force decision to evaluate the success of contracting out as compared to another base that performed the services with in-house personnel. At Arnold Air Force Base, the decision was based on a 1950 study by the Scientific Advisory Board of how the engineering development and test center should be operated. According to contracting officials, the study recommendation and a lack of qualified Air Force personnel at the time led the Secretary of the Air Force to direct that the services be provided through a contract. Naval Submarine Base Bangor was activated in 1976 and the decision to contract out base operations support services, according to a contracting official, was based on a study by a private Seattle company that determined a contract operation would be more cost-effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Multiple Service Contracts Are Fixed-Priced Type", "paragraphs": ["At 7 of 10 installations we reviewed, contracting officials have awarded fixed-price contracts for multiple base operations support services (see table 2).", "At the other three locations, contracting officials have awarded cost type contracts. In some instances, incentives or award fees were included within each of these types of contracts to contain or reduce costs. Regardless of the contract type, eight have been awarded on a 5-year basis.", "A firm-fixed price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor\u2019s cost experience in performing the contract. It remains firm for the life of the contract unless revised pursuant to the changes clause in the contract. It places maximum risk on the contractor and minimum risk on the government. The contractor is responsible for all costs incurred and the resulting profit or loss. The cost contract places more risk on the government and less risk on the contractor. Under cost contracts, the contractor is reimbursed for all reasonable and allowable costs incurred.", "In conjunction with these contracts, award fees are often used to provide incentives for outstanding performance in areas such as timeliness, quality, and cost effectiveness. The maximum amount of the award, periods of evaluation, and the officials who determine the fee are specified in an award-fee plan that is part of the contract. With the exception of three contracts, an award fee provision was included to foster maximum contractor performance based upon the government\u2019s subjective evaluation of the contractor\u2019s level of performance.", "At Fort Irwin, contracting officials decided that a cost-type contract was preferable to fixed price because the workload and workforce were continually changing and requirements could not be adequately defined beforehand. At Vance, the decision to use a fixed-price contract was due to the nature of the contract requirements, where the contractor provides mainly labor, and the number of employees, their respective labor rates, and expected hours were all known. This allowed contracting officials and offerors to estimate the cost of the contract with a higher degree of confidence.", "The multiple service contracts we reviewed were generally awarded for 5 years (1 base year and 4 option years). However, we did find two contracts with longer performance periods. At Arnold Air Force Base its cost-plus-award-fee contract was awarded in 1995 for 8 years (5 years and a single 3-year option) to foster workforce stability and morale. At the other, Naval Submarine Base Bangor, a 10-year fixed-price-award-fee contract (1 base year and 9 option years) was awarded in 1997. Based on suggestions from contractors during a presolicitation conference, the Bangor contract was increased from 5 to 10 years to save money over the life of the contract by allowing contractors to spread their costs over more years. Officials also expected that the change would encourage more companies to compete for the contract. The contract also includes incentives for the contractor to reduce costs. It further includes a provision for the contractor to meet ISO 9000 standards to better ensure it can meet customer requirements and help reduce contract monitoring costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Service Contracts Are One Tool for Accomplishing Base Operations Support", "paragraphs": ["At the 10 installations we reviewed, base operations support requirements were being met through a variety of means, including in-house personnel, as well as single contracts for multiple services, single contracts for specific services, and regional contracts. Several of the installations, including Arnold Air Force Base and Naval Submarine Base Bangor, rely heavily on single contracts for multiple base operations support services. In contrast, Fort Belvoir and Naval Air Station Whiting Field use single contracts for multiple services but also rely heavily on other contracts or in-house personnel to meet these support requirements.", "Arnold has used a single contract for virtually all base operations support services from the time the installation was established. The first multiple service contract was awarded in 1951 and provided for all testing and support services at the installation. In fiscal year 1981, the contract was separated into three contracts\u2014two testing contracts and one for multiple base operations support services. The support services contract includes a wide variety of functions such as central computer operations, base support and maintenance, environmental, utilities, logistics, transportation, base security, and fire protection. In addition, Arnold uses in-house personnel to perform morale, welfare, and recreation services.", "Similarly, Bangor accomplishes nearly all base operations support service requirements through a single contract. The current contract for multiple support services spans 10 years and provides a wide range of base support services, including administrative support, various public works services, utility and supply services, and security services. Bangor has used a multiple service contract for base operations support services since it was activated as a submarine base in 1976. Bangor has several individual contracts to meet additional support needs such as family services, food preparation and administration, architect and engineering services, and maintenance of automated data processing equipment. Also, Bangor provides services such as morale, welfare, and recreation; automated data processing; and crane inspection and certification through the use of in-house personnel.", "In contrast, Fort Belvoir and Naval Air Station Whiting Field are using single contracts for multiple services but also rely heavily on other contracts for specific support services, and in-house personnel to meet base operations support requirements. Fort Belvoir\u2019s current multiple support services contract is a firm-fixed price contract for 5 years. The contract includes such services as family housing, grounds, pest control, hospital operations and maintenance, and refuse collection. Fort Belvoir uses other contracts for specific support services such as major road repairs, asbestos removal, and custodial services. Military personnel provide such services as installation security and medical functions at the hospital. In-house civilians provide morale, welfare, and recreation; logistics management; and information management services.", "Similarly, Whiting Field meets its needs for base operations support through a single contract for multiple support services, several contracts for specific services, and the use of in-house personnel. The current multiple service contract was awarded for 5 years beginning in fiscal year 1997. Services in the contract include waste water treatment, pest control, grounds maintenance, hazardous materials management, communications systems, transportation, and utilities services. The first contract was awarded in fiscal year 1983 for a 3-year period following a commercial activities study. In addition to the multiple service contract, functions such as custodial, military family housing maintenance and repair, aircraft maintenance, and simulation are provided under single service contracts. Services such as morale, welfare, and recreation; fire protection; supply services; ground electronics; and child development are provided by in-house personnel."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Services Provided by Multiple Service Contracts Reflect Varied Installations Needs", "paragraphs": ["At the 10 installations we reviewed, the single contracts for multiple support services generally contained a broad range of activities such as refuse collection to computer support. Appendix II identifies selected base operations support activities included in contracts we reviewed. Although contracting officials often use the same or similar terms for services differently, we found that activities such as public works services, pest control, hazardous waste removal, family housing management, and administrative services were generally included in the multiple support service contracts\u2014although differences existed in the degree to which activities within these categories were included in individual contracts. Thus, individual contracts we examined varied in the extent to which the range of activities identified at one installation were comparable with another installation\u2019s contract.", "Functions and base support activities included in a given contract may vary due to requirements of the installation designing the contract to meet individual needs associated with its mission, the geographical location, and command preferences. For example, contracting officials said that base commanders need the flexibility to determine which functions to include in their multiple service contracts in order to most effectively serve each base\u2019s needs. At Arnold Air Force Base, where the mission is the testing of aerospace hardware, a provision was developed to preclude a manufacturer of aerospace hardware from competing for the contract, thus avoiding a conflict of interest. At Fort Irwin functions such as provost marshall and morale, welfare, and recreation were included because the base was being reactivated, while cooking was excluded so that soldiers could receive training. The geographic location of Laughlin Air Force Base affected services in its contract because, according to officials, the grass in that region grows extremely fast and must be cut frequently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned From Multiple Service Contracts", "paragraphs": ["Contracting officials at the 10 installations we reviewed have learned a number of lessons from their experience with single contracts for multiple base operations support services.

Contracting officials stated that the contract requirements should, in the case of simple tasks, be very specific so there is no question as to what is expected. For more complex situations and needs, results-oriented requirements that describe the government\u2019s desired outcomes without telling the contractor exactly how to accomplish the tasks are preferable. Contracting officials at Naval Submarine Base Bangor stated that the performance work statement in their multiple service contract was a good example of such results-oriented requirements. For example, they cited the area of vehicle maintenance, where the performance work statement states that the contractor is to maintain vehicles in accordance with the manufacturers\u2019 schedules, and that the amount of time that the vehicles are not available for use shall not exceed minimum standards. They also stated a well-defined performance work statement is the key to meeting these requirements and preventing excessive modifications to contracts and unanticipated cost increases.", "The Laughlin base operations support contract, solicited and awarded by officials at the Air Education Training Command, contains no award-fee provision because the contracting officials believed that the contract was so straightforward and well defined that an award fee was not necessary to get quality service for the base. While at Fort Belvoir, a contracting official stated that many of the modifications to their multiple service contract were due to incorrect inventories of equipment and confusion over what equipment the contractor could use. They also said that when discrepancies arise as to what is required, it is often because requirements are not covered adequately in the contract and the government must modify the contract to get the services needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Award Fees Viewed as Improving Contractor Responsiveness", "paragraphs": ["Contracting officials at 8 of the 10 installations we reviewed stated that award fees help focus the contractor on feedback from base personnel receiving the services and result in better responsiveness and higher quality work because these awards provide a monetary incentive for outstanding performance.", "At two of the installations where the contracts did not contain an award fee\u2014Laughlin Air Force Base and Fort Belvoir\u2014we were told that, at the time of the solicitation, the officials involved determined that the contract requirements were not complex enough to warrant the use of an award fee. In the case of Laughlin, the decision not to incorporate an award-fee provision was made by officials not directly located at the installation. According to a contracting official at Laughlin, officials at the Air Education Training Command, who solicited and awarded the Laughlin contract, believed that the contract was straightforward and well defined enough that an award fee was not necessary to get quality service for the base. At Fort Belvoir the contract was transferred to them from the Army Corps of Engineers after it had been solicited and awarded. When the Corps moved from Fort Belvoir, responsibility for contract administration was transferred to the Fort Belvoir Directorate of Contracting.

Through the use of a best- value selection process, a government agency can select an offer from the private sector that is most advantageous to the government, considering price or cost as well as past performance and other noncost factors. The agency does not have to select the lowest priced, acceptable offer. In a commercial activities (A-76) study, the \u201cbest value\u201d private sector offer is compared to the government\u2019s in-house proposal on the basis of cost only. Best-value criteria are considered most appropriate when work involves higher levels of complexity, significant technical expertise, and risk. In these situations, the government may be able to obtain a better value by comparing the various private sector technical proposals and making trade-offs between various technical and noncost factors such as past performance as well as costs.", "Officials explained that a contractor who wins based upon a low price that does not provide adequate profit is less likely to focus on quality or responsiveness and more likely to put forth only minimal effort to retain some profit or cut losses. Such situations can be more expensive for the government because of the cost of modifying contracts or finding a new contractor when one defaults."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Single Contracts Viewed as Enhancing Coordination but Can Become Cumbersome", "paragraphs": ["Our previous outsourcing work identified the benefits and drawbacks of using single contracts for multiple base operations support services.Benefits can include (1) a single manager accountable for performance; (2) greater opportunities for efficiencies, such as reduced overhead; and (3) reduced cost and effort to develop and award one contract versus multiple contracts. Conversely, while single contracts may produce large savings, they do not always succeed and can adversely affect a greater number of activities when problems arise.", "Contracting officials we spoke with during this review told us that coordination is much easier when there is a single contractor. One official stated that base operations support tasks are often interrelated and require good coordination for smooth operations. This official said that the interrelationships between tasks amplify the benefits of a reduced need for coordination.", "For example, an official at Laughlin Air Force Base stated that failed coordination between two contractors prevented a third contractor from being able to perform assigned duties, when a dispute occurred over who was responsible for mowing the airfield. This impacted the third contractor\u2019s ability to effectively spray for bugs to help reduce the number of birds attracted to the airfield. As a result, this official stated that the base was not able to fly up to 300 sorties of additional training because birds, attracted to the airfield by the bugs in the long grass, can be pulled into a jet engine causing damage. This contracting official said that if one contractor had been solely responsible for all these tasks the coordination would not have been necessary. In contrast, at Vance Air Force Base these services are provided by one contractor; as a result, all coordination responsibilities lie with that contractor.", "Fort Irwin had difficulties with a multiple service contract. The size and complexity of Fort Irwin\u2019s contract had grown until the administration and overall management of the contract had become cumbersome and in some cases not responsive to the needs of the installation. For example, the contractor directly supports the training mission of the base by maintaining combat equipment used in training. Officials found that the contractor was more focused on maintaining this equipment than on providing other installation support functions, such as public work services and range, airfield, and training support functions. In 1994, Forces Command conducted a study to determine whether the one multiple service contract was in the government\u2019s best interest. As a result of this study, Fort Irwin\u2019s contract was divided into five separate contracts\u2014two base support contracts to support the logistical and installation support functions and three individual contracts for custodial, food services, and indefinite quantity work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Small Businesses Participate, but Concerns Remain", "paragraphs": ["At 3 of the 10 installations we reviewed, small businesses were participating as prime contractors under single contracts for multiple base operations support activities.

DOD officials recognize this and have taken actions to enhance small business participation, but Small Business Administration officials remain concerned about the potential impact of multiple service contracts. The Small Business Administration Reauthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 adds new provisions to section 15(a) of the Small Business Act, which at the time of our work required federal agencies to consider the effect on small businesses when requirements currently being performed by small business are considered for consolidation.
