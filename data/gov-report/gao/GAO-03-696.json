In light of these thefts, a congressional committee asked GAO whether the Mint and BEP should continue to provide their own security or whether the United States Secret Service should provide their security. Among the issues that GAO was asked to address were (1) how do the Mint, BEP, and other organizations that produce or handle large amounts of cash provide their security; (2) what thefts have occurred at the Mint and BEP and what steps have they taken to prevent thefts from recurring; and (3) what are the potential benefits and costs of having the Secret Service provide Mint and BEP security?

Both the Mint and BEP had threat assessments made of their facilities and processes and took corrective action to enhance security. The Secret Service said that if its Uniformed Division were charged with the responsibility of protecting the Mint and BEP, the two agencies could benefit from the Secret Service's expertise in protection and criminal investigations. However, unlike Secret Service police officers, Mint and BEP security personnel are already familiar with the coin and currency production processes, which is a benefit in identifying security risks in these manufacturing facilities. Further, if the Secret Service protected the Mint and BEP, the government could incur additional costs because the Secret Service requires more training for its officers than the Mint and BEP police.

Further, he said that it would not be in the Secret  Service\u2019s best interests to take on the additional responsibility of providing  security for the Mint and BEP at a time when the effect of transferring the  Secret Service from the Treasury Department to DHS is undetermined.", "Mint and BEP officials were opposed to having an outside law enforcement  agency assume responsibility for their security functions because they said  that security is best accomplished by their own employees who are familiar  with the agencies\u2019 internal operations and the coin and currency  production processes. Mint and BEP officials also said that their police  officers have opportunities for advancement through promotion to  supervisory positions. BEP also said that police are encouraged to transfer  into career security positions, such as general investigator and security  specialist. However, they also said that a larger agency such as the Secret  Service may offer more opportunities for advancement. We asked the  Secret Service to provide data on the number of Uniformed Division  officers who had become special agents at the agency from fiscal years  1998 to 2002 and found that relatively few officers had become agents.  (Duties of special agents include investigation and protection, while the  mission of Uniformed Division officers is focused on protection.)  The data  indicated that an average of 21 officers had become special agents each  year during that 5-year period out of an average Uniformed Division  workforce of about 1,040 officers, or about 2 percent.", "If the Mint and BEP police became part of the Uniformed Division and  there was a rotation of duties, the Secret Service\u2019s mission of protecting the  president and providing security at national special security events could  be more appealing to some police officers, compared with the routine  nature of protecting Mint and BEP facilities. The Mint\u2019s Police Chief said  that, to provide variety in the work of Mint police officers and to increase  morale, up to 50 Mint police officers a year help the Uniformed Division  perform duties at special events\u2014for example, at the Olympics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Costs Associated with Having the Secret Service Protect the Mint and BEP", "paragraphs": ["If the Secret Service protected the Mint and BEP, the government could  incur additional costs because the Secret Service requires more initial  training for its officers than the Mint and BEP police, Uniformed Division  officers can retire with less government service than the Mint and BEP  police, and the Secret Service would have to increase management and  overhead to handle the additional workforce. Further, it is unknown how  many Mint and BEP police officers would be able to meet the Secret  Service\u2019s hiring standards or what the costs would be of absorbing these  officers into the Secret Service\u2019s retirement system.", "The Uniformed Division provides new hires with 6 more weeks of initial  training than the Mint police and 1 more week of training than the BEP  police. The Uniformed Division spends an average of $20,033 per officer for  initial training, compared with $16,306 per officer at the Mint and $18,791  per officer at BEP.", "The government also could be expected to incur higher retirement costs if  the Secret Service protected the Mint and BEP because Uniformed Division  officers receive federal law enforcement retirement benefits, which allows  them to retire after 20 years of service at age 50 or at any age with 25 years  of service. By comparison, Mint and BEP police receive standard  retirement benefits for federal employees, which generally allow them to  retire after 30 years of service at age 55 if covered by the Civil Service  Retirement System (CSRS) or after 30 years of service under the Federal  Employees Retirement System (FERS). Agency contributions for  employees receiving federal law enforcement retirement benefits are 31.4  percent for employees in CSRS and 22.7 percent for employees in FERS. By  comparison, agency contributions for employees receiving standard  retirement benefits are 17.4 percent for employees in CSRS and 10.7  percent for employees in FERS. Further, because employees receiving  federal law enforcement retirement benefits may retire sooner than those  who do not receive such benefits, it is likely that there would be higher  turnover in the police force, resulting in the need to train more officers and,  thus, in higher training costs over time.", "If the Secret Service assumed responsibility for protecting the Mint and  BEP and added 590 officers to its Uniformed Division to carry out that  responsibility, the size of the Uniformed Division\u2019s police force of 1,106  officers would increase by about 50 percent. Such an increase would likely  require the Secret Service to add additional overhead and resources to  manage the additional workforce. However, there also could be an offset by  reducing or possibly eliminating similar positions at the Mint and BEP. It  was not possible to estimate during our review what additional people and  facilities would be needed or what cost would be incurred.", "In addition, if the Secret Service assumed responsibility for protecting the  Mint and BEP, it is unknown how many of the Mint and BEP police would  qualify to become part of the Uniformed Division, considering that  applicants to become Uniformed Division officers are required to submit to  a polygraph test and obtain top-secret security clearances, which are not  required for Mint and BEP police. According to the Secret Service, for  example, a substantial number of applicants for the position of Uniformed  Division officer are rejected at the polygraph stage of the process. The  Secret Service also requires applicants to meet certain physical fitness  standards. Lastly, for those Mint and BEP police hired by the Uniformed  Division, there would be a cost of including them in the federal law  enforcement retirement plan. According to the Office of Personnel  Management, it could cost the government an estimated $72.7 million (in  present value dollars) if the entire existing Mint and BEP police forces  were given law enforcement retirement benefits. This computes to an  average of about $123,000 per officer. Because it was not possible to  determine how many of the existing Mint and BEP police officers would be  absorbed by the Uniformed Division, we could not estimate how much this  would cost.", "An alternative regarding the Mint and BEP police forces would be to  transfer them to a new, separate unit of the Uniformed Division. Under this  alternative, the existing Mint and BEP police forces would become a  second tier of the Uniformed Division and would be trained, supervised,  and managed by the Secret Service. One potential advantage of this  arrangement would be that the separate unit possibly could be used as a  stepping-stone for Mint and BEP police who would like to become  Uniformed Division officers. Further, this arrangement could streamline  activities, such as procurement, training, and recruitment, that may save  the government money. For example, a unified police force could help  recruiting efforts by being able to offer a variety of duties and duty stations.  However, according to the Secret Service, because of the differences in the  hiring standards between the Uniformed Division and the Mint and BEP  police, the stepping-stone concept for the Mint and BEP police officers  would be impractical and the Secret Service would not use them in  fulfilling its other protective responsibilities. The Secret Service said that  this alternative offers no advantages to the Secret Service; would place  additional financial, manpower, and other administrative burdens on the  agency; and would dilute the Uniformed Division\u2019s protective mission.  Further, Uniformed Division officers receive federal law enforcement  retirement benefits, while Mint and BEP police do not.", "The Mint and BEP police are covered by the labor management and  employee relations provisions set forth in Chapter 71 of Title 5 of the  United States Code, while the Secret Service employees are exempt from  these provisions pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7103 (a)(3)(H). According to the  Secret Service, if the Mint and BEP forces became a separate unit of the  Uniformed Division, this would create animosity in the agency because the  Mint and BEP police would have collective bargaining rights while  Uniformed Division officers would not. The Mint said that because  Uniformed Division officers receive federal law enforcement retirement  benefits and the Mint and BEP police do not, the substantial disparity in the  compensation between the Mint and BEP police officers and the  Uniformed Division would create problems with morale and performance.  In addition, the Mint said that placing responsibility for security in a  separate agency that is not part of the Treasury Department could hinder  the responsiveness of the security personnel to the Mint and BEP.  According to BEP, because of the difference in hiring standards between  the Uniformed Division and the Mint and BEP police forces, the Mint and  BEP police forces comprising the second tier would always feel less than  equal, which would also affect morale and create poor job performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided copies of a draft of this report to the Directors of the Mint,  BEP, and Secret Service for comment.
