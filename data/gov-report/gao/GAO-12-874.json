GAO identified and analyzed federal laws, state laws in six selected states (Colorado, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming), and interviewed federal and state officials and representatives from industry, environmental, and public health organizations.", "GAO is not making recommendations. In commenting on the report, agencies provided information on recent regulatory activities and technical comments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As with conventional oil and gas development, requirements from eight federal environmental and public health laws apply to unconventional oil and gas development. For example, the Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates discharges of pollutants into surface waters. Among other things, CWA requires oil and gas well site operators to obtain permits for discharges of produced water\u0097which includes fluids used for hydraulic fracturing, as well as water that occurs naturally in oil- or gas-bearing formations\u0097to surface waters. In addition, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) governs the management and disposal of hazardous wastes, among other things. However, key exemptions or limitations in regulatory coverage affect the applicability of six of these environmental and public health laws. For example, CWA also generally regulates stormwater discharges by requiring that facilities associated with industrial and construction activities get permits, but the law and its regulations largely exempt oil and gas well sites. In addition, oil and gas exploration and production wastes are exempt from RCRA hazardous waste requirements based on a regulatory determination made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1988. EPA generally retains its authorities under federal environmental and public health laws to respond to environmental contamination.", "All six states in GAO\u0092s review implement additional requirements governing activities associated with oil and gas development and have updated some aspects of their requirements in recent years. For example, all six states have requirements related to how wells are to be drilled and how casing\u0097steel pipe within the well\u0097is to be installed and cemented in place, though the specifics of their requirements vary. The states also have requirements related to well site selection and preparation, which may include baseline testing of water wells before drilling or stormwater management.", "Oil and gas development on federal lands must comply with applicable federal environmental and state laws, as well as additional requirements. These requirements are the same for conventional and unconventional oil and gas development. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) oversees oil and gas development on approximately 700 million subsurface acres. BLM regulations for leases and permits govern similar types of activities as state requirements, such as requirements for how operators drill the well and install casing. BLM recently proposed new regulations for hydraulic fracturing of wells on public lands.", "Federal and state agencies reported several challenges in regulating oil and gas development from unconventional reservoirs. EPA officials reported that conducting inspection and enforcement activities and having limited legal authorities are challenges. For example, conducting inspection and enforcement activities is challenging due to limited information, such as data on groundwater quality prior to drilling. EPA officials also said that the exclusion of exploration and production waste from hazardous waste regulations under RCRA significantly limits EPA\u0092s role in regulating these wastes. In addition, BLM and state officials reported that hiring and retaining staff and educating the public are challenges. For example, officials from several states and BLM said that retaining employees is difficult because qualified staff are frequently offered more money for private sector positions within the oil and gas industry."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the United States has imported oil and natural gas to fuel  vehicles and to heat and power homes and businesses. However,  improvements in technology have allowed companies that develop  petroleum resources to extract oil and natural gas from onshore  unconventional reservoirs that were previously considered inaccessible  because traditional techniques did not yield sufficient amounts for  economically viable production. For purposes of this report,  unconventional reservoirs include shale, tight sandstone, and coalbed  methane formations. Specifically, advances in horizontal drilling  techniques combined with hydraulic fracturing have recently increased  domestic production of oil and natural gas from such onshore  unconventional reservoirs. These advances, which have taken place over  the last several decades, now allow operators\u2014companies that extract oil  and natural gas\u2014to accurately determine the location of a drill bit while  drilling thousands of feet horizontally. Hydraulic fracturing involves  pumping water, sand, and chemical additives into oil and gas wells at  high enough pressure to fracture underground rock formations and allow  oil or gas to flow. When combined with horizontal drilling, hydraulic  fracturing allows operators to fracture the rock formation along the entire  horizontal portion of a well, increasing the number of pathways through  which oil or gas can flow. According to the Energy Information  Administration, oil production from shale formations (shale oil) has  increased significantly in several areas of the country, including the  Bakken formation in North Dakota and Montana, where production  increased from just over 2,000 barrels per day in 2000 to approximately  500,000 barrels per day in 2012. The Energy Information Administration  also projects that natural gas production from shale (shale gas) will  account for almost half of domestic production by 2035. According to a  2011 report by the Department of Energy, the recent substantial growth in  domestic natural gas production from shale has already brought lower  natural gas prices, domestic jobs, and the prospect of enhanced national  security.", "However, the increase in oil and gas development from unconventional  reservoirs has raised concerns about the potential environmental and  public health effects of such development. For example, several  environmental groups have expressed concerns that this development  releases hazardous air pollutants, such as benzene, and may  contaminate underground drinking water supplies and surface waters due  to spills or faulty well construction. These concerns have raised questions  about existing federal and state requirements governing oil and gas  development from unconventional reservoirs on both private and federal  lands. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administers and  enforces key federal laws, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act, the  Clean Water Act, and others, that aim to protect human health and the  environment. Under these statutes, EPA and its Regional offices work  with states that implement aspects of some of these laws, as well as  additional state requirements. EPA is also conducting a study, as directed  by a congressional committee, to examine the potential effects of  hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. In addition, federal land  management agencies, including the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau  of Land Management (BLM), National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife  Service (FWS) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service  manage federal lands and have responsibilities for oil and gas  development.", "You asked us to review environmental and public health requirements for  oil and gas development from onshore unconventional reservoirs. For  such development, this report (1) describes federal environmental and  public health requirements; (2) describes state requirements; (3)  describes additional requirements that apply on federal lands; and (4)  identifies challenges, if any, that federal and state agencies reported  facing in regulating oil and gas development from unconventional  reservoirs.", "To identify federal environmental and public health requirements  governing onshore oil and gas development from unconventional  reservoirs, we identified and analyzed eight key federal environmental  and public health laws and corresponding regulations and guidance. The  eight federal environmental and public health laws are: the Safe Drinking  Water Act (SDWA); Clean Water Act (CWA); Clean Air Act (CAA);  Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Comprehensive  Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA);  Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA); Toxic  Substances Control Act (TSCA); and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). We focused our analysis on federal and state  requirements that apply to activities on the well site\u2014the area of land  where drilling takes place\u2014and wastes or emissions generated at the  well site rather than on downstream infrastructure such as pipelines or  refineries. We also analyzed state laws and regulations in a  nonprobability sample of six selected states\u2014Colorado, North Dakota,  Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wyoming. We selected states with  current unconventional oil or gas development, as well as those states  with large reservoirs of unconventional oil or gas, a variety of types of  unconventional reservoirs, differing historical experiences with the oil and  gas industry, and significant development on federal lands. Because we  used a nonprobability sample, the information that we collected from  these states cannot be generalized to all states but can provide illustrative  examples. We also reviewed laws, regulations, and guidance governing  oil and gas development on federal lands. In addition, we reviewed  several reports issued by environmental and public health organizations,  industry, academic institutions, and government agencies that provided  perspectives on federal and state regulations.", "To complement our analysis of laws and regulations, we interviewed  officials in EPA headquarters and the four Regional offices responsible for  overseeing implementation of federal programs in the six selected states;  oil and gas and environmental regulators for the six selected states;  officials in BLM headquarters and field offices in each of the three  selected states with significant amounts of federal land; and officials in  Park Service, Forest Service, and FWS headquarters to discuss how  federal and state requirements apply to the oil and gas industry and any  challenges faced by regulators in implementing these requirements. We  also contacted representatives from industry, environmental, and public  health organizations regarding federal and state regulatory requirements  for unconventional oil and gas development. In addition, we met with  company officials to discuss federal and state regulations and visited  drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and production sites in Pennsylvania and  North Dakota. Oil and gas development may also be subject to local laws  and requirements related to water use and withdrawals, but we did not  include an analysis of these issues in the scope of our review. We also  did not include an analysis of the extent to which federal or state laws and  regulations concerning oil and gas development apply on tribal lands, or  the extent to which tribal laws may apply. In describing federal and state  requirements for oil and gas development from unconventional reservoirs,  where it is helpful to further the understanding of the requirements, we  provide examples of how these requirements have been applied, but  these examples do not attempt to provide a comprehensive view of the  extent to which enforcement actions have been taken for any of the  requirements. A more detailed description of our objectives, scope, and  methodology is presented in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2011 to September  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Regardless of the reservoir, unconventional oil and gas development  involves a number of activities, many of which are also conducted in  conventional oil and gas drilling. This section describes the types and  locations of oil and gas reservoirs and the key stages of oil and gas  development."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Types and Locations of Oil and Gas Reservoirs", "paragraphs": ["Oil and natural gas are found in a variety of geologic formations. In  conventional reservoirs, oil and gas can flow relatively easily through a  series of pores in the rock to the well. Shale and tight sandstone  formations generally have low permeability and therefore do not allow oil  and gas to easily flow to the well. Shale and tight sandstone formations  can occur at varying depths, including thousands of feet beneath the  surface. For example, the Bakken shale formation in North Dakota and  Montana ranges from 4,500 to 11,000 feet beneath the surface. Coalbed  methane formations, often located at shallow depths of several hundred  to 3,000 feet, are generally formations through which gas can flow more  freely; however, capturing the gas requires operators to pump water out  of the coal formation to reduce the pressure and allow the gas to flow.  Shale, tight sandstone, and coalbed methane formations are located  within basins, which are large-scale geological depressions, often  hundreds of miles across, which also may contain other oil and gas  resources. There is no clear and consistently agreed upon distinction  between conventional and unconventional oil and gas, but unconventional  sources generally require more complex and expensive technologies for  production, such as the combination of horizontal drilling and multiple  hydraulic fractures. See figure 1 for a depiction of conventional and  unconventional reservoirs.", "Unconventional reservoirs are located throughout the continental United  States on both private lands and federal lands that are administered by  BLM, Forest Service, Park Service, and FWS (see fig. 2).", "Developing unconventional reservoirs involves a variety of activities,  many of which are also conducted in conventional oil and gas drilling.", "Siting and site preparation. The operator identifies a location for the well  and prepares the area of land where drilling will take place\u2014referred to as  a well pad. In some cases, the operator will build new access roads to  transport equipment to the well pad or install new pipelines to transport the  oil or gas that is produced. In addition, the operator will clear vegetation  from the area and may place storage tanks (also called vessels) or  construct pits on the well pad for temporarily storing fluids (see fig. 3). In  some cases, multiple wells will be located on a single well pad.", "Drilling, casing, and cementing. The operator conducts several phases of  drilling to install multiple layers of steel pipe\u2014called casing\u2014and cement  the casing in place. The layers of steel casing are intended to isolate the  internal portion of the well from the outlying geological formations, which  may include underground drinking water supplies. As the well is drilled  deeper, progressively narrower casing is inserted further down the well  and cemented in place. Throughout the drilling process, a special  lubricant called drilling fluid, or drilling mud, is circulated down the well to  lubricate the drilling assembly and carry drill cuttings (essentially rock  fragments created during drilling) back to the surface. After vertical drilling  is complete, horizontal drilling is conducted by slowly angling the drill bit  until it is drilling horizontally. Horizontal stretches of the well typically  range from 2,000 feet to 6,000 feet long but can be as long as 12,000 feet  in some cases.", "Hydraulic fracturing. Operators sequentially perforate steel casing and  pump a fluid mixture down the well and into the target formation at high  enough pressure to cause the rock within the target formation to fracture.  The sequential fracturing of a well can use between 2 million and 5.6  million gallons of water. Operators add a proppant, such as sand, to the  mixture to keep the fractures open despite the large pressure of the  overlying rock. About 98 percent of the fluid mixture used in hydraulic  fracturing is water and sand, according to a report about shale gas  development by the Ground Water Protection Council. The fluid  mixture\u2014or hydraulic fracturing fluid\u2014generally contains a number of  chemical additives, each of which is designed to serve a particular  purpose. For example, operators may use a friction reducer to minimize  friction between the fluid and the pipe, acid to help dissolve minerals and  initiate cracks in the rock, and a biocide to eliminate bacteria in the water  that cause corrosion. The number of chemicals used and their  concentrations depend on the particular conditions of the well. After  hydraulic fracturing, a mixture of fluids, gases, and dissolved solids flows  to the surface (flowback), after which production can begin, and the well  is said to have been completed. Operators use hydraulic fracturing in  many shale and tight sandstone formations (see fig. 4). Some coalbed  methane wells are hydraulically fractured (see fig. 5), but operators may  use different combinations of water, sand, and chemicals than with other  unconventional wells. In addition, operators must \u201cdewater\u201d coalbed  methane formations in order to get the natural gas to begin flowing\u2014a  process that can generate large amounts of water.", "Well plugging. Once a well is no longer producing economically, the  operator typically plugs the well with cement to prevent fluid migration  from outlying formations into the well and to prevent downward drainage  from inside the well. In some cases, wells may be temporarily plugged so  that the operator has the option of reopening the well in the future. In  some states with a long history of oil and gas development, wells drilled  decades ago may not have been properly plugged\u2014or the plug may have  deteriorated.", "Site reclamation. Once the well is plugged, the operator takes steps to  restore the site to make it acceptable for specific uses, such as farming.  For example, reclamation may involve removing equipment from the well  pad, closing pits, backfilling soil, and restoring vegetation. Sometimes,  when a well starts production, operators reclaim the portions of a site  affected by the initial drilling activity.", "Waste management and disposal. Throughout the drilling, hydraulic  fracturing, and subsequent production activities, operators must manage  and dispose of several types of waste. For example, operators must  manage produced water, which, for purposes of this report includes  flowback water\u2014the water, proppant, and chemicals used for hydraulic  fracturing\u2014as well as water that occurs naturally in the oil- or gas-bearing  geological formation. Operators temporarily store produced water in tanks  or pits, and some operators may recycle it for reuse in subsequent  hydraulic fracturing. Options for permanently disposing of produced water  vary and may include, for example, injecting it underground into wells   Operators also generate solid wastes  designated for such purposes. such as drill cuttings and could potentially generate small quantities of  hazardous waste. See table 1 for additional methods for managing and  disposing of waste.", "We recently issued a report on the quantity, quality, and management of water produced  during oil and gas production.

The UIC program protects underground sources of  drinking water by setting and enforcing standards for siting, constructing,  and operating injection wells. Injection wells in the UIC program fall into  six different categories based on the types of fluids being injected. The  wells used to manage fluids associated with oil and gas production,  including produced water, are Class II wells.", "EPA officials estimate there are approximately 151,000 permitted Class II  UIC wells in operation in the United States. Two types of wells account for  nearly all the Class II UIC wells in the United States (see fig. 7), as  follows:", "Enhanced recovery wells inject produced water or other fluids or  gases into oil- or gas-producing formations to increase the pressure in  the formation and force additional oil or gas out of nearby producing  wells.

EPA documents estimate that about 20 percent of Class  II wells are disposal wells.", "UIC regulations include minimum federal requirements for most Class II  UIC wells; these requirements are generally applicable only where EPA  implements the program. For example, for most new Class II UIC wells,  an operator must, among other things (1) obtain a permit from EPA or a  state, (2) demonstrate that casing and cementing are adequate, and (3)  pass an integrity test prior to beginning operation and at least once every  5 years. In addition, when proposing a new Class II UIC well, an operator  must identify any existing water or abandoned production or injection  wells generally within one-quarter mile of the proposed well. During the  life of the Class II UIC well, the operator has to comply with monitoring  requirements, including tracking the injection pressure, rate of injection,  and volume of fluid injected.", "SDWA authorizes EPA to approve by rule a state to be the primary  enforcement responsibility\u2014called primacy\u2014for the UIC program, which  means that a state assumes responsibility for implementing its program,  including permitting and monitoring UIC wells. Generally, to be approved  for primacy, state programs must be at least as stringent as the federal  program for each of the well classes for which primacy is sought;  however, SDWA also includes alternative provisions for primacy related  to Class II wells whereby, in lieu of adopting requirements consistent with  EPA\u2019s Class II regulations, a state can demonstrate to EPA that its  program is effective in preventing endangerment of underground sources  of drinking water. Five of the six states in our review (Colorado, North  Dakota, Ohio, Texas, and Wyoming) have been granted primacy for  Class II wells under the alternative provisions. Pennsylvania has not  applied for primacy, so EPA directly implements the program there.  Please see appendix IX for more information about UIC requirements in  the six states in our review.", "As discussed, the UIC program regulates the injection of fluids  underground. Historically, the UIC program was not used to regulate  hydraulic fracturing, even though fracturing entails the injection of fluid  underground. In 1994, in light of concerns that hydraulic fracturing of  coalbed methane wells threatened drinking water, citizens petitioned EPA  to withdraw its approval of Alabama\u2019s Class II UIC program because the  state failed to regulate hydraulic fracturing. The case ended up before the  United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, which held that  the definition of underground injection included hydraulic fracturing. The  court\u2019s decision was made in the context of hydraulic fracturing of a  coalbed methane formation in Alabama but raised questions about  whether hydraulic fracturing would be included in UIC programs  nationwide.", "UIC regulations at the time and now provide that \u2018\u2018ny underground injection, except  into a well authorized by rule or except as authorized by permit issued under the UIC  program, is prohibited.\u2019\u2019 40 C.F.R. 144.11 (2005) (2011). The Energy Policy Act provision  did not exempt injections of diesel fuel during hydraulic fracturing from the definition of  underground injection. EPA\u2019s position is that underground injection of diesel fuel as part of  hydraulic fracturing requires a UIC permit or authorization by rule. program. The guidance is directed at EPA permit writers in states where  EPA directly implements the program; the guidance does not address  state-run UIC programs (including five of the six states in our review).  EPA\u2019s draft guidance is applicable to any oil and gas wells using diesel in  hydraulic fracturing (not just coalbed methane wells). The draft guidance  provides recommendations related to permit applications, area of review  (for other nearby wells), well construction, permit duration, and well  closure.", "SDWA also gives EPA authority to issue orders when the agency  receives information about present or likely contamination of a public  water system or an underground source of drinking water that may  present an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health. In  December 2010, EPA used this authority to issue an emergency  administrative order to an operator in Texas alleging that the company\u2019s  oil and gas production facilities near Fort Worth, Texas, caused or  contributed to methane contamination in two nearby private drinking  water wells. EPA contended that this methane contamination posed an  explosion hazard and therefore was an imminent and substantial threat to  human health. EPA\u2019s order required the operator to take six actions,  specifically: (1) notify EPA whether it intended to comply with the order,  (2) provide replacement water supplies to landowners, (3) install meters  to monitor for the risk of explosion at the affected homes, (4) conduct a  survey of any additional private water wells within 3,000 feet of the oil and  gas production facilities, (5) develop a plan to conduct soil and indoor air  monitoring at the affected dwellings, and (6) develop a plan to investigate  how methane flowed into the aquifer and private drinking water wells. The  operator disputed the validity of EPA\u2019s order and noted that the order  does not provide any way for the company to challenge EPA\u2019s findings.  Nevertheless, the operator implemented the first three actions EPA listed  in the order. In January 2011, EPA sued the operator in federal district  court, seeking to enforce the remaining three provisions of the order. In  March 2011, the regulatory agency that oversees oil and gas  development in Texas held a hearing examining the operator\u2019s possible  role in the contamination of the water wells and issued an opinion in  which it concluded that the operator had not caused the contamination. In  March 2012, EPA withdrew the original emergency administrative order,  and the operator agreed to continue monitoring 20 private water wells  near its production sites for 1 year. According to EPA officials, resolving  the lawsuit allows the agency to shift its focus away from litigation and  toward a joint EPA-operator effort in monitoring.", "For more details about SDWA, please see appendix II.", "To restore and maintain the nation\u2019s waters, CWA authorizes EPA to,  among other things, regulate pollutant discharges and respond to spills  affecting rivers and streams. Several aspects of CWA are applicable to  oil and gas well pad sites, but statutory exemptions limit EPA\u2019s regulatory  authority. Several elements of CWA and implementing regulations are  relevant to oil and gas development from onshore unconventional  sources. First, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System  (NPDES) program regulates industrial sites\u2019 wastewater and stormwater  discharges to waters of the United States (surface waters). Second, spill  reporting and spill prevention and response planning requirements pertain  to certain threats to U.S. navigable waters and adjoining shorelines. In  addition, under certain circumstances, EPA has response authorities; for  example, it can generally bring suit or take other actions to protect the  public health and welfare from actual or threatened discharges of oil or  hazardous substances to U.S. navigable waters and adjoining shorelines.", "EPA\u2019s NPDES program limits the types and amounts of pollutants that  industrial sites, industrial wastewater treatment facilities, and municipal  wastewater treatment facilities (often called publicly-owned treatment works  or POTWs) can discharge into the nation\u2019s surface waters by requiring  these facilities to have and comply with permits listing pollutants and their  discharge limits. As required by CWA, EPA develops effluent limitations for  certain industrial categories based on available control technologies and  other factors to prevent or treat the discharge. EPA established multiple  subcategories for the oil and gas industry; relevant here are: (1) onshore,  (2) agricultural and wildlife water use, and (3) stripper wells\u2014that is, wells  that produce relatively small amounts of oil.", "For the onshore and agricultural and wildlife water use subcategories,  EPA established effluent limitations guidelines for direct dischargers that  establish minimum requirements to be used by EPA and state NPDES  permit writers. Specifically, the onshore subcategory has a zero discharge  limit for discharges to surface waters, meaning that no direct discharges  to surface waters are allowed. EPA documents explain that this is  because there are technologies available\u2014such as underground  injection\u2014to dispose of produced water generated at oil and gas well  sites without directly discharging them to surface waters. Given that the  NPDES permit limit would be \u201cno discharge,\u201d EPA officials said that they  were unaware of any instances in which operators had applied for these  permits. EPA officials did mention, however, an instance in which an  operator discharged produced water to a stream and was fined by EPA  under provisions in CWA. For example, in 2011, EPA Region 6 assessed  an administrative civil penalty against a company managing an oil  production facility in Oklahoma for discharging brine and produced water  to a nearby stream. The company ultimately agreed to pay a $1,500 fine  and conduct an environmental project, which included extensive soil  remediation near the facilities.", "Effluent limitations guidelines for the agricultural and wildlife water use  subcategory cover a geographical subset of wells in the westthe quality of produced water from the wells is good enough for watering  crops and livestock or to support wildlife in streams. The effluent  limitations guideline for this subcategory allows such discharges of  produced water for these purposes as long as the water meets a  minimum quality standard for oil and grease. EPA officials identified 349  facilities with discharge permits in this subcategory. Officials also stated   in which  that individual permits may contain limits for pollutants other than oil and  grease.", "EPA has not established effluent limitations guidelines for stripper wells,  and EPA and state NPDES permit writers currently use their best  professional judgment to determine the effluent limits for permits on a  case-by-case basis. EPA explained in a 1976 Federal Register notice that  unacceptable economic impacts would occur if the agency developed  effluent limitations guidelines for stripper wells and that the agency could  revisit this decision at a later date. In July 2012, EPA officials confirmed  that the agency currently has no plans to develop an effluent limitations  guideline for stripper wells.", "EPA also has not established effluent limitations guidelines for coalbed  methane wells and EPA and state NPDES permit writers currently use  their best professional judgment to determine the effluent limits for  permits on a case-by-case basis. EPA officials explained that the process  of extracting natural gas from coalbed methane formations is  fundamentally different from traditional oil and gas development, partly  because of the large volume of water that must be removed from the  coalbed methane formation prior to production. Given these differences,  coalbed methane wells are not included in any of EPA\u2019s current  subcategories. EPA announced in 2011 that, based on a multiyear study  of the coalbed methane industry, the agency will develop effluent  limitations guidelines for produced water discharges from coalbed  methane formations. In the course of developing these guidelines, EPA  officials told us that they will analyze the economic feasibility of each of  the available technologies for disposing of the large volumes of produced  water from coalbed methane wells and that EPA plans to issue proposed  guidelines in the summer of 2013.", "In addition to setting effluent limitations guidelines for direct discharges of  pollutants to surface waters, CWA requires EPA to develop regulations  that establish pretreatment standards. These standards apply when  wastewater is sent to a POTW before being discharged to surface waters,  and the standards must prevent the discharge of any pollutant that would  interfere with, or pass through, the POTW. To date, EPA has not set  pretreatment standards specifically for produced water, though there are  some general requirements; for example, discharges to POTWs cannot  cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit or interfere with the  treatment process. In October 2011, EPA announced its intention to  develop pretreatment standards specific to the produced water from shale  gas development. EPA officials told us that the agency intends to conduct  a survey and use other methods to collect additional data and information  to support this rulemaking. Officials expect to publish the first Federal  Register notice about the survey by the end of 2012 and to publish a  proposed rule in 2014.", "In addition to CWA\u2019s requirement for NPDES permits for discharges from  industrial sites, the 1987 Water Quality Act amended CWA to establish a  specific program for regulating stormwater discharges, such as those  related to rainstorms, though oil and gas well sites are largely exempt  from these requirements. EPA generally requires that facilities get  NPDES permits for discharges of stormwater associated with industrial  and construction activities, but the Water Quality Act of 1987 specifically  exempted oil and gas production sites from permit requirements for  stormwater discharges, as long as the stormwater was not contaminated  by, for example, raw materials or waste products. exemption and EPA\u2019s implementing regulations, oil and gas well sites are  only required to get NPDES permits for stormwater discharges if the  facility has had a discharge of contaminated stormwater that includes a  reportable quantity of a pollutant or contributes to the violation of a water  quality standard. The 2005 Energy Policy Act expanded the language of  the exemption to include construction activities at oil and gas well sites,  meaning that uncontaminated stormwater discharges from oil and gas  construction sites also do not require NPDES permits. So while other  industries must generally obtain NPDES permits for construction activities  that disturb an acre or more of land, operators of oil and gas well sites are  generally not required to do so.", "The 1987 Water Quality Act also exempted oil and gas processing, treatment, and  transmission facilities from permit requirements for stormwater discharges.", "National Response Center, which is managed by the U.S. Coast Guard  and serves as the sole federal point of contact for reporting oil and  chemical spills in the United States. Oil discharges must be reported if  they cause a film or sheen on the surface of the water or shorelines or if  they violate water quality standards. The National Response Center  shares information about spills with other agencies, including EPA  Regional offices, which allows EPA to follow up on reported spills, as  appropriate.", "CWA also authorized spill prevention and response planning  requirements as promulgated in the Spill Prevention, Control, and  Countermeasure (SPCC) rule. Facilities that are subject to SPCC rules  are required to prepare and implement a plan describing, among other  things, how they will control, contain, clean up, and mitigate the effects of  any oil discharges that occur. Onshore oil and gas well sites, among  others, are subject to this rule if they have total aboveground oil storage  capacity greater than 1,320 gallons and could reasonably be expected,  based on location, to discharge oil into U.S. navigable waters or on  adjoining shorelines. The amount of oil storage capacity at oil and gas  well sites tends to vary based on whether the well is being drilled,  hydraulically fractured, or has entered production. For example, during  drilling at well sites located near these waters, operators generally have  to comply with SPCC requirements if fuel tanks for the drilling rig exceed  the 1,320 gallon threshold. According to EPA officials, nearly all drill rigs  have fuel tanks larger than 1,320 gallons, and so most well sites are  subject to the SPCC rule during drilling if they are near these waters. Oil  and gas well sites that are subject to the SPCC rule were required to  comply by November 2011 or before starting operations.", "In accordance with CWA, EPA directly administers the SPCC program  rather than delegating authority to states. EPA regulations generally do  not require facilities to report SPCC information to EPA, including whether  or not they are regulated. As a result, EPA does not know the universe of  SPCC-regulated facilities. To ensure that regulated facilities are meeting  SPCC requirements, EPA Regional personnel may inspect these facilities  to evaluate their compliance. EPA officials said that some of these  inspections were conducted as follow-up after spills were reported and  that most inspections are conducted during the production phase, since  drilling and hydraulic fracturing are of much shorter durations, making it  difficult for inspectors to visit these sites during those times. According to  EPA officials, Regional personnel inspected 120 oil and gas well sites  nationwide in fiscal year 2011 and found noncompliance at 105 of these  sites. These violations ranged from paperwork inconsistencies to more  serious violations, such as a lack of secondary containment around  stored oil or failure to implement an SPCC plan (though EPA officials  were unable to specifically quantify the number of more serious  violations). EPA officials said that EPA has addressed some of the 105  violations through enforcement actions.", "CWA also provides EPA with authorities to address the discharge of  pollutants and to address actual or threatened discharges of oil or  hazardous substances in certain circumstances. For example, under one  provision, EPA has the authority to address actual or threatened  discharges of oil or hazardous substances into U.S. navigable waters or  on adjoining shorelines upon a determination that there may be an  imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare of the  United States, by bringing suit or taking other action, including issuing  administrative orders that may be necessary to protect public health and  welfare. Under another provision, EPA has authority to obtain records and  access to facilities, among other things, in order to determine if a person  is violating certain CWA requirements. For example, EPA conducted  initial investigations in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, following a 2011  spill of hydraulic fracturing and other fluids that entered a stream. Citing  its authority under CWA and other laws,from the operator about the incident, including information about the  chemicals involved and the environmental effects of the spill. Meanwhile,  the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection signed a  consent order and agreement with the operator in 2012 that required the  operator to pay fines and implement a monitoring plan for the affected  stream.", "For more details about CWA, please see appendix III.", "CAA, a federal law that regulates air pollution from mobile and stationary  sources, was enacted to improve and protect the quality of the nation\u2019s  air. Under CAA, EPA sets national ambient air quality standards for the  six criteria pollutants\u2013\u2013ground level ozone, carbon monoxide, particulate  matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and lead\u2013\u2013at levels it determines  are necessary to protect public health and welfare. States then develop  state implementation plans (SIP) to establish how the state will attain air  quality standards, through regulation, permits, policies, and other means.  States must obtain EPA approval for SIPs; if a SIP is not acceptable, EPA  may assume responsibility for implementing and enforcing CAA in that  state. CAA also authorizes EPA to regulate emissions of hazardous air  pollutants, such as benzene. In addition, under CAA, EPA requires  reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from a variety of sources,  including oil and gas wells.", "In accordance with CAA, EPA has progressively implemented more  stringent diesel emissions standards to lower the amount of key pollutants  from mobile diesel-powered engines since 1984. These standards apply  to a variety of on- and off-road diesel-powered engines, including trucks  used in the oil and gas industry to move materials to and from well sites  and compressors used to drill and hydraulically fracture wells. Diesel  exhaust contains nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. Emissions  standards may set limits on the amount of pollution a vehicle or engine  can emit or establish requirements about how the vehicle or engine must  be maintained or operated, and generally apply to new vehicles. For  example, the most recent emissions standards for construction equipment  began to take effect in 2008 and required a 95 percent reduction in  nitrogen oxides and a 90 percent reduction in particulate matter from  previous standards. EPA estimates that millions of older mobile  sources\u2014including on-road and off-road engines and vehicles\u2014remain in  use. It is projected that over time, older sources will be taken out of use  and be replaced by the lower-emission vehicles, ultimately reducing  emissions from mobile sources.", "New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) apply to new stationary  facilities or modifications to stationary facilities that result in increases in  air emissions and focus on criteria air pollutants or their precursors. For  the oil and gas industry, the key pollutant is volatile organic compounds, a  precursor to ground level ozone formation. Prior to 2012, EPA\u2019s NSPS  were unlikely to affect oil and gas well sites because (1) EPA had not  promulgated standards directly targeting well sites and (2) to the extent  that EPA promulgated standards for equipment that may be located at  well sites, the capacity of equipment located at well sites was generally  too low to trigger the requirement. For example, in 1987, EPA issued  NSPS for storage vessels containing petroleum liquids; however, the  standards apply only to tanks above a certain size, and EPA officials said  that most storage tanks at oil and gas sites are below the threshold.", "In April 2012, EPA promulgated NSPS for the oil and natural gas  production industry which, when fully phased-in by 2015, will require  reductions of volatile organic compound emissions at oil and gas well  sites, including wells using hydraulic fracturing.", "Specifically, these new  standards are related to pneumatic controllers, well completions, and  certain storage vessels as follows:", "Pneumatic controllers. According to EPA, when pneumatic controllers  are powered by natural gas, they may release natural gas and volatile  organic compounds during normal operations. The new standards set  limits for the amount of gas (as a surrogate for volatile organic  compound emissions) that new and modified pneumatic controllers  can release per hour. EPA\u2019s regulatory impact analysis for the NSPS  estimates that about 13,600 new or modified pneumatic controllers  will be required to meet the standard annually; EPA also estimates  that the oil and gas production sector currently uses about 400,000  pneumatic controllers.", "Well completions for hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. EPA\u2019s  NSPS for well completions focus on reducing the venting of volatile  organic compounds during flowback after hydraulic fracturing.  According to EPA\u2019s regulatory impact analysis, natural gas well  completions involving hydraulic fracturing vent approximately 230  times more natural gas and volatile organic compounds than natural  gas well completions that do not involve hydraulic fracturing. The  regulatory impact analysis attributes these emissions to the practice of  routing flowback of fracture fluids and reservoir gas to a surface  impoundment (pit) where natural gas and volatile organic compounds  escape to the atmosphere. To reduce the release of volatile organic  compounds from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells, EPA\u2019s new  rule will require operators to use \u201cgreen completion\u201d techniques to  capture and treat flowback emissions so that the captured natural gas  can be sold or otherwise used. EPA\u2019s regulatory impact analysis for  the rule estimates that more than 9,400 wells will be required to meet  the new standard annually.", "Storage vessels. Storage vessels are used at well sites (and in other  parts of the oil and gas industry) to store crude oil, condensate, and  produced water. These vessels emit gas and volatile organic  compounds when they are being filled or emptied and in association  with changes of temperature. EPA\u2019s NSPS rule will require storage  vessels that emit more than 6 tons per year of volatile organic  compounds to reduce these emissions by at least 95 percent. EPA\u2019s  regulatory impact analysis for the rule estimates that approximately  300 new storage vessels used by the oil and gas industry will be  required to meet the new standards annually. EPA officials said they  anticipate that most of these storage vessels will be located at well  sites.", "EPA also regulates hazardous air pollutants emitted by stationary sources.  In accordance with the 1990 amendments to CAA, EPA does this by  identifying categories of industrial sources of hazardous air pollutants and  requiring those sources to comply with emissions standards, such as by  installing controls or changing production practices. These National  Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for each  industrial source category include standards for major sources, which are  defined as sources with the potential to emit 10 tons or more per year of a  hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons or more per year of a combination of  pollutants, as well as for area sources, which are sources of hazardous air  pollutants that are not defined as major sources. Generally, EPA or state  regulators can aggregate emissions from related or nearby equipment to  determine whether the unit or facility should be regulated as a major  source. However, in determining whether the oil or gas well is a major  source of hazardous air pollutants, CAA expressly prohibits aggregating  emissions from oil and gas wells (with their associated equipment) and  emissions from pipeline compressors or pumping stations.", "EPA initially promulgated a NESHAP for oil and natural gas production  facilities for major sources in 1999 and promulgated amendments in April  2012. NESHAPs generally identify emissions points that may be present at  facilities within each industrial source category. The source category for oil  and natural gas production facilities includes oil and gas well sites and  other oil and gas facilities, such as pipeline gathering stations and natural  gas processing plants. The NESHAP for the oil and natural gas production  facilities major source category includes emissions points (or sources) that  may or may not normally be found at well sites at sizes that would tend to  meet the major source threshold. EPA officials in each of the four Regions  we contacted were unaware of any specific examples of oil and natural gas  wells being regulated as major sources of hazardous air pollutants before  the April 2012 amendments. These amendments, however, changed a key  definition used to determine whether a facility (such as a well site) is a  major source. Specifically, EPA modified the definition of the term  \u201cassociated equipment\u201d such that emissions from all storage vessels and  glycol dehydrators (used to remove water from gas) at a facility will be  counted toward determining whether a facility is a major source. EPA\u2019s  regulatory impact analysis and other technical support documents for the  April 2012 amendments did not estimate how many oil and natural gas well  sites would be considered major sources under the new definition.", "EPA also promulgated a NESHAP for oil and natural gas production  facilities for area sources in 2007. The 2007 area source rule addresses  emissions from one emissions point, triethylene glycol dehydrators, which  are used to remove water from gas. Triethylene glycol dehydrators can be  located at oil and gas well sites or other oil and gas facilities, such as  natural gas processing plants. Area sources are required to notify EPA that  they are subject to the rule, but EPA does not track whether the facilities  providing notification are well sites or other oil and natural gas facilities, so  it is difficult to determine to what extent oil and gas well sites are subject to  the area source NESHAP.", "In addition to specific programs for regulating hazardous air pollutants,  CAA establishes that operators of stationary sources that produce,  process, store, or handle listed or extremely hazardous substances have  a general duty to identify hazards that may result from accidental  releases, take steps needed to prevent such releases, and minimize the  consequences of such releases when they occur. Methane is one of  many hazardous substances of concern due to their flammable  properties. Some EPA Regional officials said that they use infrared video  cameras to conduct inspections to identify leaks of methane from storage  tanks or other equipment at well sites. For example, EPA Region 6  officials said they have conducted 45 inspections at well sites from July  2010 to July 2012 and issued 10 administrative orders related to  violations of the CAA general duty clause. said that all well sites are required to comply with the general duty clause  but that EPA prioritizes and selects sites for inspections based on risk.", "EPA Region 6 includes the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and  Texas.", "CAA also requires EPA to publish regulations and guidance for chemical  accident prevention at facilities using substances that pose the greatest  risk of harm from accidental releases; the regulatory program is known as  the Risk Management Program. The extent to which a facility is subject to  the Risk Management Program depends on the regulated substances  present at the facility and their quantities, among other things. EPA\u2019s list  of regulated substances and their thresholds for the Risk Management  Program was initially established in 1994 and has been revised several  times. The regulated chemicals that may be present at oil and gas well  sites include components of natural gas (e.g., butane, propane, methane,  and ethane). However, a 1998 regulatory determination from EPA  provided an exemption for naturally-occurring hydrocarbon mixtures (i.e.,  crude oil, natural gas, condensate, and produced water) prior to entry into  a natural gas processing plant or petroleum refinery; EPA explained at  the time that these chemicals do not warrant regulation and that the  general duty clause would apply in certain risky situations. Since  naturally-occurring hydrocarbons at well sites generally have not entered  a processing facility, they are not included in the threshold determination  of whether the well site should be subject to the Risk Management  Program. EPA officials said that generally, unless other flammable or  toxic regulated substances were brought to the site, well sites would not  trip the threshold quantities for the risk management regulations. In  September 2011, the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation  Board (Chemical Safety Board) released a report describing 26 incidents  involving fatalities or injuries related to oil and gas storage tanks located  at well sites from 1983 through 2010. The report found that these  accidents occurred when the victims\u2014all young adults\u2014gathered at rural  unmanned oil and gas storage sites lacking fencing and warning signs  and concluded that such sites pose a public safety risk. The report also  noted that exploration and production storage tanks are exempt from the  Risk Management Program requirements of CAA and recommended that  EPA publish a safety alert to owners and operators of exploration and  production facilities with flammable storage tanks advising them of their  CAA general duty clause responsibilities, and encouraging specific  measures to reduce these risks. The Chemical Safety Board requested  that EPA provide a response stating how EPA will address the  recommendation. EPA responded in June 2012, stating its intent to  comply with the recommendation.", "As of 2012, oil and natural gas production facilities are required to report  their greenhouse gas emissions to EPA on an annual basis as described  in EPA\u2019s greenhouse gas reporting rule. According to EPA documents, oil  and gas well sites may emit greenhouse gases, including methane and  carbon dioxide, from sources including: (1) combustion sources, such as  engines used on site, which typically burn natural gas or diesel fuel, and  (2) indirect sources, such as equipment leaks and venting.greenhouse gas reporting rule requires oil and gas production facilities  (defined in regulation as all wells in a single basin that are under common  ownership or control) that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon  dioxide equivalent at the basin level to report their annual emissions of  carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide from equipment leaks and  venting, gas flaring, and stationary and portable combustion. EPA  documents estimate that emissions from approximately 467,000 onshore  wells are covered under the rule.", "For more details about CAA, please see appendix IV.", "RCRA, passed in 1976, established EPA\u2019s authority to regulate the  generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal of hazardous  wastes. Subsequently, the Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendments of  1980 created a separate process by which oil and gas exploration and  production wastes, including those originating within a well, would not be  regulated as hazardous unless EPA conducted a study of wastes  associated with oil and gas development and then determined that such  wastes warranted regulation as hazardous waste, followed by  congressional approval of the regulations. EPA conducted the study  and, in 1988, issued a determination that it was not warranted to regulate  oil and gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous. Based on  this EPA determination, drilling fluids, produced water, and other wastes  associated with the exploration, development, or production of oil or gas  are not regulated as hazardous. According to EPA guidance issued in  2002, these exempt wastes include wastes that come from within the  well, as well as wastes generated from field operations. Conversely,  wastes generated from other activities at well sites may be regulated as  hazardous. For example, discarded unused hydraulic fracturing fluids and  painting wastes, among others, may be present at well sites and are  \u201cnon-exempt,\u201d and could be regulated as hazardous, depending on the  specific characteristics of the wastes. Facilities that generate more than  100 kilograms (220 pounds) of hazardous waste per month are regulated  as generators of hazardous waste and, among other things, are required  to have an EPA identification number and to use the RCRA manifest  system for tracking hazardous waste. Facilities generating smaller  quantities of hazardous waste are not subject to these requirements.  EPA headquarters officials said they do not have data on how many well  sites may be hazardous waste generators, but that states may have more  information about quantities of hazardous wastes at well sites. As such,  we asked state officials responsible for waste programs whether they  were aware of well sites being classified as small-quantity hazardous  waste generators, and officials in all six states we reviewed indicated that  they were unaware of well sites having sufficient quantities of hazardous  wastes to be subject to those regulations.", "In September 2010, the Natural Resources Defense Council submitted a  petition to EPA requesting that the agency regulate waste associated with  oil and gas exploration and production as hazardous. The petition asserts  that EPA should revisit the 1988 determination not to regulate these  wastes as hazardous because, among other things, EPA\u2019s underlying  assumptions concerning the availability of alternative disposal practices,  the adequacy of state regulations, and the potential for economic harm to  the oil industry are no longer valid. According to EPA officials, the agency  is currently reviewing the information provided in the petition but does not  have a time frame for responding.", "RCRA also authorizes EPA to issue administrative orders, among other  things, in cases where handling, treatment, or storage of hazardous or  solid waste may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to  health or the environment. EPA has used RCRA\u2019s imminent and  substantial endangerment authorities related to oil and gas well sites. For  example, EPA Region 8 issued RCRA imminent and substantial  endangerment orders to operators in Wyoming after discovering that pits  near oil production sites were covered with oil and posed a hazard to  birds.", "For more details about RCRA, please see appendix V.", "Congress passed CERCLA in 1980 to protect public health and the  environment by addressing the cleanup of hazardous substance  releases. CERCLA establishes a system governing the reporting and  cleanup of releases of hazardous substances and provides the federal  government the authority to respond to actual and threatened releases of  hazardous substances, pollutants, and contaminants that may endanger  public health and the environment. CERCLA requires operators of oil and  gas sites to report certain releases of hazardous substances and gives  EPA authority to respond to certain releases but excludes releases of  petroleum (e.g., crude oil and other petroleum products) from these  provisions. As previously discussed, releases of petroleum products are  covered by CWA if the release threatens U.S. navigable waters or  adjoining shorelines. EPA officials identified some instances of petroleum  spills in dry areas that did not reach surface waters and explained that  EPA had no role related to the investigation or cleanup of these incidents.  We identified regulatory provisions in five of six states requiring cleanup  of oil spills even if they do not reach surface waters.", "For hazardous substances, CERCLA has two key elements relevant for  the unconventional oil and gas industry: release reporting and EPA\u2019s  investigative and response authority. Similar to the requirements to report  oil spills under CWA, CERCLA requires operators to report releases of  hazardous substances above reportable quantities to the National  Response Center. The National Response Center shares information  about spills with other agencies, including EPA Regional offices, which  allows EPA the opportunity to follow up on reported spills. EPA also has  investigative and response authority under CERCLA, including provisions  allowing EPA broad access to information and the authority to enter  property to conduct an investigation or a removal of contaminated  material. EPA has the following authorities, among others:  Investigative. EPA may conduct investigations\u2014including activities  such as monitoring, surveying, and testing\u2014in response to actual or  threatened releases of hazardous substances or pollutants or  contaminants. EPA can also require persons to provide information  about alleged releases or threat of release. EPA officials described  several instances in which the agency used CERCLA\u2019s investigative  and information gathering authorities relating to alleged hazardous  substance releases from oil and gas well sites. For example, EPA  used CERCLA authority to investigate private water well  contamination potentially related to nearby shale gas well sites in  Dimock, Pennsylvania. In addition, EPA is currently using the same  authority to investigate private water well contamination potentially  related to tight sandstone well sites in Pavillion, Wyoming.", "Response. EPA has the authority to respond to releases of hazardous  substances itself and to issue administrative orders requiring a  company potentially responsible for a release of hazardous  substances, which may pose an imminent and substantial  endangerment, to take response actions, as well as to seek relief in a  federal court. EPA officials could not provide a recent example where  the agency used this authority to issue an administrative order at a  well site, but EPA used the response authority to conduct sampling  and to provide temporary drinking water to residents with  contaminated wells in Dimock, Pennsylvania.", "For more details about CERCLA, please see appendix VI.", "Among other things, EPCRA provides individuals and their communities  with access to information regarding storage or release of certain  chemicals in their communities. Two provisions of EPCRA\u2014release  notification and chemical storage reporting\u2014apply to oil and gas well  sites. The release notification provisions require companies that produce,  use, or store certain chemicals to notify state and local emergency  planning authorities of certain releases that would affect the community.  Spills that are strictly on-site would not have to be reported under EPCRA  but may still have to be reported to the National Response Center under  provisions of CWA or CERCLA. In addition, companies would have to  comply with EPCRA\u2019s chemical storage reporting provisions, which  require facilities storing or using hazardous or extremely hazardous  chemicals over certain thresholds to submit an annual inventory report  including detailed chemical information to state and local emergency  planning authorities and the local fire department. When asked whether  oil and gas well sites would commonly trigger EPCRA\u2019s release  notification and chemical storage reporting requirements, EPA officials  said these requirements could be triggered at every well site.", "EPCRA also established the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI)\u2013\u2013a publicly  available database containing information about chemical releases from  more than 20,000 industrial facilities\u2013\u2013but EPA regulations for the TRI do  not require oil and gas well sites to report to TRI. Specifically, these  provisions of EPCRA generally require certain facilities that manufacture,  process, or otherwise use any of more than 600 listed chemicals to report  annually to EPA and their respective states on chemicals used above  threshold quantities; the amounts released to the environment; and  whether they were released into the air, water, or soil. EPCRA specified  certain industries subject to the reporting requirement\u2014which did not  include oil and gas exploration and development\u2014and also provided  authority for EPA to add or delete industries going forward. EPA issued  regulations to implement the TRI in 1988 and chose not to change the list  of industries subject to the provision at that time. In 1997, EPA  promulgated a rule adding seven industry groups to the list of industries  required to report releases to the TRI, including coal mining and electrical  utilities that combust coal and/or oil. In developing the 1997 rule, EPA  considered including oil and gas exploration and production but did not do  so because, according to EPA\u2019s notice in the Federal Register for the final  rule, there were concerns about how \u201cfacility\u201d would be defined for this  industry. At that time, EPA\u2019s stated rationale was that the oil and gas  exploration and production industry is unique in that it may have related  activities over a large geographic area and, while together these activities  may involved the management of chemicals regulated by the TRI  program, taken at the smallest unit\u2014an individual well\u2014the chemical and  other thresholds are unlikely to be met. According to EPA officials, EPA  is in the preproposal stage of developing a new rule to add additional  industrial sectors into the TRI program but is not planning to include the  oil and gas exploration and production industry. EPA officials said that  adding oil and gas well sites would likely provide an incomplete picture of  the chemical uses and releases at these sites and would, therefore, be of  limited utility in providing information to communities.", "For more details about EPCRA, please see appendix VII.", "TSCA authorizes EPA to regulate the manufacture, processing, use,  distribution in commerce, and disposal of chemical substances and  mixtures. TSCA provides EPA with several authorities by which EPA  may assess and manage chemical risks, including the authority to (1)  collect information about chemical substances, (2) require companies to  conduct testing on chemical substances, and (3) take action to protect  adequately against unreasonable risks. TSCA allows chemical  companies to assert confidentiality claims on information provided to  EPA; if the information provided meets certain criteria, EPA must protect  it from disclosure to the public.", "EPA maintains a list of chemicals that are or have been manufactured or  processed in the United States, called the TSCA inventory. Of the over  84,000 chemicals currently in the TSCA inventory, about 62,000 were  already in commerce when EPA began reviewing chemicals in 1979.  Since then, EPA has reviewed more than 45,000 new chemicals, of which  approximately 20,000 were added to the inventory after chemical  companies began manufacturing them. As part of EPA\u2019s Study on the  Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing on Drinking Water Resources,  EPA is currently analyzing information provided by nine hydraulic  fracturing service companies, including a list of chemicals used in  hydraulic fracturing operations. EPA officials said that they expect most of  the chemicals disclosed by the service companies to appear on the TSCA  inventory list, provided that chemicals are not classified solely as  pesticides. EPA officials do not expect to be able to compare the list of  chemicals provided by the nine hydraulic fracturing service companies to  the TSCA inventory until the release of a draft report of the Study on the  Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing on Drinking Water Resources  for peer review, expected in late 2014.", "In August 2011, EPA received a petition from the environmental group  Earthjustice and 114 others asking the agency to exercise TSCA  authorities and issue rules to require manufacturers and processors of  chemicals used in oil and gas exploration and production to develop and  provide certain information to EPA. According to the petition, EPA and  the public currently lack adequate information about the health and  environmental effects of chemicals used in oil and gas exploration and  production, and EPA should exercise its TSCA authorities to ensure that  chemicals used in oil and gas exploration and production do not present  an unreasonable risk of harm to health and the environment. In a letter to  the petitioners, EPA granted the petition in part, stating there is value in  beginning a rulemaking process under TSCA to obtain data on chemical  substances used in hydraulic fracturing. EPA\u2019s letter also stated that the  TSCA proposal would focus on providing an aggregate picture of the  chemical substances used in hydraulic fracturing, which would  complement and not duplicate well-by-well disclosure programs that exist  in some states. The letter also indicates that the agency is drafting an  Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on this issue. As of August 31,  2012, EPA has not released a publication date for this proposed  rulemaking. EPA also intends to convene a stakeholder process to gather  additional information for use in developing a proposed rule.", "For more details about TSCA, please see appendix VIII.", "FIFRA, as amended, mandates that EPA administer pesticide registration  requirements and authorizes EPA to regulate the use, sale, and  distribution of pesticides to protect human health and preserve the  environment. FIFRA requires that EPA register new pesticides;  pesticide registration is a very specific process that is not valid for all uses  of a particular chemical. Instead, each registration describes the chemical  and its intended use (i.e., the crops/sites on which it may be applied), and  each use must be supported by research data. According to EPA officials,  some pesticides registered under FIFRA are used in hydraulic fracturing,  and EPA has approved registrations of some pesticides for this purpose.  According to a report about shale gas development by the Ground Water  Protection Council, operators may use pesticides to kill bacteria or other  organisms that may interfere with the hydraulic fracturing process. For  example, glutaraldehyde may be used by operators to eliminate bacteria  that produce byproducts that cause corrosion inside the well and was  reregistered for this purpose by EPA in 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Exemptions Are Related to Preventive Programs", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, in six of the eight federal environmental and public  health laws identified, there are exemptions or limitations in regulatory  coverage related to the oil and gas exploration and production industry  (there are two exemptions related to CAA). All of these exemptions are  related to programs designed to prevent pollution (see table 2). For  example, under CWA, EPA generally requires permits for stormwater  discharges at construction sites, which prevents sediment from entering  nearby streams. However, the Water Quality Act of 1987 and Energy  Policy Act of 2005 largely exempted the oil and gas exploration and  production sector from these stormwater permitting requirements. Four of  the exemptions are statutory (related to SDWA, CWA, CAA, and  CERCLA), and three are related to regulatory decisions made by EPA  (related to CAA, RCRA, and EPCRA). States may have regulatory  programs related to some of these exemptions or limitations in federal  regulatory coverage. For example, although oil and gas exploration and  production wastes are not regulated under RCRA as hazardous, which  reduces the federal role in management of such wastes, they are  nonetheless solid wastes. State regulations may govern management of  solid waste, and certain EPA regulations address minimum requirements  for how solid waste disposal facilities should be designed and operated.", "The exemptions do not limit the authorities EPA has under federal  environmental and public health laws to respond to environmental  contamination. Table 3 lists EPA authorities that may be applicable when  conditions or events at a well site present particular risk to the  environment or human health. As noted throughout this report, EPA has  used several of these authorities at oil and gas wells. For example, as  discussed above, EPA Region 8 has used RCRA\u2019s imminent and  substantial endangerment authorities to issue RCRA imminent and  substantial endangerment orders to operators in Wyoming after  discovering that pits near oil production sites were covered with oil and  posed a hazard to birds. Similarly, as discussed above, EPA is using  CERCLA\u2019s response authority to investigate private water well  contamination in Pavillion, Wyoming.", "Whether an authority is available depends on requisite conditions being  met in a given instance. EPA officials said that, in some instances,  response authorities of multiple federal environmental laws could be used  to address a threat to public health or the environment. In 2001, EPA and  the Department of Justice developed a memo advocating that officials  consider the specifics of a situation and use the most appropriate  authority. See appendixes II through VI for a more detailed discussion of  these authorities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "States in Our Review Implement Additional Requirements and Recently Updated Some Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The six states in our review implement additional requirements governing  a number of activities associated with oil and gas development.

State requirements  often do not explicitly differentiate between conventional and  unconventional development but, in recent years, states have begun to  promulgate some requirements that apply specifically to unconventional  development. States have regulatory requirements related to a variety of  activities involved in developing unconventional reservoirs, including  siting and site preparation; drilling, casing, and cementing; hydraulic  fracturing; well plugging; site reclamation; waste management and  disposal; and managing air emissions. Table 4 compares selected state  requirements and related federal environmental and public health  requirements; a more comprehensive table is available in appendix X.  Several studies noted that development practices and state requirements  may vary based on a number of factors, including geology, climate, and  the type of resource being developed. We did not assess whether all  requirements are appropriate for all states as part of this review.", "All six states we reviewed have state requirements regarding site  selection and preparation, though the specifics of their requirements vary.  Specifically, states have requirements for baseline testing of water wells,  required setbacks from water sources, and stormwater management,  among others. For example, three of the six states\u2014Colorado, Ohio, and  Pennsylvania\u2014have requirements that encourage or require operators to  conduct baseline water testing in certain cases. Colorado requires testing  of certain nearby wells when a proposed coalbed methane well is located  within a quarter-mile of a conventional gas well or a plugged and  abandoned well. In Ohio, baseline water well sampling is required within  1,500 feet of any proposed horizontal well or within 300 feet of any kind of  well proposed in an urban area. Pennsylvania does not require baseline  testing, but state law presumes operators to be liable for any pollution of  water wells within 2,500 feet of an unconventional well that occurs within  12 months of drilling activities, including hydraulic fracturing. Operators  in Pennsylvania can defend against this presumption if they have  predrilling tests conducted by an independent certified laboratory showing  that the pollution predated drilling. State regulators in Pennsylvania said  that nearly all companies in Pennsylvania conduct baseline testing of  nearby water wells, in many cases up to 4,000 feet from the drilling site.", "Five of the six states\u2014Colorado, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and  Wyoming\u2014we reviewed have requirements related to setbacks for well  sites or equipment from certain water sources. For example, in Ohio, oil  and gas wells and associated storage tanks generally may not be within 50  feet of a stream, river, or other body of water. In Pennsylvania,  unconventional wells may not be drilled within 500 feet of water wells  without written owner consent unless the operator cannot otherwise access  its mineral rights and demonstrates that additional protective measures will  be utilized. In Pennsylvania, there are also setbacks from public water  supplies and certain other bodies of water such as springs and wetlands.", "Oil and gas operations are generally not subject to certain stormwater  permitting requirements under the Clean Water Act, but four of the six  states we contacted\u2014Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and  Wyoming\u2014have their own stormwater permitting requirements. For  example, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality requires  permit coverage for stormwater discharges from all construction activities  disturbing 1 or more acres. These permits require the operator to develop  a stormwater management program, including best management  practices, that can be reviewed by the Wyoming Department of  Environmental Quality. In North Dakota, operators must obtain a permit  for construction activities that disturb 5 or more acres, and state officials  said that nearly all oil and gas drilling projects meet this threshold. This  permit also requires the operator to develop a stormwater management  program and implement best management practices for managing  stormwater, such as using straw bales or dikes to manage water runoff.  We did not identify any stormwater permitting requirements for Ohio and  Texas, but their state regulations address stormwater in other ways. For  example, operators in Ohio are required to comply with the state\u2019s best  management practices during construction, such as design guidelines for  constructing access roads. Texas regulations prohibit operators from  causing or allowing pollution of surface water and encourage operators to  implement best management practices to minimize discharges, including  discharges of sediment during storm events.", "States have additional requirements relating to erosion control, site  preparation, and surface disturbance minimization. For more details about  state siting and site preparation requirements, see appendix IX.", "All of the six states in our review have requirements related to how wells  are to be drilled and casing should be installed and cemented in place,  though the specifics of their requirements vary. For example, states have  different requirements regarding how deep operators must run surface  casing to protect groundwater. In Pennsylvania, operators are required to  run surface casing approximately 50 feet below the deepest fresh  groundwater or at least 50 feet into consolidated rock, whichever is  deeper. Generally, the surface casing may not be set more than 200 feet  below the deepest fresh groundwater unless necessary to set the casing  in consolidated rock. Different casing and cementing requirements apply  in Pennsylvania when drilling through coal formations, which state  regulators said is common in the southwest part of the state. In Texas,  operators are required to run surface casing to protect all usable quality  water, as defined by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  The depth of the surface casing may be specified in a letter by the  commission or in rules specific to a particular oil or gas field, which  account for local considerations. In no case may surface casing be set  deeper than 200 feet below the specified depth without prior approval  from the Texas Railroad Commission, the oil and gas regulator in Texas.  Operators in Wyoming are generally required to run surface casing to  reach a depth below all known or reasonably estimated usable  groundwater as defined in regulations and generally 100 to 120 feet  below certain permitted water supply wells within a quarter-mile, but  certain coalbed methane wells are exempt from these requirements. Until  2012, Ohio did not specify a depth to which surface casing was required  to be set but according to state regulators, the depth of the casing used to  protect groundwater was dictated through the permitting process, and  regulators and operators were generally following the same casing and  cementing requirements for unconventional wells as they would for Class  II UIC wells. Ohio adopted new regulations effective August 2012 that  generally require operators to run surface casing at least 50 feet below  the base of the deepest underground source of drinking water or at least  50 feet into bedrock, whichever is deeper.", "Among the six states we contacted, North Dakota and Ohio are the only  states with specific casing and cementing provisions for horizontal wells.  However, all six states have some requirements\u2014whether through law,  regulation, or the permitting process\u2014that generally require operators to  provide regulatory officials with information about the vertical and  horizontal drilling paths. For example, an application for a permit to drill a  horizontal well in Wyoming must include information about the vertical  and horizontal paths of the well, and operators must provide notice to  owners within a half-mile of any point on the entire length of the well. In  addition, operators must (1) provide notification and obtain approval from  the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission before beginning  horizontal drilling and (2) file a description of the exact path of the well,  known as a directional survey, within 30 days of well completion. North  Dakota requires a different permit to drill a horizontal well than it does for  a vertical well, and the horizontal permit contains information about the  horizontal path of the well.", "For more details about state drilling, casing, and cementing requirements,  see appendix IX.", "All six states we reviewed have requirements for disclosing the chemicals  used in hydraulic fracturing, but the specific requirements vary (see table  5). Four states\u2014Colorado, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Texas\u2014 require disclosure through the website FracFocus, which is a joint project  of the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas  Compact Commission. For example, operators that perform hydraulic  fracturing in Texas are required to upload certain information to the  website FracFocus within 30 days after completion of the well or 90 days  after the drilling operation is completed, whichever is earlier. Information  required to be uploaded to FracFocus includes, among other things, the  operator\u2019s name; the date of completion of hydraulic fracturing; the well  location; the total volume of water used to conduct fracturing; and  chemicals used, including their trade names, suppliers, intended use, and  concentration. In Ohio, companies have options as to how to disclose  information, including through FracFocus. Wyoming\u2019s chemical disclosure  requirements were developed prior to the development of FracFocus, and  the state does not require operators to disclose information through the  website. Among the six states we contacted, Wyoming is the only state  that requires operators to disclose certain chemical information prior to  conducting hydraulic fracturing. Specifically, as part of their application for  permit to drill, operators are required to submit information on the  chemicals proposed to be used during hydraulic fracturing.", "Five of the six states\u2014Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, and  Wyoming\u2014have specific provisions for protecting information on  hydraulic fracturing fluids that is claimed as confidential business  information or trade secrets. Four of the six states\u2014Colorado, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, and Texas\u2014specifically require that the information must  be provided to health professionals for diagnosis or treatment and to  certain officials responding to a spill or a release. For example, in Texas,  if an operator claims that a chemical is subject to trade secret protection,  the chemical family or other similar description must generally be  provided. Operators in Texas may not withhold information, including  trade secrets, about chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing from  health professionals or emergency responders who need the information  for diagnostic, treatment, or other emergency response purposes, but  health professionals and emergency responders must hold the  information confidential except as required for sharing with other health  professionals, emergency responders, or accredited laboratories for  diagnostic or treatment purposes. Texas\u2019 regulations also allow for certain  entities\u2014including the owner of the land on which the well is located, an  adjacent landowner, and relevant state agencies\u2014to challenge a claim to  trade secret protection.", "Five of the six states\u2014Colorado, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and  Wyoming\u2014have additional requirements specifically related to hydraulic  fracturing. For example, Colorado, North Dakota, Ohio, and Wyoming  require operators to continuously monitor certain pressure readings  during hydraulic fracturing and to notify the state if pressure exceeds a  certain threshold. Ohio also requires the suspension of operations when  anticipated pressures are exceeded. North Dakota has mechanical  integrity requirements specific to hydraulic fracturing, including  requirements for specific types of casing, valves, and other equipment,  which vary based on different fracturing scenarios. In addition, Colorado,  Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming require operators to notify state  regulators prior to conducting hydraulic fracturing, which provides state  regulators the opportunity to conduct inspections during the hydraulic  fracturing. Colorado requires notice 48 hours prior to conducting hydraulic  fracturing, and Ohio and Pennsylvania require notice 24 hours prior.  Wyoming does not require a specific period of notice. In Wyoming,  benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX compounds) and  petroleum distillates may only be used for hydraulic fracturing with prior  authorization from state oil and gas regulators. Pennsylvania law requires  blowout preventers to be used when drilling into an unconventional  formation.", "For more details about state hydraulic fracturing requirements, see  appendix IX.", "All six states in our review have requirements regarding well plugging,  such as notifying the state prior to plugging or using specific materials or  methods to do so. For example, operators in Colorado must obtain prior  approval from state regulators for the plugging method and provide notice  of the estimated time and date of plugging. Colorado regulations specify  that the material used for plugging must be placed in the well in a manner  that permanently prevents migration of oil, gas, water, or other  substances out of the formation in which it originated. Cement plugs must  be a minimum of 50 feet in length and must extend a minimum of 50 feet  above each zone to be protected. After plugging the well, operators must  submit reports of plugging and abandonment to the Colorado Oil and Gas  Conservation Commission and include information specifying the fluid  used to fill the wellbore, information about the cement used, date of work,  and depth of plugs. In Pennsylvania, operators must follow (1) specific  provisions for well plugging based on whether the well is located in a coal  area or noncoal area or (2) an alternate approved method. Prior to  plugging a well in an area underlain by a workable coal seam, the oil and  gas operator must notify the state and the coal company to permit  representatives to be present at the plugging.", "In addition, all six states have programs to plug wells that were improperly  plugged and have been abandoned, though their level of activity varies.  For example, state regulators in Texas said that the primary objective of  their program, which began in 1983, is to plug abandoned oil and gas  wells that are causing pollution or threatening to cause pollution for which  a responsible operator does not exist; the responsible operator failed to  plug the well; or the responsible operator failed to otherwise bring the  wells into compliance. As of 2009, Texas state regulators had plugged  30,000 wells, and approximately 8,000 potentially abandoned wells  remained throughout the state. Officials stated, however, that many of  these abandoned wells may be re-used for development of previously  overlooked reservoirs. State regulators in North Dakota said that the  number of abandoned wells in the state is very low compared with other  states because the state was fairly late to oil and gas development\u2014with  major development starting in the 1950s\u2014and that the state had a good  tracking system in place during the early days of development. State  regulators in North Dakota used funds from its well plugging program to  plug two wells in the last year.", "For more details about state well plugging requirements, see appendix IX.", "All six states in our review have requirements for site reclamation, though  the extent of the requirements varies. Five states\u2014Colorado, Ohio, North  Dakota, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming\u2014have requirements both for  backfilling soil and for revegetating areas. For example, in Colorado, final  reclamation must generally be complete within 3 months of plugging a  well on crop land and within 12 months on noncrop land. Reclamation in  Colorado involves returning segregated soil horizons to their original  relative positions; returning crop land to its original contour; as near as  practicable, returning noncrop land to its original contour to achieve  erosion control and long-term stability; and adequately tilling to establish  a proper seedbed. In Wyoming, operators must begin reclamation within  1 year of permanent abandonment of a well or last use of a pit and in  accordance with the landowner\u2019s reasonable requests, or to resemble the  original vegetation and contour of adjoining lands. In addition, where  practical, topsoil must be stockpiled during construction for use in  reclamation. Texas has requirements for contouring soil, but we did not  identify requirements for revegetating the area.", "For more details about state site reclamation requirements, see   appendix IX.", "All six states in our review have some requirements regarding waste  management and disposal, though specific requirements and practices  vary across and within states. For example, regulators in Colorado said  that the method of waste disposal varies based on the geological  formation being exploited and the location of the production well. In some  parts of the state, they said that the produced water generated is very  salty and is therefore generally disposed of in a Class II UIC well. In  contrast, in the Raton Basin\u2014a coalbed methane formation near the  border with New Mexico\u2014the produced water is of sufficiently good  quality that much of it is discharged to surface waters, according to state  regulators.", "All six states we reviewed have requirements regarding the use of pits for  storage of produced water, drill cuttings, and other substances. For  example, in North Dakota, a lined pit may be temporarily used to retain  solids or fluids generated during activities including well completion, but  the contents of the pits must be removed within 72 hours after operations  have ceased and must be disposed of at an authorized facility.  Pennsylvania requires that certain pits be lined and requires the liners to  meet certain permeability, strength, thickness, and design standards; the  pit itself must also be constructed so that it will not tear the liner and can  bear the weight of the pit contents. In addition, Colorado and Wyoming  require pitless drilling systems (tanks) to be used in certain  circumstances. For example, Colorado requires pitless drilling systems for  produced water from new oil and gas wells within a specified distance of  certain drinking water supply areas, and Wyoming requires pitless drilling  systems in areas where groundwater is less than 20 feet below the  surface.", "Underground injection of produced water in Class II UIC wells is a  common method of disposal of produced water in five of the six states we  reviewed. For example, state regulators in Ohio said that there are 177  Class II UIC disposal wells currently in operation, and 98 percent of the  fluid waste from oil and gas wells in Ohio is disposed of in these Class II  UIC wells. As noted previously, five out of the six states we reviewed  have primary responsibility for regulating injection wells, whereas EPA  implements the program in Pennsylvania. The five states in our review  that have been granted primacy for their Class II UIC programs obtained  it under the alternative provisions in which they demonstrate to EPA that  their program is effective in preventing endangerment of underground  sources of drinking water, in lieu of adopting all Class II UIC requirements  in EPA regulations. All states have requirements for Class II UIC wells  relating to casing and cementing, operating pressure, mechanical integrity  testing, well plugging, and the monitoring and reporting of certain  information, among other requirements. For example, North Dakota  requires the operators of all new Class II UIC wells to demonstrate the  mechanical integrity of the well and requires existing Class II UIC wells to  demonstrate continued mechanical integrity at least once every 5 years.  In North Dakota, mechanical integrity is demonstrated by showing that  there is no significant leak in, for example, the casing; and there is no  significant fluid movement into an underground source of drinking water  through vertical channels adjacent to the injection well. Texas also  requires operators to demonstrate the mechanical integrity of Class II UIC  wells generally by conducting specified pressure tests before  commencing injection, after conducting maintenance, and every 5 years.  With regard to monitoring and reporting, Ohio requires operators to  monitor injection pressures and volumes for each disposal well on a daily  basis and to report annually on maximum and monthly average pressure  and volumes.", "Aside from underground injection, there are several other options for  disposal of produced water, though the specifics vary across and within  states. For example, regulatory agencies issue NPDES permits in  Colorado, Texas, and Wyoming for direct discharges to surface waters in  certain cases; in doing so, the states must apply, where applicable,  EPA\u2019s effluent limitations guidelines discussed above. According to state  regulators in Wyoming, the state has about 1,000 currently active permits  for discharges of produced water from coalbed methane formations and  500 permits for produced water from conventional formations. In contrast,  state regulators in North Dakota said that there are no direct surface  discharges of produced water in their state because the produced water  is too salty.", "Some states, such as Colorado and Pennsylvania, also have commercial  facilities, which treat produced water before discharging it to surface  waters. In addition, disposal to a POTW is an option in Ohio and  Pennsylvania, but there have been some recent efforts to restrict such  disposal. One concern regarding disposal to POTWs is that these  facilities may not have the technology necessary to remove key  pollutants, including total dissolved solids, from the waste stream. In  2010, Ohio\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) approved a  permit modification that allowed a POTW in Warren, Ohio, to accept  100,000 gallons per day of produced water with concentrations of less  than 50,000 milligrams per liter of total dissolved solids, which was then  diluted and discharged to surface waters. However, the Director of  OEPA subsequently issued a determination in 2011 that the permit had  been unlawfully issued because Ohio law does not generally permit the  disposal of produced water through a POTW. In response, OEPA did  not reauthorize the POTW to accept produced water when its NPDES  permit came up for renewal in 2012. In July 2012, however, OEPA\u2019s  decision was reversed by an administrative review commission, which  held that the matter was outside of OEPA\u2019s jurisdiction. Instead, the  power to prohibit disposal to a POTW lies with the Ohio Department of  Natural Resources. Accordingly, the commission removed the NPDES  permit\u2019s prohibition on accepting produced water. Prior to 2011, POTWs  in Pennsylvania also accepted produced water from oil and gas well sites.  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued  administrative orders to POTWs in Pennsylvania requiring, among other  things, that the POTWs restrict the volume of oil and gas wastewater they  were accepting, evaluate the impacts of oil and gas wastewaters on their  treatment process, and submit certain samples of oil and gas wastewater  accepted for treatment. In addition, the state of Pennsylvania requested  that operators of Marcellus shale gas wells stop delivering produced  water to POTWs and began revising the POTWs\u2019 NPDES permits. State  officials later reported that POTWs in Pennsylvania were no longer  accepting produced water from the Marcellus shale, and EPA Regional  officials said that they believe that POTWs are accepting less produced  water.", "In addition to permanent disposal of produced water, all six states in our  review allow for recycling or other reuses of produced water. For  example, according to a 2011 report, over 50 percent of the produced  water in Colorado is recycled. In addition, state regulators in  Pennsylvania said that the best option for dealing with produced water in  the state is recycling, and the Department of Environmental Protection  can track what percentage of recycled water was used in hydraulic  fracturing based on information required on well completion reports.  Approximately 90 percent of produced water in Pennsylvania is recycled,  according to state regulators. The Texas Railroad Commission has  approved several recycling projects in the Barnett Shale to reduce the  amount of fresh water used in development activities there. Four of the  six states\u2014Colorado, North Dakota, Ohio, and Wyoming\u2014also allow  operators to reuse certain types of fluid waste for road applications. For  example, in Ohio, produced water, excluding flowback from hydraulic  fracturing, may be used for dust and ice suppression on roads with the  approval of local governments; approximately 1 percent of produced  water is used in this way. In Wyoming, road and land applications may be  permitted as reuses of produced water. North Dakota allows road but not  land application of produced water.", "Regulatory agencies in all six states implement requirements for the  disposal of waste such as drill cuttings. For example, in Colorado, drill  cuttings may be buried in pits at the well site, an activity which is regulated  by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. Drill cuttings taken  off site for disposal at a commercial waste facility must comply with the  regulations of the state\u2019s Department of Public Health and Environment that  govern those facilities. Texas allows drill cuttings to be landfarmed on the  well site where they were generated with the written permission of the  surface owner of the site if they were obtained using drilling fluids with a  chloride concentration of 3,000 milligrams per liter or less. Texas allows  on-site burial of drill cuttings that were obtained using drilling fluids with a  chloride concentration in excess of 3,000 milligrams per liter. In North  Dakota, operators frequently bury drill cuttings on-site where the North  Dakota Industrial Commission\u2019s Oil and Gas Division has authority, but, in  some cases, the drill cuttings may be disposed of at a landfill under the  jurisdiction of the Department of Health due to shallow groundwater or  permeable subsoil.", "As discussed earlier in this report, officials in the six states we reviewed  were not aware of any oil or gas well sites that would be regulated as  small-quantity generators of hazardous waste under RCRA. Pursuant to  RCRA, regulation of waste that is not considered hazardous is largely a  state responsibility. Some states have special categories of waste and  associated additional requirements that apply to industrial wastes  generally, or oil and gas wastes specifically. For example, waste from  crude oil and natural gas exploration and production in North Dakota is  called special waste. Special waste landfills must be permitted and  comply with specific design standards. Currently, there are four special  waste landfills in North Dakota with another five proposed special waste  landfills at the beginning stages of the permitting process. State  regulators said that special waste consists mostly of drill cuttings but can  also include other things such as contaminated soil. In Pennsylvania, oil  and gas waste falls into a category of waste called residual waste that  applies to, among other things, certain wastes from industrial, mining, or  agricultural operations. Residual waste disposal must be permitted and is  subject to processing and storage rules.", "All six states in our review have requirements for managing and disposing  of wastes, such as oilfield equipment, drilling solids, and produced water  that have been exposed to or contaminated with naturally-occurring  radioactive material (NORM) or technologically-enhanced NORM.occurs naturally in some geologic formations that also contain oil or gas  and when NORM is brought to the surface during drilling and production, it  remains in drill cuttings and produced water and, under certain conditions,  creates scales or deposits on pipes or other oilfield equipment. Officials at  the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said that they  set tiers for how to manage materials that contain NORM based on their  level of radioactivity. In addition, they said that the department is working  with the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to require  operators to perform certain tests on produced water before allowing  produced water to be used for road application. Texas officials said that the  state requires operators to identify NORM-contaminated equipment with  the letters \u201cNORM\u201d by securely attaching a clearly visible waterproof tag or  marking with a legible waterproof paint or ink. In addition, Texas requires  operators to dispose of oil and gas NORM waste by methods that are  specifically authorized by rule or specifically permitted. State regulators in  Wyoming said that a lot of NPDES permits for direct discharges to surface  waters have limits on radioactivity that would probably lead the operator to  dispose of produced water contaminated with NORM in a Class II UIC well.", "For more details about states waste management and disposal  requirements, see appendix IX.", "Five of the six states we reviewed have permitting or registration  requirements for managing air emissions from oil and gas production  sites. In addition, all six states have requirements related to venting and  flaring of gas and limiting or managing emissions of hydrogen sulfide\u2014a  hazardous and deadly gas\u2014at drilling sites.", "Five of the six states we reviewed \u2014Colorado, North Dakota, Ohio,  Texas, and Wyoming\u2014have developed permitting or registration  requirements that apply to oil and gas development. For example,  according to state regulators, the vast majority of production wells in  Colorado require air permits. Operators with certain condensate tanks  and tank batteries are required to obtain a permit if the tanks have  uncontrolled actual emissions of volatile organic compounds greater than  or equal to 2 tons per year in areas which are not attaining certain air  quality standards (nonattainment areas) or greater than or equal to 5 tons  per year in an attainment area. As part of the permit requirements,  operators in nonattainment areas must reduce emissions of volatile  organic compounds by 90 percent from uncontrolled actual emissions  during certain times of the year, and by 70 percent during other times,  and reduce emissions by 90 percent for dehydration systems. In Ohio, an  operator meeting certain requirements must obtain an air permit that lists  each source of emissions; all applicable rules that apply to the sources,  including federal and state requirements; operational restrictions;  monitoring; recordkeeping; reporting; and testing requirements. Wyoming  officials noted that oil and gas facilities are subject to general state  permitting requirements but did not identify any permitting requirements  specific to air emissions from oil and gas development. In Wyoming, state  regulators have worked with industry to achieve voluntary reductions from  mobile sources in certain parts of the state that may soon not meet air  quality standards for ozone. Specifically, officials at the Wyoming  Department of Environmental Quality said that they have asked operators  in certain areas to agree to implement voluntary reductions in volatile  organic compounds and nitrogen oxides and to install controls on diesel  engines on mobile drilling rigs; regulators then include these requirements  in the air permit issued to the operator. North Dakota and Texas also  have permitting or registration requirements, and Pennsylvania is in the  process of developing an inventory for oil and gas emissions information.", "All six states have some requirements for flaring excess gas encountered  during drilling and production, which may otherwise pose safety hazards  and contribute to emissions. For example, operators in Pennsylvania who  encounter excess gas during drilling or hydraulic fracturing must capture  the excess gas, flare it, or divert it away from the drilling rig in a manner  that does not create a hazard to public health and safety. According to  state regulators in Wyoming, the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission  has jurisdiction for flaring prior to production when the primary concern  with flaring is safety. For flaring that occurs after production has begun,  the Department of Environmental Quality requires 98 percent combustion  efficiency.", "All six states have safety requirements to limit and manage emissions of  hydrogen sulfide\u2014a hazardous and deadly gas\u2014at drilling sites. For  example, in Texas, operators are subject to detailed requirements in  areas where exposure to hydrogen sulfide could exceed a certain  threshold if a release occurred, taking into consideration whether the area  of potential exposure includes any public areas such as roads.  Requirements relate to posting warning signs, using fencing, maintaining  protective breathing equipment at the well site, installing a flare line and a  suitable method for lighting the flare, and conducting training. In some  cases, hydrogen sulfide requirements overlap with flaring requirements.  For example, flares used for treating gas containing hydrogen sulfide in  North Dakota must be equipped and operated with an automatic ignitor or  a continuous burning pilot, which must be maintained in good working  order, including flares that are used for emergency purposes only.", "For more details about state requirements for managing air emissions,  see appendix IX."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regional Commission Implements Additional Requirements", "paragraphs": ["One of the states in our review\u2014Pennsylvania\u2014is also part of a regional  commission that implements additional requirements governing several  aspects of natural gas development.

The commission regulates water quantity and quality  within the basin, which spans approximately 13,500 square miles.", "In December 2010, the Delaware River Basin Commission published draft  Natural Gas Development Regulations, which are currently under  consideration for adoption, and the commission will not issue any permits  for shale gas wells within the basin until the final regulations have been  adopted. The draft regulations propose a number of requirements related  to the protection of certain landscapes and waters and how to handle  wastewater generated by natural gas development. For example, the  proposed regulations require that produced water stored on the well pad  be kept in enclosed tanks. In addition, operators of treatment and/or  discharge facilities proposing to accept natural gas wastewater would be  required to provide the commission with information on the contents of  the proposed discharge and submit a study showing that the proposed  discharge could be adequately treated. Natural gas well operators would  also be required to have natural gas development plans for projects that  exceed certain thresholds for acreage or number of wells. According to  commission officials, the natural gas development plans would allow the  commission to consider the cumulative impacts of development from  numerous well pads, associated roads, and pipeline infrastructure, and to  minimize and mitigate disturbance on lands most critical to water  resources, such as core forests and steep slopes.

According to BLM officials, the APD is a  comprehensive plan for drilling and related activities, which is approved  by BLM. Prior to permit issuance for the proposed drilling activity, BLM is  required to document that needed reviews under NEPA have been  conducted. According to officials, at this step BLM conducts site-specific  NEPA analysis, often drawing on the previous NEPA analysis conducted  prior to the lease sale, but supplemented with more specifics about the  proposed well site and related facilities, such as access roads or  pipelines.

Forest Service officials  explained that the Forest Service evaluates the effects of the  development and, through negotiations with the operator, tries to reach  agreement on certain mitigation measures. Officials explained that these  mitigation measures are generally not as stringent or specific as  mitigation measures used on federal leases. In addition, Forest Service  officials explained that enforcement options are limited for environmental  damage from development of privately owned minerals. Generally, the  Forest Service can work with state oil and gas agencies to have them  enforce any relevant state requirements regarding surface impacts, or the  Forest Service can seek an injunction from the court to stop damaging  actions and then pursue possible damages or restitution via the court.  According to Forest Service officials, development of privately owned  minerals has been a particular challenge in the Alleghany National Forest  in Pennsylvania where privately owned minerals underlie more than 90  percent of the forest. Forest Service officials stated that there are  approximately 1,000 new wells drilled in this forest each year, most of  which are shallow conventional oil development.

FWS  officials said that, despite having minimal requirements for operators  drilling for privately owned minerals, they can use other federal authorities  and work with federal and state agencies to minimize or remediate injury  to FWS lands. For example, FWS worked with EPA to respond to a spill  of produced water into a stream on a National Wildlife Refuge in  Louisiana in 2005, in violation of CWA. EPA, the Coast Guard, and the  Department of Justice worked together on the case, and the operator  ultimately paid $425,000 to FWS for the two affected wildlife refuges.

The Park Service analyzes the  operator\u2019s proposed plan of operations to ensure that the proposed plan  complies with the 9B regulations. Also, in determining whether it can  approve an operation, the Park Service undertakes an environmental  analysis under NEPA. Once the Park Service approves the proposed plan  of operations, the operator can begin drilling. The Park Service continues  to have access to the site for monitoring and enforcement purposes.
