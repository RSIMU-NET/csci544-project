However, internal control deficiencies exist for, among other things, ensuring that only eligible applicants are approved to participate in the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program and receive transfers of excess controlled property. DLA is establishing memorandums of understanding with participating federal agencies intended to, among other things, establish general terms and conditions for participation, revise its program application to require additional prospective participant information, and plans to provide additional online training for participating agencies that is expected to begin in late 2017. However, GAO created a fictitious federal agency to conduct independent testing of the LESO program's internal controls and DLA's transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies.", "Through the testing, GAO gained access to the LESO program and obtained over 100 controlled items with an estimated value of $1.2 million, including night-vision goggles, simulated rifles, and simulated pipe bombs, which could be potentially lethal items if modified with commercially available items . GAO's testing identified that DLA has deficiencies in the processes for verification and approval of federal law enforcement agency applications and in the transfer of controlled property, such as DLA personnel not routinely requesting and verifying identification of individuals picking up controlled property or verifying the quantity of approved items prior to transfer. Further, GAO found that DLA has not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO program, including the application process. Without strengthening DLA and LESO program internal controls over the approval and transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies, such as reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, DLA lacks reasonable assurance that it has the ability to prevent, detect, and respond to potential fraud and minimize associated security risks.", "Examples of Controlled Property Items Obtained", "DLA maintains a public Internet site to address statutory requirements to provide information on all property transfers to law enforcement agencies. DLA's public Internet site shows all transferred property, and, as of April 2017, in response to GAO's findings, has included a definition of controlled property to distinguish for the general public what items are considered controlled."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today with my colleague, Wayne  McElrath, with whom I am jointly providing this statement. Today, we will  discuss our July 2017 report on the Department of Defense (DOD) Law  Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program, also known as the 1033  program in reference to the section of the law authorizing it. Under this  authority, DOD can transfer excess personal property to federal, state,  and local law enforcement agencies. The Defense Logistics Agency  (DLA) Disposition Services administers the LESO Program for DOD.", "Since 1991, DOD has reported transferring more than $6 billion worth of  its excess personal property to more than 8,600 federal, state, and local  law enforcement agencies. According to DOD, about 4 to 7 percent of the  total excess property transferred is controlled property, which typically  involves sensitive equipment and items that cannot be released to the  public. Examples of controlled items available include night-vision  goggles, thermal imaging equipment, specialized printers, and explosive  ordnance detonation robots, as well as certain high-visibility items, such  as small arms, High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs),  Mine\u2010Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicles (MRAPs), and aircraft. LESO  program data shows that during calendar years 2013 through 2015,  approximately $1.1 billion of excess controlled property was transferred to  federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Approximately two- thirds of the 388,000 DOD excess controlled property items had been  transferred to state and local agencies, and one-third had been  transferred to federal agencies.", "Over the past 15 years, we have examined DOD\u2019s excess property  reutilization program and reported deficiencies, including unauthorized  parties obtaining excess controlled property and internal control  breakdowns with regard to the security of sensitive excess military  equipment. We have made over 20 recommendations aimed at enhancing internal controls over DOD\u2019s disposal and accountability of its  excess property and improving the overall economy and efficiency of the  reutilization program. The department has implemented most of the  recommendations. Likewise, the DOD Office of Inspector General has  reported on internal control deficiencies, such as the distribution of  excess property to law enforcement agencies without the accountability  necessary to ensure that the released property had the proper  authorization. The Inspector General has made recommendations, which  the department has also implemented.", "Our testimony today summarizes key findings from our July 2017 report  on DOD excess property. Accordingly, our testimony addresses (1) how  federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies reported using and  benefiting from excess controlled property transferred to them through the  LESO program; and (2) the extent to which DLA has taken actions to  enhance processes, including internal controls, related to its transfers of  excess controlled property.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed DOD policies and procedures,  interviewed and surveyed cognizant officials, and conducted independent  testing of LESO\u2019s application and DLA\u2019s transfer process. Specifically, we  conducted a survey of 15 participating federal law enforcement agencies  as well as 53 state coordinators who had controlled property transferred  to their offices through the LESO program during calendar years 2013,  2014, and 2015 to gain an understanding of their use of the LESO  program. Also, we conducted non-generalizable case studies of five  states: Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, and Texas. We interviewed  federal, state, and local law enforcement officials in each of the selected  states to gain an understanding of how property is transferred to them,  including how they screen for, obtain, and dispose of DOD excess  controlled property.", "Additionally, our investigators created a fictitious federal agency to  conduct independent testing of the LESO program\u2019s internal controls and  DLA\u2019s transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies. We  also compared DLA and LESO practices to those identified in GAO\u2019s A  Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (hereafter  cited as the Fraud Risk Framework). Issued in July 2015, GAO\u2019s Fraud  Risk Framework is a comprehensive set of leading practices that serves  as a guide for program managers to use when developing efforts to  combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based manner. Further details on our  scope and methodology are included in our report. The work on which  this statement is based was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards and our investigative work was  performed in accordance with the Council of Inspector General on  Integrity and Efficiency standards for investigations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Law Enforcement Agencies Reported Various Uses and Benefits from the Transfer of the DOD Excess Controlled Property", "paragraphs": ["Federal law enforcement agencies and state coordinators in our survey\u2014 as well as officials we interviewed from federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies\u2014reported various uses of DOD excess controlled  property for law enforcement activities. The reported uses included  enhancing counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border-security activities.  Also, law enforcement agencies reported using DOD\u2019s excess controlled  property for other law enforcement activities, such as search and rescue,  natural disaster response, surveillance, reaching barricaded suspects,  police training, and the serving of warrants.", "Federal, state, and local agencies cited a number of ways in which they  had benefited from LESO program, with several reporting that the  transfers of controlled property allowed them to save money. For  example, a local law enforcement official in Texas reported that 96  percent of the department budget goes to salaries and that the LESO  program helped the department acquire items that it would otherwise not  be able to afford, saving the department an estimated $2 million to $3  million. Additionally, agencies provided examples of how property they  received through the LESO program have been used. For example, the  Bureau of Indian Affairs officials reported they have used vehicles to  support their Office of Justice Services\u2019 drug unit during marijuana  eradication and border operations by providing transport to agents over  inhospitable terrain in mountainous and desert environments. In another  example, Texas law enforcement officials reported that the San Marcos  and Hays County police departments used their issued Mine Resistant  Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles to rescue more than 600 stranded  people from floodwaters in October 2015. Moreover, the Los Angeles  County Sheriff\u2019s Department reported that it used a robot to remove a rifle  from an attempted murder suspect who had barricaded himself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DLA Has Taken Some Actions to Address Weaknesses in Its Excess Controlled Property Program, but Deficiencies Exist in Key Processes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DLA Actions to Address Weaknesses in LESO Program", "paragraphs": ["DLA has taken some steps to address previously identified weaknesses  in its processes for transferring and monitoring its excess controlled  property through revisions to its policy and procedures on the  management, oversight, and accountability of the LESO program. Such  revisions were made, in part, because of recommendations made by the  DOD and DLA Offices of Inspector General. The DOD and DLA Offices of  Inspector General conducted four audits of the LESO program between  2003 and 2013 that identified more than a dozen recommendations, such  as developing and implementing written standard operating procedures  for the approval and disapproval of law enforcement agency property  requests and issuance, transfer, turn-in and disposal of LESO property. In  our July 2017 report, we found the department had taken the following  actions to enhance its transfer process through revisions to policy and  procedures:  transitioned full management responsibility of the LESO Program to DLA Disposition Services in 2009; developed LESO Program Standard Operating Procedures in 2012 and updated them in 2013; transitioned to a new data system in 2013 after identifying that the old system was not capable of post-issue tracking;revised the DLA instruction that provides policy, responsibility, and procedures for DLA\u2019s management responsibilities of the LESO program in 2014 and 2016; and revised LESO program processes in 2016 to incorporate recommendations made by the Federal Interagency Law Enforcement Equipment Working Group, such as defining executive order controlled property or prohibiting schools K-12 from participating in the program.", "In addition, DLA is in the process of developing additional training on  LESO program policies and procedures, and is establishing  memorandums of understanding with federal law enforcement agencies  on the general terms and conditions of participating in the program,  including the restrictions on the transfer and sale of controlled property."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DLA Has Deficiencies in Its Processes for Verifying and Approving Applications and Transferring Property and Has Not Conducted a Risk Assessment", "paragraphs": ["We found weaknesses in three areas: (1) verifying and approving  applications, (2) transferring property, and (3) the assessment of risk.  First, our independent testing of the LESO program\u2019s internal controls  identified deficiencies in the processes for verification and approval of  federal law enforcement agency applications. Specifically, our  investigators posing as authorized federal law enforcement officials of a  fictitious agency applied and were granted access to the LESO program  in early 2017. In late 2016, we emailed our completed application to the  LESO program office. Our application contained fictitious information  including agency name, number of employees, point of contact, and  physical location. In early 2017, after revising our application at the  direction of LESO officials we were notified that our fictitious law  enforcement agency was approved to participate in the LESO program.  LESO officials also emailed us to request confirmation of our agency\u2019s  authorizing statute; in response, our investigators submitted fictitious  authorizing provisions as provisions in the U.S. Code. At no point during  the application process did LESO officials verbally contact officials at the  agency we created\u2014either the main point of contact listed on the  application or the designated point of contact at a headquarters\u2019 level\u2014to  verify the legitimacy of our application or to discuss establishing a  memorandum of understanding with our agency.", "DLA\u2019s internal controls for verifying and approving federal agency  applications and enrollment in the LESO program were not adequate to  prevent the approval of a fraudulent application to obtain excess  controlled property. Specifically, LESO\u2019s reliance on electronic  communications without actual verification does not allow it to properly  vet for potentially fraudulent activity. For example, DLA did not require  supervisory approval for all federal agency applications, or require  confirmation of the application with designated points of contact at the  headquarters of participating federal agencies. Additionally, at the time  we submitted our application, DLA officials did not visit the location of the  applying federal law enforcement agency to help verify the legitimacy of  the application. After our briefing of DLA officials in March 2017 on the  results of our investigative work, DLA officials stated they took immediate  action, and in April 2017 visited 13 participating federal law enforcement  agencies. However, at this time DLA has not reviewed and revised the  policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency  applications and enrollment in the LESO program.", "Second, our independent testing also identified deficiencies in the transfer  of controlled property, such as DLA personnel not routinely requesting  and verifying identification of individuals picking up controlled property or  verifying the quantity of approved items prior to transfer. Our  investigators, after being approved to participate in the LESO program,  obtained access to the department\u2019s online systems to view and request  controlled property. We subsequently submitted requests to obtain  controlled property, including non-lethal items and potentially-lethal items  if modified with commercially available items. In less than a week after  submitting the requests, our fictitious agency was approved for the  transfer of over 100 controlled property items with a total estimated value  of about $1.2 million. The estimated value of each item ranged from $277  to over $600,000, including items such as night-vision goggles, reflex  (also known as reflector) sights, infrared illuminators, simulated pipe  bombs, and simulated rifles. Our investigator scheduled appointments  and obtained the controlled property items, such as those shown in the  photos below.", "Using fictitious identification and law enforcement credentials, along with  the LESO-approved documentation, our investigator was able to pass  security checks and enter the DLA Disposition Service warehouse sites.  Personnel at two of the three sites did not request or check for valid  identification of our investigator picking up the property. According to DLA  guidance, direct pickup of allocated property may be made by an  individual with valid identification and the appropriate DOD authorization  form that is signed by the authorized individual listed in the letter.", "DLA has not taken steps to reasonably ensure that onsite officials  routinely request and verify valid identification of the individual(s)  authorized to pick up allocated property from the LESO program, as  required by the guidance. DLA officials acknowledged they could take  additional steps to ensure compliance with the requirements in the  handbook. Furthermore, although we were approved to receive over 100  items and the transfer documentation reflects this amount, we were  provided more items than we were approved to receive. The discrepancy  involved one type of item\u2014infrared illuminators. We requested 48 infrared  illuminators but onsite officials at one Disposition Services site provided  us with 51 infrared illuminators in 52 pouches, of which one pouch was  empty. Additionally, we found that one DLA Disposition Services site had  a checklist as a part of their transfer documentation for their personnel to  complete. The checklist required manual completion of several items,  including quantity, date, and who fulfilled the order. The other two DLA  Disposition Services sites, including the site that transferred the wrong  quantity, did not include this checklist with the transfer documentation we  received. DLA guidance states that accountability records be maintained  in auditable condition to allow property to be traced from receipt to final  disposition. We concluded that without guidance that specifically  requires DLA Disposition Services\u2019 on-site officials to verify the type and  quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred prior  to removal from the sites, DLA will lack reasonable assurance that the  approved items transferred are appropriately reflected in their inventory  records.", "Third, while DLA has taken some steps, mostly in early 2017, to address  identified deficiencies in the LESO program, DLA lacks a comprehensive  framework for instituting fraud prevention and mitigation measures.  During the course of our review, DLA revised the LESO program  applications by requiring applicants to sign an attestation that the agency  that they represent is a legitimate law enforcement agency. Further, DLA  officials stated they are more carefully reviewing the legitimacy of some  information on the application such as email addresses and physically  visiting federal agencies that enter into memorandums of understanding  with the LESO program.", "However, as previously discussed, we identified internal controls  weakness in the policy and procedures for verifying and approving federal  agency applications and enrollment as well as weakness throughout the  process from approval to the actual transfer of the items to the agencies,  which indicates that DLA has not examined potential risks for all stages of  the process. According to GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework, effective fraud  risk managers collect and analyze data on identified fraud schemes, use  these lessons learned to improve fraud risk management activities, and  plan and conduct fraud risk assessments that are tailored to their  programs. The framework states there is no universally accepted  approach for conducting fraud risk assessments since circumstances  among programs vary. However, per leading practices, assessing fraud  risks generally involves five actions: (1) identifying inherent fraud risks  affecting the program, (2) assessing the likelihood and effect of those  fraud risks, (3) determining fraud risk tolerance, (4) examining the  suitability of existing fraud controls and prioritizing residual fraud risks,  and (5) documenting the program\u2019s fraud risk profile.", "DLA has begun to examine some fraud risks associated with the LESO  program. However, DLA officials acknowledged during our March 2017  meeting that they have not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the  LESO program to include the application process, and as such, has not  designed or implemented a strategy with specific control activities to  mitigate risks to the program. We concluded that conducting such an  assessment could have program-wide improvements, including  strengthening the controls to verify the legitimacy of applicants.", "Overall, we concluded in our July 2017 report that DLA\u2019s internal controls  did not provide reasonable assurance in preventing fraud. Therefore, we  made four recommendations for DLA to:  review and revise policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment; ensure compliance that DLA Disposition Services on-site officials transferring controlled property verify that persons picking up items have valid identification and are authorized to pick up allocated property from the LESO program; issue guidance that requires DLA Disposition Services on-site officials to verify the type and quantity of approved items against the actual items being transferred prior to removal from the sites; and conduct a fraud risk assessment to design and implement a strategy with specific internal control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks.", "DOD concurred with all of our recommendations and highlighted actions  to address each one.", "Chairman Wilson, Ranking Member Bordallo, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes our prepared statement.
