For example, it is unclear what marketing activities are covered by Part 810. DOE has not provided written guidance to clarify the regulation's scope, instead directing exporters to inquire with DOE officials. DOE officials said that they do not document all such inquiries or their responses. Without such documentation, DOE can neither reasonably assure that its responses are consistent, nor can it analyze the inquiries to identify parts of the regulation that may need clarification. DOE is taking some steps to clarify Part 810 by defining or refining some key terms. However, DOE's revisions do not address all terms that exporters have identified as unclear, and the time frame of DOE's revisions is unknown.", "DOE has taken limited actions to enforce Part 810. DOE's primary method for monitoring compliance with Part 810 is reading reports from exporters, but according to DOE officials, they conduct in-depth analysis on less than 10 percent of reports and do not have a risk-based procedure for selecting reports to analyze. Also, because DOE does not provide guidance for companies to self-identify and self-report possible violations, DOE is missing an opportunity to leverage exporters' role in monitoring their own compliance. DOE has not yet determined whether it has the legal authority to impose civil penalties for violations of Part 810. According to DOE officials, DOE has never taken a formal action for a violation of Part 810, such as revoking an authorization or referring a potential violation to the Department of Justice (DOJ).

Seeking a balance between encouraging U.S. exports of  civilian nuclear products, services, and technology while ensuring they  are not used for foreign nuclear weapons programs has long been a  fundamental goal of U.S. policy. The U.S. nuclear industry faces  formidable competition abroad from foreign companies, some of which  receive strong financial and political support through direct government  ownership or subsidies. As we reported in 2010, the U.S. share of global  nuclear exports decreased during the period from 1994 through 2008.  U.S. nuclear companies have raised concerns that, compared with the  nuclear export control regimes of their major competitors\u2014in Russia,  Japan, South Korea, and France\u2014the U.S. regime is, in many respects,  more complex, restrictive, and time-consuming.", "In 2010, we found that U.S. industry representatives believed that certain  U.S. government policies and practices\u2014particularly the Department of  Energy\u2019s (DOE) authorization process under 10 C.F.R. Part 810\u2014 impeded the U.S. nuclear industry\u2019s ability to compete globally. Part 810  empowers the Secretary of Energy to authorize persons subject to the  jurisdiction of the United States to directly or indirectly engage in the  development or production of special nuclear material, which includes  plutonium, outside of the United States, upon a determination that the  activity will not be inimical to the national interest. Part 810 applies  broadly to commercial nuclear technology, assistance, and services  abroad because nuclear reactors fueled with uranium also produce  plutonium. Nuclear technology and assistance may include training and  services in support of commercial power reactors, as well as tangible  items such as manuals, blueprints, and software. Exports subject to Part  810 also include the transfer of technology to non-U.S. persons in civilian  U.S. nuclear facilities and universities.", "Exports with little or no proliferation or national security significance may  be generally authorized under Part 810, with no application required. For  example, the export of commercial nuclear power reactor technology may  be generally authorized unless intended for restricted countries or  nationals of those countries, to which any export of civilian nuclear  technology must be specifically authorized through an application to  DOE. Transactions with a more direct relationship to the production of  special nuclear material must always be specifically authorized through  an application to DOE, regardless of the countries involved. DOE\u2019s  procedures for approving specifically authorized exports include target  time frames, and the authorizations include conditions to hold the  exporter, importer, and importing government accountable for protecting  the technology and reducing the risk of proliferation. DOE data show that  the value of generally authorized transactions is currently in the range of  $2 billion to $3 billion per year, and the total value of specifically  authorized transactions since 2009 is at least $13.6 billion. According to  DOE officials and nuclear industry representatives, Part 810 applications  are typically the initial foray into a broader nuclear relationship with a  foreign partner company or foreign country.", "In 2010, we recommended that DOE review the Part 810 process and  develop guidelines to help clarify the types of technology, information,  and technical assistance that require a Part 810 authorization, among  other things. Clarity and consistency are among the key principles of  efficient regulation, according to two executive orders. DOE reviewed the  Part 810 process and, in August 2013, DOE issued a Supplemental  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, with the purpose of \u201cstriking a balance  to promote trade without increasing proliferation risk,\u201d by clarifying the  scope of the regulation, among other things. In this proposed rule, DOE  further noted that the goals of Part 810 were efficient regulation\u2014defined  by an efficient, timely, transparent, and predictable regulatory process;  effective nuclear trade support; and effective threat reduction by better  addressing proliferation challenges.", "In light of the international security and commercial implications of the  export of U.S. civilian nuclear technology, you asked us to examine the  Part 810 process.

According to DOE and State  officials, State\u2019s concurrence times depend on, among other things, the  responsiveness of the importing country in providing assurances of  peaceful use and no re-export without U.S. government consent. For  example, NNSA sent an application package for interagency review in  April 2009 asking for responses within 30 days for the export of a  computer program to a Chinese university for teaching and research  purposes. State concurred in January 2011, about 2 weeks after receiving  the foreign government assurance and almost 2 years after receiving the  letter from NNSA.

Embassy staff, who receive instructions and  background documents from State headquarters, often work to make sure  that the facts listed in the request for assurances are correct and that the  staff have current information for points of contact for the importer, which  is a key step in the assurance process. State officials recognized the  need to streamline the process for obtaining assurances in countries with  growing nuclear markets, such as China and the UAE. Of the 89  applications DOE approved from 2008 through 2013, 23 were for exports  to the UAE\u2014more than any other country\u2014largely for U.S. persons to  provide expertise to the UAE\u2019s Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation and  nuclear regulatory body. In 2010, State developed generic assurances for  Part 810 authorizations to the UAE, based on an agreed-upon template,  so that the language would not need separate negotiation for each  application. These generic assurances confirm that the transferred  technology will be used exclusively for civil nuclear power activities and  not for any nuclear explosive or other military purpose and that the  technology will not be retransferred outside the UAE without prior U.S.  consent.

Two executive orders identify clarity and consistency  among the key principles of federal regulation. We identified the  following three areas regarding the lack of clarity in the regulation:", "Key definitions in Part 810 are broad. The regulation\u2019s definition of  \u201cnuclear reactor\u201d does not distinguish among reactor components  based on their relative sensitivities. Representatives of nuclear  exporters have said that the regulation\u2019s definition of \u201cnuclear  reactor\u201d\u2014as \u201can apparatus, other than a nuclear explosive device,  designed or used to sustain nuclear fission in a self-supporting chain  reaction\u201d\u2014is overly broad and could be interpreted to encompass a  wide variety of technologies unrelated to the production of special  nuclear material. For example, NEI noted in its comments on DOE\u2019s  proposed revisions to Part 810 that nuclear reactors, under DOE\u2019s  definition, contain thousands of components and systems, only some  of which, such as the reactor pressure vessel, relate to the  production of special nuclear material. The group raised concerns  that absent a clearer definition of the technologies covered within the  scope of \u201cnuclear reactor,\u201d companies would be forced to seek time- consuming advisory opinions for each item in a nuclear power plant.  By contrast, NRC\u2019s export control regulations provide an illustrative  list of covered nuclear reactor components, and representatives of  exporters suggested in their public comments that DOE compile a  similar list.", "Part 810 does not explicitly address sales or marketing. The  regulation does not contain provisions that specifically address  marketing and does not clearly delineate the types of marketing  information that may require a general or specific authorization. A  representative of an association for nuclear companies told us that  this has created confusion and that exporters determine whether  sales and marketing information is covered based on whether the  information is public or proprietary. However, exporters noted in their  public comments on DOE\u2019s proposed revisions to Part 810 that  marketing activities may entail the transfer of general design or price  information that is proprietary but not sufficiently detailed to assist in  production of special nuclear material. Nonetheless, such information  may fall under the jurisdiction of Part 810 because it is not \u201cpublic  information,\u201d which is generally authorized for transfer (and would be  exempt under the proposed rule). A company representative told us  that absent greater clarity, companies are limited in marketing a  design and advancing a contract because customers request detailed  information\u2014which may be proprietary\u2014to understand how much  they would be willing to pay for a product. Representatives of another  company told us that it took 2 years to get the specific authorization to  disclose the information needed for a marketing activity. While DOE  has proposed to adjust its definitions related to public information, it  has declined to specify what marketing activities may be exempt from  authorization\u2014stating that the regulation\u2019s applicability depends on  the data transferred rather than the activity\u2014and has instead noted in  its Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that companies can  seek guidance from the department on a case-by-case basis.", "The regulation does not clearly specify the information and  documents that applicants are required to submit. DOE\u2019s review  of Part 810 applications may be prolonged because applicants may  not submit all of the information required, which may occur because it  is sometimes unclear to applicants what information is required. For  example, a university export control officer told us that she applied for  a specific authorization for a course being developed on operating a  nuclear power plant. More than 5 weeks after submitting the  application, a DOE official requested additional information from the  applicant\u2014specifically, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for the foreign nationals involved.  The university officer said that, unlike with other export control  regimes, DOE does not provide guidance on the application materials  necessary for Part 810, and that she would have included the  r\u00e9sum\u00e9s at the beginning of the process if she had known she needed  to provide them. Section 57(b) of the AEA states that, to the extent  practicable, an applicant should be advised of all the information  required at the beginning of the process. NNSA officials told us that  Part 810 contains the application requirements; however, the  regulation does not list, for example, r\u00e9sum\u00e9s among the  requirements.

One company  wrote in its public comments on DOE\u2019s proposed revisions to Part 810  that, rather than requiring companies to obtain advisory opinions with  respect to proposed activities, DOE and the nuclear industry would  benefit from DOE\u2019s establishment of clearer boundaries for the  applicability of Part 810. University export officers also said that DOE  declined their request to clarify which types of university activities would  require authorization, but encouraged the officers to inquire or apply so  that DOE could make a case-by-case determination. These officers  raised concerns that the lack of clarity in Part 810, together with the  uncertainty about DOE\u2019s decisions regarding what activities require  authorization, may restrict scientific communication by creating confusion  about what universities may share openly.", "Without established written guidance, exporters uncertain about the  scope of Part 810 must inquire with DOE for interpretation. Under Part  810, potential applicants may request advice on, among other things,  whether a proposed activity falls within the scope of the regulations or  requires specific authorization. According to DOE\u2019s Part 810 procedures,  DOE receives numerous inquiries from U.S. persons and firms regarding  activities that may fall under the scope of Part 810 regulations. NNSA  officials told us they receive approximately two inquiries in the form of  letters and more than 10 inquiries by phone each week. According to  DOE\u2019s Part 810 procedures, most of these inquiries are requests for  interpretation of the regulation or requests for review of proposed financial  ventures with foreign entities. These inquiries require the input of a wide  range of expertise from various sources inside DOE and elsewhere that  are consolidated into informal written or oral guidance or for formal  correspondence. DOE\u2019s responses to these inquiries are significant,  because, as DOE acknowledges, the specific-authorization process can  be protracted, and its approval time frames can impose business risks for  U.S. companies.", "Several representatives of nuclear exporters told us that DOE responded  promptly to inquiries, but that the need to consult DOE to clarify the scope  and applicability of the regulation contributed to a process that was too  dependent on individual interpretation. For example, one company  representative told us that there was no way of knowing whether other  companies were getting the same response\u2014with regard to what type of  authorization would be needed\u2014for the same set of circumstances. A  university export officer said that a definition provided by DOE in the  course of an inquiry appeared to be \u201cmade up on the spot.\u201d Another  company representative suggested that a potential applicant could get a  different answer depending on which official at DOE takes the call, based  on an individual interpretation with no basis in the regulation. This  representative said that DOE\u2019s inquiry system provides companies with  an incentive to proceed with the activity in question without consulting  DOE. Specifically, the representative noted that an inquiry could lead to a  response that the transaction could not proceed without waiting for an  authorization. If the company proceeds without inquiring, however, and  DOE later determines that the transaction required authorization, this  representative believes that the company would be able to defend itself  against any enforcement action because DOE would not be able to point  to the specific regulatory language on which it based its determination.", "DOE officials do not consistently document inquiries or their responses,  and cannot analyze them for consistency or to identify parts of the  regulation that may need clarification. Part 810 does not require exporters  to submit inquiries for interpretation of the scope of the regulation, or for  DOE to respond to them, in writing or electronically. However, DOE\u2019s  internal procedures state that DOE is to maintain a database that includes  a listing of and files for all inquiries, and other export-control agencies  such as State and Commerce do require written or electronic submissions  and responses for inquiries regarding jurisdiction. DOE officials said that  they do not document all inquiries or responses because some inquiries  are vague, and DOE\u2019s responses are predecisional. However, as noted  earlier, DOE\u2019s responses to these inquiries are significant because of the  time frames of the specific authorization process; they determine whether  or not an activity is subject to the regulation and whether an exporter has  to engage in the time-consuming authorization process. Documenting all  inquiries and responses would provide DOE with the information needed  to reasonably assure that the agency\u2019s responses are consistent under  similar circumstances, and to identify aspects of the regulation that may  need clarification. Under the federal standards for internal control,  agencies are to accurately record and appropriately document  transactions. Documentation of transactions is also important because  gaps can develop in an organization\u2019s institutional knowledge and  leadership as experienced employees leave.

In addition, NNSA, NRC, State,  Commerce, and DOJ provided technical comments that we incorporated,  as appropriate.", "In its written comments, NNSA agreed with all six of our  recommendations and noted several actions and initiatives it is planning  or undertaking to implement our recommendations. For example, NNSA  stated that as part of its ongoing process improvements, the agency is  working to identify gaps, overlaps, and inefficiencies in the Part 810  authorization process and will establish new, achievable targets for each  stage of the Part 810 process. Among other things, NNSA also stated that  it plans to consult with other regulatory agencies, such as NRC, to  determine what risk-based procedures the agency has for analyzing  reports on authorized activities and whether they could be modified to  work for Part 810 reports. NNSA also stated that it would consult with  regulatory agencies such as NRC and Commerce to determine what  export compliance policies they have for encouraging and rewarding self- disclosure and whether they could be modified for Part 810 self-reporting.", "NNSA also provided general comments on some of our findings. For  example, NNSA stated that the draft report frequently draws comparisons  between DOE\u2019s Part 810 process and other agencies\u2019 export control  regimes. NNSA stated that, unlike the other regimes, DOE\u2019s export  authorization process involves other agencies and diplomatic  engagements with foreign governments, whose responsiveness the U.S.  government cannot control. We note that our analysis considered relevant  differences in the export control regimes. As noted above, NNSA  concurred with our recommendations and stated that it would consider  whether the processes of these agencies could be adapted for Part 810.", "NNSA also stated that the ability to devise \u201ccreative solutions\u201d for unique  or new situations remains an important aspect of the Part 810  authorization process, and that consistent guidance in light of such  situations is inapplicable. However, as noted in the report, DOE must  reasonably assure that its interpretation of Part 810 is consistent in  responding to wide-ranging questions from exporters.", "In addition, NNSA stated that the Department clearly took seriously the  recommendations from our report, Nuclear Commerce: Governmentwide  Strategy Could Help Increase Commercial Benefits from U.S. Nuclear  Cooperation Agreements with Other Countries (GAO-11-36), as  evidenced by the current rulemaking, process improvements, and the  creation of an e-810 system. We noted the actions DOE took in response  to these recommendations in the current report. However, because the  rulemaking and process improvements were ongoing at the time of our  audit, we could not evaluate the extent to which these initiatives will  address the findings and recommendations in this report. NNSA said that  our draft report stated that DOE had not proposed revising its inquiry  process, but noted that its initiatives will address the inquiry process, and  that the inquiries we referred to are exploratory and informal. We clarified  the language in the report to address NNSA\u2019s comment. However, as we  say in the report, several exporters whom we interviewed expressed  concern about the consistency of the responses DOE was providing to  their inquiries. We could not evaluate whether DOE\u2019s responses to  inquiries were consistent because DOE does not document all inquiries.  Without such documentation, DOE cannot reasonably assure that the  interpretations offered in response to these inquiries are consistent.", "Finally, in its written comments, NNSA stated that it is true that it has not  referred any suspected Part 810 violations to the Department of Justice  for criminal investigation or revoked any authorizations for cause but that  it has not received reports of illicit technology transfers or seen evidence  of violations of Part 810 authorization restrictions. We recommend in this  report, as a step in strengthening export controls through Part 810, that  DOE take a risk-based approach to reviewing reports for in-depth  analysis from exporters and assess the need for guidance and incentives  to exporters for self-identifying, self-reporting, and correcting possible  violations. NNSA agreed with these recommendations.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate  congressional committees, the Secretary of Energy, the Administrator of  the National Nuclear Security Administration, the Secretary of State, the  Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Secretary of  Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, and other interested parties.

Part 810 Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities Part 810  Program Elements and the National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s  (NNSA) procedures for processing, reviewing, and approving specific  authorizations to determine DOE\u2019s internal targets. We analyzed DOE  data on the processing times for the 89 specific authorizations granted  from 2008 through 2013. For each authorization, the analysis included a  calculation of the number of days between the date of each application for  authorization and the date of the Secretary\u2019s determination, which  encompasses the entire Part 810 process. We also calculated the  number of days between each of the three stages of the process\u2014initial  review, interagency review, and final review. We calculated the duration  of the internal review stage based on the number of days between the  date on the application and the date NNSA forwarded the application to  the interagency. This date marked the beginning of the interagency stage,  which ended when NNSA received the last interagency concurrence with  the application package. The final review stage started from the date of  the last interagency concurrence and ended on the date of the Secretary  of Energy\u2019s determination. To ensure the analysis was as accurate as  possible, we reviewed the data, identified irregularities, and contacted  NNSA officials to clarify and correct those irregularities. For example,  when we noticed an application in which the Department of Commerce\u2019s  concurrence date preceded the date NNSA submitted the application to  the interagency, we notified NNSA officials of this inconsistency, and they  provided us with the correct date. Moreover, we interviewed the NNSA  officials who collected and recorded the data, about the procedures they  follow to ensure the data are accurate, complete, and reliable. On the  basis of our review, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable  for purposes of analyzing trends in processing times.", "To identify factors affecting the processing times for specific  authorizations, we selected a nonprobability sample of eight applications  that represented a range of processing times. Specifically, for each stage  in the Part 810 process as well as for the entire process, we selected (1)  one case from among applications with short processing times, defined  as processing times in the 25th percentile (that is, processing times  shorter than those for 75 percent of all applications), and (2) one case  representing long processing times, defined as applications in the 75th  percentile (that is, processing times longer than those for 75 percent of all  applications). Among applications with long processing times, we  considered those with over twice the median processing time. We used  the median\u2014rather than the mean\u2014because outliers in the data unduly  impact the size of the mean, making it a less valid representation of the  typical processing time. From applications with long and short processing  times, we selected cases that represented a range of countries and types  of exports or assistance, such as computer codes, consulting services,  and advanced reactor technologies.", "The small number of cases selected precluded us from generalizing the  results, but the case study analysis provided examples of factors that may  explain the varying processing times. To identify these factors, we  reviewed application packets NNSA provided to us, including technical  assessments and intra- and inter-agency correspondence. When  reviewing case study documents, we noticed that some of the  correspondence dates differed from the dates recorded in the  spreadsheet. Because these discrepancies are small, they do not  significantly impact the results of our aggregate data analysis, which  measures the duration (i.e., number of days) between each stage of the  process and the overall process. The small discrepancies also do not  impact the findings of our case study analysis, which focuses on the  causes of long and short processing times. We also interviewed agency  officials to better understand these factors. For seven of the eight  applications in our case study, as well as for the three applications that  NNSA provided to us as samples, we were able to determine, based on  the last internal concurrence among DOE and NNSA staff, the earliest  date that the recommendation could have been provided to the Secretary  upon receipt of interagency comments to determine whether the  recommendation was provided to the Secretary within 30 days\u2014the  target time frame. In one case, the correspondence was not dated, and  we could not determine the date of the recommendation to the Secretary.  In nine other cases, we were able to determine whether the time elapsed  between the receipt of interagency comments and the last internal  concurrence among DOE and NNSA staff\u2014which must precede the  recommendation to the Secretary\u2014 exceeded 30 days.", "To examine the impacts of Part 810 processing times on U.S. nuclear  exporters, we interviewed representatives of these exporters and  reviewed public comments submitted in response to DOE\u2019s proposed  changes to Part 810, as well as DOE\u2019s response to comments made in  response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, as articulated in the  preamble to the Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. The  representatives we interviewed included representatives of companies, as  well as representatives of four associations (the Nuclear Energy Institute  (NEI), American Nuclear Society (ANS), Nuclear Infrastructure Council  (NIC), and Association of University Export Control Officers (AUECO),  and reviewed the public comments of a fifth (the Ad-Hoc Utilities Group)).  The companies were either identified through interviews with association  representatives\u2014we requested that they identify nuclear exporters with  experience with the Part 810 authorization process for us to interview\u2014  or by GAO (for example, at public meetings and other forums on nuclear  export issues, or through their public comments). We then interviewed  five exporters, including reactor designers and manufacturers,  engineering service providers, and fuel companies, and obtained written  comments from a nuclear energy technology company. We also selected  for interviews, based on recommendations from industry associations and  on our reviews of public comments and letters, representatives from a  consulting group that exports nuclear services and from a utility company,  which is the largest commercial nuclear generator in the United States,  and from two law firms. The law firms were selected because of their  expertise and experience in U.S. nuclear export controls. To learn more  about the relevance of regulation of civilian nuclear technology to  nonproliferation more generally, we interviewed five nonproliferation  experts.", "To examine the extent to which the scope of Part 810 is clear, we  consulted and analyzed the Atomic Energy Act, as well as executive  orders and Office of Management and Budget bulletins related to  government regulation. We also reviewed the Part 810 regulation. We  interviewed DOE officials and a variety of entities regulated or potentially  regulated under Part 810, as well as various groups representing these  entities\u2014as described above\u2014for their views on the clarity of the  regulation. We also consulted public comments submitted in response to  DOE\u2019s proposed changes to Part 810, as well as DOE\u2019s response to the  comments received in response to the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking as  articulated in the preamble to the Supplemental Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking. To examine the extent to which DOE can reasonably assure  that the regulation is consistently interpreted, we consulted DOE\u2019s 10  C.F.R. Part 810 Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities Part 810  Program Elements and the federal standards for internal control, and  interviewed DOE officials and a variety of entities regulated or potentially  regulated under Part 810, as well as various groups representing these  entities, as described above.", "To examine the extent to which DOE enforces its nuclear export controls,  we first determined the activities DOE undertakes to monitor conditions  imposed through authorizations by interviewing DOE and NNSA officials.  We then conducted an analysis of the conditions imposed through the 89  Part 810 authorizations approved from 2008-2013. The conditions for  each authorization are documented in determination letters signed by the  Secretary of Energy, and we conducted a double-blind content analysis of  the 89 letters to determine the range and frequency of conditions.  Specifically, two analysts independently reviewed the 89 letters and  recorded the range and frequency of conditions in separate documents.  Then the analysts compared their assessments and resolved any  differences through discussion. To describe DOE\u2019s authorities to enforce  these conditions, as well as the actions DOE has taken to enforce them,  we reviewed the Atomic Energy Act and 10 C.F.R. Part 810. We also  interviewed DOE, NNSA, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and  Department of Justice officials and obtained information on enforcement  actions. To describe the information DOE provides on its enforcement of  Part 810, we reviewed DOE\u2019s 10 C.F.R. Part 810 Assistance to Foreign  Atomic Energy Activities Part 810 Program Elements and interviewed  DOE and NNSA officials. We also interviewed representatives from  entities regulated or potentially regulated under Part 810, as described  above. To determine the information provided by other agencies that  administer related export control regimes, we reviewed relevant  regulations and publicly available information on NRC and the  Departments of State and Commerce\u2019s enforcement policies, including  enforcement manuals and voluntary disclosure guidelines; and  interviewed NRC officials.
