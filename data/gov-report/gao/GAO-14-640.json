In light of recent events, having a high-quality process to determine whether an individual's eligibility to access classified information should be revoked has become increasingly important. DOD and DHS grant the most clearances in the executive branch, and the Director of National Intelligence is responsible for, among other things, oversight of clearance eligibility determinations.", "GAO was asked to evaluate revocation processes at DHS and DOD. GAO evaluated the extent to which the agencies (1) track data on these processes; (2) consistently implement government-wide requirements and exercise oversight over these processes; and (3) determine outcomes for employees whose clearances were revoked. During this review, GAO identified possible inaccuracies in DOD's data on eligible personnel with access to classified information and is also reporting on that issue. GAO analyzed agency revocation data, reviewed executive orders, agency guidance, and documents, and interviewed officials from ODNI, DHS, DOD, and their components."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Defense (DOD) both have systems that track varying levels of detail related to revocations of employees' security clearances. DHS's and DOD's data systems could provide data on the number of and reasons for revocations, but they could not provide some data, such as the number of individuals who received a proposal to revoke their eligibility for access to classified information, which means that the total number of employees affected by the revocation process is unknown.", "Inconsistent implementation of the requirements in the governing executive orders by DHS, DOD, and some of their components, and limited oversight over the revocation process, have resulted in some employees experiencing different protections and processes than other employees. Specifically, DHS and DOD have implemented the requirements for the revocation process contained in Executive Orders 12968 and 10865 in different ways for different groups of personnel. Although certain differences are permitted or required by the executive orders, GAO found that implementation by some components could potentially be inconsistent with the executive orders in two areas. As a result, some employees may not be provided with certain information upon which a revocation appeal determination is based, and may not be told that they have a right to counsel. These inconsistencies in implementation may be in part because neither DHS nor DOD have evaluated the quality of their processes or developed performance measures to measure quality department-wide. Similarly, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) has only exercised limited oversight by reviewing policies and procedures within some agencies. ODNI has not established any metrics to measure the quality of the process government-wide and has not reviewed revocation processes across the federal government to determine the extent to which policies and procedures should be uniform.", "DHS and DOD employees whose clearances were revoked may not have consistent employment outcomes, such as reassignment or termination, because these outcomes are determined by several factors, such as the agency's mission and needs and the manager's discretion. Further, most components could not readily ascertain employment outcomes of individuals with revoked clearances, because these data are not readily available, and communication between personnel security and human capital offices at the departments varies.", "GAO's comparison of the total number of DOD employees eligible to access classified information to the total number of DOD employees in fiscal year 2013 suggests that DOD's clearance eligibility totals may be inaccurate. Specifically, GAO found that the number of eligible employees exceeded the total number of employees in five DOD components. DOD officials said this discrepancy could be because DOD's eligibility database is not consistently updated when an employee separates. As a result, the total number of government employees eligible to access classified information that ODNI reports to Congress likely overstates the number of eligible DOD employees. Inaccurate eligibility data hampers DOD's ability to reduce its number of clearance holders to minimize risk and reduce costs to the government."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS, DOD, and the DNI take several actions to improve data quality and oversight related to the personnel security revocation process.

While much attention has been paid to the processes for  granting a personnel security clearance, equally important are the  processes governing whether individuals who have personnel security  clearances should retain their access to classified information. If an  individual\u2019s circumstances change in a manner that raises security  concerns regarding whether he or she should continue to be entrusted  with access to classified information, then processes exist to take away,  or revoke, an individual\u2019s eligibility to access classified information, and  for that individual to appeal that decision.", "After the September 16, 2013, shooting at the Washington Navy Yard,  several reviews were initiated and conducted to assess the security  clearance process and facilitate progress in evaluating and improving the  quality of that process. For example, in February 2014, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) issued a report that assessed risks  inherent in the current security, suitability, and credentialing processes  and identified recommended solutions to safeguard personnel and protect  sensitive information. In November 2013, the Department of Defense  (DOD) issued reports from two reviews addressing gaps or deficiencies in  DOD programs, policies, and procedures regarding security at DOD  installations and the granting and reviewing of security clearances for  DOD employees and contractor personnel. In these reports, both OMB  and DOD made recommendations related to improving access to  information and reducing the number of clearance holders, among other  recommendations.", "Further, although the report recommendations have not yet been  implemented, all three reports recommended continuous evaluation of  employees and contractors who are eligible for access to classified  information, which involves automated data checks from sources such as  credit checks, social media, and personnel records to provide near-real- time notification of relevant information to help identify potential risks to  national security. Implementation of continuous evaluation could prompt  further investigation of events and incidents that could lead to an increase in the number of revocations that are proposed by government agencies.", "In addition, the consistent application of revocation processes across  different federal agencies has become increasingly important due to the  requirement for clearance reciprocity, where executive-branch agencies  are required to accept a background investigation or personnel security  clearance determination completed by any authorized investigative or  adjudicative agency, subject to certain exceptions.", "For purposes of this report, references to revocation of an employee\u2019s security clearance  means revocation of an employee\u2019s eligibility to access classified information. data, we reviewed the revocation data and supporting documentation and  discussed their reliability with agency officials.

As a result, neither system could provide data on how many  individuals separated before a revocation decision was made, appeals,  and time to complete a revocation case. Notably, neither the DHS nor the  DOD system was able to provide data about the total number of  individuals who received a proposal to revoke their security clearance,  which would likely exceed the total number of revocations. Therefore, we  are unable to comment on the total number of employees who might be  affected by the revocation process. In order for organizations to measure  performance, it is important that they have sufficiently complete, accurate,  and consistent data to document performance and support decision  making, while balancing the cost and effort involved in gathering and  analyzing data. DHS\u2019s system for managing and standardizing  personnel security data, the Integrated Security Management System  (ISMS), has not typically been used to track additional information about  security clearance revocations, such as (1) the number of employees who  received a proposal to revoke their clearance, (2) the number of  employees who separated from the department before a revocation  decision was made, (3) the number of employees that filed an initial  appeal of a revocation decision, and (4) the length of time to complete a  revocation case.", "First, DHS officials could not provide us with data on the number of  individuals who had received a proposal to revoke their clearance. They  said that this information could be recorded in ISMS, but that this  capability may not be used by all of the components. Second, DHS  officials said that ISMS does not track cases where an individual  separated from the department before a decision was made regarding a  proposal to revoke a personnel security clearance. For example, DHS  officials said that if an employee was issued a proposal to revoke his or  her clearance and he or she resigned and never responded to the  proposal, then the security clearance was never revoked and the case  would not be counted as a revocation. Once an initial decision is made to  revoke a clearance, the decision is entered into ISMS and that decision  will become final even if the employee does not respond, so those cases  would be counted. Third, DHS data on the number of employees that filed  an initial appeal of a revocation decision were not available. Officials from  the Office of the Chief Security Officer told us that ISMS has a module  that could provide this information, but because use of this module is not  required, only a few DHS components use it. Finally, while officials at  DHS components stated that the entire revocation process can take over  a year to complete, DHS data on the average amount of time it takes to  complete a revocation case were not available. Officials from the Office of  the Chief Security Officer said that while ISMS can identify this  information in individual records, it cannot track this type of data as a  whole across the DHS components, because each appeal level would be  saved as a different module entry. They said they try to complete a  revocation case as quickly as possible. However, in some cases,  employees request extensions of time in order to obtain representation or  to obtain documents to refute or explain the revocation decision, which  lengthens the process time. Until DHS considers whether tracking  additional revocation and appeals information would be beneficial, and  modifies its system to provide such information as is deemed beneficial,  the department will continue to lack visibility over certain aspects of the  security clearance revocation and appeal process, which may hinder its  ability to effectively oversee these processes.", "Similarly, DOD\u2019s Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) system,  which is designated as DOD\u2019s system of record for personnel security  management to record and document personnel security actions, captures varying levels of detail related to security clearance revocations.   also  We found certain JPAS data fields partially completed or incomplete,  such as fields showing whether an employee received a proposal to  revoke his or her clearance, whether the employee chose to appeal the  revocation decision in writing or in person, the time taken at different  stages of the employee\u2019s revocation appeal, and the number of  employees who separated from the department before a revocation  decision was made. For example, although more than 16,000 military and  federal civilian employees had their personnel security clearances  revoked from fiscal years 2009 through 2013, JPAS data reflected that  fewer than 3,000 individuals had received a statement of reasons, which  is DOD\u2019s initial proposal to revoke a personnel security clearance,  because the JPAS field to record this information had not been filled.", "The JPAS system of record notice, dated May 3, 2011, states that the  categories of records in JPAS include records documenting the personnel  security adjudicative and management process. However, officials from  the Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC), DOD\u2019s JPAS administrator,  and the DOD CAF stated that DOD users instead generally used  component-specific case-management systems to keep track of  adjudication information. DMDC officials explained that the final  eligibility determination, and not all the other adjudication data, from the  different case-management systems was uploaded to JPAS. Officials  from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, which  is responsible for overseeing DOD\u2019s personnel security program, stated  that their oversight efforts have been hindered by the lack of available  data in JPAS, and that they do not have access to the component-specific  case-management systems. DMDC officials stated that JPAS and the  different case-management systems are going to be replaced, by 2016  and the end of fiscal year 2014, respectively. ODNI officials stated that it  would be important for DOD to improve the data in JPAS before the new  systems are implemented.", "DOD is already aware that data in JPAS are not being updated as  frequently as needed. For example, the November 2013 DOD report in  response to the Navy Yard shooting found that DOD does not have  policies addressing roles, responsibilities, and standards for security  managers to ensure the upkeep of data in JPAS. The report  recommended that the department establish, reinforce, and enforce roles  and responsibilities for updates to JPAS. Similarly, in April 2014, the DOD  Inspector General issued a report assessing the personnel security  clearance processes for contractors in four defense intelligence agencies.  This report found a lack of effective recordkeeping that occurred because  the appropriate investigative and personnel security databases, including  JPAS, were not being reliably populated with investigative and security  information. The report recommended that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence direct the defense intelligence agencies to review  the procedures used to ensure that JPAS and other systems are being  properly populated. The report also found that DOD did not have any  overarching policy documents governing JPAS operation, and  recommended that DOD develop and issue an overarching policy for  JPAS.improve the data in JPAS.

Executive Order 12968 provides that  employees shall be provided an opportunity to appear personally at some  point in the process before an adjudicative or other authority; it does not  specify when during the process this personal appearance should occur.  Executive Order 10865 provides that a contractor shall be provided an  opportunity to appear personally after he or she has provided a written  reply to the proposal to revoke eligibility to access classified information.  Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals officials explained that the  personal appearance is a significant opportunity to refute, explain,  extenuate or mitigate critical facts, and stated that the later timing of this  significant procedural protection for military and civilian personnel can  adversely affect the individual\u2019s continued employment while the appeal  process is completed.", "The timing of the personal appearance for contractors is earlier in the  revocation process than for DHS employees and DOD military and civilian  employees. Contractors who receive a proposal to revoke their clearance  may choose to respond to the proposal by requesting a personal  appearance before an administrative judge. The administrative judge, in  turn, issues a written decision to revoke or sustain the clearance after the  employee has had his or her hearing. The contractor can appeal this  decision to an appeal board. Thus, contractors have their personal  appearance before the revocation decision is made. In contrast, military  and civilian personnel within DHS and DOD who receive a notice that  their clearance may be revoked can only submit written documentation  prior to a revocation decision. Adjudicators issue a written decision to  revoke or sustain the clearance before any personal appearance by, and  without any in-person discussion with, the employee. The employee can  appeal this written decision and request a personal appearance during  the appeal process.", "Furthermore, DHS military and civilian employees, and contractor  employees government-wide, have a better opportunity than DOD military  and civilian employees to understand the rationale for the revocation  decision and the effect their personal appearance may have had on the  revocation decision. DHS military and civilian employees receive a written  decision letter to revoke or sustain the clearance from the individual who  presided over the personal appearance. Similarly, contractors  government-wide are also provided a copy of the administrative judge\u2019s  written decision. However, for DOD military and civilian employees, the  administrative judge who presided over the personal appearance during  the appeal makes a written recommendation rather than a decision. This  recommendation is sent directly to one of DOD\u2019s Personnel Security  Appeals Boards (PSAB), based on the agency to which the employee is  assigned, and the recommendation generally is not shared with the DOD  military or civilian employee. The DOD PSABs consider the administrative  judge\u2019s recommendation and other evidence when they reach and issue a  final written decision regarding the security clearance to the employee,  but they are not required to follow the judge\u2019s recommendation. The  employee is provided a final written decision from one of the three military  department PSABs, which cannot be appealed, but the employee  generally is not privy to the administrative judge\u2019s recommendation. An  exception is the Washington Headquarters Services appeal board which,  in its written decision, typically provides the employee with a copy of the  administrative judge\u2019s recommendation and the hearing transcript. Army  PSAB officials explained that providing the judge\u2019s recommendation to  the employee could be misleading because the individual might assume  that was the final decision, and would be disappointed if the PSAB  reached a different decision.", "The level of detail contained in the written decisions received by  employees after the personal appearance also varied, with contractors  having more information about the rationale for the decision than military  and federal civilian personnel in the military departments. When we  reviewed Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals administrative judge  decisions that are provided to contractors, we found that they contained  detailed findings of fact, discussions of applicable law and policy, and  analysis, which provides an employee an in-depth understanding of the  rationale for the judge\u2019s decision. In reviewing versions of the PSAB  decisions that are provided to military and civilian employees, however,  we found that the Army and Air Force PSAB decisions were in a short  memorandum format that state that case records have been reviewed  and the board either sustains the revocation decision or reinstates  eligibility for access to classified information. We found that only the Navy  PSAB decisions provided a more detailed explanation of the rationale for  the revocation of a security clearance.

A fourth appeals board is administered  by DOD\u2019s Washington Headquarters Services, which reviews civilian  employee cases for all other DOD agencies. A fifth appeals board is  administered by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, which  reviews cases for all contractors in the industrial security program,  including DOD and DHS. We have previously reported that overlap  occurs when programs have similar goals, devise similar strategies and  activities to achieve those goals, or target similar users, and duplication  occurs when two or more agencies or programs are engaged in the same  activities or provide the same services to the same beneficiaries.", "While  overlap in efforts may be appropriate in some instances, especially if  agencies can leverage each others\u2019 efforts, in other instances overlap  may be unintended, may be unnecessary, or may represent an inefficient  use of U.S. government resources. DOD\u2019s multiple different PSABs could  constitute inefficient overlap because more than one component within  DOD provides the same service.", "In 2010, the Secretary of Defense directed a series of initiatives designed  to reduce duplication, overhead, and excess and instill a culture of  savings and cost accountability across the department. As part of this  initiative, in March 2011, the Secretary approved a recommendation to  colocate and consolidate the overlapping security clearance appeal  boards with the Defense Legal Services Agency, similar to the  colocation and consolidation of the service adjudication activities that  were previously directed by the base realignment and closure process  and the Deputy Secretary of Defense. The Secretary directed a  completion date of September 30, 2011, for this recommendation.  However, this recommendation had not been implemented at the time of  our review. A Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals official explained  that this direction had not been cancelled, but it had not been  implemented because of opposition from the military departments.  Officials from the Navy PSAB stated that the direction had not been  implemented because the PSABs had not received any instructions or  guidance to implement this direction from the Defense Legal Services  Agency. Similarly, the Army PSAB attributed the lack of action to a focus  on completing the consolidation of DOD\u2019s adjudication facilities as well as  the absence of policy direction from the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence.", "An official from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence explained that there has been an impasse since 2011 over a  legal question regarding whether the PSAB consolidation directed by the  Secretary of Defense is consistent with Executive Order 12968.  Specifically, Army and Air Force PSAB officials stated that PSAB  consolidation is not consistent with Executive Order 12968, explaining  that the review proceedings outlined in the executive order provide an  employee with revoked access to classified information the opportunity for  a final appeal in writing to an agency head\u2013appointed high-level panel.  Army and Air Force PSAB officials stated that \u201cagency head\u201d refers to the  Secretary of the Military Departments, not the Secretary of Defense. Air  Force PSAB officials stated that the Secretary of Defense direction for  PSAB consolidation would require modifying section 5.2 of Executive  Order 12968, and that removing PSABs from the services would neither  enhance due process nor national security. Air Force PSAB officials also  explained that the procedures used to review the DOD efficiency  proposals did not include the opportunity for the service Secretaries to  review and comment, and thus the memo directing consolidation of the  PSABs was signed before military department equities in maintaining  their department PSABs were captured for consideration.", "However, an official from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals  explained that the term \u201cagency head\u201d as used in the executive order  includes the Secretary of Defense. Further, an official from the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence explained that by law, the  Secretary of Defense has authority, direction, and control over the  Department of Defense, to include the Secretaries of the military  departments, and the Secretary of Defense\u2019s efficiency decisions are  decisions as the head of DOD and apply to all subordinate components of  the department, including the Secretaries of the military departments.  This official stated that the interpretation of the language in the executive  order was ultimately a legal question. DOD guidance provides that the  DOD General Counsel shall provide advice and guidance as to the legal  sufficiency of procedures and standards involved in implementing the  DOD personnel security program.", "In addition to the disagreement about the legal authority to consolidate  the PSABs, there is disagreement within the department about the risks  and benefits of implementing the Secretary of Defense direction to  consolidate the PSABs. Officials from the Army, the Navy, and the Air  Force PSABs explained that consolidating PSABs would limit the military  department Secretary\u2019s ability to consider circumstances and risk in light  of that specific service\u2019s special or sensitive programs, missions, or  needs. Washington Headquarters Services officials stated that separate  PSABs were more likely to be sensitive to their component\u2019s special  programs, missions, and needs than a central DOD PSAB. Air Force  PSAB officials stated that, from their past experience, the DOD  Consolidated Adjudications Facility\u2019s (CAF) statement of reasons for  revoking access to classified information is often narrowly focused and  fails to weigh all issues appropriately, and that in personal hearings the  Defense Office of Hearings Appeals administrative judges sometimes fail  to challenge statements made by employees that immediately raise flags  with PSAB members based on their background and experience. They  stated that with the DOD CAF making initial DOD-wide risk assessments  for the military departments, the final revocation appeals should be  decided by the individual departments.", "In contrast, officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals agree that  DOD PSAB consolidation is in keeping with the principles of reciprocity  where risk is managed DOD-wide, not on a component basis. They stated  that with the DOD CAF, the components have already lost their ability to  manage risk with respect to favorable adjudications because the CAF is  making those decisions for the component when personnel security  clearances are initially granted. Officials from the Defense Office of  Hearings and Appeals stated that the requirement that agencies grant  clearance reciprocity has removed the role that service-specific  programs may play in clearance determinations that were completed by  another agency. Officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence explained that consolidation would bring  standardization and consistency of quality, objectivity, and experience to  the process for personnel security appeals, and would result in legal  expertise being part of every appeal process, which would help ensure  that national security needs and procedural fairness are appropriately  balanced. Further, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals officials  stated that contractors have the benefit of independent fact-finding and an  independent written decision by officials who do not work for the  component, which provides an important check against unfairness and  the taint of undue influence. These officials stated that having decision  makers outside of the component\u2019s chain of command helps to reduce  the opportunity for the perception or reality that those in the individual\u2019s  component or chain of command can influence the outcome of the  process.", "Officials from the DOD CAF cautioned that DOD needs to study the  implications of moving to a consolidated appeal board to make an  informed decision on any process modifications, efficiencies, and  resource implications prior to executing the direction to consolidate the  appeal boards. Army officials also suggested that establishment of a  working group to review the efficiencies, feasibility, way ahead, and  timelines would be beneficial in formulating a course of action in  implementing the direction to consolidate the PSABs. Until DOD General  Counsel resolves the disagreement within the department about the legal  authority to consolidate the PSABs, and collaborates with the PSABs and  the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence to address any other  obstacles to consolidation, the department will continue to face delays  implementing the Secretary of Defense\u2019s direction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementation of Some Revocation Processes by Components Is Potentially Not Consistent with Executive Orders or Agency Policy", "paragraphs": ["Our review of DHS and DOD department- and component-level guidance,  as well as the components\u2019 communication letters to employees  undergoing a revocation proceeding, found that both departments  generally provided information to employees about their rights under the  two executive orders.

Army PSAB officials explained that the credit report is accessed solely to  verify the existence or resolution of disqualifying financial information that  formed the basis of an unfavorable determination by the DOD CAF, so it  is not routinely provided to the employees, but they said that it would be  provided upon request. This raises concerns about whether the employee  has an opportunity to review or respond to information in the credit  reports obtained directly by the PSAB, because credit reports may not  always be accurate.

Furthermore, ODNI officials  acknowledged that metrics have not been established to measure the  quality of the security clearance revocation process. In November 2013,  we testified that executive-branch agencies do not consistently assess  quality throughout the personnel security clearance process, in part  because they have not fully developed and implemented metrics to  measure quality in key aspects of the personnel security clearance  process.

The absence of data on the number of persons who receive a  proposal to revoke their eligibility to access classified information, as  discussed above, combined with the likelihood that the shift to increase  continuous evaluation may result in increased instances of revocation  proposals, make it increasingly important for agencies to have  performance measures and data to ensure a high-quality revocation  process. Without performance measures and data to assess the quality of  the personnel security clearance revocation process, individual  departments, such as DHS and DOD, and ODNI lack information to  identify and resolve potential problems in the process, and make informed  decisions about potential changes to the program.", "Furthermore, the security clearance revocation process implementation  differences we identified at DHS and DOD continue in part because ODNI  has not reviewed security clearance revocation processes across the  federal government to determine the extent to which policies and  procedures should be uniform.

When asked about the different processes, ODNI  officials stated that the executive orders provide broad guidelines that  give agencies the flexibility to implement a review and appeal process  that best fits the agency\u2019s needs, and there is no single solution that all  agencies must follow. Additionally, Executive Orders 12968 and 10865 do  not require a uniform government-wide process, and in fact establish two  parallel processes, one for contractors and one for government  employees.perspective, standardization of the security clearance revocation process  makes sense, but said that ODNI has not had a reason or purpose to  perform an extensive review of the revocation processes.

ODNI officials stated that   The ODNI officials explained that from an efficiencies  publishing guidance for the appeal process might be worth pursuing, but  would have to be prioritized in light of competing priorities and limited  resources. Given the inconsistencies we have identified in the revocation  processes at DHS and DOD discussed previously, combined with the  requirement of clearance reciprocity and the recommendations to  implement continuous evaluation, the DNI\u2019s new role as Security  Executive Agent places ODNI in a unique position to examine whether  any changes to the existing structure with its parallel revocation  processes might be warranted.

While one Army  regulation states that revocation of an officer\u2019s security clearance requires  that the officer be discharged, and further states that this requirement  cannot be waived, a different Army regulation regarding reassignment of  officers provides guidance for the reassignment of officers whose security  clearance has been revoked.", "For enlisted military personnel whose security clearance has been  revoked, officials from the military services stated that the Army and the  Marine Corps reassign military personnel to the extent that an alternative  position is available, and the Air Force may reassign military personnel,  while the Navy will generally only reassign military personnel until a final  revocation decision is made by the PSAB. Army officials noted, however, that a clearance revocation should affect a soldier\u2019s ability to  reenlist, because as of 2005 all soldiers enlisting in the Army are subject  to an investigation for eligibility to access classified information at the  secret level, regardless of the access requirements of their position. Navy  officials said that since 2011, all Navy positions require secret clearance  eligibility as a condition of employment, regardless of whether the position  requires access to classified information.

Similarly, Coast Guard officials  stated that their human capital and personnel security offices work closely  with each other throughout the revocation process with respect to civilian  employees.", "In contrast, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials stated that  they are unaware of any specific DHS human capital policies and  procedures that align or support the security process. These officials also  stated that better coordination and communication between human  capital and personnel security offices is needed during the revocation  process, and that increased coordination and communication could  improve the quality of the process. Similarly, DHS Headquarters  employee relations officials said that their office is not involved or  informed by the personnel security office throughout the security  revocation and appeal process, which includes the initial decision to  revoke an employee\u2019s security clearance through the three levels of  appeal. They explained that their office gets involved after the decision to  revoke the employee\u2019s security clearance is final, and the human capital  office communicates with the personnel security office when a personnel  action is necessary. They explained that this communication is not to  share the details of the underlying offense, but to notify the human capital  office or supervisor of the status of the investigation. An official from the  DHS Office of General Counsel stated that the office is involved  throughout the revocation process to provide legal sufficiency reviews of  clearance determinations and to advise management during any  clearance-related personnel action.", "Within DOD, Army human capital officials stated that the appropriate  offices are not informed of the revocation of the security clearance due to  weaknesses in information sharing with other Army offices. They  explained that there is no standard time frame or process for the civilian  personnel office to be notified about a civilian employee\u2019s clearance  revocation, but the office is typically notified when the supervisor seeks  advice regarding what action to take now that the employee\u2019s clearance  has been revoked. In contrast, Navy human capital officials stated that  the nature of the adverse information may trigger employee misconduct  actions as well as actions to revoke a security clearance, thus making  communication among the commanding officer, security manager, and  the serving human resource office essential. They said that, generally, the  security officer and the human resource office interact at all stages of the  incident. Similarly, Marine Corps headquarters officials stated that its  human resources office works with the local command and includes its  local security manager into the process from the very beginning of the  revocation process. Air Force officials stated the local human capital  office is normally informed by the organization when the employee\u2019s  security clearance is revoked. Washington Headquarters Services human  capital officials stated that their personnel security office and occasionally  the local component security manager notifies their human capital office  when an employee\u2019s security clearance has been revoked.", "A lack of communication between the human capital and personnel  security offices could result in adverse employment actions being taken  prematurely or in the inappropriate use of personnel security processes in  lieu of human capital processes. For example, DOD officials stated that  one issue that can arise is that human capital officials could fire an  individual before all of the appeals associated with a revocation action are  completed. If the termination was based upon a separate adverse action  proceeding, that action would be appropriate; however, if the action was  based on the clearance revocation, then, under DOD regulation, subject  to certain exceptions, termination should not take place until after the  revocation decision is final, after all appeals have been completed.  Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals and other DOD officials stated  that some components are inappropriately terminating employees due to  loss of a security clearance before the personnel security clearance  appeal process is completed. In addition, ODNI officials explained that  some agencies could use the personnel security process to handle  personnel disciplinary issues, which is not appropriate. For example,  Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals Officials said that retaliation  against whistleblowers is perceived, fairly or not, as a continuing problem  in the personnel security clearance arena. Ordinarily, most federal civilian  employees have a right to appeal serious adverse employment  actions taken against them to the Merit Systems Protections Board.  However, in the security clearance context, federal case law has limited  the scope of the board\u2019s review of adverse actions. Specifically, the board  may review appeals of adverse employment actions resulting from a  denial or revocation of a security clearance or a determination that an  employee is not eligible to hold a sensitive position for specific procedural  issues,clearance denial or revocation, or a finding that an employee is not  eligible to hold a sensitive position. DOD officials said that the personnel  security and human capital processes are designed and intended to be   but the board cannot review the substance of a security  separate in part to protect the employee from someone trying to exercise  undue influence over the disciplinary process, as well as to protect  national security. ODNI officials stated that there are legal restrictions on  the type of information that can be shared between the human capital and  personnel security offices, but said that further review of what information  should be shared between the two offices could be beneficial. Until DHS  and DOD develop guidance specifying what information can and should  be communicated between human capital and personnel security officials,  and at what decision points during the revocation process that information  should be communicated, DHS and DOD will be hampered in their ability  to combat the perception that the personnel security process is being  used to circumvent procedural protections ordinarily provided to federal  employees subject to adverse employment actions, and that individuals  are not being treated in a fair and consistent manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS and DOD Do Not Readily Know Employment Outcomes of Individuals with Revoked Clearances Because Data Are Not Readily Available", "paragraphs": ["DOD and most DHS components cannot readily ascertain the  employment outcomes of individuals whose clearances had been  revoked, because these data are not readily available. Within DOD,  officials representing all DOD civilian and military personnel\u2014in the Army,  the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and Washington Headquarters  Services\u2014stated that they do not track and would not be able to report  the human capital outcomes of employees with revoked security  clearances. For example, Army officials explained that there is a  resignation code in their human capital database, but that code covers all  resignations for any reason, and there may or may not be a remark on the  agency\u2019s personnel action form (known as an SF-50) that would relate the  resignation to a security clearance issue. Moreover, Army officials  explained that if an individual were removed as a result of a security  clearance revocation, the removal code could be attributed to failing to  meet any one of several conditions of employment, if maintaining  eligibility for a security clearance was one of the requirements listed in an  individual\u2019s position description. An official from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness explained that the  separation codes applied for military personnel are similarly broad in  nature, and would include separations for reasons other than revocation  of a security clearance.", "Officials in some DHS components said they could manually gather  information about employment outcomes from clearance revocations, but  they explained that doing this would be labor-intensive because their  human capital system would need to be cross-referenced against the  personnel security system. For example, U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officials commented that there is no DHS or Immigration and  Customs Enforcement policy that requires the collection of data and  reporting of outcomes for employees with revoked security clearances,  but stated that they could determine the employment outcomes on a  piecemeal basis by making a data query for each employee record.  However, Coast Guard officials said that they maintain a spreadsheet of  all disciplinary and adverse actions taken against its civilian employees.  Similarly, Transportation Security Administration personal security  officials also stated that their component can identify the outcomes of  employees with revoked security clearances with help from human capital  officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Data ODNI Provides to Congress on Total Employees Eligible for Access to Classified Information May Include Inaccurate DOD Data", "paragraphs": ["The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires the  President to submit an annual report to Congress on, among other things,  the total number of personnel security clearances across the government,  categorized by government employees and contractors who held or were  approved for a security clearance. In response to this requirement,  ODNI has prepared and submitted a report each year, with the most  recent report being issued for fiscal year 2013. However, we found that  the DOD data that are included in this report to Congress likely overstate  the total number of DOD employees eligible to access classified  information, in part because JPAS does not have up-to-date information  about the current population of DOD employees. Without accurate data,  DOD\u2019s ability to reduce the total population of clearance holders and  minimize risk and reduce costs to the government will be hampered. To  measure performance, it is important that organizations have sufficiently  complete, accurate, and consistent data to document performance and  support decision making. Further, one of the five internal control  standards that define the minimum level of quality acceptable for internal  control in the federal government states that information should be  recorded within a time frame that enables management to carry out  responsibilities, and that operational information is needed in part to  determine whether the agency is complying with applicable laws and  regulations.", "The number of employees eligible to access classified information was obtained from  JPAS, and includes all employees who had an active or valid confidential, secret, top  secret, or sensitive compartmented information eligibility at the end of fiscal year 2013,  and who did not have a separation date recorded in JPAS prior to the end of the fiscal  year.", "Washington Headquarters Services provides human capital support and manages the personnel  security process for several DOD components and agencies.", "When we asked DMDC officials for their opinions on why the number of  employees eligible to access classified information was greater than the  total number of employees for some of the DOD components, they  provided some possible explanations for the discrepancy. For example,  DMDC officials explained that the database includes individuals who have  newly enlisted into the military services but who may not have begun their  enlistment period yet, and this would not be included in the employee  totals. However, we reviewed data reported by the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness for fiscal years 2010 through 2012,  and found that the total number of all personnel who joined each year (not  just those who joined with a delayed entry date) each year ranged from  about 43,000 to 44,000 for the Air Force and around 40,000 to 42,000 for  the Marine Corps, which is too few to explain the discrepancy of almost  200,000 for Air Force military personnel and 125,000 for Marine Corps  military personnel.", "Furthermore, DOD officials said that the information in JPAS may not  reflect changes in personnel status such as separations due to  retirements, employee job transfers, and deaths. DMDC officials  explained that JPAS receives data from the components\u2019 personnel  centers, and DMDC is dependent on the components to send separation  information. As a result, the number of DOD clearance holders included in  the report to Congress likely overstates the total number of DOD  employees eligible to access classified information because it may  include people whose clearance eligibility has not yet expired, but who  have separated from the department, since JPAS was not updated to  reflect that separation information. ODNI officials stated that because  DOD has the largest number of eligible persons in the federal  government, any overstatement of DOD\u2019s data will have a greater effect  on the reported totals than for other agencies.", "DMDC officials stated that since management of JPAS transitioned to  DMDC in June 2010, DOD has conducted an extensive study on the  quality of JPAS data. Specifically, they stated that DMDC has conducted  more than 127 data-quality initiatives affecting 165 million records. These  initiatives include examining records where the access level did not match  the eligibility level (such as where a person has top-secret access but  only secret eligibility) and identifying duplicate records. In addition, a  DMDC official said that the team working on the migration from JPAS to  the new system has identified data-quality issues that they are working to  resolve.", "Until DOD takes steps to review and analyze the discrepancies in the  total number of employees and the number of employees eligible to  access classified information, and address any problems identified, DOD  will be unable to rely on the information provided by JPAS to get an  accurate understanding of the total number of DOD employees eligible to  access classified information. The lack of visibility over this total will  impede the department\u2019s ability to implement recommendations to  improve the security clearance process. For example, the February 2014  OMB report on the security, suitability, and credentialing processes  recommended that federal agencies reduce the total population of  clearance holders to minimize risk and reduce costs. However, until  DOD has an accurate baseline of the number of clearance holders in the  department, DOD will be unable to determine the extent that it can or has  reduced the number of clearance holders in accordance with this  recommendation. Furthermore, having inaccurate data about the number  of clearance holders within DOD will hinder the department\u2019s ability to  provide oversight and accurate, complete information about security  clearance eligibility to Congress as required by statute, to other offices  within the department, and to interagency stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In an environment where reciprocity of personnel security clearances is  required among federal agencies, the consistent and transparent  application of the processes governing whether individuals should retain  their access to classified information has become increasingly important,  so that all agencies can have reasonable assurance that only trustworthy  individuals obtain and keep security clearances.

In  the absence of requirements to track or report security clearance eligibility  data and related metrics, DHS and DOD do not have key revocation data,  such as the number of proposed revocations, to help oversee the  revocation process or determine their workload for planning purposes.", "Although both DHS and DOD are generally meeting their responsibilities  and providing information to employees about most of their rights under  the two executive orders governing the revocation process, until Army,  Navy, and Coast Guard guidance is updated, some employees could  potentially be denied some of the protections provided in the executive  orders. Additionally, given the different interpretations of the executive  order and other obstacles to implementation of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s  direction to consolidate DOD\u2019s PSABs, in the absence of a resolution of  these issues by the DOD General Counsel, DOD will be unable to  implement the Secretary of Defense\u2019s direction to eliminate the overlap in  this function.", "Further, DHS, DOD, and some of their components have implemented  the requirements from the executive orders in different ways. Without  consistent processes for all employees, regardless of which component  they work for, employees within DHS may experience different  opportunities to cross-examine witnesses during the revocation process.  In addition, without performance measures to assess the quality of the  personnel security clearance revocation process, the ODNI, DHS, and  DOD lack information to identify and resolve potential problems in the  process, and make informed decisions about potential changes to the  program. Further, until the DNI, as the Security Executive Agent, reviews  the efficiency and effectiveness of the existing revocation processes, it is  unknown whether having different processes, for military and civilian  personnel and for contractors, and having inconsistencies among DHS  and DOD, is the most appropriate approach to meet national security  needs. Finally, without specific guidance from DHS and DOD on what  information should be shared between personnel security and human  capital offices, and when that information should be shared, DHS and  DOD cannot ensure that individuals are treated in a fair and consistent  manner. Similarly situated individuals who lose their security clearance  may lose their employment or remain employed and be reassigned,  based on their supervisor\u2019s discretion.", "Moreover, without accurate data about the number of current DOD  military and federal civilian employees eligible to access classified  information, DOD is not well positioned to provide the information  Congress has requested.

Table 5 provides a complete list of the agencies we contacted  for our review.", "To examine the extent to which DHS and DOD track data to oversee their  revocation processes, and what these data show, we analyzed relevant  executive orders and DHS and DOD personnel security clearance  revocation policies to identify the extent to which they are required to  maintain or report data and documentation on their security clearance  revocation and appeals processes. We compared those requirements to  leading practices, and assessed the extent that the policy requirements  comply with these leading practices.obtained DHS and DOD personnel security clearance revocation and  appeal data.", "In addition, we requested and  Revocation data for DHS was provided by DHS\u2019s Office of the Chief  Security Officer using its system for managing and standardizing  personnel security processes and data, the Integrated Security  Management System (ISMS). Personnel security records maintained in  ISMS include suitability and security clearance investigations, which  contain information related to background checks, investigations, and  access determinations. The reported DHS security clearance revocation  and appeals data include DHS military personnel and federal civilian  employees within DHS Headquarters and the DHS operational  components. DHS revocation cases for its contractor employees are  processed by DOD and were not included in the DHS data. Although we  requested data from fiscal years 2009 through 2013, DHS officials from  Office of the Chief Security Officer could only provide revocation data for  fiscal years 2011through 2013, because not all of the DHS operational  components had been using ISMS to manage personnel and  administrative security case records until recently. DHS Headquarters  migrated data from its legacy system into and began using ISMS in May  2008; Federal Emergency Management Agency migrated to ISMS in May  2009; U.S. Customs and Border Protection migrated in October 2009;  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement migrated in December 2009;  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services migrated in December 2009;  U.S. Coast Guard migrated in July 2011; Transportation Security  Administration migrated in December 2012; and U.S. Secret Service  migrated in May 2013.", "To provide the revocation data we requested regarding the number of  revocations and the reasons for the revocation under the adjudicative  guidelines, DHS queried ISMS and then validated those results with each  of its operational components. The components made changes to the  ISMS data when they determined that the data entered into ISMS did not  track with what they had tracked elsewhere. DHS officials said that the  differences were likely based on data entry and system use issues. The  total number of revocation cases and the total number of revocation  cases that went to the Security Appeals Board represents DHS military  and civilian employees\u2019 revocation cases that were closed in that  particular fiscal year. We found that the total number of cases where a  revocation proceeding was initiated could be higher because ISMS does  not track cases where a person separated from the agency before a final  decision was made on a proposal to revoke a personnel security  clearance. In addition, the total number of military and civilian employees  eligible to access classified information represents a current snapshot in  time as ISMS does not track historical security clearance numbers. To  corroborate the accuracy of the ISMS total number of DHS employees  eligible to access classified information at each component, we compared  this information to the total number of employees at six DHS components  (U.S. Coast Guard, Transportation Security Administration, Federal  Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and U.S.  Customs and Border Protection).

Officials from  the Office of the Chief Security Officer told us that ISMS has a module,  called the Appeals Case, that could provide information about the number  of initial appeals, but because use of this module is not required, only a  few DHS components use it. Furthermore, officials from the Office of the  Chief Security Officer told us that ISMS cannot track case timeliness data  as a whole across the DHS components, because each appeal level  would be saved as a different appeals case module entry, but the officials  explained that they could determine this information for a particular case  by looking at the individual ISMS records. We analyzed the DHS  revocation data and supporting documentation, and discussed its  reliability with DHS officials, and found the data to be sufficiently reliable  to report on the number of employees whose personnel security  clearance was revoked in DHS, and the reasons for the revocations.", "Revocation data for DOD military and federal civilian personnel and for  industry or contractor personnel government-wide was provided by the  Defense Manpower Data Center from DOD\u2019s Joint Personnel  Adjudication System (JPAS), which is DOD\u2019s system of record for  personnel security management to record and document personnel  security actions. DOD security clearance revocation and appeals data  include military personnel and federal civilian employees within the  military services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps) and the  defense agencies (referred to as Washington Headquarters Services).  Data for government-wide contractors (also referred as industry  personnel) is collectively grouped as one entity because Defense  Manpower Data Center officials informed us that data on contractor  personnel do not indicate the agency with which an individual\u2019s contract is  associated. We met with officials from the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Intelligence and the Defense Manpower Data Center (the  administrator of JPAS) to discuss the approach for our data request and  to get their feedback. We requested JPAS data extracts showing the total  number of persons eligible to access classified information, the number of  security clearance revocations, the reasons for a revocation decision, the  number of appeals, the number of favorable and unfavorable appeal  decisions, the type of appeal selected by the individual (personal  appearance or in writing), and the time values at different intervals of the  revocation and appeal process. We requested that all of these data be  broken out by each DOD component for DOD military personnel, DOD  federal civilian employees, and government-wide contractor employees  for fiscal years 2009 through 2013.", "Furthermore, while we requested DOD data on the number of employees  that filed an appeal, appeal outcomes, and the average amount of time it  takes to complete a revocation case, these data were not available.  Although there are fields in JPAS where this information can be recorded,  we found that these fields were not consistently being used in JPAS.", "Defense Manpower Data Center officials initially provided mock-ups of  the data request that excluded these data fields or left them blank. When  we asked about this, Defense Manpower Data Center officials stated that  it is their agency\u2019s practice not to provide information from data fields with  less than 50 percent fill rates. We asked that Defense Manpower Data  Center to provide all the requested data along with an additional  worksheet to show the data fill rate percentage, so we could report on the  extent that these data fields had not been used.", "To corroborate the accuracy of the JPAS revocation data for DOD military  and civilian employees, we asked DOD officials from the DOD  Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) to provide us with the number  of revocations processed by their adjudicators for the military  departments\u2019 military and civilian employees for fiscal years 2009 through  2013. We compared the JPAS data received from Defense Manpower  Data Center with the data provided by the DOD CAF and we found that  the data did not match. We determined that the discrepancy with the DOD  CAF data was likely caused by a difference in the periods and  populations included in the counts.", "To corroborate the accuracy of the JPAS revocation data for contractor  personnel, and data regarding the personal appearance for DOD military  and civilian employees, we asked DOD officials from Defense Office of  Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to provide information on the number of  contractor hearings and appeals performed, and their outcomes, for fiscal  years 2009 through 2013 and the number of personal appearances for  DOD military and civilian employees and their outcomes for fiscal years  2009 through 2013. We compared the JPAS data received from the  Defense Manpower Data Center with the data provided by DOHA and we  found that the data did not match. We determined that the discrepancy  with the contractor data from DOHA was a result of the inclusion of  clearance denials, which the DOHA database was unable to separate  from clearance revocations. Security clearance denials were not part of  the scope of this review. We analyzed the DOD revocation data and  supporting documentation, and discussed their reliability with DOD  officials, and found the data to be sufficiently reliable to report on the  number of military personnel and federal civilian employees and  contractors whose personnel security clearances were revoked in DOD,  and the reasons for the revocations.", "To examine the extent to which DHS and DOD consistently implemented  government-wide requirements in their revocation processes, we  obtained and reviewed the policies and procedures DHS, DOD, and their  components use when revoking an employee\u2019s access to classified  information, interviewed DHS and DOD officials about whether these  processes are being uniformly applied within each department and across  the departments, and discussed the officials\u2019 suggestions for improving  the revocation process. In addition, we reviewed Executive Orders 12968  and 10865, which establish the overall process for revoking an  employee\u2019s security clearance, to identify agency and employee rights  and responsibilities during the clearance revocation process. We then  analyzed DHS and DOD template or redacted sample communication  letters sent to employees during the revocation and appeal process by  each component within DHS and DOD to determine whether they provide  employees notice of their security clearance revocation rights and  responsibilities under Executive Orders 12968 and 10865. Two analysts  independently reviewed and assessed the DHS and DOD communication  letters to determine whether they contain the 14 key rights and  responsibilities for military, civilian, and contractor employees provided by  Executive Order 12968 and the three additional rights for contractor  employees provided by Executive Order 10865. For DHS military and  civilian employees, we reviewed the Notice of Determination, the Notice  of Review, and the Security Appeals Board decision letter. For DOD  military and civilian employees, we reviewed the Statement of Reasons,  the Letter of Revocation, and the PSAB decision letter. For contractor  employees government-wide, we reviewed a Statement of Reasons, the  administrative judge\u2019s decision letter, and the DOHA Appeal Board  decision letter. The analysts then compared their results to identify any  disagreements and reached agreement on all items through discussion.  We reviewed processes for civilian and military personnel within DHS and  DOD, excluding the intelligence community, and for industry or contractor  personnel that are part of the 23 executive-branch agencies that follow  the DOD guidance and process.", "Additionally, we interviewed officials from DHS, DOD, and their respective  components to discuss (1) how they are following their policies, (2) how  employee rights and responsibilities factor into the security clearance  revocations process, and (3) how and under what circumstances they  communicate with employees who are subject to the security clearance  revocation process. When we identified discrepancies in following policies  or communicating with employees, we contacted appropriate DHS and  DOD officials to determine the reasons for such discrepancies and their  potential effect. We also met with DHS, DOD, and ODNI officials to  discuss the oversight they provide over executive-branch agencies\u2019  personnel security revocation processes, their suggestions for building  quality into the revocation process, and whether there are currently any  metrics or reporting requirements related to personnel security clearance  revocations.", "To examine the extent to which DHS\u2019s and DOD\u2019s respective human  capital and personnel security clearance revocation policies enable the  departments to determine the employment status of their federal civilian  and military employees subject to revocation in a consistent manner, we  analyzed department-level and component level DHS and DOD human  capital guidance\u2014specifically their respective guidance for misconduct,  discipline, and adverse actions, such as a table of penalties\u2014and  personnel security guidance. We assessed the extent that this guidance  could be used to systematically determine what actions the agencies  should take regarding the employment status of individuals subject to the  clearance revocation and appeals processes, and what employment  actions, such as reassignment or separation, are typically taken if an  employee\u2019s personnel security clearance is revoked. In addition, we  assessed the extent to which the different sources of guidance are linked  or are cross-referenced, and assessed what communication is required to  take place between an agency\u2019s personnel security office and human  capital office during the course of a clearance revocation proceeding. We  also interviewed human capital officials at DHS, DOD, and their  components to obtain their perspectives on the extent that DHS and  DOD\u2019s human capital practices regarding the employment status of  individuals subject to revocation are linked to and aligned with personnel  security policies related to security clearance revocation, and the extent  that there is communication between an agency\u2019s personnel security  office and a human capital office during the course of a clearance  revocation proceeding.", "In addition, we analyzed DHS\u2019s, DOD\u2019s, and the components\u2019 guidance to  determine whether the departments required tracking of any data  regarding the employment outcomes of individuals whose personnel  security clearances were revoked. We also discussed with DHS and DOD  officials what data regarding employment outcomes were available at the  department and component level. For this objective, within DHS, we  focused on the three DHS components that had the largest number of  personnel security clearance revocations from fiscal years 2011 through  2013, which were the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, and U.S. Secret Service. Within DOD, our review included  the headquarters-level elements of the Departments of the Army, the  Navy, and the Air Force; the Marine Corps, and the Washington  Headquarters Services. Contractor personnel were not included in the  scope of this objective, as the human capital policies applicable to  contractors would be those of their private-sector employers.", "To assess whether DOD\u2019s personnel security management system  accurately reports the total number of DOD employees eligible for access  to classified information, we compared the total number of DOD  employees eligible for access to classified information reported by DOD\u2019s  personnel security management system to the total number of DOD  employees in each component. To corroborate the accuracy of the JPAS  total number of military and federal civilian employees eligible to access  classified information, we compared this information with total military  personnel end strength and civilian personnel full-time equivalents from  the Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller\u2019s National Defense Budget  Estimates (Green Book). We assumed that the total number of military  and civilian employees in each component should be higher than the total  number of military and civilian employees who were eligible to access  classified information, because not all DOD employees should be  required to have clearance eligibility. However, we found that the total  number of military and civilian employees eligible to access classified  information in fiscal year 2013 as reported by JPAS was higher than the  total number of military and civilian employees listed in the fiscal 2013  military personnel end strength and civilian personnel full-time equivalent  data found in the DOD Green Book. We met with officials from Defense  Manpower Data Center to discuss the discrepancies. Regarding the  disparity in the revocation data, the Defense Manpower Data Center  officials stated that they could not speak for the accuracy of the data  derived from the Green Book, since full-time equivalents would  undercount the total number of individuals employed, due to issues such  as two part-time individuals occupying one full-time position. As a result,  they believed that it would not be appropriate to compare these data  against the total number of persons eligible to access classified  information. DMDC officials subsequently agreed to provide us with  counts for the total numbers of DOD active-duty and reserve military  personnel and federal civilian employees for fiscal year 2013.", "To determine the total number of DOD active-duty military personnel who  were employed at any time in each active component during fiscal year  2013, data were taken from the Automated Extract of Active Duty Military  Personnel Records. DMDC calculated the total number of active-duty  military personnel by adding the totals from all 12 monthly files for fiscal  year 2013 that were counted and reported as part of official active  component strength. After combining the 12 files, duplicate personnel  were dropped based on Social Security number and service. This  methodology could potentially double-count individuals if someone  transferred from one active service to another active service (e.g., if an  individual transferred from active duty in the Army to active duty in the  Navy).", "To determine the total number of DOD reserve personnel who were  employed at any time in each component during fiscal year 2013, data for  reserve personnel were taken from the Reserve Components Common  Personnel Data System. Reserve personnel data includes all Reserve  categories in the Reserve and National Guard (Ready Reserve, Standby  Reserve, and Retired Reserve). DMDC calculated the total number of  reserve personnel by adding the totals of all members of the reserve  components from all 12 monthly files for fiscal year 2013. combining the 12 files, duplicate personnel were dropped based on Social  Security number and service.", "This count excludes reserve personnel who were counted within the active end strengths  of the components, which is usually those who serve on active duty for more than 180  days. permanent and non-full-time permanent employees.12 files, duplicate personnel were dropped based on Social Security  number and service. This methodology could potentially double-count  individuals if someone transferred from one agency to another agency  (e.g., if an individual transferred from an Army civilian position to a Navy  civilian position).", "Using these total employee counts, we still found that the number of DOD  employees who were eligible to access classified information in five  components exceeded the actual number of DOD employees in those  components. Regarding the disparity in the revocation data, Defense  Manpower Data Center officials stated that JPAS completeness and  accuracy of the data is dependent on the users entering the data. They  further stated that information in JPAS may not reflect the loss of  personnel\u2014due to changes such as retirements, employee job transfer,  and deaths\u2014in the different agencies in DOD, because the department\u2019s  personnel centers can only send in separation dates for their personnel  for a limited period and the personnel centers may not enter or correct an  employee\u2019s status during this period. As a result, we did not find the JPAS  data on the number of current military personnel and federal civilian  employees and contractors who are eligible to access classified  information to be reliable.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2013 to September 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
