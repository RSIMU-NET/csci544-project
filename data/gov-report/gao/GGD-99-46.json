The commissioner selected to serve as Chair is the Dean of Regent University\u2019s Robertson School of Government.", "NGISC\u2019s enabling legislation directed that NGISC contract with the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations and NAS-NRC for some of its research. The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations contract was to include a thorough review and cataloging of all applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances that pertain to gambling in the United States. The NAS-NRC contract was to include an assessment of pathological or problem gambling, including its impact on individuals, families, businesses, social institutions, and the economy.", "The legislation that established NGISC does not specify the branch of government in which NGISC is located. In our view, NGISC is a legislative branch entity. As explained in an August 13, 1997, letter from the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) to NGISC, NGISC is a legislative branch entity because (1) six of the nine members are appointed by the congressional leadership, (2) congressional leadership has the majority role in choosing the Chair of the Commission, and (3) only information gathering and advisory functions are performed by NGISC.Because NGISC is a legislative branch entity, General Services Administration (GSA) found NGISC to be exempt from the procurement and personnel laws that apply to executive branch agencies. GSA also concluded that FACA applies to NGISC.", "NGISC\u2019s enabling legislation specifies that the Chair may, without regard to civil service laws and regulations, appoint and terminate an executive director and other personnel necessary for NGISC to perform its duties. In 1997, legislation was passed to clarify that NGISC members and personnel are considered to be federal employees under the Federal Tort Claims Act and would not incur personal liability while acting within the scope of their employment at NGISC. In response to a request from GSA, on January 26, 1999, the Department of Justice\u2019s OLC issued an opinion concluding that NGISC is not subject to 18 U.S.C. 208, a criminal conflict of interest statute.", "To address the objectives of this report, we interviewed GSA officials, NGISC employees, NGISC\u2019s Chair and two of her staff from Regent University, located in Virginia Beach, VA, and an official from NAS-NRC.

Appendix I provides further details about our scope and methodology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Applicability of and Compliance With FACA", "paragraphs": ["Is NGISC subject to FACA and, if so, did it follow FACA with respect to three specific meetings?", "FACA establishes requirements pertaining to the creation, operation, duration, and review of covered advisory committees. For example, the act requires advisory committees to file charters, publish notice of their meetings, open their meetings to the public, and make their minutes and other committee records publicly available. Whether a particular group is subject to FACA\u2019s requirements depends on whether it is an advisory committee to the President or a federal agency.", "GSA concluded that NGISC is an advisory committee to the President and is therefore subject to FACA. NGISC\u2019s outside counsel reached a contrary conclusion primarily based on the view that NGISC was not established to advise the President, but rather to study the impact of gambling to advise the Congress and state and tribal governments. For the reasons explained in appendix II and summarized below, we believe that NGISC is an advisory committee under FACA.", "FACA\u2019s definition of an advisory committee is broadly worded and includes, in relevant part, any commission that is established by statute, the President, or an agency \u201cin the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government.\u201d FACA section 3(2), 5 U.S.C. app. 2. The definition does not cover committees that are established solely to advise the Congress. However, a committee can be established in the interest of advising the President or the executive branch, and thus subject to FACA, even though part of the purpose of the committee is to report to the Congress.", "As recognized by the courts and OLC, the starting point for determining whether a commission was established in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or an executive agency is the text of the commission\u2019s authorizing legislation. In this case, the text of the NGISC Act clearly identifies the President as a recipient of NGISC\u2019s advice and recommendations. Specifically, section 4(b) of the NGISC Act provides that NGISC \u201cshall submit to the President, the Congress, State Governors, and Native American tribal governments a comprehensive report of the Commission\u2019s findings and conclusions, together with any recommendations of the Commission.\u201d", "In support of its position that FACA does not apply to NGISC, NGISC\u2019s outside counsel relied on OLC\u2019s opinion in Applicability of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the Native Hawaiians Study Commission (\u201cNative Hawaiians\u201d), 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 39, 1982. In Native Hawaiians, OLC concluded that the Native Hawaiians Study Commission was not an advisory committee to the President because, even though the Commission was required to provide the President as well as the Congress with a copy of its final report, the Commission\u2019s recommendations were to be provided only to the Congress. Further, the legislative history of the Native Hawaiians Study Commission\u2019s authorizing legislation established that it was created to provide advice and recommendations to the Congress and not to the President.", "Unlike the statutory provisions addressed in Native Hawaiians, the NGISC Act does not draw a distinction between the types of work results to be provided to the Congress and the President (i.e., a copy of the report with and without recommendations). Rather, as discussed above, the NGISC Act places the President, the Congress, and the other listed recipients of the Commission\u2019s work on an equal footing by requiring NGISC to provide each recipient with (1) a report on its findings and conclusions and (2) any recommendations it has developed. Further, there is nothing in the legislative history of the NGISC Act to suggest that the Congress viewed NGISC\u2019s work as being directed to the Congress rather than to the President or that it otherwise intended for FACA not to apply to NGISC. The only specific reference to FACA was made during the Senate\u2019s consideration of H.R. 497, the bill that eventually was enacted as the NGISC Act, and this statement was to the effect that FACA was intended to apply to NGISC. Accordingly, we conclude that NGISC is an advisory committee subject to FACA.", "While the NGISC\u2019s outside counsel ultimately concluded that FACA does not apply to NGISC, NGISC has taken steps to comply with FACA\u2019s requirements. For example, before its first meeting, NGISC filed a charter with GSA. NGISC designated an official (the current Executive Director) to serve as NGISC\u2019s Designated Federal Officer; under FACA this official, among other things, is responsible for approving and attending committee meetings.

FACA requires that each meeting of an advisory committee be open to the public (unless, for an advisory committee that is advising the President, approval is received from GSA to close a meeting) and that appropriate notice of each meeting be published in the Federal Register.

Because the subcommittee identified issues to be considered by the full Commission, the subcommittee meeting was not required to be open under FACA.

NGISC did not publish a 15-day advance notice of the meeting in the Federal Register, as required by FACA\u2019s implementing regulations. A GSA official agreed that this was a departure from the notice requirement.", "According to the current Executive Director, NGISC did not publish a 15- day advance notice of the teleconference due to time constraints. Two days before the teleconference, NGISC faxed a notice of the teleconference to approximately 730 people from the media and general public that expressed interest in NGISC activities. This fax stated that NGISC would make available a number of listening lines for interested members of the press and public and would allow interested individuals to listen live to the teleconference at NGISC\u2019s Washington, D.C., office.

This notice stated that meetings conducted by the full Commission and, where possible, those of its subcommittees would be fully open to the public unless otherwise announced at least 15 days in advance of the meeting. For the February retreat, the notice indicated that the meeting would be conducted by the full Commission, gave the dates of February 8 to 10, 1999, and provided the conference center\u2019s name and address where the retreat would be held. The notice stated that further details on times and locations of specific meetings would be made available 15 days in advance of the meeting on NGISC\u2019s website and advisories would be distributed to individuals and organizations in its Fax directory. This approach for providing notice of the NGISC\u2019s meetings was adopted with the concurrence of the GSA official responsible for FACA compliance.

Fundamentally, these procedures should entail identification of potential sources for the goods and services the agency is procuring and a reasonable effort to seek competition among them. Further, the agency\u2019s procurement actions should be documented in writing for management review purposes and to assist in the resolution of disputes over billings or costs.", "To determine the procedures used by NGISC in the award of its major contracts, we reviewed NGISC\u2019s award of three contracts: one each for (1) legal services, (2) research consulting services, and (3) a national survey on American gambling behavior and the creation of a database on the economic and social impacts of gambling.

First, she said that she contacted several persons, including two former United States attorneys general, to identify individual attorneys or law firms that would meet her criteria. Secondly, she said that she and others contacted about 8 to 10 of the referrals she received to determine whether they met her criteria, ascertain their interest and availability, and inquire about their fees.

These time sheets showed that he accounted for at least 80 hours and that he often worked more than 80 hours every 2 weeks. His time sheets from October 1997 through February 1998 sometimes identified the number of work hours being charged for work at his residence and on the train. He also provided a record of the tasks he performed at the locations other than NGISC\u2019s office.", "According to NGISC\u2019s current Executive Director, his predecessor authorized NGISC\u2019s former Deputy Director to begin working on a full- time basis at a location other than NGISC\u2019s office starting in the later stages of her pregnancy. According to the NGISC\u2019s Administrative Officer, the former Deputy Director was employed by NGISC between November 1997 and January 1999 and reported first to the previous Executive Director and subsequently to the current Executive Director. The Administrative Officer said there was no written work schedule for the former Deputy Director approved by a supervisor, which showed the number of hours she was scheduled to work at home. According to the current Executive Director, the former Deputy Director began working at her home on a full-time basis in October 1998, but she discontinued this arrangement after her first week because she went on maternity leave. The current Executive Director provided a log of the work that the former Deputy Director had done during the time she worked at home and said that she had completed the work she was expected to do outside NGISC\u2019s office.

NGISC\u2019s former Executive Director, the former Research Director\u2019s supervisor, did not sign the work schedule and said that she had not asked to see the work schedules of NGISC\u2019s staff. The former Executive Director approved a leave request for New Year\u2019s week that was a part of the former Research Director\u2019s work schedule; but this approval, although on the same page as the work schedule, appeared to relate only to the requested days of leave. According to the former Executive Director, she was aware of the former Research Director\u2019s schedule of working at home on Fridays but was not aware that he was counting work done on the train as official work time. The former Executive Director indicated that the former Research Director\u2019s work schedule was in place when she began working for NGISC. Further, she said the former Research Director generally completed the assigned work. NGISC\u2019s Administrative Officer said that he did not have written work schedules with supervisory approval for any of its employees.", "According to NGISC\u2019s Administrative Officer, he did not believe a written agreement for the former Research Director covering work at alternate locations was necessary because the former Research Director was not working at these alternate locations on a full-time basis. The Administrative Officer provided us with a draft of such an agreement for the former Deputy Director, but he said she discontinued working at her residence before the agreement was completed. Further, NGISC\u2019s time and attendance process did not require its supervisor to approve employees\u2019 official time sheets. NGISC\u2019s process provided for each employee to complete an internal time and attendance form showing his or her work time and provide this internal form to the Administrative Officer, who was to then prepare the official time sheets and sign them before transmitting them to GSA. The Administrative Officer said that the former Executive Director and the former Deputy Director would sometimes review the time sheets, but that was not done routinely.", "We found no evidence that the two NGISC employees who were authorized to work at locations other than NGISC\u2019s office did not work the hours scheduled or did not accomplish the work they were expected to complete. However, there appears to be a misunderstanding concerning the approval of the former Research Director\u2019s work while commuting on the train. In addition, according to the NGISC\u2019s Administrative Officer, NGISC did not have employee work schedules or time sheets approved by their supervisor.", "We are not aware of any specific policy that applies to legislative branch entities like NGISC regarding work at a location other than an employee\u2019s official workstation on a regular basis. Nonetheless, the circumstances described above indicate that when employees at an entity such as NGISC want to work regularly at alternate work locations, there should be documentation of advance supervisory approval and a mechanism for ensuring that the employees worked as scheduled. Without such controls, the entity is vulnerable to misunderstandings and other potential problems that could arise with employees who work at alternate work locations.", "We discussed the vulnerabilities associated with NGISC\u2019s time and attendance process with the current Executive Director. The Chair and current Executive Director have agreed to require each NGISC staff member to have a work schedule approved by the Executive Director and to require that each employee\u2019s time sheet be approved by the Executive Director.

As described in detail in appendix II, the legislation authorizing the Native Hawaiians Study Commission and its legislative history established that the Native Hawaiians Study Commission was created to provide advice and recommendations to the Congress and not to the President; thus, it was not subject to FACA. In contrast, the NGISC Act requires NGISC to provide the President, the Congress, and the other specified recipients with a report on its findings and conclusions and any recommendations it has developed.

We prepared our own legal opinion on the applicability of FACA based on a review of the legislation that established NGISC, FACA, and relevant opinions on FACA.

(2) To determine NGISC\u2019s process for awarding major contracts, we reviewed the three largest contracts it awarded, excluding the two required by NGISC\u2019s enabling legislation. We limited our review to determining how NGISC chose the contractors, i.e., whether competition was sought and if not, whether reasonable justification existed for not doing so. We reviewed NGISC\u2019s contract files and other documents that included information on the selection processes used.

Essentially, the opinion maintained that the Commission was not established for the purpose of providing advice to the President or an executive agency, but rather to study the impact of gambling in order to advise Congress, the states, and tribal governments. In this connection, the outside counsel relied on a 1982 opinion issued by OLC, in which OLC concluded that FACA was inapplicable to the Native Hawaiians Study Commission (NHSC). See Applicability of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the Native Hawaiians Study Commission (hereinafter Native Hawaiians), 6 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 39 (1982). In Native Hawaiians, OLC found that although the NHSC was required to furnish the President with a copy of its final report, the text of NHSC\u2019s authorizing legislation and its legislative history established that the commission was created to provide advice and recommendations to the Congress and not to the President.", "As additional support for its conclusion that FACA does not apply to NGISC, the outside counsel\u2019s opinion pointed to (1) a provision in the NGISC Act that it viewed as being duplicative of the requirements of FACA; (2) the absence of a requirement in the NGISC Act that the executive branch utilize the commission\u2019s work product; and (3) the fact that neither funding for, nor management of the study comes from the executive branch. However, the opinion concluded with the caveat that since \u201cno controlling authority on this issue exists . . . a court therefore could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d", "GSA continues to view NGISC as an advisory committee subject to FACA.In an October 9, 1998, letter responding to a request from Senator Bryan, GSA stated that \u201cur review of . . . the statute creating the NGISC, its legislative history, and  opinion does not alter our conclusion that FACA is applicable to the Commission.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Applicable Legal Framework", "paragraphs": ["\u201c(2) The term \u2018advisory committee\u2019 means any committee, board, commission, council, conference, panel, task force, or other similar group, or any subcommittee or other subgroup thereof . . . which is\u201d  (A) established by statute or reorganization plan, or  (B) established or utilized by the President, or  (C) established or utilized by one or more agencies, in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies or officers of the Federal Government. . . .\u201d", "The above-quoted definition is broadly worded and in relevant part includes any commission that is established by statute in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or one or more agencies.

Cir. 1996).", "As the NGISC outside counsel\u2019s opinion notes, there are no court cases specifically addressing the issue of FACA\u2019s applicability to NGISC. However, two court cases cited in the opinion have examined FACA\u2019s applicability to committees serving more than one purpose and apply an analytical framework that is useful in examining the status of NGISC. \u201cCongress expressly stated the purpose for the establishment of the panels\u2014improving health care by developing, reviewing, and updating guidelines for use by clinical health care practitioners. In light of that express purpose, the court will not lightly infer any other purpose, such as reducing health care costs by giving advice to the Secretary regarding Medicare reimbursement policy . . . Although  may consult  when setting Medicare reimbursement policy, and Congress may have intended that  do so, it does not follow that Congress\u2019 purpose in authorizing the panels . . . was to provide advice or recommendations to .\u201d 61 F.3d at 935-36.", "Because the panel\u2019s authorizing legislation expressly designated the intended beneficiaries of its guidelines, the court stated that HHS\u2019s \u201csubsequent and optional use\u201d of the guidelines in administering Medicare policy would not render the panel an advisory committee subject to FACA.", "In California Forestry Ass\u2019n v. United States Forest Service, 102 F.3d 609, the Forest Service unsuccessfully argued, based on Sofamor Danek, that it was only an incidental recipient of a research panel study that was being prepared for submission to the Congress. The concept for the panel originated in a provision of an appropriations act that allocated funds to be used for forest research and conference report language explaining that a panel should be convened to study forests of the Sierra Nevada. The Forest Service sought more specific guidance, and it received two letters from multiple members of Congress framing the scope of the study and directing that the study results be submitted to the Congress.", "The court in California Forestry distinguished Sofamor Danek, noting that in Sofamor \u201cthe statute designated the primary user\u201d of the Low Back Panel whereas, \u201cere we have no similar statutory directive\u201d (102 F.3d at 613). In the absence of a statutory directive, the court looked to the circumstances surrounding the creation and use of the research panel and found that, among other things, the study results were expected to form an important part of the Forest Service\u2019s long-term plan for ecosystem management. Thus, although the research panel had been created at the behest of and was responsible for reporting to the Congress, the Forest Service was not merely a subsequent and optional user of the study (102 F.3d at 612).", "Finally, the core legal authority relied on by NGISC\u2019s outside counsel is OLC\u2019s opinion in Native Hawaiians, cited above. As indicated previously, the outside counsel\u2019s opinion draws parallels between NGISC and NHSC, maintaining that, like NHSC, NGISC is not an advisory committee because it was established to advise the Congress (and others) but not the President or a federal agency. Because the Native Hawaiians opinion is central to the outside counsel\u2019s conclusions and involves an extensive analysis of FACA\u2019s applicability to NHSC, it is summarized in some detail below.", "In Native Hawaiians, OLC framed the issue as \u201chether the Native Hawaiians Study Commission was established to advise the President or federal agencies or solely to advise Congress,\u201d and stated that the answer \u201cmust be determined by reference to the Commission\u2019s authorizing act.\u201d Turning to the NHSC\u2019s authorizing legislation, the NHSC Act, OLC noted that the NHSC\u2019s basic mission was to \u201cconduct a study of the culture, needs, and concerns of Native Hawaiians.\u201d The act provided that, after NHSC completed its study, it was to publish a draft report summarizing the study\u2019s findings, solicit comments on the draft from various sources, and prepare a final report with copies to be sent to the President and two congressional committees. Finally (and according to OLC \u201cmost importantly\u201d), the NHSC Act required the Commission to \u201cmake recommendations to the Congress based on its findings and conclusions .\u201d", "Reviewing the provisions summarized above, OLC noted that the fact that the President was to receive a copy of NHSC\u2019s final report could imply a relationship for the transmittal of advice between NHSC and the President. However, OLC found that several factors weighed against NHSC being considered an advisory body to the President. First, OLC found it significant that the NHSC Act drew a distinction between the NSHC\u2019s final report, which was to contain factual findings, and its recommendations, which were to be made only to the Congress and apparently transmitted separately. Second, OLC stated that, even if the final report could be characterized as advice, it was unclear that such advice was really meant for the President, where (as discussed below) various factors showed that the Commission was created to formulate policy recommendations to the Congress for future legislation. Accordingly, OLC stated that the fact \u201chat the President is to receive a copy of the study, perhaps simply as a courtesy or for his general information, does not mean the study was intended to advise him.\u201d", "The OLC mentioned two additional provisions in the NHSC Act that it viewed as at least indirectly suggesting that NHSC was not established to advise the President. The first provision required NHSC to publish public notice of its hearings, specifying the information to be included, and required NHSC to \u201ctake such other actions as it considers necessary to obtain full public participation\u201d in its study. According to OLC, the effect of this provision was to establish a modest open meeting goal for NHSC, and it would have been redundant if FACA\u2019s more prescriptive requirements had applied to the Commission. OLC also noted that the NHSC Act provided initial funding for NHSC from the contingent fund of the Senate, suggesting that NHSC was closely tied to the Congress.", "Although OLC viewed all of these factors as weighing against a conclusion that NHSC was formed to advise the President, it found that they did not resolve the issue conclusively. In OLC\u2019s view, the provision requiring NHSC to submit its final report to the President made NHSC\u2019s relationship with the President \u201csufficiently ambiguous\u201d to present a close question requiring resort to the NHSC Act\u2019s legislative history.", "As described in detail in Native Hawaiians, the NHSC Act\u2019s legislative history disclosed numerous indications that NHSC was established specifically for the purpose of advising the Congress. For example, OLC found that, in floor comments, the bill\u2019s two sponsors described NHSC as a body to advise the Congress (and referred to possible legislation resulting from the Commission\u2019s findings), without any mention of an advisory relationship with the executive branch. Tracing the evolution of the bill, OLC found that two predecessor bills had sought to establish a commission specifically to advise the Congress. One of these bills had been amended in committee to add the requirement that the commission\u2019s final report be submitted to the President, but the accompanying committee report did not comment on the change and continued to characterize NHSC as an advisory body to the Congress. Based on these and other \u201cclear indications . . . that the Commission was created to advise the Congress and not the President or federal agencies,\u201d OLC concluded that NHSC was not subject to FACA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis", "paragraphs": ["As recognized by the court cases and OLC opinion discussed above, the starting point for determining whether a commission was established in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the President or an executive agency is the text of the commission\u2019s authorizing legislation.

The balance requirement in the NGISC Act essentially implements FACA\u2019s direction in section 5(b)(2) that \u201cany . . . legislation  shall require the membership of the advisory committee to be fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee.\u201d In contrast, in Native Hawaiians, the NHSC Act requirements for open meetings were different from those imposed by FACA and thus supported an inference that FACA was not intended to apply.", "The outside counsel\u2019s opinion also maintains that an inference of FACA\u2019s inapplicability can be drawn from the fact that the NGISC Act does not require the executive branch to consider or utilize the commission\u2019s work product. However, FACA applies to any advisory committee established by statute in the interest of obtaining advice or recommendations for the executive branch; there is no further stipulation that, for FACA to apply, the recipient must be required to act on the advice or recommendations received. Rather FACA itself provides that within 1 year after a presidential advisory committee\u2019s report is issued, the President or his delegate must report to the Congress his proposals for action or reasons for inaction, with respect to the committee\u2019s recommendations.

While a commission\u2019s linkage to the legislative branch may, in combination with other factors, indicate that a commission was intended solely to advise the Congress (Native Hawaiians), it is not determinative of an entity\u2019s status as an advisory committee. FACA\u2019s definition of an advisory committee focuses on whether the committee has an advisory relationship with the President or a federal agency and not on the branch of government in which the committee is located.", "NGISC\u2019s status as a legislative branch entity with responsibilities to the Congress has no bearing on whether it is also responsible for providing advice to the President and is therefore subject to FACA. The Supreme Court, in commenting on the dual obligations of the Comptroller General to the legislative and executive branches, recognized that \u201cbligations to two branches are not . . . impermissible and the presence of such dual obligations does not prevent the characterization of the official with the dual obligations as part of one branch.\u201d See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 746 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring in the judgment). In this connection, in 1988, OLC determined that the National Economic Commission (NEC), which was charged with making recommendations to the President and to the Congress regarding methods to reduce the federal deficit, was in effect a legislative branch entity. Letter for Alexander H. Platt, General Counsel, National Economic Commission, from Douglas W. Kmiec, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (June 22, 1988). OLC reached this conclusion even though, as OLC noted in a later opinion, NEC\u2019s enabling legislation expressly made it subject to FACA.
