DSS grants clearances to contractor facilities so they can access and, in some cases, store classified information. In 2005, DSS monitored over 11,000 facilities\u2019 security programs to ensure that they meet NISP requirements for protecting classified information.", "In 2004 and 2005, GAO issued reports that examined DSS responsibilities related to facilities accessing or storing classified information. The first report assessed DSS oversight of facilities and DSS actions after possible compromises of classified information. The second focused specifically on DSS oversight of contractors under foreign ownership, control, or influence (FOCI). This testimony summarizes the findings of these reports and their relevance to the effective protection of technologies critical to U.S. national security interests\u2014 an area GAO designated as a governmentwide high-risk area in 2007."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DSS did not systematically collect and analyze the information needed to assess its oversight of both contractor facilities and contractors under FOCI. While DSS maintained files on contractor facilities\u2019 security programs and their security violations, it did not use this information to determine, for example, whether certain types of violations are increasing or decreasing and why. As a result, DSS was unable to identify patterns of security violations across all facilities based on factors such as the type of work conducted, the facilities\u2019 government customer, or the facilities\u2019 corporate affiliation. Identifying such patterns would enable DSS to target needed actions to reduce the risk of classified information being compromised. With regard to contractors under FOCI, DSS did not collect and track the extent to which classified information was left in the hands of such contractors before measures were taken to reduce the risk of unauthorized foreign access. GAO found instances in which contractors did not report foreign business transactions to DSS for several months.", "DSS\u2019s process for notifying government agencies of possible compromises to their classified information has also been insufficient. When a contractor facility reports a violation and the possible compromise of classified information, DSS is required to determine whether a compromise occurred and to notify the affected government agency so it can assess any damage and take actions to mitigate the effects of the suspected compromise or loss. However, for nearly 75 percent of the 93 violations GAO reviewed, DSS either made no determination regarding compromise or made a determination that was inconsistent with established criteria. In addition, in many cases in which DSS was required to notify the affected agencies of possible information compromises, the notification took more than 30 days; in one case, notification was delayed 5 months.", "Despite the complexities involved in overseeing contactor facilities and contractors under FOCI, DSS field staff lacked the guidance, tools, and training necessary to effectively carry out their responsibilities. According to DSS field staff, they lacked research tools and training to fully understand, for example, the significance of corporate structures, legal ownership, and complex financial relationships when foreign entities are involved\u2014 knowledge that is needed to effectively oversee contractors under FOCI. Staff turnover and failure to implement guidance consistently also detracted from field staff\u2019s ability to effectively carry out responsibilities.", ""]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made numerous recommendations aimed at improving NISP and DSS\u2019s oversight of classified information that has been entrusted to contractors.

The  Defense Security Service (DSS) within the Department of Defense (DOD)  administers NISP on behalf of DOD and other federal agencies. DSS grants  clearances to contractor facilities so they can access and, in some cases,  store classified information. In 2005, DSS monitored over 11,000 facilities\u2019  security programs to ensure that they met NISP requirements for  protecting classified information. We have issued two reports that  examined how DSS carried out its industrial security responsibilities. The  first report assessed DSS oversight of contractor facilities and DSS actions  after possible compromises of classified information. The second focused  specifically on DSS oversight of contractors under foreign ownership,  control, or influence (FOCI).", "Before I discuss our work on NISP, I would like to place the program in a  larger context. NISP is just one element within a myriad of laws,  regulations, policies, and processes intended to identify and protect  technologies critical to maintaining U.S. technological superiority on the  battlefield and to provide for the transfer of these technologies to foreign  parties in a manner consistent with U.S. economic, foreign policy and  national security interests. The government\u2019s other technology protection  programs include export control regimes, national security reviews of  foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies, the foreign military sales program,  the national disclosure policy process, and DOD\u2019s anti-tamper policy. Over  the past several years GAO has looked at each of these and identified  weaknesses in their implementation. These weaknesses have been  exacerbated by the increasingly globalized nature of the defense industrial  base and the increased pace of technological innovation worldwide. As a  result, in 2007, we designated the effective protection of technologies  critical to U.S. national security interests as a governmentwide high-risk  area, which warrants a strategic reexamination of existing programs to  identify needed changes and better ensure the advancement of U.S.  interests. I believe this hearing today contributes to that strategic  reexamination.", "This testimony is based on the cited reports, which were done in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provided a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NISP was established by executive order in 1993 to replace industrial  security programs operated by various federal agencies. The goal of the  national program is to ensure that contractors\u2019 security programs detect  and deter espionage and counter the threat posed by adversaries seeking  classified information. Contractor facilities must be cleared prior to  accessing or storing classified information and must implement certain  safeguards to maintain their clearance. The National Industrial Security  Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) prescribes the requirements,  restrictions, and safeguards that contractors are to follow to prevent the  unauthorized disclosure\u2014or compromise\u2014of classified information.", "DSS is responsible for providing oversight, advice, and assistance to U.S.  contractor facilities that are cleared for access to classified information.  Contractor facilities can range in size, be located anywhere in the United  States, and include manufacturing plants, laboratories, and universities.  Industrial security representatives work out of DSS field offices across the  United States and serve as the primary points of contact for these  facilities. Representatives\u2019 oversight involves educating facility personnel  on security requirements, accrediting information systems that process  classified information, approving classified storage containers, and  assisting contractors with security violation investigations. DSS  representatives also conduct periodic security reviews to assess whether  contractor facilities are adhering to NISPOM requirements and to identify  actual and potential security vulnerabilities.", "Contractors are required to self-report foreign business transactions on a  Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests form. Examples of such  transactions include foreign ownership of a contractor\u2019s stock, a  contractor\u2019s agreements or contracts with foreign persons, and whether  non-U.S. citizens sit on a contractor\u2019s board of directors. Contractors are  required to report changes in foreign business transactions and to update  this certificate every 5 years. Because a U.S. company can own a number  of contractor facilities, the corporate headquarters or another legal entity  within that company is required to complete the certificate.", "When contractors declare foreign transactions on their certificates and  notify DSS, industrial security representatives are responsible for ensuring  that contractors properly identify all relevant foreign business  transactions. They are also required to collect, analyze, and verify  pertinent information about these transactions. For example, by  examining various corporate documents, the industrial security  representatives are to determine corporate structures and ownership and  identify key management officials. The representatives may consult with  DSS counterintelligence officials, who can provide information about  threats to U.S. classified information. If contractors\u2019 answers on the  certificates indicate that foreign transactions meet certain DSS criteria or  exceed thresholds, such as the percentage of company stock owned by  foreign persons, the representatives forward these cases to DSS  headquarters. DSS headquarters works with contractors to determine  what, if any, protective measures are needed to reduce the risk of foreign  interests gaining unauthorized access to U.S. classified information. Field  staff are then responsible for monitoring contractor compliance with these  measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DSS Did Not Systematically Collect and Analyze Information to Identify Weaknesses and Institute Corrective Actions", "paragraphs": ["In overseeing contractor facilities and contractors under FOCI, DSS did  not systematically collect and analyze information to assess the  effectiveness of its operations. Without this analysis, DSS was limited in its  ability to detect trends in the protection of classified information across  facilities, to determine sources of security vulnerabilities, and to identify  those facilities with the greatest risk of compromise. In addition, DSS was  unable to determine whether contractors were reporting foreign business  transactions as they occurred or how much time a contractor facility with  unmitigated FOCI had access to classified information.", "In overseeing contractor facilities, we found DSS evaluated its  performance in terms of process factors, such as the    percentage of security reviews completed,    percentage of security reviews that covered all pertinent areas of  contractors\u2019 security programs,  length of time needed to clear contractor facilities for access to classified  information, and  length of time needed to clear contractor personnel for access to classified  information.", "While such indicators are important, they alone cannot measure where the  greatest risks are, the types of violations that are occurring, and by whom.  Performance indicators such as the ratings and number of findings that  resulted from security reviews would have provided an indication as to  whether DSS was achieving its mission. However, there were no such  indicators to determine overall facility ratings, the sources of the  violations, and their frequency. Without such information, DSS cannot  ensure facilities are protecting the classified information entrusted to  them.", "Similarly, DSS did not know how many contractors under FOCI were  operating under all types of protective measures and, therefore, was  unaware of the magnitude of potential FOCI-related security risks.  Although DSS tracked information on contractors operating under some  types of protective measures, it did not centrally compile data on  contractors operating under all types of protective measures. Specifically,  DSS headquarters maintained a central repository of data on contractors  under voting trust agreements, proxy agreements, and special security  agreements\u2014protective measures intended to mitigate majority foreign  ownership. However, information on contractors under three other  protective measures\u2014security control agreements, limited facility  clearances, and board resolutions\u2014were maintained in paper files in the  field offices. DSS did not aggregate data on contractors for all six types of  protective measures and did not track and analyze overall numbers. Such  analysis would allow DSS to target areas for improved oversight.", "The NISPOM requires contractors with security clearances to report any  material changes of business transactions previously notified to DSS. DSS  is dependent on contractors to self-report transactions by filling out the  Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests form. However, this form did  not ask contractors to provide specific dates for when foreign transactions  took place. Consequently, DSS did not know if contractors were reporting  foreign business transactions as they occurred and lacked knowledge  about how much time a contractor facility with unmitigated FOCI had  access to classified information. In addition, DSS did not compile or  analyze how much time passed before it became aware of foreign business  transactions. DSS field staff told us that some contractors reported foreign  business transactions as they occurred, while others reported transactions  months later, if at all. During our review, we found a few instances in  which contractors were not reporting foreign business transactions when  they occurred. One contractor did not report FOCI until 21 months after  awarding a subcontract to a foreign entity. Another contractor hired a  foreign national as its corporate president but did not report to DSS, and  DSS did not know about the change until 9 months later, when the  industrial security representative came across the information on the  contractor\u2019s Web site. In another example, DSS was not aware that a  foreign national sat on a contractor\u2019s board of directors for 15 months  until we discovered it while conducting our audit work.", "DSS also did not determine the time elapsed between the reporting of  foreign business transactions by contractors with facility clearances until  the implementation of protective measures or when suspensions of facility  clearances occurred. Without protective measures in place, unmitigated  FOCI at a cleared contractor increases the risk that foreign interests can  gain unauthorized access to U.S. classified information. We found two  cases in which contractors appeared to have operated with unmitigated  FOCI before protective measures were implemented. For example,  officials at one contractor stated they reported to DSS that their company  had been acquired by a foreign entity. However, the contractor continued  operating with unmitigated FOCI for at least 6 months. According to the  NISPOM, DSS shall suspend the facility clearance of a contractor with  unmitigated FOCI, and DSS relies on field office staff to make this  determination. Contractor officials in both cases told us that their facility  clearances were not suspended. Because information on suspended  contractors with unmitigated FOCI is maintained in the field, DSS  headquarters did not determine at an aggregate level the extent to which  and under what conditions it suspends contractors\u2019 facility clearances due  to unmitigated FOCI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Determinations of Information Compromise either Did Not Occur or Were Done Inappropriately", "paragraphs": ["Industrial security representatives often failed to determine whether  security violations by facilities resulted in the loss, compromise, or  suspected compromise of classified information or made determinations  that were not in accordance with approved criteria. Determinations of  loss, compromise, or suspected compromise are important because the  affected government customer must be notified so it can evaluate the  extent of damage to national security and take steps to mitigate that  damage. Even when representatives made an appropriate determination,  they often took several weeks and even months to notify the government  customer because of difficulties in identifying the customer. As a result,  the customer\u2019s opportunity to evaluate the extent of damage and take  necessary corrective action was delayed.", "The NISPOM requires a facility to investigate all security violations. If  classified information is suspected of being compromised or lost, the  facility must provide its DSS industrial security representative with  information on the circumstances of the incident and the corrective  actions that have been taken to prevent future occurrences. The industrial  security representative is to then review this information and, using the  criteria specified in DSS\u2019s Industrial Security Operating Manual, make one  of four final determinations: no compromise, suspected compromise,  compromise, or loss.", "If a determination other than no compromise is made, the Industrial  Security Operating Manual directs the representative to inform the  government customer about the violation so a damage assessment can be  conducted. However, for 39 of the 93 security violations that we reviewed,  industrial security representatives made no determination regarding the  compromise or loss of classified information. For example, in two cases  involving one facility, the representative made no determination of  compromise even though the facility reported the improper transmission  of classified information via e-mail. In another eight cases at another  facility, the representative made no determination despite employees\u2019  repeated failure to secure a safe room to ensure the protection of  classified information. In the absence of a determination, the government  customers were not notified of these violations and therefore were unable  to take steps to assess and mitigate any damage that may have occurred.", "For the remaining 54 violations that we reviewed, representatives made  determinations regarding the compromise or loss of information, but many  were not consistent with the criteria contained in DSS\u2019s Industrial Security  Operating Manual. Representatives made 30 inappropriate determinations,  such as \u201ccompromise cannot be precluded\u201d or \u201ccompromise cannot be  determined.\u201d For example, in nine cases, the same facility reported that  classified material was left unsecured, and the facility did not rule out  compromise. In each of these cases, the industrial security representative  did not rule out compromise but used an alternative determination. Senior  DSS officials informed us that industrial security representatives should  not make determinations other than the four established in the Industrial  Security Operating Manual because the four have specific meanings based  on accepted criteria. By not following the manual, representatives  introduced variability in their determinations and, therefore, their  decisions of whether to notify the government customer of a violation.", "The failure of representatives to always make determinations consistent  with the Industrial Security Operating Manual was at least partially  attributable to inadequate oversight. The Standards and Quality Branch is  the unit within DSS responsible for ensuring that industrial security  representatives properly administer the NISP. Branch officials regularly  test and review field office chiefs and representatives on NISP  requirements, particularly those related to granting clearances and  conducting security reviews. However, the Standards and Quality Branch  did not test or review how representatives responded to reported  violations and made determinations regarding compromise. As a result,  DSS did not know the extent to which representatives understood and  were consistently applying Industrial Security Operating Manual  requirements related to violations and, therefore, could not take  appropriate action.", "While the Industrial Security Operating Manual did not specify a time  requirement for notifying government customers when classified  information had been lost or compromised, DSS was often unable to notify  customers quickly because of difficulties in identifying the affected  customers. DSS notified government customers regarding 16 of the 54  reported violations for which representatives made determinations. For 11  of these 16 violations, DSS did not notify the customer for more than 30  days after the contractor reported that information was lost,  compromised, or suspected of being compromised. In one case, 5 months  passed before an industrial security representative was able to notify a  government customer that its information was suspected of being  compromised. This delay was a result of the facility\u2019s inability to readily  determine which government customer was affected by the compromise.  DSS relied on the facility to provide this information. However, facilities  that were operating as subcontractors often did not have that information  readily available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DSS Did Not Always Provide Adequate Guidance, Training, and Tools to Field Staff", "paragraphs": ["DSS industrial security representatives faced several challenges in  carrying out their FOCI responsibilities, largely due to complexities in  verifying FOCI cases, limited tools to research FOCI transactions,  insufficient FOCI training, staff turnover, and inconsistencies in  implementing guidance on FOCI cases.", "For industrial security representatives, verifying if a contractor is under  FOCI is complex. Representatives are required to understand the  corporate structure of the legal entity completing the Certificate  Pertaining to Foreign Interests form and to evaluate the types of foreign  control or influence that exist for each entity within a corporate family.  For example, representatives are required to verify information on stock  ownership by determining the distribution of the stock among the  stockholders and the influence or control the stockholders may have  within the corporation. This entails identifying the type of stock and the  number of shares owned by the foreign person(s) to determine authority  and management prerogatives. Some industrial security representatives  told us they did not always have the tools needed to verify if contractors  are under FOCI. They conducted independent research using the Internet  or returned to the contractor for more information to evaluate the FOCI  relationships and hold discussions with management officials, such as the  chief financial officer, treasurer, and legal counsel. DSS headquarters  officials told us additional information sources, such as the Dun and  Bradstreet database of millions of private and public companies were not  available in the field.", "In addition, industrial security representatives stated they lacked the  training and knowledge needed to better verify and oversee contractors  under FOCI. For example, DSS did not require its representatives to have  financial or legal training. While some FOCI training was provided,  representatives largely depended on DSS guidance and on-the-job training  to oversee a FOCI contractor. In so doing, representatives worked with  more experienced staff or sought guidance, when needed, from DSS  headquarters.", "Despite DSS efforts to provide training on FOCI, we found that the training  needs on complex FOCI issues were still a concern to representatives. In  fact, many said they needed more training to help with their responsibility  of verifying FOCI information, including how to review corporate  documents, strategic company relationships, and financial reports. In  addition, officials from one-third of the field offices we reviewed noted  staff retention problems. DSS officials at two of these field offices said  that in particular they have problems retaining more experienced  industrial security representatives.", "Compounding these challenges are inconsistencies among field offices in  how industrial security representatives said they understood and  implemented DSS guidance for reviewing contractors under FOCI. For  example, per DSS guidance, security reviews and FOCI meetings should  be performed every 12 months for contractors operating under special  security agreements, security control agreements, voting trust agreements,  and proxy agreements. However, we found that some industrial security  representatives did not follow the guidance. One representative said a  contractor under a special security agreement was subject to a security  review every 18 months because the contractor did not store classified  information on-site. In addition, two industrial security representatives  told us they did not conduct annual FOCI meetings for contractors that  were operating under a proxy agreement and security control agreement,  respectively. We also found that industrial security representatives varied  in their understanding or application of DSS guidance for when they  should suspend a contractor\u2019s facility clearance when FOCI was  unmitigated. The guidance indicates that when a contractor with a facility  clearance is determined to be under FOCI that requires mitigation by DSS  headquarters, the facility security clearance shall be suspended until a  protective measure is implemented. However, we were told by officials in  some field offices that they rarely suspend clearances when a contractor  has unmitigated FOCI as long as the contractor is demonstrating good  faith in an effort to provide documentation to DSS to identify the extent of  FOCI and submit a FOCI mitigation plan to DSS. Officials in other field  offices said they would suspend a contractor\u2019s facility clearance once they  learned the contractor had unmitigated FOCI.", "In conclusion, we believe that the weaknesses identified in the NISP and  other programs designed to protect technologies critical to U.S. national  security present significant challenges and need to be addressed. Although  in its initial response to our reports, DOD did not agree with many of our  recommendations or the need for corrective actions, we understand that  DSS has subsequently begun to address some of the issues we raised.  While we have not reviewed any of these actions and therefore can not  address their potential effectiveness, we welcome DSS\u2019s recognition that  action is needed.", "Mr. Chairman this concludes my statement.
