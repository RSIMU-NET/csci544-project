While state and local agencies have primary responsibility for combating gang crime, the federal government has key roles to enforce laws and help fund programs to provide alternatives to gang membership for at-risk youth. GAO was asked to examine federal efforts to combat gang crime. This report addresses (1) the roles of DOJ and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in combating gang crime and the extent to which DOJ and DHS agencies coordinate their efforts with each other and state and local agencies; (2) the extent to which DOJ and DHS measure their gang enforcement efforts; and (3) how federal grant funding is used to administer or support activities to reduce gang-related crime. GAO reviewed federal agencies' plans, resources, and measures and interviewed federal, state, and local officials in 15 localities with federally led anti-gang task forces representing varying population sizes and locations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Various DOJ and DHS components have taken distinct roles in combating gang crime, and at the headquarters level, DOJ has established several entities to share information on gang-related investigations across agencies. However, some of these entities have not differentiated roles and responsibilities. For example, two entities have overlapping responsibilities for coordinating the federal response to the same gang threat. Prior GAO work found that overlap among programs can waste funds and limit effectiveness, and that agencies should work together to define and agree on their respective roles and facilitate information sharing. At the field division level, federal agencies have established strategies to help coordinate anti-gang efforts including federally led task forces. Officials GAO interviewed were generally satisfied with the task force structure for leveraging resources and taking advantage of contributions from all participating agencies. Federal agencies have taken actions to measure the results of their gang enforcement efforts, but these efforts have been hindered by three factors. Among other measures, one agency tracks the number of investigations that disrupted or shut down criminal gangs, while another agency tracks its gang-related convictions. However, agencies' efforts to measure results of federal actions to combat gang crime have been hampered by lack of a shared definition of \"gang\" among agencies, underreporting of information by United States Attorneys Offices (USAOs), and the lack of departmentwide DOJ performance measures for anti-gang efforts. Definitions of \"gang\" vary in terms of number of members, time or type of offenses, and other characteristics. According to DOJ officials, lack of a shared definition of \"gang\" complicates data collection and evaluation efforts across federal agencies, but does not adversely affect law enforcement activity. DOJ officials stated that USAOs have underreported gang-related cases and work, in part because attorneys historically have not viewed data collection as a priority. In the absence of periodic monitoring of USAO's gang-related case information, DOJ cannot be certain that USAOs have accurately recorded gang-related data. Further, DOJ lacks performance measures that would help agencies to assess progress made over time on anti-gang efforts and provide decision makers with key data to facilitate resource allocation. DOJ administers several grant programs to assist communities to address gang problems; however, initiatives funded through some of these programs have had mixed results. A series of grant programs funded from the 1980s to 2009 to test a comprehensive communitywide model are nearing completion. Evaluations found little evidence that these programs reduced youth gang crime. DOJ does not plan to fund future grants testing this model; rather, DOJ plans to provide technical assistance to communities implementing anti-gang programs without federal funding. DOJ also awarded grants to 12 communities during fiscal years 2006 to 2008 under another anti-gang initiative. The first evaluations of this initiative are due in late 2009, and no additional grants will be funded pending the evaluation results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["According to estimates from the Department of Justice (DOJ), the United  States has about 20,000 gangs and 1 million gang members, and gangs are  active in every U.S. state and territory and Washington, D.C. Once  considered a problem of urban areas of the country, gangs began  migrating in the 1980s and 1990s into suburban and rural communities, as  well. Gangs are involved in violent crimes such as armed robbery, assault,  homicide, and shootings. They dominate retail-level drug distribution  throughout the country, and they are increasingly becoming involved in  wholesale-level drug trafficking.", "While most of the responsibility for combating gang crime rests with state  and local law enforcement and social service agencies as well as  community and local faith-based organizations, the federal government  also has important responsibilities. The federal government\u2019s role includes  enforcing laws to combat gang crime and identifying and supporting  promising programs to help prevent young people from becoming gang  members or to intervene to provide at-risk youth with alternatives to being  part of a gang. DOJ and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), have  key roles in federal law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute  gang-related crimes. DOJ also administers programs to assist local  communities in efforts designed to prevent the spread of gangs and gang  crime, and sponsors evaluations of whether the strategies it supports are  effective in reducing gang-related crime.", "You asked us to review federal programs to combat gang violence and  coordination mechanisms among federal, state, and local agencies for anti- gang efforts. This report addresses the following questions: (1) What are  the roles of DOJ and DHS related to combating gangs, and to what extent  do DOJ and DHS agencies collaborate and coordinate their efforts in  combating gangs with each other and state and local partners? (2) To what  extent do DOJ and DHS measure the results of their gang enforcement  efforts? and (3) How does DOJ use grant funding to administer and/or  support activities to reduce gang-related crime and what have been the  reported results of grant-funded activities? We also provide information on  the nature and scope of the gang problem in the United States (see app. I);  federal statutes, including federal racketeering statutes, used to prosecute  gang members (see app. II); and factors to consider in developing and  implementing anti-gang approaches (see app. III).", "To examine the roles of DOJ and DHS agencies in gang enforcement  efforts and the extent to which their efforts are coordinated with other  federal, state, and local partners, we reviewed federal strategies and plans  to combat gang crime and interviewed headquarters DOJ, DHS, and  component agency officials involved in gang crime enforcement activities.  We reviewed DOJ\u2019s, DHS\u2019s, and components\u2019 strategic plans including  goals and objectives for efforts to combat gang crime. We compared DOJ  and DHS coordination and information sharing efforts to criteria in our  prior work on effective interagency collaboration and results-oriented  government. We also examined staffing levels and budgets for DOJ  agencies and ICE. To assess the reliability of statistical information and  budget data we obtained, we discussed the sources of the data with  agency officials and reviewed documentation regarding the compilation of  data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. Using semi-structured interview instruments, we  interviewed the U.S. Attorney or designated staff of U.S. Attorneys Offices  (USAO) and supervisory agents of DOJ and DHS law enforcement  agencies involved in investigating and prosecuting gang members in 15  localities across the country. We also reviewed anti-gang strategies and  other documentation of enforcement efforts to reduce criminal gang  activity in these localities. The localities we visited were Atlanta, Ga.  Baltimore, Md. Brooklyn, N.Y.; Chicago, Il. Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas, Tex.;  Durham, N.C.; Los Angeles, Calif.; Manhattan, N.Y.; Milwaukee, Wisc.;  Newark, N.J.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Raleigh, N.C.; Richmond, Va.; and Tampa,  Fla. We selected these localities based on a mix of criteria that included  population size, geographic location, violent crime rates, and receipt of  federal grants to address gang-related crime problems. Other criteria  considered in selecting these localities included the location of the USAO  and federal law enforcement agency field offices, the presence of federally  led task forces to combat gang crime, and suggestions from DOJ and DHS  components. In addition, we met with selected state and local prosecutors  and law enforcement officials in these localities to discuss the gang  problem in their area and the role of DOJ agencies and ICE in helping to  address it. The results of our site visits cannot be generalized across all  DOJ or ICE field offices and states and localities in the United States.  However, because we selected these sites and localities based on a variety  of factors, they provided us with an overview and examples of the  activities and coordination of DOJ and DHS efforts to combat gang crime,  including law enforcement as well as prevention and intervention  programs.", "To determine the extent to which federal agencies have measured the  results of their gang enforcement efforts, we first assessed how DOJ and  DHS components defined \u201cgang\u201d and gang-related crimes. We reviewed  data maintained by DOJ and DHS law enforcement agencies and U.S.  Attorneys on gang-related investigations and prosecutions, and we  interviewed headquarters officials. To assess the reliability of statistical  information we obtained, we discussed the sources of the data with  agency officials and reviewed documentation regarding the compilation of  data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this review. We also reviewed DOJ and DHS strategic plans,  budgets, and performance reports. We compared DOJ and DHS efforts to  measure the results of their gang enforcement efforts to criteria in our  prior work on effective interagency collaboration and results oriented  government. We also asked interviewees in the 15 localities we visited  how they measured the results of local gang enforcement efforts.", "To determine how DOJ administers and/or supports gang prevention,  intervention, and suppression programs through grant funding and the  programs\u2019 reported results, we examined documentation on DOJ\u2019s overall  approach and objectives for anti-gang grant programs as well as DOJ- sponsored evaluations and a guide on best practices to address  community gang problems. We also reviewed funding levels for fiscal  years 2007 and 2008 for the four DOJ grant programs that we identified as  being directly focused on anti-gang efforts. We interviewed DOJ  headquarters officials about the status of funding, sustainability of anti- gang programs without federal funding, and results of evaluations of the  effectiveness of the anti-gang grant programs, among other topics. Eight of  the 15 localities we visited had received federal grants for anti-gang  efforts, and we interviewed grant recipients to determine activities that  they were pursuing with the grant funds and how they planned to sustain  programs when federal funding expired. In addition, we interviewed USAO  officials in the 15 localities we visited to obtain information on their roles  in anti-gang efforts. We reviewed guidance on developing and  implementing comprehensive prevention, intervention, and suppression  programs and key documents related to the four federal grant programs,  such as grant applications. We also reviewed available nationwide  evaluations of grant programs sponsored by DOJ. We obtained  information and views from nine criminal justice researchers on how  effective the federal government has been in measuring its gang  suppression, prevention, and intervention activities; and on whether the  programs are sustainable without federal funding and likely to be  implemented by communities that did not receive federal grants based on  lessons learned from the federally funded projects. We identified the  researchers through a review of literature related to gangs and gang crime  issues, researchers\u2019 participation in gang-related conferences, and by  asking federal officials for recommendations.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2007 through July  2009, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Most gangs  nationwide are local neighborhood or street groups. Assessments by DOJ  and other organizations have identified gang crime problems nationwide  from large cities to rural communities. In many communities, criminal  gangs commit as much as 80 percent of crime, according to law  enforcement officials.

In addition, the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) fugitive task force program  assists law enforcement agencies in apprehending dangerous fugitives,  including gang members, who are not arrested after having been criminally  charged. ICE is the DHS agency with the largest role in investigating gang- related crimes, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is  responsible for interdicting gang-related illicit activities that cross United  States borders.", "Within DOJ, the Criminal Division, along with U.S. Attorneys, is charged  with enforcing most federal criminal laws. The Criminal Division can  prosecute a wide range of criminal matters, including many of those  involving gangs and gang members. Criminal Division attorneys are to  prosecute nationally significant cases and formulate and implement  criminal enforcement policy, among other responsibilities. The Criminal  Division oversees the investigation and prosecution of gang-related crimes  under five Deputy Assistant Attorneys General. Each one supervises three  or four sections dealing with specific violations of criminal law. The work  of each of the sections is driven by the type of criminal matter under  investigation (i.e., organized crime and racketeering, as well as narcotics  and dangerous drugs), not whether gangs and/or gang members are  involved in the crimes. As a result, according to a DOJ Criminal Division  official, all five Criminal Division deputy assistant attorneys general  oversee sections that deal with crimes and criminal matters that involve  gangs and gang members. The Criminal Division has also established the  Gang Unit to help coordinate multi-jurisdictional gang investigations and  prosecutions.", "The 93 U.S. Attorneys prosecute the majority of criminal cases as well as  civil litigation, handled by DOJ. In 2005, as part of a DOJ initiative to  combat gangs, the Attorney General instructed each U.S. Attorney to name  an anti-gang coordinator to work in consultation with federal, state, and  local agencies to develop a comprehensive anti-gang strategy focusing on  prevention and enforcement. EOUSA provides general executive  assistance and supervision to USAOs and has a national gang coordinator  who helps act as a liaison between the USAOs and other DOJ components  involved in gang prosecution efforts. EOUSA provides operational support  for information technology, training, and other functions, and prepares an  annual statistical report of U.S. Attorneys, among other functions.", "The FBI has jurisdiction to investigate a broad range of violations of  federal law including organized crime and violent crime that can involve  gangs and gang members. ATF, as part of its mission, conducts  investigations to reduce violent crimes involving firearms and explosives,  which frequently involve gangs and gang members. DEA is the nation\u2019s  single-mission drug enforcement agency with responsibility for enforcing  controlled substance laws and regulations. Some DEA priority  investigations target gangs involved in narcotics trafficking. USMS is the  enforcement arm of the federal courts with responsibilities including  apprehending fugitives from federal justice, protecting federal judges,  transporting federal prisoners, operating the witness security program,  and seizing property acquired by criminals through illegal activities.

FBI, ICE, and DEA are the  three federal law enforcement agencies that specifically track agent time  dedicated to gang enforcement efforts. These federal agencies have  dedicated a relatively small portion of overall agent resources to anti-gang  efforts, but these resource levels have increased since fiscal year 2003.

NGIC  has helped to facilitate information sharing on gang-related issues by, for  example, issuing intelligence bulletins to law enforcement agencies.", "Our work on effective interagency collaboration has shown that when  multiple agencies are working to address aspects of the same problem,  there is a risk that overlap or fragmentation among programs can waste  scarce funds, confuse and frustrate program customers or stakeholders,  and limit overall program effectiveness. Collaborating agencies should  work together to define and agree on their respective roles and  responsibilities and can use a number of possible mechanisms, such as  memoranda of understanding, to clarify who will do what, organize joint  and individual efforts, and facilitate information sharing. The  headquarters-level anti-gang entities have defined their individual roles  and responsibilities. Although some overlaps in mission may be  appropriate to help reduce gaps, these entities have not yet clearly  identified their differentiated roles and responsibilities, resulting in  possible gaps or unnecessary overlap in agencies\u2019 coordination and  sharing of information on gang enforcement efforts. Examples include:    The purpose of GangTECC is to allow participating agencies including ICE  to access and use each respective agency\u2019s gang intelligence, allow  immediate access to operational information in a collocated environment  and provide a national deconfliction center for gang operations. Although  the roles and participation by DOJ and its component agencies in  GangTECC were specified by the Deputy Attorney General in a July 2006  memorandum establishing GangTECC, as well as in the GangTECC  Concept of Operations, GangTECC and ICE have not yet documented  ICE\u2019s participation in the center. ICE\u2019s participation has varied since  GangTECC\u2019s inception. According to the head of ICE\u2019s National Gang Unit,  in the past ICE\u2019s representative to GangTECC was engaged with other  responsibilities at ICE headquarters, which periodically impacted the  amount of time that the representative spent at GangTECC. However, the  head of the National Gang Unit said that ICE\u2019s representative is assigned  to GangTECC on a full-time basis. ICE officials said that they are willing to  work with other GangTECC officials to develop a memorandum of  understanding that documents ICE\u2019s role and participation in the center  but had not yet done so at the conclusion of our audit work.", "Establishment of task forces at the field office level has not always been  fully coordinated with ICE. Specifically, according to Anti-Gang  Coordination Committee guidance, concurrence for each new gang or  violent crime task force at the field office level is to be obtained by  representatives of FBI, ATF, DEA, USMS, ICE, and the local USAO, as well  as local or state police departments. The Anti-Gang Coordination  Committee gives final approval to DOJ law enforcement agencies for  establishing new anti-gang task forces in field locations. According to the  Chief of the Gang Unit, this process for establishing new task forces in  field locations helps to reduce task force overlap and duplication of effort.  However, ICE did not have the opportunity to provide its concurrence for  the creation of all recently approved task forces, making it difficult for the  Anti-Gang Coordination Committee to ensure that there are no  unnecessary overlaps in the creation or mission of task forces. Our review  of the approval process for eight task forces authorized by the Anti-Gang  Coordination Committee from January 2008 through June 2008 found that  ICE\u2019s concurrence was not obtained in three instances. Moreover, ICE is  not represented on the Task Force Subcommittee of the Anti-Gang  Coordination Committee, which, on behalf of the committee, reviews and  provides recommendations concerning new task force applications. DOJ  officials said that no Memorandum of Understanding or other document  outlines ICE\u2019s participation in the process for approving task forces.", "GangTECC and the MS-13 National Gang Task Force have overlapping  missions and responsibilities for coordination and deconfliction of multi- jurisdictional investigations involving the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs. The  two entities have these overlaps in part because the MS-13 Task Force  already existed when GangTECC was established in 2006 and was not  dismantled or folded into GangTECC at that time. The two entities differ in  that GangTECC has participants from ATF, DEA, ICE, FBI, USMS, and  other DOJ and DHS components and has responsibility for coordinating  multi-jurisdictional investigations of all gangs except FBI-led  investigations involving the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs. The MS-13  National Gang Task Force, on the other hand, has only FBI participants  and is responsible for coordinating FBI\u2019s multi-jurisdictional investigations  involving MS-13 and 18th Street gangs. As a result, both entities coordinate  some multi-jurisdictional MS-13 and 18th Street gang investigations and  risk unnecessary federal resource expenditures to fund two entities when  a single group could be more efficient. The GangTECC and MS-13 Task  Force Directors acknowledged that there is overlap between the missions  and responsibilities of the two entities, and the chief of the DOJ Criminal  Division\u2019s Gang Unit also noted that the two entities have overlapping  jurisdictions and no formal coordination mechanisms. The Directors  stated that the two entities do share information about the gangs and were  co-located to encourage that interaction. Moreover, the director of  GangTECC said he had invited representatives of the MS-13 National Gang  Task Force to participate in meetings. As the invitation had been extended  just prior to the conclusion of our audit work, we were not able to assess  the level of participation. The Directors also said that while there is  mission overlap, it has not jeopardized investigations or law enforcement  operations. Nevertheless, the rationale for why two separate entities are  needed is unclear. For example, the Criminal Division chief said that if  DOJ were starting from scratch in creating a structure for coordinating  federal anti-gang investigations, the department would not have the  structure that currently exists because of the potential for this overlap.  While the overlap may not have interfered with investigations or  operations to date, it is not clear that this is the most efficient and  effective use of federal resources.", "Articulating and differentiating among roles, responsibilities, and missions  of headquarters-level anti-gang entities and ensuring ICE\u2019s full  participation in authorizing anti-gang task forces would help to identify  gaps or overlaps among the entities and participating agencies and help to  increase the understanding of federal, state, and local law enforcement  agencies of each of the entities\u2019 mission and goals.

These officials provided examples of  how these taskforces provide avenues through which federal, state, and  local agencies can directly share resources and partner in conducting gang  investigations, as noted below:    Ten of the twenty local police chiefs or supervisors of gang units that we  interviewed said that federally-led taskforces have resources to pay  informants, conduct wiretaps, and purchase vehicles for surveillance and  undercover operations; among other resources which state and local law  enforcement agencies often do not have, or the officials noted that local  law enforcement officers assigned to federally-led taskforces have better  access to technology and new investigative techniques than officers not  assigned to task forces. Use of these investigative tools and equipment  allow state and local agencies to work with federal agencies in conducting  investigations that target gangs as criminal enterprises, types of cases  which state and local agencies would generally not be able to conduct in  the absence of federal resources and assistance.", "Officials also provided examples of how task forces provide opportunities  for direct information and intelligence sharing among federal, state, and  local law enforcement agencies, as noted below:    Four of the twenty local law enforcement officials said that one of the  primary benefits to their agencies participating in federally led task forces  is access to information and intelligence on gangs. State and local officers  assigned to federally led task forces benefit by learning new investigative  techniques that they, in turn, can share with other local law enforcement  officers.", "In nineteen of the thirty four federal law enforcement field division offices  we visited, supervisory agents noted that their task forces also benefited  from state and local police officers\u2019 intimate knowledge of the gang  problems in their local communities.", "In addition to these benefits, several officials identified a challenge to the  task force structure that they work to overcome. In some cases, federal,  state, and local agencies that participate in task forces may have differing  priorities and interests for gang enforcement activities. For example,  supervisors at two FBI field divisions said that the FBI focuses on long- term gang investigations designed to eliminate entire gangs. In contrast,  they said that state and local law enforcement agencies tend to focus on  efforts to help reduce gang crime and violence in the short-term and look  for short-term results for their communities. Consequently, the officials  said that state and local law enforcement agencies are sometimes  reluctant to dedicate resources to support the long-term investigations, but  that these issues are worked through jointly by federal and local agencies  involved in the task force.", "In addition to task forces, interviewees in the localities we visited  described other mechanisms or tools for deconflicting law enforcement  actions, sharing information, and coordinating gang enforcement activities  with one another. In areas of the country identified by the White House  Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) as high intensity drug  trafficking areas (HIDTA), including New York City, Chicago, and Los  Angeles, the HIDTAs monitored law enforcement activities including anti- gang operations to deconflict and coordinate across law enforcement  agencies. In Richmond, Virginia, federal, state, and local agencies met  regularly to deconflict cases and discuss anti-gang initiatives through a  Cooperative Violence Reduction Partnership, which was created and  chaired by the Richmond Chief of Police. Similarly, in Tampa, Florida, the  Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Department and the Tampa Police  Department co-chair of a Multi-Area Gang Task Force composed of  representatives of 60 law enforcement agencies, including local, state and  county police departments, FBI, ATF, and ICE. The task force participants  share intelligence at monthly meetings and support one another in major  anti-gang operations.", "The USAOs also have responsibilities for coordinating anti-gang efforts in  their districts. For example, each of the 15 USAOs we visited had complied  with DOJ requirements to appoint an Anti-Gang Coordinator for the  district to help formulate the anti-gang strategies for their districts. The  Anti-Gang Coordinators implement training opportunities for prosecutors  and law enforcement agents and officers, act as liaisons for the USAO on  gang-related cases with prosecutors from other offices as well as law  enforcement officers and agents, and are proactively involved in  developing strategies for investigating and prosecuting gang members with  violent criminal behavior. Each USAO we visited had also completed a  districtwide anti-gang strategy, as required by the Attorney General in  2005. According to guidance from the Attorney General, USAOs were to  consult with federal, state, and local law enforcement; social service  organizations; and community and faith-based groups in their district to  develop the strategies. They included a description of the gang problem in  each district; a description of how agencies within the district were  responding or planned to respond to the problem; a description of whether  the district has a specific gang unit or the resources being used to  investigate and prosecute gangs; a description of the roles played by state  and local law enforcement agencies in combating gangs; and any  suggestions on how DOJ could more effectively address the gang problem  on a local or national level. Anti-Gang Coordinators are required to  prepare annual reports on the district\u2019s anti-gang strategy, which are  submitted to EOUSA and then provided to the Deputy Attorney General  who informs the Attorney General of anti-gang activities throughout the  nation. The reports are used to identify best practices, which are discussed  at national conferences and informally among prosecutors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Measures for Gang Enforcement Efforts, but Lack a Common Definition of \u201cGang\u201d and a DOJ Departmentwide Performance Measure", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have developed and used measures to assess their gang  enforcement efforts, but they lack a common or shared definition for  \u201cgang,\u201d hindering their efforts to measure and report on gangs, gang crime,  and enforcement activities.

For example, we noted that a  broadly accepted definition of \u201chomeland security\u201d did not exist and that  some officials believed it was essential that the concept and related terms  be defined, particularly because homeland security initiatives are  crosscutting, and a clear definition promotes a common understanding of  operational plans and requirements, and can help avoid duplication of  effort and gaps in coverage. Common definitions promote more effective  agency and intergovernmental operations and permit more accurate  monitoring of homeland security expenditures at all levels of  government.", "With respect to the definition of \u201cgang,\u201d DOJ and its components have  discussed needs and possibilities for developing a common or shared  definition for gangs in terms of numbers of members and organizational  characteristics, but have not yet reached consensus on such a shared  definition. DOJ developed a working definition of a \u201cgang\u201d as a group or  association of three or more persons who may have a common identifying  sign, symbol, or name and who are involved in criminal activity which  creates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation. The DOJ definition is used  by its component agencies such as ATF and FBI. ICE\u2019s working definition  of a gang also specifies that three or more persons must be involved in  criminal activity; however, ICE\u2019s definition requires that a gang crime be  an ongoing pattern of criminal activity committed on two or more separate  occasions. These working definitions are also distinct from a provision of  federal law, which, for specified purposes, defines a criminal street gang  as \u201can ongoing group, club, organization, or association of five or more  persons that has as one of its primary purposes the commission of one or  more of the described criminal offenses; the members of which engage, or  have engaged within the past 5 years, in a continuing series of described  offenses; and the activities of which affect interstate or foreign  commerce.", "According to the FBI\u2019s National Gang Strategy, a universal definition for a  \u201cgang\u201d would facilitate intelligence collection and sharing, target selection,  prosecution, and overall program management. The DOJ Criminal Division  Gang Unit Chief recognized that having a standard definition of \u201cgang\u201d  across agencies and departments would result in better statistics on how  agencies are performing on gang-related criminal investigations. Other  DOJ components also identified negative impacts resulting from the  absence of a shared definition. For example, in its 2009 National Gang  Threat Assessment, DOJ reported that one of the greatest impediments to  the collection of accurate gang-related data was the lack of a national  uniform definition of a gang used by all federal, state, and local law  enforcement agencies. EOUSA officials also said that lack of consistent  definitions of \u201cgang member\u201d and \u201cgang-related crime\u201d contributed to  underreporting of gang-related cases by USAOs; therefore, EOUSA may  not have complete data on its gang-related cases.

Agency  officials said lack of a common definition did not adversely affect law  enforcement activity. According to the Chief of the Gang Unit, agencies  have not attempted to reach a consensus on a shared definition of \u201cgang\u201d  because, while consistent use of the term would improve the quality of  information available on federal efforts to combat gang violence, it would  not make a difference in the cases investigated and prosecuted by federal  agencies. For example, this official noted that a consistent definition of  \u201cgang\u201d has no impact on U.S. Attorneys\u2019 decisions to prosecute cases nor  on the charges brought against gang-related defendants. Although lack of a  common definition for \u201cgang,\u201d may not negatively affect gang  investigations and prosecutions, the absence of a common or shared  definition for \u201cgang\u201d and related terms makes it difficult for federal  agencies to completely and accurately report on gang-related data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Lacks a Departmentwide Performance Measure for Anti-Gang Efforts", "paragraphs": ["At the department level, DOJ lacks a performance measure for anti-gang  efforts.

GPRA requires federal agencies  to develop strategic plans and performance goals and to identify resources  needed to achieve them, as well as for agencies to develop performance  measures to use in assessing the relevant outputs, service levels, and  outcomes of each program activity.

Second, the systems have become more complex to use as additional  codes are created to record information on cases and time spent on  various activities to respond to congressional interest, DOJ priorities, and  audits. Third, attorneys, historically, have not viewed data entry as a  priority, so they have not always been diligent about being sure that it is  done correctly. With regard to collecting data specifically on gang-related  cases, EOUSA officials identified other specific challenges. For example,  extra data entry steps are required to enter information on gangs into  LIONS and USA-5 beyond those steps required for inputting general case  information to the systems.

The grant had been used to provide services to  a large number of young people and other residents, and it resulted in  collaborative partnerships among social service agencies and community  service providers and, to an extent, between law enforcement and social  service agencies. Figure 10 shows several services and programs that  received funding under the grant.", "Communities we visited that received funding under the Comprehensive  Anti-Gang Initiative also were using, or planned to use, the grants for a  wide variety of activities. For example, in Dallas, Tex., program officials  said that gang prevention activities would take place primarily in schools.  The officials planned to use the law enforcement component of the  initiative for police overtime for operations designed to get gang members  off of the streets in targeted areas. The re-entry component funds were to  be used to implement a comprehensive strategy to assist offenders to  prepare for release while still in prison and then offer services on their  release from prison. In Tampa, Fla., the city\u2019s \u201cGang Out\u201d program  provided many prevention activities. For example, in June 2008, more than  1,200 at-risk youth aged 7 to 14 in nine neighborhoods identified as \u201chot  spots\u201d for gang activity were participating in \u201cGang Out\u201d programs.  Children were referred to the program by law enforcement, social  services, school officials, parents, or others, and they were provided  access to a variety of structured services and activities according to their  needs (i.e. mental health counseling, tutoring, mentoring, field trips, and  participation on sports teams). Tampa officials said they were using the  law enforcement portion of the grant to help pay overtime for law  enforcement task forces investigating gang crime, and to develop a  database to facilitate information sharing among federal, state, and local  law enforcement agencies. Re-entry funding was being used to provide  counseling, job placement assistance, housing, and other services to ex- gang members about to exit prison and return to the Tampa area. Figure  11 shows one young Gang-Out participant at work on an anti-gang mural  and the mural the young people completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Reported Lessons Learned and Grant Recipients Reported Benefits, but Projects Had Mixed Results and Were Difficult to Sustain", "paragraphs": ["DOJ sponsored evaluations of OJJDP grant programs that reported both  benefits and challenges faced by communities in implementing  comprehensive anti-gang models and awarded a contract to Michigan  State University for a national evaluation of BJA\u2019s Comprehensive Anti- Gang Initiative. Cosmos Corporation completed an evaluation of the Gang  Free Schools and Communities program in November 2007. The Urban  Institute completed an interim evaluation of the Gang Reduction Program  in May 2008. The final evaluation of the Gang Reduction Program was not  completed in April 2009 as scheduled because OJJDP officials said that the  evaluators were waiting to receive additional data from one demonstration  site and anticipated that the evaluation would be completed in 2009. The  officials did not provide a revised estimated completion date for the  evaluation. Officials said that no evaluation component of the Gang  Prevention Coordination Assistance Program was funded because funding  levels awarded to communities for gang prevention coordinator positions  were relatively small amounts of $200,000 or less. With respect to BJA\u2019s  Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative, Michigan State University is expected  to complete an interim report in late 2009 and provide it to NIJ, the OJP  component handling the evaluation of the program.", "According to DOJ-sponsored evaluations, grant recipients benefited in  various ways from the grant programs. First, grant recipients received  federal funds to implement gang enforcement, prevention, intervention,  and reentry programs that they might otherwise not have been able to  implement. These programs benefited those individuals who participated  in them. For example, the evaluation of the Gang-Free Schools and  Communities Program found that each of the four communities awarded  grants implemented the programs according to requirements by providing  outreach and social services to at least 100 youth in targeted communities  and neighborhoods. The youth served ranged in age from 12 to 24 years  with a median age of 16.2 years, and 75 percent of the participating youth  were gang members. Second, grant recipients received technical  assistance and support from OJJDP and BJA to implement their  approaches to addressing gangs. For example, the interim evaluation of  the Gang Reduction Program found that significant implementation  successes were achieved at all four of the sites. Each grantee developed  strategic plans consistent with target area needs and problems and  achieved broad participation in planning the program. Communication  about gang issues within the target area and among participating  organizations generally improved over the course of the program. Third, as  a result of having federal funds and participating in a grant program, sites  obtained needed leverage to bring together a wide range of stakeholders,  such as law enforcement agencies, social service providers, and faith- based and community groups, to address communities\u2019 gang problems.", "Despite these benefits, the projects reported mixed results in achieving  reductions in gang crime. For example, evaluations of OJJDP-funded  programs\u2014the Gang-Free Schools and Communities Program and the  Gang Reduction Program\u2014showed that, while grantees were successful in  doing strategic planning, forming community partnerships, and  implementing programs, and their experiences offered insights on best  practices, they found little evidence that the programs effectively reduced  youth gang crime. In particular, the Gang-Free Schools and Communities  Program evaluation concluded that while some measures of gang crime  decreased and each location had anecdotal evidence of success with some  individuals, overall, the program had little positive effect on the targeted  youth who participated in the programs. Similarly, the preliminary  evaluation of the Gang Reduction Program found that the program had not  achieved its goal of reducing gang crime. One location, Los Angles, Calif.,  had a decrease in gang crime rates. The other locations had no changes or  slight increases in gang crime after program implementation.", "In addition, communities that received funding under OJJDP\u2019s grants to  demonstrate the Comprehensive Community-Wide Anti-Gang Model faced  difficulties in sustaining their programs after federal funding ended. No  sites that received grant funds under the Rural Gang Initiative sustained  the project with local funding or new grants after federal funding ended.  Likewise, by 2004, all of the communities that had received funding under  the Gang-Free Communities program had used all of the federal funding  allocated and could not continue the programs with other funding sources.  Of communities that received funding under the Gang-Free Schools  program, Cleveland, Ohio did not sustain the program, however, as of  March 2009, three other communities that received grants were sustaining  at least some parts of their programs with other sources of funding. For  example, the Houston, Tex., and North Miami Beach, Fla., programs  received city funds; and the Pittsburgh, Pa., program received funding  from the School Board and Project Safe Neighborhoods. The project  coordinator in Pittsburgh, Pa., noted that sustainability is a great  challenge. According to the coordinator, sustaining a program that  targeted and enrolled about 100 gang-involved youth who lived or attended  school in the target area once federal funding expires was definitely  possible. However, expanding the program was a concern. For example,  the coordinator wanted the project to be able to serve girls in addition to  boys and increase efforts to provide services to youth reentering the  community after being detained in juvenile facilities, but she had not  identified funding sources to do so. Finally, OJJDP reported that very little  planning for sustainability of projects and services funded by the Gang  Reduction Program had taken place by 2006; however, in 2007, OJJDP  reported that three of the four communities that were awarded funding  under the Gang Reduction Program had taken steps toward sustaining at  least portions of the initiative beyond the federal funding period. For  example, in North Miami Beach, Fla., the initiative was incorporated as a  nonprofit organization in 2007 and in Richmond, Va., partnerships with the  Office of the Attorney General and Richmond Police Department ensured  that some efforts would be sustained.", "DOJ has not yet made decisions about whether to expand existing anti- gang grant programs or fund new programs in the future. In particular,  OJJDP and BJA officials told us that the department has not yet made  decisions about priorities and availability of funding for future anti-gang  programs. As of March 2009, OJJDP officials said that in the short term, no  plans are in process for funding future demonstration projects of the  Comprehensive Community-Wide Gang Program Model because OJJDP  plans to use the funding it has available to provide information and  technical assistance to communities nationwide to assist them in  implementing community-based anti-gang efforts using lessons learned  from the demonstration projects that have been completed or are  underway. To this end, in 2008, DOJ published a report on best practices  to address community gang problems based on OJJDP\u2019s comprehensive  gang model and lessons learned from the demonstration projects. The  report is available to interested communities through OJJDP\u2019s Web site,  and OJJDP officials said that they had discussed aspects of the report with  officials of communities that were interested in implementing the model.  According to OJJDP officials, communities in Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah,  and North Carolina are developing anti-gang programs based on OJJDP\u2019s  recommendations without federal funding, and have consulted OJJDP for  information on best practices and lessons learned. Since these programs  are all in the planning stages, it is too early to tell whether they will be  successfully implemented, reduce youth gang crime, and be sustainable by  the communities without federal funding. With regard to the  Comprehensive Anti-Gang Initiative, the BJA-sponsored evaluation of sites  funded under this program has not yet been completed, but the evaluation  will include assessments of programs\u2019 outcomes and sustainability, among  other things. As of April 2009, BJA officials said that the agency does not  currently plan to fund additional locations under the initiative in the short  term and that results achieved in the communities currently funded under  the program would be considered in making any future determination of  whether to expand federal funding for the initiative to additional  communities, and whether it is feasible for communities to implement the  model without federal funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Gangs have spread across community, state, and regional boundaries to  become a national problem, requiring federal agencies to strengthen their  coordination and collaboration on anti-gang programs and initiatives to  combat gang crime and violence. Carrying out gang enforcement,  prevention, and intervention efforts that involve multiple agencies with  varying jurisdictions and missions is not an easy task, especially since  agencies have limited resources and, in most cases, competing priorities.  Federal agencies have taken positive actions to coordinate their anti-gang  programs and initiatives and share information about gang threats and  multijurisdictional investigations. However, these actions have not  addressed all possible gaps or unnecessary overlaps in anti-gang  programs, nor have they addressed all of the challenges identified in this  report. Further actions by DOJ and DHS would enhance and sustain their  collaboration in combating gangs. In particular, differentiation of the roles,  responsibilities, and missions of headquarters-level gang coordination  entities\u2014including the MS-13 National Gang Task Force, NGIC, and  GangTECC\u2014could enhance DOJ and DHS\u2019s collaboration in combating  gang crime and reduce the potential for expending resources on  overlapping missions. Moreover, DOJ and DHS could strengthen their  efforts to more fully involve ICE in the task force review and approval  process. In addition, to assist Congress, federal agencies, and other  stakeholders in understanding and assessing gang enforcement efforts,  additional actions are needed on the part of DOJ and DHS to improve  performance measurement and evaluation. More specifically, consensus is  needed on a shared definition of \u201cgang\u201d and other related terms to help  federal law enforcement agencies improve their collection, evaluation, and  reporting on gang enforcement efforts. For DOJ, a departmentwide  performance measure for gangs is needed to help the department and  Congress track the progress of the department\u2019s overall gang enforcement  efforts. Additionally, at a component level, additional monitoring of the  extent to which USAOs track and record gang-related case information is  needed to ensure accurate reporting of such information within DOJ and  to external stakeholders, such as Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen federal agencies\u2019 coordination of anti-gang efforts; help  reduce gaps or unnecessary overlaps in federal entities\u2019 roles and  responsibilities; and assist the department, Congress, and other  stakeholders in assessing federal gang enforcement efforts, we  recommend that the Attorney General take the following three actions:    direct DOJ law enforcement agencies that lead or participate in the  headquarters-level anti-gang coordination entities\u2014including GangTECC,  NGIC, the Anti-Gang Coordination Committee, and the MS-13 National  Gang Task Force\u2014to, in consultation with DHS, reexamine and reach  consensus on the entities\u2019 roles and responsibilities, including identifying  and addressing gaps and unnecessary overlaps;    develop a departmentwide, strategic-level performance measure for the  department\u2019s anti-gang efforts; and    direct EOUSA to periodically review gang-related case information  entered by USAOs into the case and time management systems to ensure  more accurate and complete reporting of USAOs\u2019 gang-related cases.", "We also recommend that the Attorney General and the Secretary of  Homeland Security jointly take the following two actions:    ensure that ICE is part of the process for reviewing and approving the  creation of new anti-gang task forces and  jointly develop a common or shared definition of \u201cgang\u201d for use by DOJ,  DHS, and component agencies for reporting purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In providing written comments on a draft of this report, DOJ concurred  with three of our five recommendations and stated that it will consider the  other two recommendations.

DOJ commented that this role is  performed by the Anti-Gang Coordination Committee and that the  department will continue to work with ICE, the headquarters-level anti- gang entities, and other DOJ agencies to identify and address gaps and  unnecessary overlaps.", "Second, DOJ stated that the department will consider the recommendation  to develop a departmentwide strategic-level performance measure for its  anti-gang efforts as part of its strategic planning process. DOJ stated that it  is in the initial stages of developing its next strategic plan and that it is too  early in the planning process to state for certain that such a measure  would be included. DOJ commented that senior leadership will consider  including such a measure and that it recognizes that gangs are a major  factor in many crimes and that it is possible that raising the visibility of  DOJ\u2019s efforts to combat gangs would weigh in favor of including such a  measure. Given that efforts to address gangs have been a major part of  DOJ\u2019s overall approach to combating violent crime, we continue to believe  that a departmentwide performance measure for gangs would help DOJ  and Congress track the progress of the department\u2019s overall anti-gang  efforts.", "Third, DOJ concurred with our recommendation for EOUSA to review the  case and time management systems of the USAOs to ensure more accurate  and complete reporting of their gang-related cases and noted that  beginning in fiscal year 2010, USAOs will be specifically required to enter  gang-related information into the data management systems accurately  and in a timely manner. According to DOJ, compliance with this  requirement will be measured in performance evaluations of each USAO  approximately every 3 years by evaluation and review staff. We believe  this is a positive step that could help DOJ strengthen the completeness and  accuracy of USAOs\u2019 data on gang-related cases.", "Fourth, DOJ and DHS concurred with our recommendation to ensure that  ICE is part of the process for reviewing the creation of new anti-gang task  forces. DOJ and DHS said they would work on implementing a procedure  for reviewing the creation of new anti-gang task forces, and DOJ outlined  steps it has begun to take to address this recommendation.

DOJ noted that it will use  the Anti-Gang Coordination Committee as a forum to jointly consider a  common definition or otherwise develop an effective performance  measurement system for anti-gang activities. DHS concurred with the  recommendation.

While RICO was originally enacted to dismantle organized  crime groups such as the Mafia, prosecutors have successfully used it to  bring cases against members of organized gangs. RICO prohibits the  commission of a pattern of racketeering activity to invest in, maintain an  interest in, or participate in, directly or indirectly, an enterprise, the  activities of which affect interstate or foreign commerce; it also prohibits  conspiracy to commit any of these activities. The second statute, VICAR,  was intended to supplement RICO and makes it unlawful to commit any of  a list of violent crimes in return for anything of pecuniary value from an  enterprise engaged in racketeering activity, or for the purpose of joining,  remaining with, or increasing a position in such an enterprise. The listed  violent crimes are murder, kidnapping, maiming, assault with a dangerous  weapon, assault resulting in serious bodily injury, and threatening to  commit a crime of violence and may be violations of state or federal law.  The statute also makes unlawful attempt and conspiracy to commit the  listed crimes. To use these statutes to prosecute gangs, prosecutors must  prove several elements. In particular, prosecutors must prove that the  gang functions as an \u201centerprise\u201d  through evidence of an ongoing  organization, formal or informal, and by evidence that the various  associates function as a continuing unit. This may be accomplished by  showing that the gang holds meetings, has a specific, stated mission,  collects dues, and has a decision-making structure, among other  characteristics.", "DOJ requires that prosecutions under these statutes be coordinated with  DOJ Criminal Division and approved for prosecution by the Criminal  Division\u2019s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section.

One  USAO official explained that the organized crime statutes allow  prosecutors to tell the entire story of a gang\u2019s existence and criminal  activity in an indictment and later to a jury. The official noted that every  aspect of the gang and its history\u2014including how it acquired its territory;  how it makes and disposes of its money; how it uses coded language, hand  signals, and graffiti; and what crimes it has committed and why\u2014can be  offered in one coherent story during the trial. Gang cases prosecuted  under an organized crime statute generally have more co-defendants than  cases prosecuted under narcotics trafficking, firearms, and other violent  crime statutes. The officials explained that such cases allow prosecutors  to reach deep into the gang hierarchy to the top leaders of the gang  organizations and are generally well-publicized by the news media.", "Violations of the criminal provisions of RICO and VICAR carry significant  penalties. A gang member convicted under RICO is subject to up to 20  years imprisonment, or up to life imprisonment if the violation is based on  racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty includes life  imprisonment. Defendants also remain subject to conviction and  sentencing for the underlying or predicate crimes that make up the  racketeering activity. Additionally, the statute provides for the forfeiture of  property maintained or acquired in violation of the Act. Under VICAR,  conviction may result in up to life imprisonment depending on the  predicate offense committed; VICAR murder is a death-eligible offense.  Gang members convicted of crimes under RICO or VICAR may be fined up  to $250,000. RICO also contains a civil provision that allows people who  have been injured by a RICO defendant to recover damages in federal  court.", "USAO interviewees also cited limitations to the use of RICO and VICAR  statutes. RICO and VICAR cases are resource-intensive, time consuming,  and complex, according to some interviewees, and only suited to  prosecutions of highly structured gang organizations; not the local street  gangs that are the predominant gang crime concern in some localities.", "Although U.S. Attorneys do not maintain data on the number of gang- related organized crime cases they accept for prosecution, the total  number of organized crime cases they accept for prosecution is a small  percentage of the overall caseload. In fiscal year 2007, a total of 217  organized crime cases of all types, including gangs and traditional groups,  against 483 defendants were filed in the United States, about 0.4 percent of  the total cases filed\u2014and that figure was an increase of 39 percent from  the previous year.", "A case charged under organized crime statutes in Los Angeles, Calif.,  provides an example of the large commitment of time and investigative  and prosecution resources that are required for these complex cases that  result in indictments of leaders and members of large gang operations.", "A 3-year investigation of the Florencia 13 Gang in Southern Los Angeles,  Calif., resulted in indictments against 102 defendants on RICO and  narcotics trafficking charges. As of January 2009, 76 defendants had been  convicted with other cases pending trial. The defendants were alleged to  be part of a controlled drug distribution operation. Gang leaders were  charged with collecting fees and/or rent from gang members and others  engaged in criminal conduct in areas controlled by the Florencia 13 Gang.  Numerous federal and local law enforcement agencies were involved in  the investigation. Federal agencies included FBI, DEA, ATF, USMS, ICE,  and IRS. Local agencies included Los Angeles City Police Department, Los  Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s and Probation Departments, and local police  departments in five other area towns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Officials Said Enhanced Penalties for Gang Membership Are Generally Not Used Because the Elements Are Difficult to Prove", "paragraphs": ["As part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994,  Congress established an enhanced penalty for gang-related crimes by  authorizing the imposition of an additional term of imprisonment of up to  10 years for participation in certain federal felonies involving drugs or  violence by members of criminal street gangs. Some USAO officials we  visited said that the sentencing enhancement for gang members was  generally not used because the elements of proof required are difficult for  prosecutors to establish. For the defendant to be subject to the  enhancement, prosecutors must prove several elements. At the outset,  there are four components required to establish the \u201ccriminal street gang\u201d  under the statute: (1) an ongoing group, club, organization, or association  of five or more persons; (2) that has as one of its primary purposes the  commission of one or more specified felonies involving violence or drugs  in violation of federal law; (3) the members of which engage, or have  engaged within the past 5 years, in a continuing series of the same  specified felonies; and (4) the activities of the criminal street gang affect  interstate or foreign commerce. In addition, prosecutors must establish  that the defendant committed the crime for which he was charged to  promote the felonious activities of the gang or maintain or increase his  position in the gang; that the defendant had been convicted of another  crime of violence or drug offense arising to a felony under state or federal  law within the past 5 years; and that the defendant participates in a  criminal street gang with knowledge that its members engage or have  engaged, in a \u201ccontinuing series\u201d of federal felonies involving violence or  drugs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Important Elements of an Approach to Combating Gangs", "paragraphs": ["Federal and local agencies, research experts, and others we interviewed,  as well as research we reviewed, identified important elements for  consideration in developing and implementing an approach for combating  gangs. Among others, these elements include:  thorough assessment and understanding of local gang problem(s);   ongoing communication and coordination among stakeholders;    comprehensive and varied efforts (i.e., prevention, intervention,  suppression, and re-entry);   public and community outreach and visibility for programs;    plans for sustainability of programs and efforts; and commitment to long-   performance monitoring, evaluation, and feedback incorporation.", "Presence of these elements does not guarantee that an approach to  addressing gangs will be successful. These elements are important for  federal, state, and local agencies and communities to consider in  developing and implementing anti-gang approaches. In addition, these  elements should not be considered as an exhaustive list of items for  agencies and communities to consider in developing their anti-gang  approaches. Rather, these elements were identified as key considerations  by the agencies and individuals we interviewed and the research we  examined.", "Thorough assessment and understanding of local gang problem(s):  Agencies and individuals we interviewed and research we examined  indicated that it is important for agencies and communities to thoroughly  assess their gang problems in order to gain a complete understanding of  the nature of the gang threat and the resources needed to address that  threat. For example, in identifying best practices that resulted from its  projects testing the Comprehensive Community-Wide Anti-Gang Model,  the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP)  reported assessments of gang problems helped projects determine types  and levels of gang activity, gang crime patterns, community perceptions,  and gaps in available services. OJJDP found that assessment also assisted  communities in identifying target populations to be served, understanding  why those populations merited attention, and making the best use of  available resources. Similarly, the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA)  reported that a needs assessment is often the first step in planning a  comprehensive solution to a gang problem, as it can help uncover hidden  problems, set priorities, and develop a communitywide consensus about  what to do.", "Similarly, agency officials and research experts we interviewed noted the  importance of agencies and communities thoroughly assessing gang  problems and threats. For example, one prosecutor told us that a \u201cone\u2013 size fits all approach\u201d does not work for addressing gangs. This prosecutor  stated that each jurisdiction or community is different, and a program that  works in one community may not work in another. This is because of  different characteristics and different gang problems in each community; a  gang problem in one community has different characteristics and occurs  in a different environment than a gang problem in another community.  Furthermore, officials from one U.S. Attorneys Office (USAO) suggested  that communities recognize and admit their gang problems, complete an  assessment of those problems, and plan strategically for how to best  address them. Several research experts also emphasized that gangs are  inherently a local problem best addressed through targeted solutions  carefully vetted through community input.", "Consensus among key stakeholders: Based on our interviews and  examination of research, it is important for stakeholders, including law  enforcement agencies, prosecutors, community-based social service  agencies, schools, citizens\u2019 groups, and other interested community  residents, to reach consensus on an overall approach and goals for a  coordinated anti-gang effort. For example, OJJDP reported that partners  should try to find shared goals for anti-gang efforts. According to BJA,  planning can help stakeholders to establish a common mission and  common priorities and minimize parochial perspectives in favor of  broader goals.", "Agency officials and research experts we interviewed also noted the  importance of obtaining consensus for anti-gang strategies from all key  stakeholders. Officials involved in managing one Department of Justice  (DOJ) funded grant program said that it is important for all stakeholders to  feel like they have ownership and have bought into the program. They said  that allowing all stakeholders to take credit for program successes and  providing them all with an opportunity to discuss failures and obstacles  helps the program succeed and last over the long term. Furthermore, one  local prosecutor stated that a comprehensive approach requires all  stakeholders within a community\u2014police, prosecutors, social service  providers, and elected officials\u2014to buy into a comprehensive approach  for addressing gang problems. If just one of these groups is not committed  to such an approach, the approach ultimately may not be successful.  Likewise, officials from two USAOs stated that organizing the effort to  combat gang violence and understanding the problem are key to  combating gangs. They suggested that communities, law enforcement  agencies, and researchers agree and buy into the assessment of the gang  problem and the strategies developed to address that problem.", "Ongoing communication and coordination among stakeholders: After  consensus is established among stakeholders, agencies we interviewed  and research we reviewed indicated that it is important that there be  ongoing communication and coordination among stakeholders involved in  overall anti-gang efforts. For example, according to BJA, one of the most  important components of a successful approach to gangs is multiagency  cooperation. BJA reported that communities should actively involve all  community components that have a potential interest in responding to  gang problems.", "Federal agencies similarly affirmed the importance of coordination and  multiagency efforts to address gangs as part of a comprehensive approach  but also within specific efforts. For example, officials from three Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) field offices told us that the most critical  element to an approach for successfully addressing gangs is for federal,  state, and local law enforcement agencies to work together through joint  investigations and task forces to leverage information, experience, and  resources. These agencies also need to coordinate with and gain  cooperation from the USAO to get USAO support for prosecuting cases.  Officials from another FBI field office told us that a task force or  collaborative approach is crucial in successfully addressing gangs.  Agencies that participate in a task force or collaborative approach should  clearly define their roles and responsibilities and clearly understand other  agencies\u2019 roles, responsibilities, resources, and missions. In addition, Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials discussed the task force  model as being a critical element in any successful effort to combat gangs,  drugs, and violent crime. They stated that task forces facilitate information  sharing among participating agencies, nurture cooperation, and build trust  among participants.", "Comprehensive and varied efforts (i.e., law enforcement, prevention,  intervention, and reentry): Agencies and research experts we visited and  research we reviewed indicated that overall anti-gang approaches should  include a variety of efforts that address law enforcement, prevention,  intervention, and reentry. For example, OJJDP reported that  comprehensive programs that incorporate prevention, intervention, and  enforcement components are most likely to be effective. Gang research  experts have argued that enforcement responses are less likely to be  successful if isolated from other strategies. It is important that prevention  and intervention activities occur in conjunction with suppression, despite  challenges in implementing and maintaining such efforts. Moreover, BJA  recommended that communities with emerging or existing gang problems  plan, develop, and implement comprehensive responses that include a  broad range of community-based components.", "Officials we interviewed similarly commented on the importance of an  overall anti-gang approach including programs and initiatives that address  law enforcement, prevention, intervention, and reentry. For example,  officials managing one DOJ-grant funded program stated that strong state  laws and gang enforcement efforts are needed to complement prevention,  intervention, and reentry programs. They said that a successful gang  approach is one that appropriately includes and balances prevention,  intervention, enforcement, and reentry. One local prosecutor suggested  that a community or local government invest in prevention and  intervention programs as well as law enforcement programs, suggesting  that communities may be more successful at combating gangs and curbing  gang violence when they take a communitywide approach in addressing  the problem. For example, one of the research experts we interviewed  suggested that pulling together strategies \u201cacross intervention domains\u201d  such as law enforcement, social services, and schools is an effective way  to sustain anti-gang efforts.", "Public and community outreach and visibility for programs: Our  interviews indicated that it is important for entities involved in  implementing anti-gang programs to conduct community outreach and  provide publicity and visibility for the programs and program  accomplishments. For example, officials from one DOJ-funded grant  program told us that one element important to successful program  implementation is for program officials to be visible to communities. When  program officials are on the streets in communities, it shows communities  that the officials care and are invested in the program. DEA officials also  suggested that community leaders need to be willing to speak out against  violence. They stated that before prevention and intervention efforts can  be effective in a specific community, law enforcement agencies first have  to get violence under control so that community members are not afraid to  participate in community events or report crimes to law enforcement  agencies. Moreover, according to one USAO, anti-gang programs and  services can be unified under a common brand and marketed aggressively,  so that the public is aware of the existence and affiliation of anti-gang  efforts.", "Plans for sustainability of programs and efforts: Entities we interviewed  and research we reviewed suggested that agencies and communities  should plan on how to sustain their anti-gang programs and initiatives over  time, particularly as gang problems and availability of resources change.  For example, OJJDP recommended that programs begin planning for long- term sustainability during the initial stages of implementation.", "Agency officials and experts interviewed also noted that resolving gang  problems can require a long-term commitment. For example, one local  prosecutor told us it can be challenging to sustain a communitywide  approach to dealing with gang problems because such an approach  requires leaders committed to making a long-term investment in the  approach and resources to sustain the long-term effort. Another local  prosecutor noted that it is important to sustain gang programs over the  long term because as soon as a community or region believes it has solved  its gang problems and scales programs back, gangs reemerge. Research  experts noted that communities have to be willing to invest resources in  anti-gang programs, particularly comprehensive programs, for a long  period of time in order to achieve results and establish programs that  include adequate study time up-front in order to measure results.", "Performance monitoring, evaluation, and feedback incorporation: A  final common element identified by individuals we interviewed and  research we examined was the regular monitoring and evaluation of  program progress and performance and the incorporation of feedback and  performance results into programs. For example, OJJDP reported that  evaluation is a valuable tool that can tell the community whether it has  accomplished what it set out to do and whether there are ways to do it  better.", "Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, Office of Juvenile Justice and  Delinquency Prevention, OJJDP Comprehensive Gang Model: Planning for  Implementation (Washington, D.C.: June 2002)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To examine the roles of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) in gang enforcement efforts and the extent to  which the efforts are coordinated with each other and state and local  partners, we reviewed federal agencies\u2019 strategies and plans to combat  gang crime and interviewed headquarters DOJ and DHS officials involved  in gang crime enforcement activities. We reviewed DOJ\u2019s and DHS\u2019s  strategic plans including goals and objectives for efforts to combat gang  crime and how the departments assessed their performance in meeting  these goals and objectives. We compared DOJ and DHS coordination and  information sharing efforts to criteria in our prior work on effective  interagency collaboration and results-oriented government. We also  examined staffing levels and budgets for DOJ and U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE) within DHS.", "To assess the reliability of statistical information and budget data we  obtained, we discussed the sources of the data with agency officials and  reviewed documentation regarding the compilation of data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. Using semi-structured interview instruments, we interviewed the  U.S. Attorney or designated staff of U.S. Attorneys Offices (USAO) and  supervisory agents of DOJ and DHS law enforcement agencies involved in  investigating and prosecuting gang members in 15 localities across the  country. We also reviewed anti-gang strategies and other documentation  of enforcement efforts to reduce criminal gang activity in these localities.  We focused our discussions on particular localities within the U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 districts rather than the district as a whole. For example, in the  U.S. Attorney District of Maryland, we discussed anti-gang efforts in  Baltimore. The localities we visited were Atlanta, Ga.; Baltimore, Md.;  Brooklyn, N.Y.; Chicago, Ill.; Cleveland, Ohio; Dallas, Tex.; Durham, N.C.;  Los Angeles, Calif.; Manhattan, N.Y.; Milwaukee, Wisc.; Newark, N.J.;  Pittsburgh, Pa.; Raleigh, N.C.; Richmond, Va.; and Tampa, Fla. We selected  these localities based on a mix of criteria that included a desire to talk  with officials in communities of varying sizes and geographic locations  that had received federal grants to address gang-related crime problems.  Other criteria considered in selecting these localities included the location  of the USAO and federal law enforcement agency field offices, the  presence of federally led task forces to combat gang crime, and  recommendations of officials of DOJ and DHS components during our  preliminary interviews.", "We also considered the results of our review of data from the 2006 Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Report on localities\u2019  population and number of violent crimes. We considered this data in order  to select localities that represent a range of population sizes and violent  crime concerns. We also considered sites that were located in close  geographic proximity where possible in order to maximize travel  resources. At each locality, in addition to meeting with federal officials, we  met with selected state and local prosecutors and law enforcement  officials to discuss the gang problem in their area and the federal agencies\u2019  role in helping to address it. The results of our site visits cannot be  generalized across all U.S. Attorney districts, DOJ or ICE field offices, or  states and localities in the United States. However, because we selected  sites and localities based on a variety of factors, they provided us with a  broad overview of activities of DOJ and ICE related to federal anti-gang  activities including law enforcement, as well as prevention and  intervention programs. See table 4 for additional information on the  interviews we conducted in each locality we visited.", "To determine how DOJ and DHS have measured the results of their gang  enforcement efforts, we first assessed how DOJ and DHS components  define \u201cgang\u201d and gang-related crimes. We then reviewed data on gang- related investigations and prosecutions maintained by DOJ and DHS law  enforcement agencies and U.S. Attorneys. To assess the reliability of  statistical information and budget data we obtained, we discussed the  sources of the data with agency officials and reviewed documentation  regarding the compilation of data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We also interviewed  headquarters officials about performance measurement initiatives and  reviewed DOJ and DHS strategic plans, budgets, and performance reports,  and we reviewed a DOJ Office of Inspector General report that evaluated  the Executive Office of U.S. Attorney\u2019s (EOUSA) case management  system. We compared DOJ and DHS efforts to measure the results of their  gang enforcement efforts to our prior work on effective interagency  collaboration and results oriented government. In addition, we asked  state and local law enforcement officials in nine of the 15 localities we  visited how they measured the results of local gang enforcement efforts.", "To determine how DOJ administers and/or supports gang prevention,  intervention and law enforcement programs through grant funding, we  examined documentation of DOJ\u2019s overall approach and objectives for  anti-gang grant programs, as well as DOJ-sponsored evaluations and a  guide to best practices to address community gang problems. We  interviewed Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention  (OJJDP) and Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) officials about the status  of funding, sustainability of anti-gang programs without federal funding,  and results of evaluations of the effectiveness of the anti-gang grant  programs, among other topics. We also reviewed funding levels for fiscal  years 2007 and 2008 for the four active grant programs that we identified  as being directly focused on anti-gang efforts and included in the scope of  our review. In eight localities we visited that received federal grants for  anti-gang efforts, we interviewed grant recipients to determine activities  that they were pursuing with the grant funds and how they planned to  sustain programs when federal funding expired. In two of these locations,  we observed youth gang prevention and intervention programs in process  and spoke with participants and representatives of community-based  groups implementing them to gain an understanding of the scope of the  demonstration projects and how they used federal funds for anti-gang  prevention and intervention activities. In addition, we interviewed USAO  officials to obtain information on their roles in anti-gang programs. We  reviewed guidance on developing and implementing comprehensive  prevention, intervention, and suppression programs and key documents  related to the four federal grant programs, including grant applications,  community reports on the use of grant funding and performance data. We  did not, however, review every program supported by federal funding that  communities could use for anti-gang efforts or for other law enforcement  and crime prevention efforts. For example, DOJ grant programs including  the Community Oriented Policing Services, Weed and Seed, Project Safe  Neighborhoods, and Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant  Program were not in the scope of our review because they are not  specifically designated for anti-gang efforts, although communities could  choose to use funds from the grants for anti-gang activities or for other  law enforcement and crime prevention purposes. We also reviewed  available nationwide evaluations of grant programs sponsored by DOJ.", "Nine criminal justice researchers with expertise on anti-gang issues  provided their views on how effective the federal government has been in  measuring its gang suppression, prevention, and intervention activities and  whether the programs are sustainable without federal funding and likely to  be implemented by communities that did not receive federal grants based  on lessons learned from the federally funded projects.", "Semistructured interviews with officials in 15 localities provided  information to help address each of our three reporting objectives. During  our visits, we interviewed officials of the following offices:    FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA); and ICE offices when a field division  or resident office or an FBI, ATF, DEA or ICE-led task force was present  and found to be engaged in local anti-gang efforts through communication  with officials of the USAO; local law enforcement agencies when those agencies accepted our request  for interview; and   state, local, or nongovernmental entities that received or were responsible  for administering DOJ anti-gang grants.", "Table 4 lists the officials we interviewed at each locality visited.", "We also interviewed officials of the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s  Office and the Los Angeles City Attorney\u2019s Office who had an established  history of prosecuting gang-related crime, and we pre-tested our  structured interview instruments with law enforcement officials in  Washington, D.C.; Montgomery County, Md.; and Northern Virginia.", "Research experts provided input to our reporting objective on how DOJ  administers and/or supports gang prevention, intervention and law  enforcement programs through grant funding and to appendix IV, which  provides perspective on important elements for consideration in  developing and implementing an approach for combating gangs.
