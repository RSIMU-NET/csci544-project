False claims of lost, stolen, or damaged passports and child substitution are among the other tactics used. Fraudulently obtained passports can help criminals conceal their activities and travel with less scrutiny. Concerns exist that they could also be used to help facilitate terrorism. State faces a number of challenges to its passport fraud detection efforts, and these challenges make it more difficult to protect U.S. citizens from terrorists, criminals, and others. Information on U.S. citizens listed in the federal government's consolidated terrorist watch list is not systematically provided to State. Moreover, State does not routinely obtain from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) the names of other individuals wanted by federal and state law enforcement authorities. We tested the names of 67 federal and state fugitives and found that 37, over half, were not in State's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) database for passports. One of those not included was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. State does not maintain a centralized and up-to-date fraud prevention library, hindering information sharing within State. Fraud prevention staffing reductions and interoffice workload transfers resulted in fewer fraud referrals at some offices, and insufficient training, oversight, and investigative resources also hinder fraud detection efforts. Any effect that new passport examiner performance standards may have on State's fraud detection efforts is unclear because State continues to adjust the standards. State began implementing the new standards in January 2004 to make work processes and performance expectations more uniform nationwide. Passport examiner union representatives expressed concern that new numerical production quotas may require examiners to \"shortcut\" fraud detection efforts. However, in response to union and examiner concerns, State eased the production standards during 2004 and made a number of other modifications and compromises."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our report on the State  Department\u2019s efforts to strengthen U.S. passport fraud detection.", "Maintaining the integrity of the U.S. passport is essential to the State  Department\u2019s effort to protect U.S. citizens from terrorists, criminals, and  others.

This method accounted for 69 percent  of passport fraud detected in fiscal year 2004. Investigators found  numerous examples of aliens and U.S. citizens obtaining U.S. passports  using a false identity or the documentation of others to hide their true  identity. In one example, in 1997, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Cuba  stole a Lear jet and transported it to Nicaragua. At the time of his arrest in  2003, he was using an assumed identity and possessed both false and  legitimate but fraudulently obtained identification documents, including a  U.S. passport in the name he used while posing as a certified pilot and  illegally providing flight instruction. Seized at his residence when he was  arrested were two Social Security cards, four driver\u2019s licenses, three  Puerto Rican birth certificates, one U.S. passport, one pilot identification  card, numerous credit cards and checking account cards, and items used  to make fraudulent documents. In October 2004, he pled guilty to  knowingly possessing five or more \u201cauthentication devices\u201d and false  identification documents, for which he was sentenced to 8 months  confinement. In another case, a man wanted for murdering his wife  obtained a Colorado driver\u2019s license and a passport using a friend\u2019s Social  Security number and date and place of birth. Three and four years later he  obtained renewal and replacement passports, respectively, in the same  assumed identity. He was later arrested and pled guilty to making a false  statement in an application for a passport. He was sentenced to about 7  months time served and returned to California to stand trial for murdering  his wife.", "Applicants commit passport fraud through other means, including  submitting false claims of lost, stolen, or mutilated passports; child  substitution; and counterfeit citizenship documents. Some fraudulently  obtain new passports by claiming to have lost their passport or had it  stolen or damaged. For example, one individual who used another  person\u2019s Social Security number and Ohio driver\u2019s license to report a lost  passport obtained a replacement passport through the one-day expedited  service. This fraudulently obtained passport was used to obtain entry into  the United States 14 times in less than three years. Diplomatic Security  officials told us that another means of passport fraud is when individuals  obtain replacement passports by using expired passports containing  photographs of individuals they closely resemble. This method of fraud is  more easily and commonly committed with children, with false  applications based on photographs of children who look similar to the  child applicant.

According to Diplomatic Security officials, concerns exist  within the law enforcement and intelligence communities that passport  fraud could also be used to help facilitate acts of terrorism. Using a  passport with a false identity helps enable criminals to conceal their  movements and activities, and U.S. passports provide their holders free  passage into our country with much less scrutiny than is given to foreign  citizens. U.S. passports also allow visa-free passage into many countries  around the world, providing obvious benefits to criminals operating on an  international scale. According to State officials, the most common crime  associated with passport fraud is illegal immigration. For example, one  woman was recently convicted for organizing and leading a large-scale  passport fraud ring that involved recruiting American women to sell their  children\u2019s identities, so that foreign nationals could fraudulently obtain  passports and enter the United States illegally. According to the  Department of State, the woman targeted drug-dependent women and  their children, paying them about $300 for each identity and then using the  identities to apply for passports.

State officials  were not aware that the information in the U.S. Marshal\u2019s database was  not as comprehensive as that contained in the FBI-operated National  Crime Information Center database. State officials became aware of this  situation when the union representing passport examiners brought to their  attention that a number of individuals on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted list  were not in CLASS. In the summer of 2004, the FBI agreed to State\u2019s  request to provide the names from the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted list.
