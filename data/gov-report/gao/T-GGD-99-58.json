Each of these bills includes provisions for determining when a debtor could be required to file under chapter 13, rather than chapter 7. Currently, the debtor generally determines whether to file under chapter 7 or 13. Generally, these bills would establish a \u201cneeds-based\u201d test, whose specific provisions vary among the bills. H.R. 3150, the bill used in the Ernst & Young and ABI analyses, would require a debtor whose gross monthly income met a specified income threshold to file under chapter 13 if the debtor\u2019s net monthly income after allowable expenses was more than $50 and would be sufficient to pay 20 percent of the debtor\u2019s unsecured nonpriority debt over a 5-year period.

Historically, only about one-third of chapter 13 debtors have successfully completed their repayment plans, suggesting that for two-thirds of debtors something changed between the time the plans were confirmed by the bankruptcy court and the time the actual repayment plan was to be successfully completed.", "The three reports focus on the potential debt that debtors could repay should more debtors be required to file under chapter 13. However, should the number of debtors who file under chapter 13 increase, there would also be additional costs for bankruptcy judges and administrative support requirements that would be borne by the government. This is because bankruptcy judges would be involved in debtor screening to a greater extent than they are now and chapter 13 cases require more judicial time than chapter 7 cases do. None of the reports estimated these additional costs, although the ABI report acknowledges that such additional costs could accompany means-testing of bankruptcy debtors. In addition, the Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act of 1998 permits chapter 13 bankruptcy debtors to include certain charitable deductions of up to 15 percent of their annual gross income in their allowable living expenses. The implementation of this statute could affect the estimates in each of the three reports. The potential effect could be to reduce (1) the number of bankruptcy debtors who could be required under the \u201cneeds- based\u201d tests to file under chapter 13 or (2) the amount of debt repaid to unsecured nonpriority creditors by those debtors who are required to file under chapter 13.

The Credit Center report analyzed the repayment capacity of all the chapter 7 debtors in its sample, regardless of their annual gross income.", "The Ernst & Young and ABI report used the \u201cneeds-based\u201d provisions of different versions of H.R. 3150 as the basis for their analysis of debtor repayment capacity. H.R. 3150 passed the House in June 1998. Under the provisions of H.R. 3150 as introduced and as it passed the House, debtors must pass three tests to be required to file under chapter 13: \u2022  debtors must have monthly gross income that exceeds a set percentage of the national median income for households of comparable size (debtors below this threshold are presumed to be eligible to file under chapter 7); \u2022  debtors must have income of more than $50 per month after allowable living expenses and payments on secured and unsecured priority debts; and, \u2022  debtors could repay at least 20 percent of their unsecured nonpriority debts over a 5-year period if they used this remaining income for such payments.", "passed by the House of Representatives. The principal effect of using the two different versions of H.R. 3150 was that each report used a different threshold of gross annual income to screen debtors for further repayment analysis. In the Ernst & Young analysis, debtors whose gross annual income was 75 percent or less of the national median income for a household of comparable size were deemed eligible for chapter 7. Debtors whose gross annual income was more than 75 percent of the national median household income were subject to further analysis of their repayment capacity. In the ABI report\u2019s analysis, debtors whose gross annual income was at least 100 percent of the national median income for households of comparable were subject to further repayment analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Assumptions About Debtors\u2019 Allowable Living Expenses", "paragraphs": ["The three reports used different estimates of debtors\u2019 allowable living expenses.

Basically, the Credit Center\u2019s analysis used the debtor\u2019s living expenses as reported on the debtor\u2019s schedule of estimated monthly living expenses. The Ernst & Young and ABI reports used the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) Financial Collection Standards, as specified in H.R. 3150. However, Ernst & Young and ABI interpreted them somewhat differently. The principal difference was for transportation expenses. Ernst & Young did not include an automobile ownership allowance for debtors who leased cars or whose cars were debt-free. ABI included an ownership allowance for leased cars and for debtors with debt-free cars.

The actual number of chapter 7 debtors who could repay at least a portion of their nonhousing debt could be more or less than the estimates in these studies. Similarly, the amount of debt these debtors could potentially repay could also be more or less than the reports estimated.", "We agree that there are likely some debtors who file for bankruptcy under chapter 7 who have the financial ability to repay at least a portion of their debt, and that those who are able to repay their debts should do so.
