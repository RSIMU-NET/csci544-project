BEA estimated remittances for 2003 at $28.2 billion; its model used data on the number of foreign-born residents, their income, the proportion of income that is remitted, and other demographic data. The strengths of BEA's methodology are that, in theory, it estimates remittances sent through formal and informal channels. It also is low-cost because it uses existing data on the foreign born. However, BEA's methodology was limited by the quality and timeliness of the data, particularly on the portion of income likely to be remitted. BEA revised its model in 2005 to use new data sources, but the accuracy of its estimates depends on the accuracy of its assumptions regarding the remitting behavior of the foreign born and other factors. Some central banks and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) use different methodologies to provide estimates of remittances from the United States that vary significantly. For example, Mexico's central bank estimates remittances primarily by collecting data from money transmitters. The IDB used a variety of sources, such as surveys of remittance senders and receivers, and information from remittance transfer companies and central banks, to estimate remittances from the United States to Latin America to be $30.6 billion in 2003. We aggregated BEA's data to estimate remittances to this region to be $17.9 billion. BEA is an active participant in recent international efforts to improve remittance statistics. The World Bank and others established a remittances working group in 2005, which delegated tasks to other international groups to (1) clarify the definition of remittances and (2) provide guidance on how to collect and estimate remittances.

According to the World Bank, remittances  received by developing countries were estimated to have been $167 billion  in 2005, up 73 percent from 2001; however, given that the extent of  unrecorded flows through formal and informal channels is unknown,  actual remittance flows may be much higher.

IMF figures show that in 2004, immigrants in the  United States sent over $29.9 billion in remittances, more than any other  country. Saudi Arabia was the second largest remittance-sending country;  however, as shown in figure 1, the volume of remittances from Saudi Arabia  has been falling since 1994, while that from the United States has been  steadily increasing.", "For some countries, remittances constitute the single largest source of  foreign currency and can often rival direct foreign investment in amounts.  World Bank data show that for selected countries remittances exceed the  flows of official development assistance and foreign direct investment and  are relatively large compared to exports and gross national income\u2014 particularly for the Dominican Republic and the Philippines (see table 1).", "Remittances are also very important for those households that receive  them. Table 2 shows the minimum wage per month for several developing  countries as well as our computation of the 2003 per capita remittances  from the United States per month. As can be seen from this table,  remittances received by households on a monthly basis tend to  substantially exceed the monthly minimum wage for these countries.

According to IMF, \u201cworkers\u2019 remittances\u201d are  transfers by migrants who are employed in countries other than their birth  countries and are considered residents there; \u201ccompensation of  employees\u201d is made up of wages, salaries, and other benefits earned by  individuals in economies other than those in which they are residents, for  work performed or paid for by residents of those economies. As a result,  compensation of employees applies only to individuals away from their  place of origin for less than a year.", "In the United States, no U.S. government agency tracks the flow of  remittances through the payment system. Because of its role in compiling  balance of payments statistics, BEA provides to the IMF official estimates  of U.S. remittance inflows and outflows. BEA publishes remittance  estimates in a different manner than reported in the IMF\u2019s balance of  payment statistics. BEA includes estimates of remittances by the foreign- born population residing in the United States to households abroad in the  published item called \u201cprivate remittances and other transfers.\u201d This  category is broader than the international definition of remittances, as it  also includes payments or receipts of nongovernmental U.S. entities and  foreign entities. Also, BEA publishes its estimates of \u201cprivate remittances  and other transfers\u201d in its tables of international transactions accounts,  defining it as the difference between transfers to and transfers from the  United States. However, BEA provides to the IMF an estimate of  remittances that flow from the United States to the world based on its  underlying country-by-country tabulations.

A large amount also flows to Asia, including the  Philippines.", "There are many obstacles to accurately estimating remittances. First, many  transactions may go through unregulated informal channels from which  information cannot be garnered for inclusion in official estimates. While  there are no official estimates, some experts believe that a large amount of  remittances flow through this system, with market observers estimating  that informal flows can range from 50 percent to 250 percent of recorded  remittance flows. Second, countries do not always report remittance  estimates or do not report them according to commonly held IMF  definitions, which exclude transfers by the foreign born who have been in- country for less than one year. Variations in data compilation procedures  occur partially due to different interpretations of definitions and  classifications. In most cases, however, data weaknesses and omissions are  due to difficulties in obtaining the necessary data. For example, the World  Bank and other international organizations have indicated that developing  countries with large remittance inflows often have a relatively weak  capacity and limited resources, even though remittances are a large item in  their balance of payments statistics. Countries with large remittance  outflows often give lower priority to improvements in remittance statistics  because they are a relatively small item in their balance of payments  statistics, according to the World Bank and other international  organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BEA Uses a Model to Estimate Remittances Sent from the United States, but the Accuracy of BEA\u2019s Estimate Is Uncertain for Several Reasons", "paragraphs": ["BEA uses a model to estimate remittances (which it calls \u201cpersonal  transfers\u201d) from the United States.

The count of the foreign born, their income, and other  demographic characteristics were obtained from information aggregated  annually from U.S. Bureau of the Census surveys. These data were arrayed  by length of residency in the United States and family types linked to  marital status (e.g., married foreign head of households, native-born  married to foreign-born spouse, and unmarried individuals). The remitter  was assumed to be the household head. BEA extrapolated the foreign-born  population derived from the 1990 Decennial Census using indicators,  including the Census Bureau\u2019s annual Current Population Survey (CPS).", "To estimate the proportion of income immigrants were likely to remit, BEA  relied on the 1989 Legalized Population Survey (LPS1) and the 1992  Legalized Population Follow-Up Survey (LPS2), which were conducted as a  result of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). BEA  then combined the information obtained from LPS1 and LPS2 with  demographic and income information obtained from the CPS to arrive at  the total amount of remittances sent from the United States. For a more  detailed description of BEA\u2019s methodology for estimating remittances, see  appendix II.", "In 2005, BEA made several revisions to its methodology to include more  recent census data, and recent studies on the foreign born and their  remitting behaviors. First, BEA incorporated data on the foreign-born  population and their income from the 2000 Census and the American  Community Survey (ACS), which is available annually, unlike decennial  census data, and thus requires less extrapolation of population and income  trends. According to BEA, these data will enable a better breakdown of  the foreign-born population by all relevant characteristics on an annual  basis. The ACS data on the number and income of the adult foreign-born  population are arrayed by their gender, duration of stay, presence or  absence of children, and per capita income of recipient countries and  proximity to the United States. BEA then used its own judgment to  determine the percentage of the adult foreign-born population that remits  and the probability of remitting from information gathered from various  academic studies published between 1995 and 2004, as well as LPS1 and  LPS2, which BEA used in its earlier model. BEA revised its estimates back  to 1991 using this new approach, which resulted in an increase in estimated  remittances for all years.

BEA cautions  that disaggregating its estimate for the world is error-prone and expresses  confidence only in its aggregate estimate. Further, according to BEA, in  moving from the global estimate to increasingly smaller geographic areas  or countries, the average errors in the underlying tabulations increase.

It is also low-cost because it  relies on available data and not on eliciting data from a foreign-born  population that may not have an incentive to provide accurate data.  However, the accuracy of BEA\u2019s estimate is affected by the quality of the  data available to BEA. A critical component of the methodology relies on  information about the remitting behavior (e.g., amount, frequency) of the  foreign born. Prior to 2005, the primary data available to BEA were the 1989  LPS1 and the 1992 LPS2; however, these surveys may not have been  appropriate for use in estimating remittances of all the foreign born  because they sampled a population participating in a special legalization  program primarily aimed at Latin American immigrants. The LPS1 and  LPS2 excluded undocumented aliens, temporary residents who did not  wish (or were not eligible) for legal status, and legal immigrants who  became legalized through processes other than IRCA. The survey design  did not provide a way to more extensively sample immigrant groups more  likely to remit than others (e.g. the foreign born with less than 10 years of  residence in the United States). In addition, recent census data show that  some basic demographic characteristics of the foreign born have changed  significantly since the LPS1 and LPS2 surveys were done.", "BEA\u2019s revisions to its methodology recognize these changes in the foreign  born population. In its revision, BEA reviewed a number of academic  studies to update the findings of the LPS1 and LPS2 and published the  sources in the July 2005 Survey of Current Business, however, the  estimates on the proportion of income remitted cannot be directly tracked  to these source documents. Although this approach is more transparent  than the prior approach of relying primarily on LPS1 and LPS2, BEA\u2019s  estimate is still affected by its \u201cjudgment\u201d of how it incorporates  information from the academic studies it is now using, and the assumptions  it makes in its model. For example, two of BEA\u2019s assumptions are that the  proportion of income remitted is higher for U.S. residents from developing  countries than developed countries, and that the percentage of the foreign  born that remit is the same for all countries and only varies based on how  long they have been in the United States. Our analysis suggests that the  final BEA estimates of remittances are affected by these assumptions. We  used a statistical technique that repeatedly and randomly samples from  underlying data to obtain the range for 90 percent of possible estimates and  determined this to be between $17.3 billion and $35.9 billion.

All  remittances are presumably sent by the foreign born who have been in the  host country for greater than one year, while those that are in a country for  less than a year are presumed to be temporary, earning only compensation.  For this reason, some experts compile remittances as the sum of (1) the  remittances sent by those in country greater than a year and (2) the  compensation for those in-country for less than a year. In its description of  its revised methodology, BEA states that it excludes transfers by the  foreign born who have been in the United States for less than 1 year from  its measure of remittances; however, BEA uses a U.S.-residency-duration  grouping of 0-5 years in its personal remittances calculation.

The working group met in January 2005  and included BEA and representatives from key remittance-sending  countries, one key remittance-receiving country, and the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development.", "The working group\u2019s first objective was to clarify the definition of  remittances. The group agreed that the United Nations Technical Subgroup  on the Movement of Natural Persons (TSG), of which BEA is a member,  should be the forum to discuss improvements in concepts and definitions  for remittances. The TSG recommended, among other things, that the  \u201cworkers\u2019 remittances\u201d item in the balance of payments be replaced with a  new component called \u201cpersonal transfers,\u201d which would include all  current transfers (in cash or in kind) sent or received by resident  households to or from nonresident households. This new component  would not be based on employment or migration status and would resolve  the inconsistencies associated with \u201cworkers\u2019 remittances.\u201d This new  definition was discussed at the June 2005 meeting of the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics. BEA officials stated that they have begun  using this new definition; however, it will be included in the publication of  the revised Balance of Payments Manual, which is scheduled to be  completed in 2008.", "The second objective of the working group was to improve guidance on  collecting and compiling remittance statistics, including the use of  household surveys, if needed. The working group agreed that it would be  useful to form a core group of compilers to review methods and develop  more detailed guidance for compiling remittances data. Eurostat, the  statistical office of the European Communities, offered to host the first  meeting in June 2006 in Luxembourg, thereby creating the \u201cLuxembourg  Group,\u201d which includes the World Bank and IMF\u2019s statistics department.  The Luxembourg Group will review, among other things, the extent to  which household survey data can be used to improve balance of payment  statistics. BEA expects to be invited to serve on this group. According to  the IMF, the prerequisite to the group\u2019s success is the commitment of  national compilers to share their methodologies. The progress of this group  will be reviewed by the IMF Committee on Balance of Payments Statistics,  of which BEA is a member. No date has been set for this group to complete  its work.", "In the meantime, the international working group will coordinate with a  recent project conducted by the Center for Latin America Monetary Studies  to improve central bank remittance reporting and procedures. This project  is supported by the MIF.

Countries define remittances differently and use various  methodologies to estimate them; it is therefore not surprising that  estimates vary widely.", "Although there are international efforts in which BEA participates to  improve remittance statistics, two issues suggest the challenges facing  these efforts. First, current remittance data are incomplete globally and  cannot be easily reconciled because of the inconsistency in the methods of  collecting and reporting remittance data. Second, for source countries,  remittances constitute a small share of their overall economy\u2014thus there  may not be enough incentives for these countries to improve their  remittance estimates. For recipient countries, remittances constitute a  larger share of the economy; but these countries lack the resources to  improve their statistics. International efforts to improve remittance  statistics have begun recently, and it is too soon to tell whether these  efforts will improve the accuracy of remittance statistics.", "In the United States, remittance estimates are important for agencies such  as Treasury and the Federal Reserve; more accurate remittance estimates  could help them better target their financial infrastructure and automated- clearinghouse remittances programs. With better data on remittances, the  U.S. government could make better decisions about how much (and what  kind) of development assistance to provide, and U.S. companies could  make better decisions regarding foreign direct investment. As remittance  flows from the United States continue to grow, U.S. policy makers may  want to explore options for improving the accuracy of U.S. remittance  statistics\u2014such as conducting a new survey to determine the remitting  behavior of U.S. immigrants, or adding specific questions to current  government surveys to obtain better information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Departments of Commerce and the Treasury provided written  comments on the draft report, which are reproduced in appendixes V and  VI, respectively.

Commerce concurred  with most of our observations. Specifically, they concurred that estimates  of remittances from the United States derived by BEA and those of foreign  governments and international organizations differ substantially and that  there are several methodological reasons for these differences. Commerce  also concurred that more accurate estimates would enable users of  remittance data to make better informed decisions.", "Commerce, however, stated its view that BEA\u2019s estimates are lower than  most of the others we discuss because we compare BEA\u2019s estimate of  personal gifts to foreign residents (personal transfers) with much broader  estimates of remittances, which include compensation paid to foreign  workers who are temporarily employed in the United States. Commerce  believes that a substantial portion of the differences between BEA\u2019s  estimates and those of other government or international organizations is  accounted for by this definitional difference. Contrary to Commerce\u2019s view,  compensation paid to foreign workers temporarily employed in the United  States was not included in the remittances estimates with which we  compared BEA\u2019s personal transfers estimates. We therefore do not believe  that the differences among the estimates we discuss in our report are due  to this definitional difference.

BEA obtains these  proportions by making assumptions based on its judgment. BEA assumes  that the place of birth of the adult foreign-born population does not affect  the likelihood of remitting but that it does affect the percentage of income  remitted. BEA also assumes that, once the presence of children in the  household and the duration of stay are accounted for, men and women are  equally likely to remit. In effect, only the presence of children in the  household and the duration of stay determines the percentage of the adult  foreign-born population that remit to their countries of birth under these  assumptions, as shown in figure 5.", "To determine the percentage of income that the adult foreign-born  population remits, BEA makes assumptions about the development status  and proximity of the country of origin of the adult foreign-born population,  along with the presence of children in the U.S. household. BEA groups  countries of origin into four categories indicating their propensity to send  remittances and representing highest-remitting, high-remitting, medium- remitting, and low-remitting countries of birth. The highest-remitting  countries are closest to the United States, while other developing countries  are either high-remitting or middle-remitting, depending on their  development status. Low-remitting countries are generally developed  economies. Figure 6 shows that the percentage of income remitted varies  by the presence of children and country groupings. Although average  incomes are lower for women than for men, BEA assumes that the  percentage of income remitted does not vary by gender. Furthermore, BEA  assumes the duration of stay is negatively associated with likelihood to  remit\u2014but that it has no effect on the percentage remitted.

The survey interviewed 3,802 households in  37 states and the District of Columbia from January through April 2004.

Figure 7  provides a diagram of the methodology IDB used to arrive at the $30.1  billion estimate. According to IDB, the estimate captured remittance flows  through the formal and informal sectors. The IDB also used the survey to  estimate remittances from each of the 37 states and the District of  Columbia.

According to IDB officials, for countries where no in- country survey has been conducted, data from establishments facilitating  money transfers to each country was used. These officials indicated that  data were obtained from a sample of 45 money transfer businesses to  approximately 14 countries. The amount and frequency of the average  remittance sent by residents from the survey countries was used to  estimate the total remittance outflow to each country, according to IDB  officials.

BEA commented on the Highlights page that the IDB estimates differ  from BEA\u2019s estimates because the IDB estimate includes \u201cnet  compensation\u201d of foreign workers and the BEA estimate does not. BEA  also commented that data provided by foreign central banks and  financial establishments are sometimes overstated because U.S.  correspondent banks are used in transmitting funds for senders not  living in the United States. We disagree with BEA on these points. This  \u201cnet compensation\u201d of foreign workers is a new concept that was just  proposed by the Technical Subgroup on the Movement of Natural  Persons (TSG) in June 2005, and we are not aware of any remittances  estimates for 2003 that use this definition. Further, IDB never stated  that any of the funds accounted for in their estimates came through  U.S. correspondent banks for workers who were not located in the  United States. This was true for the Philippines, which we noted in the  report. BEA also commented that IDB\u2019s estimates are substantially  derived from data reported from central banks and private money  transfer establishments. BEA is correct on the latter point and we have  corrected the Highlights page to be consistent with the letter and  reflect that IDB uses a variety of sources in making its remittances  estimates. 2. BEA suggested that we place Mexico in North America or create a  separate bar in our graphic in the Highlights page for Mexico. In this  report, we used the United Nations\u2019 Standard Country and Area Codes  Classification, which places Mexico in Central America. 3. BEA commented that to develop an estimate that corresponds to our  definition of remittances, we should have used BEA\u2019s estimates of  personal transfers and compensation of employees, net of their  expenditures. However, we make it clear in footnote 6 that we are  focusing only on personal transfers and that we call these remittances  for the purpose of this report.  4. BEA states that it has confirmed with the Bank of Mexico that Mexico\u2019s  estimates of remittances include net compensation of migrant Mexican  workers in the United States. BEA states that if we added BEA\u2019s net  compensation of employees figure to its estimate of personal transfers,  the two figures for 2003 would be closer. As stated above, this new  definition was proposed in June 2005, and, to our knowledge, the  Mexican central bank has not published 2003 figures for \u201cnet  compensation\u201d of employees. The Mexican central bank figures for  2003 as reported by the IMF in its balance of payments statistics are  almost $13.4 billion for workers\u2019 remittances, which we use in our  report, and $1.5 billion in compensation of employees. The $12.9 billion  estimate BEA attributes in its comments to the Mexican central bank is  the IDB\u2019s estimate.  5. BEA commented that the data used in our analysis of the potential  effects of BEA\u2019s judgmentally determined values in its remittance  estimating methodology are unclear, as are the particulars of our  modeling technique. As we stated, we replicated BEA\u2019s methodology  using its underlying tabulation of remittances by country and included  additional information from the sources that BEA primarily used to  arrive at its estimate. BEA further stated that there is a very small  probability that the BEA estimate would be near the end points of the  intervals and suggested that we use the midpoint of the intervals  instead. As explained in appendix III, the purpose of our analysis was to  show the effect of BEA\u2019s judgmentally determined values on its  estimate $28.03 billion in 2003. Using a range illustrates the uncertainty  in BEA\u2019s estimate. BEA also commented on our use of the lognormal  distribution for the percentage of income remitted and the percentage  of the adult foreign born population that remit. We chose the lognormal  distribution because it satisfied the requirements that both of these  variables were nonnegative and distributed in a bell-shaped curve. 6. BEA commented that we left the impression that BEA\u2019s estimates of  personal transfers contain a double count of $377 million and that any  double count that may exist probably involves the compensation of  employees, not the personal transfers account. We modified the text of  our report to reflect that BEA\u2019s personal transfers are therefore  potentially overstated by up to $377 million because BEA\u2019s estimate  includes remittances sent by some of the foreign born who have been in  the United States for less than one year. 7. Commerce reiterated its concerns about our comparison between  BEA\u2019s estimates and those of other organizations. Commerce restated  its view that the methods used by the Mexican central bank and others  capture both remittances and compensation of employees and further  stated that BEA\u2019s estimates for personal transfers and compensation of  employees should be summed when making these comparisons to  other organizations. However, none of the organizations with which we  compare BEA\u2019s estimates indicated that their methods captured  compensation of employees, therefore, we believe our comparisons are  appropriate. 8. BEA states that the TSG now recommends that \u201cpersonal transfers\u201d  also include capital transfers. This is incorrect. The paper BOPCOM- 05/9 states that the TSG agreed to define \u201cpersonal transfers\u201d as  consisting of all current transfers in cash or in kind.  9. BEA disagreed with our statement that remittance data cannot be  reconciled and stated that, because reconciliation projects are resource  intensive and difficult, BEA must choose the statistical items it  reconciles with which trading partners. We concur that reconciliation  cannot be done easily. However, our observations were on  reconciliation of remittance data on a global level, not between  individual countries, as shown in figure 4.
