This program provides supplemental food and  nutrition services to lower-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and  postpartum women. The program also serves infants and children up to age  5 who are at nutritional risk. The WIC program serves a monthly average of  7.3 million individuals, including about 47 percent of all infants born in the  United States. In fiscal year 2000, the Congress appropriated $3.9 billion to  fund WIC, $2.8 billion of which was used to provide food benefits and $1.1  billion of which was used for nutrition services and program  administration. The nutrition services part of the program includes  nutrition education, breastfeeding promotion and support, and referrals to  health and social services.", "A substantial body of research has examined the overall effectiveness of  the WIC program, but little is known about what research shows regarding  the effectiveness of specific WIC nutrition services.

This report is the fourth in a series providing information on  various aspects of WIC nutrition services as directed by the William F.  Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-336).", "To identify recent studies that examine the effectiveness of each WIC  nutrition service, we searched relevant databases, such as the National  Technical Information Service, Sociological Abstracts, and Wilson Social  Science Abstracts. We also consulted with USDA WIC program staff and  other program stakeholders including officials from the National  Association of WIC Directors. Initially, we identified more than 200  published WIC studies dealing with various aspects of the WIC program. In  order to focus on recent research, we eliminated from consideration  research published prior to 1995. We also eliminated any study that did not  specifically address the effects of at least one of the three WIC nutrition  services, whether nutrition education, breastfeeding promotion and  support, or referral services. We included research that falls in two general  categories: demonstration studies and impact studies. The demonstration  studies typically attempt to assess whether special interventions, such as  hospital visits to promote breastfeeding, more effectively achieve program  objectives than the usual WIC services. In contrast, impact studies attempt  to determine whether a WIC nutrition service, such as breastfeeding  promotion and support, improves WIC participants\u2019 outcomes compared to  similar individuals who do not participate in the WIC program.", "We conducted our work between May 2000 and March 2001 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

FNS provides annual cash grants for  food benefits and nutrition services to fund program operations at 88 state- level WIC agencies (including agencies in all 50 states, the District of  Columbia, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the  U.S. Virgin Islands, and 33 Indian Tribal Organizations). Some of these  state-level agencies\u2014those that operate the program at both the state and  local levels\u2014retain all of their federal WIC grants. Most state-level  agencies, however, retain a portion of their grants and pass the remaining  funds to over 1,800 local WIC agencies.", "In fiscal year 2000, about $2.8 billion in federal program funds were used to  provide food benefits to participants. Typically food benefits are in the  form of vouchers or checks that participants can use to obtain approved  foods at authorized retail food stores. An additional $1.1 billion in federal  funds were used for nutrition services and program administration.  Program administration includes, among other things, activities related to  accounting and record keeping, outreach, monitoring and financial audits,  and general management. Nutrition services include activities related to  determining participants\u2019 eligibility and issuing food benefits, as well as the  following:  Nutrition education: WIC offers classes, counseling, and other activities  to teach participants about proper nutrition, positive food habits, and  the prevention of nutrition-related problems.", "Breastfeeding promotion and support: To promote breastfeeding, WIC  offers individual and group counseling sessions at WIC clinics or the  hospital. Breastfeeding support can include telephone or in-person  consultation with breastfeeding mothers.", "Referral to health care and social services: WIC agencies provide  participants with information on health care and social services and  refer them to providers including immunization clinics and the Food  Stamp and Medicaid programs.", "By law, spending for nutrition education and breastfeeding promotion and  support activities combined must equal at least one-sixth of a state\u2019s total  annual expenditures for nutrition services and administration plus a target  amount for breastfeeding promotion and support that is established by FNS  at the beginning of each fiscal year. There is no minimum spending  requirement for referral activities.", "Over the past 20 years, government agencies such as USDA, the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention, and GAO, as well as universities and  private research organizations, have conducted a substantial body of  research on the effects of the entire WIC program. Some of the  accumulated body of WIC research and evaluations provides nationwide  assessments of WIC\u2019s effects. Most of it has focused on the effect of  program participation on birth outcomes and the nutritional status of  program participants. USDA has a review under way describing and  assessing research on the diet and health outcomes of its nutrition  programs, including WIC. The results of this review, set for release later  this year, will provide detailed information on over 70 studies, most of  which examine WIC\u2019s effects on birth outcomes or on the nutrition status  of participants. While the USDA review will not focus on the impacts of  specific nutrition services, it will include studies that examined the WIC  program\u2019s effects on the initiation and duration of breastfeeding and the  immunization status of children. These two health-related outcomes are  directly linked to two of the three nutrition services addressed in this  report\u2014breastfeeding promotion and support and referral services.

To varying degrees, all were more effective than usual WIC  interventions. Examples of the special interventions include the following:  Breastfeeding promotion and support. Gross and others evaluated  special interventions designed to encourage breastfeeding among  African-American WIC participants. Mothers in the three special  intervention groups were provided a motivational video or peer  counseling or a combination of the video and counseling. Mothers in the  control group received the standard WIC service that incorporated  encouragement and support to breastfeed and brochures about  breastfeeding during discussions about infant feeding. Mothers in the  special intervention groups were twice as likely as mothers receiving  the standard WIC infant feeding education to be breastfeeding 8 weeks  and 16 weeks after giving birth, even accounting for factors that could  increase breastfeeding duration, such as prior breastfeeding experience.", "Health referrals. Birkhead and others evaluated two special  interventions designed to increase the number of WIC-eligible children  who receive measles immunizations. The special interventions included  having WIC staff escort children to an on-site immunization clinic and a  food voucher incentive in which WIC staff provided only a 1-month  supply of vouchers to parents, rather than the usual 2-month supply,  until the parents provided documentation that their children\u2019s  immunizations were up-to-date. The standard WIC immunization  referral consisted of notifying parents that immunizations were due,  providing information on the benefits of immunizations, and providing  the names and telephone numbers of local health facilities that  immunize children. Children at escort sites were about five times more  likely to be immunized than children at standard referral sites; children  at voucher incentive sites were about three times more likely to receive  immunizations.", "Nutrition education. Havas and others evaluated a special intervention  designed to increase WIC participants\u2019 consumption of fruits and  vegetables. The special intervention\u2014Maryland\u2019s \u201c5-A-Day\u201d program\u2014 was a series of three 45-minute group sessions taught by former WIC  participants, or \u201cpeer educators,\u201d that incorporated special visual  materials and included direct mailings to participants. The standard  service generally included less than 10 minutes of nutrition education  conversation between WIC staff and participants when they picked up  their food voucher every other month. Compared to participants  receiving the standard WIC nutrition education program, participants  exposed to the special intervention displayed a significant increase in  nutrition knowledge and in the consumption of fruits and vegetables.", "Each of the demonstration studies we reviewed suffers from  methodological limitations that, while not invalidating the study\u2019s findings,  should be taken into account. The limitations we identified are common in  studies that attempt to assess the extent to which social or health program  interventions\u2014not other factors\u2014are responsible for changes in program  participants\u2019 behaviors or health. The major methodological limitations of  the demonstration studies we reviewed include the following:  Lack of control group. To help isolate the effects of an intervention, an  evaluation study must compare people receiving the special  intervention to similar people receiving standard WIC services. The  difference between these groups can provide insight into whether the  special intervention is more effective than standard WIC practice. Not  having such a comparison obscures the relationship between the  intervention and participant outcomes. Four of the studies we reviewed  had a weak research design associated with a lack of control group. For  example, Hoekstra and others attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of  a new voucher incentive program in increasing WIC children\u2019s rates of  immunization. However, the researchers did not compare the group  receiving the special intervention to a group receiving standard services.  Instead, they compared three special intervention groups to themselves  at different points in time over a period of 14 months. Without a control  group that does not participate in the voucher intervention, it is difficult  to attribute any changes the researchers noticed to the special  intervention.", "Inappropriate data analysis techniques. The analytic techniques used in  a study must suit the available data and the research design\u2014in  particular, they should be selected for their ability to help isolate the  effects of the intervention. Three of the demonstration studies we  reviewed used questionable analytic techniques. For example, Havas  and others found that a special peer counselor program was effective in  increasing nutrition knowledge and the consumption of fruits and  vegetables. To reach this finding, Havas and others compared the  average fruit and vegetable consumption of the special \u201c5-a-Day\u201d group  to the average fruit and vegetable consumption of a group exposed to  the standard WIC nutrition education. The comparison, which examined  the linkage between demographic characteristics, such as race, and fruit  and vegetable consumption, did not take into account the simultaneous  influence of other characteristics, such as education level, on  consumption. Without an analysis technique, such as multiple  regression, that can account for the influence of several factors at once,  determining the extent to which the observed differences in fruit and  vegetable consumption are the result of the \u201c5-A-Day\u201d program is greatly  complicated.", "Selection bias. Ideally, study participants should be randomly assigned  to intervention and control groups to ensure that all participant  characteristics will, on average, be the same from one group to another.  A selection bias exists if the two groups differ in some systematic way.  Selection bias makes it more difficult to attribute an observed difference  in outcomes between the two groups to any one factor, such as the  intervention. Six of the demonstration studies we reviewed have a  possible selection bias. For example, Tuttle and Dewey examined the  influence of a new, culturally sensitive breastfeeding education  intervention on the initiation and duration of breastfeeding among  Hmong WIC participants in Northern California.10,  However, the  study\u2019s research design depended on women to volunteer to participate  in the study\u2014the women self-selected themselves to participate in the  special intervention. Thus, those choosing to participate in the special  intervention may have shared characteristics (for example, an already  existing inclination to breastfeed) that did not exist in those women  who chose not to participate. If present, selection bias could lead the  researcher to overstate the benefits of the special intervention.", "Cynthia Reeves Tuttle and Kathryn G. Dewey, \u201cImpact of a Breastfeeding Promotion  Program for Hmong Women at Selected WIC Sites in Northern California,\u201d Journal of  Nutrition Education, Vol. 27, No. 2 (1995), p. 69. to agree. Excessive missing data, or poor response rates, may skew  research findings. Missing data or poor response rate was a limitation in  five of the demonstration studies. For example, Ahluwalia and others  evaluated five new breastfeeding interventions, and attributed  significant improvements in breastfeeding initiation to them. However,  the database employed by the study contained breastfeeding initiation  data for only 52 percent of the women in the sample.", "Measurement error. For an analysis to produce reliable results, the  measures in the analysis must be accurate. Measurement error is the  difference between a measured value and its true value. Five of the  studies have potential measurement errors. For example, Shaw and  Kaczorowski sought to examine the effectiveness of a peer counseling  program on breastfeeding initiation and duration by asking new mothers  to recall interactions with breastfeeding peer counselors that took place  at the time of birth. Mothers were interviewed 6 weeks to 6 months  after giving birth. If memory lapses occurred, new mothers may have  incorrectly recalled their dealings with peer counselors, thereby  potentially introducing measurement error into the data.", "Appendix V shows the major findings and methodological limitations of  each of the 12 demonstration studies.", "Our analysis suggests that the effective interventions described in the  demonstration studies may cost more than standard WIC approaches. For  example, most breastfeeding special interventions were specifically  designed to increase the amount of counseling and support provided to  prenatal and postpartum women. Although only one of the demonstration  studies provided information about the additional costs associated with  such interventions, it is reasonable to expect that such one-on-one support  will cost more than the standard WIC program.", "Two of the demonstration studies help to illustrate the linkage between  resource commitment and results achieved. The first, Ahluwalia and  others, which found that a hospital-based strategy providing bedside  support and counseling to women who had just given birth, was the most  effective at increasing breastfeeding initiation rates out of five new  strategies evaluated. This strategy clearly required more resources than the  standard practice of providing counseling and brochures to participants  during a visit to the WIC clinic. The second study, Weimer, which was  funded by USDA, focused on a special intervention that was similarly  resource-intensive. It reported that providing one-on-one support in the  hospital after delivery, followed by an in-home visit within 72 hours of  birth, increased breastfeeding duration. However, neither study provided  any information about the additional costs needed to implement these  special interventions.", "Only one of the 12 demonstration studies we reviewed, Hutchins and  others, provided any information about the costs associated with the  implementation of the special intervention. This study reported that  vaccinations increased at sites providing vaccination screening and  voucher incentives (until their children are immunized, a family must visit  the clinic monthly\u2014rather than every 3 months\u2014to pick up WIC  vouchers). This study uses what its authors term \u201ccrude\u201d cost-effectiveness  ratios to estimate the average cost for each additional child with up-to-date  immunizations. These costs range between $30 and $73, depending on the  number of enrolled children and rates of active participation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact Research Provides Very Limited Information on the Effectiveness of WIC\u2019s Individual Nutrition Services", "paragraphs": ["The seven impact research studies we reviewed provide few conclusive  insights into the recent effectiveness of WIC breastfeeding promotion and  support, referral services, or nutrition education services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Breastfeeding Promotion and Support", "paragraphs": ["Three of the four impact studies that focused on breastfeeding promotion  and support\u2014Schwartz and others, Balcazar and others, and Timbo and  others\u2014use old data from the 1988 National Maternal and Infant Health  Survey. Although, according to FNS officials, this survey represents the  most recent data available, much has changed in the program since 1988,  including the characteristics of WIC participants and the emphasis the  program places on breastfeeding. As a result, these studies\u2019 findings shed  little light on the program\u2019s current effects. Although the fourth study,  Wiemann and others, uses data from the mid-1990s, its limited scope, in  terms of geography and participants, constrains the applicability of its  findings. This study, with data collected from 684 adolescent mothers who  gave birth at a hospital in Galveston, Texas, could have some specialized  usefulness, but would have to be replicated at many other sites to provide  insights into the broader effectiveness of WIC\u2019s breastfeeding promotion  and support services. In addition, since adolescent mothers comprise only  about 11 percent of all WIC mothers, the study\u2019s focus on them further  compromises its more general usefulness.", "Taken as whole, the inconsistency in the findings of these four studies  further limit their usefulness in assessing the effects of WIC\u2019s breastfeeding  promotion and support program. For example, Wiemann and others and  Balcazar and others find that WIC enrollment is a significant factor in some  mothers\u2019 decision to bottle-feed, while Timbo and others, and Schwartz and  others, conclude that WIC participation increases breastfeeding.

The first study, Suarez and others, using survey  data from 30 counties in Texas, found that children who are enrolled in  WIC are significantly more likely than children who are not enrolled to be  up-to-date on their immunizations, regardless of other intervening factors  such as the child\u2019s age, ethnicity, or the family\u2019s income. Although this  study likely contains some measurement error, it provides at least limited  evidence that WIC referral services are effective in increasing  immunization rates. In contrast, due to major methodological problems,  the second referral study, McCunniff and others, provides little useful  information on the effectiveness of WIC referral services. This study is  based on self-administered questionnaire data collected from a sample of  mothers at three WIC sites in Kansas City, Missouri. The study found that  when taking into account factors such as WIC referral, child\u2019s age,  household size, and availability of dental insurance, only the age of the  child had a significant, independent effect on the likelihood that children  will visit a dentist. There are two principal limitations to this study. First,  almost 40 percent of the sampled children were younger than 1 year old.  Because many children less than 1 year of age do not yet have teeth, they  are much less likely to have made a dental visit, thus reducing the study\u2019s  ability to identify factors associated with dental visits other than age. The  second major limitation is the measurement error associated with the  reliance on self-reported questionnaire data about visits to the dentist. The  study did not attempt to verify questionnaire responses through a review of  dental records. The authors suggested that such reviews would have  increased the accuracy of the self-reported data. As a result of these  serious methodological problems, it is likely that McCunniff and others has  only limited relevance to understanding the effectiveness of WIC referral  services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nutrition Education", "paragraphs": ["The one study that primarily focused on the impact of nutrition education,  Fox and others, also examined breastfeeding programs and their  effectiveness.

For example, its scope was  limited in that it focused on pregnant and postpartum women at six WIC  sites, in three states. Within this limited context, the study describes  program and participant characteristics; the nutrition services offered  (including breastfeeding promotion and support); participants\u2019 receipt of  and satisfaction with these services; and changes in participants\u2019  knowledge and behaviors between the time of prenatal WIC certification  and 4 to 6 months postpartum. The study also attempted to assess the  impact of WIC nutrition education on participants\u2019 knowledge and  behavior.
