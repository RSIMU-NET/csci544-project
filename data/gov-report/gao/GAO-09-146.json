The 2008 filing season was particularly challenging due to the unanticipated mandate to make economic stimulus payments. The filing season is also the start of IRS's efforts to ensure the newly filed returns are compliant with the tax laws. GAO was asked to assess IRS's performance, describe the costs and foregone revenue of administering the economic stimulus payments, and identify any opportunities for improving filing season compliance checks. GAO analyzed IRS performance data, reviewed IRS operations, and interviewed IRS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS successfully processed150 million returns and issued 105million refundsfor $246 billion as of September 12, 2008. In addition, IRS issued 116 million stimulus payments totaling $94 billion. However, taxpayers' access to IRS's telephone assistors was substantially lower than last year because of an unanticipated increase in telephone call volume. Calls to IRS more than doubled to 118 million as many taxpayers had questions about the amount of their stimulus payment or its timing. IRS acted to answer the calls including shifting hundreds of staff from collection cases to telephone assistance. IRS took other actions such as adding features to its Web site that answered stimulus-related questions and likely diverted some calls. Regardless, taxpayers' ability to get through to IRS telephone assistors declined from about 81 percent of waiting callers getting through last year to about 57 percent from January through June 30 of this year. IRS expects the costs and foregone revenue associated with issuing the economic stimulus package (ESP) payments to reach about $960 million, of which $655 million is revenue foregone due to the shift of collections staff to telephone service. There are two areas where IRS does not use its current legal authority to automatically correct errors when processing tax returns. One involves eligibility for the child and dependent care credit by taxpayers who are \"Married Filing Separately.\" Taxpayers in this filing status are not eligible for the credit, but IRS allows the credit to be claimed, issues refunds, and then audits taxpayers to try to recover the money. The second is that IRS does not use its existing legislative authority to verify earned income tax credit claims by noncustodial parents--in 2006, $91 million of claims were unverified. IRS has plans to study one option for verifying these claims, but is not planning to study another option, combining federal data on noncustodial parents and other taxpayer characteristics to automatically determine eligibility. Finally, there are two areas where IRS lacks legal authority, but has the technical ability to use automated error checks. IRS could prevent (1) individuals from deducting contributions to individual retirement accounts above the allowable limit and (2) individuals from violating the age requirements for such contributions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Effective and timely taxpayer service and enforcement programs, working  together, can provide faster refunds, reduce the burden on taxpayers of  complying with tax laws, help identify and correct errors before interest is  owed by the taxpayer, and help to ensure that taxpayers receive tax  benefits for which they are eligible.

Electronic filing is faster,  which allows taxpayers to receive refunds faster, and is less prone to  transcription and other errors, and provides IRS with significant cost  savings.", "Taxpayers below an income ceiling can access the Free File program  offered through IRS\u2019s Web site by a consortium of 19 tax preparation  companies that offer free on-line tax preparation and filing services for  qualifying taxpayers.  IRS continues to develop and deliver a number of Business Systems  Modernization programs, including releases of the Customer Account  Data Engine (CADE). CADE is intended to eventually replace IRS\u2019s  antiquated Master File legacy processing system and facilitates faster  refund processing and provides IRS with more up-to-date account  information.", "IRS provides a variety of taxpayer services, including the following.", "IRS has toll-free assistance telephone lines which taxpayers can call  with questions about tax law or their refunds. Depending on how  taxpayers respond to menu choices, questions are answered by  automated messages or calls are routed to telephone assistors located  at 24 call sites around the country.  IRS offers assistance through its Web site, including \u201cWhere\u2019s My  Refund?\u201d, which enables taxpayers to use the Web site to determine  whether the agency received their tax returns and processed their  refunds. Taxpayers can also download forms, instructions, and  publications, research their own tax law issues through Frequently  Asked Questions or Tax Topics, and receive help with specific tax law  questions and procedural questions via e-mail.  IRS offers assistance at nearly 12,000 volunteer sites, which helps IRS  serve traditionally underserved taxpayer segments, including elderly,  low-income, and disabled taxpayers, and taxpayers with limited- English proficiency. Additionally, IRS has 401 walk-in sites where  taxpayers can receive basic tax law and account assistance from IRS  staff and have returns prepared if their annual income is $40,000 or  less.", "In addition to depending on IRS, taxpayers depend heavily on paid tax  return preparers or commercial tax prepartion software during the filing  season. Paid preparers are a critical part of the nation\u2019s tax administration  system because of the wide variety of assistance they offer taxpayers,  including help understanding tax obligations, return preparation and  electronic filing, and providing forms and publications. In 2007, 59 percent  of individual taxpayers had their return prepared and filed by paid  preparers and about 16 percent prepared their return using commercial  tax preparation software.", "Late tax law changes create filing season challenges for IRS. This can be  particularly true if, like ESP, the changes are complex and significantly  increase filing season workload (for a detailed description of IRS\u2019s  implementation of ESP, see app. II). ESP contained complex rules about  eligibility, amount of the rebate, and filing requirements.", "Over the years, the Congress granted IRS legal authority to cover 11 areas  so that the agency could correct return errors during processing, including  calculation errors and entries that are inconsistent or exceed statutory  limits, without having to issue the taxpayer a statutory notice of deficiency  (see app. III for further details on the MEA process and authorities). We  have reported that prompt compliance checks such as these are important  because as unpaid taxes age, the likelihood of collecting all or part of the  amount owed decreases, due in part to continued accrual of interest and  penalties on the outstanding federal taxes. MEA also provides a taxpayer  service as it allows taxpayers to receive their refunds faster, corrects  return errors before interest is accrued, and can avoid time consuming  interaction with IRS while the error is being resolved.", "MEA can also help ensure taxpayers receive the tax benefits for which  they are eligible. For example, between tax years 2003 and 2006, using its  MEA, IRS identified over 500,000 occurrences of taxpayers under-claiming  the EITC with the result that an additional $130 million was provided to  those claimants. Without MEA, most of these errors would not likely have  been identified and thousands of low income taxpayers would likely have  received less than they were entitled.", "Because math error checks are automated and require little contact with  taxpayers, they provide IRS with an enforcement tool that is low cost and  less intrusive and burdensome to taxpayers than audits. By using its MEA,  IRS reported preventing $460 million from reaching ineligible taxpayers in  fiscal year 2006.", "The NTA\u2014who heads the program that helps resolve taxpayers\u2019 tax  problems with IRS and recommends changes to mitigate taxpayer  problems\u2014noted some concerns about IRS\u2019s use of MEA in its 2006 report  to Congress. NTA reported that, because MEA allows IRS to summarily  assess the tax before a taxpayer has the opportunity to challenge the  assessment, it should be used in specific and narrow circumstances.  Because taxpayer rights are different under MEA, NTA expressed concern  that math error notices did not provide enough detail for the recipient to  understand what had occurred, their rights, and how they could request  abatement. NTA also reported that IRS was using math error checks in  some limited areas where it was not clear that IRS had the authority. In its  response to the NTA\u2019s 2006 report, IRS reported that it resolved the issues  raised by NTA.

The number of taxpayers who filed electronically through Free File  increased 24 percent, after a 2 percent decline in participation last year, to  3.8 million.

As we have previously reported, a major benefit of  CADE is that direct deposit refunds are issued by CADE 1 to 5 business  days faster than the current legacy system, and paper check refunds are  issued 4 to 8 business days faster because CADE posts information daily.  CADE also was successful in processing 24 million stimulus payments and  contributed to IRS\u2019s early distribution of some stimulus payments. ESP- only payments processed through CADE, rather than the legacy Master  file, were issued up to 4 days earlier than the first scheduled disbursement  date.", "Despite the additional volume, IRS met or exceeded goals for seven out of  eight of the processing measures (see app. IV for details). The one measure  where performance was significantly below IRS\u2019s goal and last year\u2019s level  was the refund error rate, i.e., the percentage of refunds with IRS-cause  errors issued to taxpayers by IRS.

Consistent  with this approach, IRS released the \u201cAdvancing E-File Study\u201d in  November 2008, which is the foundation for the agency\u2019s strategy and  planned actions to reach the congressionally-set goal of 80 percent of  individual returns filed electronically.", "In recent reports, we suggested two options for increasing electronic filing  or reducing paper processing. One would be for Congress to mandate  electronic filing by large paid tax return preparers. Currently, many  returns prepared by preparers on computers are printed and mailed to  IRS, which then have to be transcribed. Our other option is to require bar  coding on paper returns that were prepared by taxpayers using  commercial tax preparation software. Bar coding would eliminate IRS\u2019s  transcription costs and errors. IRS agreed to study this recommendation.", "Paid preparers prepared over 81 million returns, which was 59 percent of  all individual tax returns in the 2007 filing season. Because IRS has limited  ability to identify paid preparers and match them with the returns they  prepared, we recently reported that IRS has limited information about the  accuracy of these returns and recommended that IRS develop a plan to  require a single identification number for paid preparers, which could  facilitate research on paid preparers\u2019 influence on taxpayer compliance.

However, compared to last  year, more than twice as many callers abandoned their calls and nearly   10 times as many were disconnected by IRS.", "On the basis of its experience with the stimulus rebates in 2001 and 2003,  IRS took steps to facilitate telephone service, including establishing a  dedicated toll-free Rebate Hotline for callers with ESP-related questions in  February. As of June 30, IRS answered 37 million calls made to its Rebate  Hotline. However, the unprecedented call volume strained IRS telephone  resources and contributed to a significant decline in the telephone level of  service. Calls to IRS spiked in the first three weeks of May around the  same time that the first rounds of stimulus checks were issued (see fig. 1).  According to IRS officials, taxpayers\u2019 confusion over when they would  receive their payment, or how much they received contributed to the high  call volume. During these weeks, the percentage of callers waiting for an  assistor and getting through fell below 50 percent and subsequently did  not surpass that mark.", "The increased call volume also contributed to a decline in related  performance indicators and measures. As previously noted, the number of  callers who received busy signals or were disconnected from IRS  increased as did the caller abandon rate. Further, as shown in table 3, the  average speed of answer\u2014the length of time taxpayers wait to get their  calls answered\u2014nearly doubled from last year.", "In addition to the Rebate Hotline, service on other toll-free lines, such as  tax law and account assistance, was affected as well. For example, IRS  estimated that from early May, when IRS began issuing ESP payments,  through the end of June about 30 percent of callers to other toll-free lines  asked ESP-related questions in addition to their primary question. When  the caller asked an ESP-related question, the assistor was instructed not to  transfer the caller to the rebate hotline, but instead to answer the question.  As a result, the level of service on some other telephone applications not  related to the Rebate Hotline also declined this year, according to IRS  officials.", "Even with the increased volume of calls, the accuracy of the telephone  assistors\u2019 responses to tax law and account questions was comparable to  the same time period last year and met IRS\u2019s goals (see table 4).

On May 21, 2008, we sent a  letter to the IRS Commissioner that suggested four options for his  consideration. IRS implemented three of the four options. IRS re-ordered  the Frequently Asked Questions page on IRS\u2019s Web site to put the most  common questions addressed by assistors first. IRS added text to the  payment schedule page on its Web site and a message for telephone  assistors that provided more detail as to when various types of taxpayers  should expect to receive their refunds. IRS modified the Rebate Hotline  script to include an automated \u201cMost Frequently Asked Questions\u201d (FAQs)  option by adding the FAQs to the automated messaging in the call waiting  queue. The option IRS did not implement was to expand outreach efforts  in the press about the timing and calculation of stimulus payments. IRS  officials concluded that this information might unintentionally create more  calls.

This funding would be used, in part, to cover telephone  demand, which IRS expects to remain well above normal in 2009 due in  part to ESP.", "Because of the timing of ESP, IRS officials said that they did not have time  to hire, conduct background checks on, and train additional staff to handle  the increased telephone volume. Instead, IRS shifted hundreds of  Automated Collection System (ACS) staff to answer calls to the Rebate  Hotline from March through August 2008.", "As of August, IRS reported $655 million in foregone revenue because of  ACS staff being taken off their collections work to answer the  unprecedented volume of calls related to ESP. As we previously reported,  IRS considered alternatives to shifting ACS staff, including contracting  out, using other staff, or using Social Security Administration (SSA) staff,  but decided the alternatives were not feasible.

These partners played a key role in funding and carrying out outreach to  inform targeted groups, e.g., elderly, limited English proficiency, disabled,  about their eligibility for the economic stimulus. For example, AARP  supplied economic stimulus information on its Web site and in its monthly  bulletin, and IRS officials reported that AARP paid for one of the mailings  to people over 65 who may have been eligible for a stimulus payment, but  had not yet filed a tax return. According to IRS officials, partly because of  the efforts of the volunteer partners, 82 percent of the targeted individuals  eligible for the economic stimulus participated in the program.

Noncustodial parents are generally ineligible for EITC, because in most  but not all cases, the child have not lived with the noncustodial parent  for more than the required 6 months of the tax year to meet EITC  eligibility. According to EITC officials, IRS does not use its MEA in these  cases because the child may have lived with the non-custodial parent for  more than 6 months, meeting the residency requirements for eligibility;  however, the FCR may not reflect this living arrangement. Instead of using  its MEA, IRS audits less than 2 percent of these cases; however, it does not  audit more cases because audits are labor intensive. As a consequence,  most of the more than 41,000 claims for $91 million in 2006 by  noncustodial parents were allowed without verification. IRS does not  know how many of these claims were incorrect, but for the claims it  audited, the error rate was about 91 percent of claims for 2006.", "IRS officials reported that, as part of their 2009 EITC Research Plan, they  plan to review the reliability and applicability of linking the custodial  information in the FCR to EITC eligibility. They stated that if the FCR is  found to be sufficiently reliable, IRS could use its MEA to automatically  identify and correct ineligible EITC claims.", "By focusing on FCR data alone, IRS\u2019s review may be missing another way  to use MEA to verify EITC claims by noncustodial parents and minimize  the chance of disallowing eligible claims. IRS could combine FCR data  with factors it currently uses to select returns for audits, factors such as  taxpayer characteristics like filing status. In a limited sample of returns  from tax year 2006, audit data show that the FCR combined with audit  selection factors such as filing status allowed IRS to accurately identify  ineligible EITC claims by noncustodial parents in 98 percent of cases.  Without including a more thorough assessment of this approach in its FCR  review, IRS will not know the extent to which more accurate eligibility  decisions could be made. Because the agency has MEA to use the FCR, the  agency does not need additional authority to use FCR together with the  audit selection factors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Two Areas Where IRS Could Use Math Error Checks, but Would Need Legislative Authority", "paragraphs": ["We identified two areas related to IRA contributions where IRS officials  reported that they have the technical ability to accurately identify and  correct math errors and did so as recently as 2006.

These taxpayers incorrectly claim the amount  intended for people over 50 making IRA \u201ccatch-up\u201d contributions. In 2004,  IRS identified 24,000 incidences of these IRA contribution overclaims  resulting in $23.2 million in underreported taxes. IRS used age data from  the SSA database to check for age eligibility of these contributions. IRS  counsel determined that the agency does not have MEA to use age-based  data in this manner, although IRS has and does use age data from the SSA  database for other math error types, such as EITC eligibility.", "Second, some taxpayers over the age of 70-\u00bd claim contributions to a  traditional IRA, which they are not entitled to make. By law, taxpayers  over the age of 70-\u00bd cannot make contributions to traditional IRAs.

In general, these are errors that must be corrected in order for IRS  to process the tax return. A 1976 statutory revision defined the authority to  include not only mathematical errors, but other obvious errors such as  omissions of data needed to substantiate an item on a return, and provided  a statutory right to file a request for abatement of the assessment within 60  days after the notice is sent.
