Nonetheless, IRS records indicate that some federal workers and annuitants are not fulfilling their tax responsibilities and owe the federal government about $2.5 billion in outstanding taxes. In its attempt to improve management and collection of federal taxes owed by federal workers and annuitants, IRS faces the same issues hindering its ability to manage and collect unpaid taxes of the general population.

Unpaid assessments also include accumulated penalties and interest.", "Despite the high level of tax collections, the agency continues to have a significant balance of cumulative unpaid assessments. As of September 30, 2000, IRS reported cumulative unpaid assessments of $240 billion, of which only $22 billion, or 9 percent, it estimated to be collectible.Similarly, as of September 30, 1999, IRS estimated that of $231 billion in unpaid assessments, $21 billion, or 9 percent, was likely to be collected. IRS\u2019 balance of unpaid assessments consists of various types of taxes, including payroll, corporate, and individual income taxes. Included in this cumulative balance are outstanding taxes IRS reports to be owed by federal workers and annuitants. According to IRS records, cumulative amounts owed by federal workers and annuitants made up about 1 percent of the total outstanding balance of unpaid assessments in both fiscal years 1999 and 2000.", "This report responds to your request for information on unpaid taxes that federal workers and annuitants owe the federal government. You asked for information on the number of federal workers and annuitants that have outstanding tax obligations, how much they owe, the type of taxes they owe, and how the level of taxes they owe compares with that owed by nonfederal taxpayers. You also asked for information on what impediments, if any, affect IRS\u2019 ability to (1) collect amounts owed by federal workers and annuitants and (2) promote tax compliance, and thus impact IRS\u2019 effectiveness in enforcing the tax code for this federal population.", "To respond to your request, we used a combination of (1) analyses of data maintained on IRS\u2019 systems or otherwise provided by IRS as of October 1999, (2) detailed reviews of federal worker and annuitant unpaid tax cases, (3) interviews with IRS headquarters and field office officials, (4) interviews with Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and Office of Government Ethics (OGE) personnel on ethics and responsibilities of federal workers and annuitants, and (5) discussions with the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) personnel on the status of implementation of Treasury\u2019s continuous levy program.

Among the ethical standards prescribed in the order is that \u201cEmployees shall satisfy in good faith their obligations as citizens, including all just financial obligations, especially those such as Federal, State, or local taxes that are imposed by law.\u201d The executive order, which was recently emphasized by the current administration in January 2001, continues to stress the ethical importance of federal workers\u2019 complying with their federal tax obligations. Noncompliance by federal workers and annuitants could adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of tax administration, government effectiveness, and the federal workforce. If the general public perceives that federal workers and annuitants can successfully evade their tax obligations, voluntary compliance, the foundation of the U.S. tax system, could be eroded.", "In 1992, IRS initiated FERDI, a program to identify the degree of compliance with federal tax laws among federal workers and federal annuitants. IRS began this program as a means to improve information on potential levy sources and in response to the presidential executive order. Beginning in 1992, IRS began to periodically match its records of outstanding taxes and nonfiled tax returns against federal personnel records to identify federal workers and annuitants who either had outstanding taxes or had not filed their tax returns. IRS entered into agreements with the Defense Manpower Data Center, which receives personnel data files on many of the government\u2019s active and retired civilian and military workers, and the U.S. Postal Service, which maintains and processes similar data for postal workers, to match these personnel records against a data file of outstanding taxes and unfiled tax returns monthly. Most agencies, accounting for over 95 percent of the federal workforce, participate in this matching process. For those federal agencies and entities that do not, including the National Security Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and legislative branch entities, IRS attempts to identify these employees through a separate matching of Wage and Earnings Statements (W-2s). However, this process has certain limitations.", "Agencies that participate in the matching process and agencies where IRS is able to perform a match using W-2 information annually receive a letter from IRS informing them of the number of employees with outstanding taxes or unfiled tax returns. These letters also contain IRS\u2019 assessment of the agency\u2019s rate of compliance. Because of restrictions imposed by confidentiality laws, these agencies do not receive information on the specific names of individual employees whom IRS has identified as not complying with the nation\u2019s tax laws.", "The broad objectives of FERDI are to enhance the federal government\u2019s tax administration process by improving the compliance of federal employees and annuitants with their responsibility for filing tax returns and paying taxes, thereby helping to ensure the public\u2019s confidence in the tax system. The program combines reaching out to federal agencies to raise their awareness of this issue and prioritizing IRS\u2019 efforts to reduce its unpaid tax cases. Because of the potential ethical concerns and public perceptions related to federal employees and annuitants who do not comply with their tax responsibilities, IRS until recently adopted what it referred to as a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy for these cases. Specifically, IRS\u2019 policy until January 2001 has generally been to actively pursue all known noncompliance cases involving federal workers and annuitants, without prioritizing by amount involved or potential for collection. In January 2001, IRS changed its prioritization system for FERDI cases and these now receive the same priority as the general population cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Records Indicate Federal Workers and Annuitants Owe $2.5 Billion in Unpaid Taxes", "paragraphs": ["According to IRS records, as of October 1999, over 390,000 federal workers and annuitants, or 4.5 percent of the total 8.7 million on-roll federal worker and annuitant population, owed about $2.5 billion in unpaid federal taxes. IRS records indicate that another 65,000 federal workers and annuitants had not filed tax returns and were identified by IRS as potential nonfilers. In total, IRS records indicated that as of October 1999, over 5 percent of the federal population had outstanding taxes, had not met its tax filing responsibilities, or both. This percentage compared favorably with the general population: IRS\u2019 records indicated that as of October 1999, over 8 percent of the general population owed amounts to the government for unpaid taxes, had not filed tax returns, or both. Information recently reported by IRS indicated that, as of October 2000, 340,000 federal workers and annuitants owed cumulative unpaid taxes of about $2.5 billion, and another 85,000 federal workers and annuitants had not filed tax returns. This information indicated that, as of October 2000, slightly less than 5 percent of the federal worker and annuitant population owed taxes or had not filed tax returns as required, compared to a little over 7 percent for the general population.", "Based on these percentages, federal workers and annuitants appear to be more compliant than the general taxpayer population in meeting their tax obligations. However, these percentages and the amounts reported as owed to the federal government are affected by several factors. Not all taxpayers, including federal workers and annuitants, pay the amounts they owe the federal government. Some do not provide payments on their tax liability when they file their tax returns. Others underreport, either mistakenly or deliberately, the amounts they owe the government. Still others do not report the amounts they owe. To the extent that underreporting or nonreporting by taxpayers is not detected and corrected by IRS, the amount of unpaid taxes IRS identifies is understated.", "Conversely, not all amounts IRS identifies as unpaid taxes are actually owed by taxpayers; thus, the amount of unpaid taxes IRS identifies could be overstated. This is particularly true for cases in which IRS assesses additional taxes based on third-party-provided information, or when a taxpayer has not filed a tax return for a given period and IRS constructs a return for the individual based on third-party information. Erroneous third-party information can result in IRS\u2019 erroneously assessing a taxpayer for amounts that are not owed. Also, when IRS assesses taxes based on third-party payment information, the assessed tax may be overstated because IRS cannot consider legitimate deductions that may apply and that could reduce or even eliminate the identified tax liability. In addition, if IRS errs in applying taxpayer payments, its records could reflect a tax liability that has already been paid. In other instances, IRS unpaid assessments include amounts being contested by taxpayers. In some cases, the taxpayers may even be due a refund.", "It is also important to note that, for both the federal and the general populations, the percentages noted above and the reported amounts of unpaid taxes include balances taxpayers owe that are being paid under installment agreements. The amount of unpaid taxes owed by the federal population as of October 1999 and October 2000 included about $660 million and about $650 million, respectively, owed by taxpayers who were in installment agreements with IRS. If these federal workers and annuitants were excluded from the population of federal workers and annuitants who were considered to be noncompliant, the percentages of the federal worker and annuitant population who owed taxes or had not filed tax returns as required as of October 1999 and October 2000 would decline to 3.3 percent and 3 percent, respectively.", "IRS\u2019 difficulty in better determining noncompliance is affected by a number of issues including significant deficiencies in its systems and processes leading to delays in identifying noncompliant taxpayers and errors in taxpayer accounts, and resource allocation decisions and limitations.

About one-third of these individuals owed taxes for more than one tax period and owed for extended periods of time, and about 56 percent of the total outstanding amounts dated back to before 1995. Federal annuitants accounted for 54 percent of the total outstanding amounts owed by federal workers and annuitants, while constituting 40 percent of the number of individuals with tax delinquencies.

According to IRS records, as of October 1999, over 99 percent of the accounts owed by federal workers and annuitants was attributable to individual income taxes owed. It is important to note that such income taxes are not necessarily solely attributable to federal salaries or pensions. Some income may be attributable to other sources such as secondary nonfederal income, a spouse\u2019s nonfederal income, or gains on sale of property.", "Among the less than one percent of federal workers and annuitants with outstanding taxes as of October 1999 that were not related to their income, approximately 2,300 individuals owed the government penalty assessments totaling $155 million resulting from IRS\u2019 finding them to be willful and responsible for the failure to remit amounts withheld from employee salaries for payroll taxes. In some instances, these individuals were assessed for multiple periods of withheld but nonremitted payroll taxes\u2014the 2,300 individuals owe outstanding penalties on 3,019 separate tax accounts. In one case we reviewed, we found that IRS had assessed a retired federal employee for withholding and not forwarding to the government payroll taxes he withheld from employees of two businesses he started after retiring. In each of these two businesses, the individual had withheld taxes from his employees\u2019 salaries for 17 separate periods without forwarding the withheld funds to the federal government.

Our statistical sample of 140 unpaid tax cases involving federal workers and annuitants reinforces these statistics. In 55 of the cases (39 percent), some or all of the taxes owed were identified as a result of IRS\u2019 enforcement programs, rather than through the taxpayers\u2019 own reporting.

Table 1 provides a breakdown of the federal workers and annuitants by number of tax accounts owed.", "In addition, most of the amounts owed by federal workers and annuitants had been outstanding for a number of years. As of October 1999, about 200,000 separate accounts (29 percent of the total number of accounts) related to taxes assessed for years before 1995. These accounts totaled about $1.4 billion and represented 56 percent of the nearly $2.5 billion total balance in tax assessments identified by IRS as owed by federal workers and annuitants. About 23 percent, or $576 million, dated back to before 1990.

Table 2 provides a breakdown of the number and associated outstanding balances owed by year in which the tax was due.", "As our previous work on unpaid assessments shows, the longer a tax liability remains outstanding, the lower the likelihood that IRS will be able to collect the outstanding amount. Further, because IRS continues to accrue significant amounts of interest and penalties on these delinquent taxes as they age, additional amounts having a lower likelihood of being collected are added to IRS\u2019 balance of unpaid assessments.

This percentage was fairly consistent between federal workers and federal annuitants: 5.5 percent for active federal workers and 5 percent for federal annuitants. However, according to IRS records, federal annuitants owed, on average, 50 percent more per account than active federal workers. While the average account balance for federal annuitants was $4,387, the average account balance for the active federal workers was $2,962. As a result, as indicated in table 3, federal annuitants owed 54 percent of the nearly $2.5 billion in unpaid taxes while accounting for 40 percent of the population.", "Several factors account for this difference. For one, federal and nonfederal retirees receiving civil service or private-sector retirement pension or annuity payments have the option to waive tax withholdings. This treatment contrasts with that for active employees, both federal and nonfederal, who cannot claim an exemption from withholding unless they meet certain conditions. The treatment of civil service and private-sector retirees also differs from that of U.S. Armed Forces annuitants, since periodic pension or annuity payments for the latter (as well as certain other types of payments) are defined as wages and thus are subject to income tax withholding.", "If annuitants elect not to have amounts withheld and do not make the appropriate financial adjustments, they increase the risk of finding themselves without the means to pay their tax obligations. Discussions with IRS officials at several field offices we visited, and many of the cases we reviewed in our statistical sample, indicate that one underlying cause of tax delinquencies by federal annuitants is the lack of withholding of amounts from pension payments throughout the year to ensure that the individual is not faced with a substantial tax liability at the end of the year. In 14 (19 percent) of the 73 unpaid tax cases we reviewed involving federal retirees, the lack of adequate tax withholdings or the absence of any withholdings contributed to substantial tax liabilities at the end of the year.", "Another factor contributing to the difference is that without automatic tax withholdings from pension payments and without the means to pay amounts due, annuitants\u2019 accounts are often older than those of active federal workers. About 4 percent of the accounts and 15 percent of the outstanding balance owed by active federal workers as of October 1999 dated back to before 1990. In contrast, 9 percent of the accounts and 30 percent of the outstanding balance owed by federal annuitants predated 1990. Because penalties and interest continue to accrue on outstanding unpaid taxes, the longer an account remains outstanding, the greater the extent to which the original taxes are increased by the added penalties and interest. Over time, the penalties and interest can grow to the point where they significantly exceed the original balance due. IRS records show that penalties and interest charges, both accrued and assessed, accounted for 59 percent of federal annuitants\u2019 average account balance as of October 1999, compared with 50 percent of federal workers\u2019 average account balance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Employees Are Subject to Tax Compliance Program and Are More Compliant", "paragraphs": ["IRS views compliance by its employees as critical to its mission as the nation\u2019s tax collector.

IRS\u2019 rules of conduct specifically stress the requirement that its employees promptly and properly file all tax returns, and that properly filing tax returns includes providing the appropriate payments as reflected on the return. IRS bases this requirement on the fact that, by virtue of IRS\u2019 mission, the public must have confidence in its integrity, efficiency, and fairness. IRS\u2019 rules of ethical conduct do allow the employee the same rights with respect to tax issues as those afforded the general public, such as the ability to file an extension or enter into an installment agreement to pay any outstanding amounts. However, the rules specifically note that failure to adhere to the filing requirements may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.", "Also, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA98) imposed more stringent requirements on IRS employees, with some sanctions as severe as terminating their employment. Specifically, Section 1203 of the act cites two specific instances in which the commission of such violation could result in the employee\u2019s termination: (1) willfully failing to file required tax returns, unless such failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect (Section 1203(8)), and (2) willfully understating a tax liability, unless such understatement is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect (Section 1203(9)).", "IRS has an Employee Tax Compliance Program to monitor the compliance of its workers with its filing and tax requirements. The program is designed to identify IRS employees who have filed or paid their taxes late, are delinquent in paying any balance due, or for whom IRS has no record of a tax return having been filed. The program is centralized at IRS\u2019 Cincinnati Service Center, which periodically matches IRS\u2019 automated personnel records against its master files\u2014its detailed database of taxpayer accounts\u2014and downloads any matches into a separate Employee Tax Compliance database. Program personnel review these data to identify the potential compliance issue, and if they determine an infraction has occurred, refer the issue to the employee\u2019s labor relations office for review. Depending on the nature of the issue identified, certain disciplinary action may be warranted.", "It is important to note that potential non-Section 1203 violations are dealt with in a different manner. Examples of the potential non-Section 1203 issues and disciplinary actions are reflected in table 4. The policies and procedures for non-Section 1203 violations apply to all IRS employees regardless of grade level. The only distinction is that cases involving Senior Executive Service (SES) employees and GS-15 employees are handled at a central labor relations office at IRS headquarters.", "If IRS personnel responsible for the Employee Tax Compliance program determine that the violation falls within the provisions of Section 1203, the case is brought before a Central Adjudication Unit at IRS headquarters for review. If the unit determines that a Section 1203 violation exists, the case is brought before the IRS Commissioner\u2019s 1203 Review Board for final disposition. The board, which is chaired by the IRS Deputy Commissioner for Operations, can either terminate the employee or recommend that the IRS Commissioner mitigate the disciplinary action. After the final determination, the employee has the right to due process and can appeal the final decision. From June 1999 through July 2000, 77 cases involving Section 1203 violations were brought before, and reviewed by, the Commissioner\u2019s 1203 Review Board. Of these cases, 38 resulted in the dismissal of the employee, 29 resulted in disciplinary actions less severe than termination due to a finding of mitigating factors, and 10 were still pending disposition.", "Through its program, IRS identified 3,255 of its employees who either had outstanding taxes or had not filed tax returns as of October 1999. The 3,255 employees with outstanding taxes or unfiled tax returns represented about 3.3 percent of IRS\u2019 overall population at that time. More recent information reported by IRS showed that as of October 2000, 2,975 of its employees, or 3.1 percent of its overall workforce at that time, either had outstanding taxes or had not filed tax returns.

Nonetheless, this significantly impedes IRS\u2019 ability to pursue collection of outstanding taxes owed and creates the potential for increased noncompliance.", "IRS does not investigate all tax returns identified as having potential underreported taxes. For example, for tax year 1996, IRS screened 155 million individual income tax returns and found that about 12 million (8 percent) had potential underreported taxes totaling at least $15 billion. However, IRS investigated only about 3.1 million (26 percent) of these returns, accounting for estimated underreported taxes due of about $5.2 billion (35 percent). Consequently, about $10 billion in potential underreported taxes went uninvestigated and thus will likely not be pursued for possible collection. More recent statistics show this is a continuing problem. IRS\u2019 screening of individual tax returns for tax year 1998 identified over 14 million individual tax returns that had potential underreported taxes totaling $15.4 billion, yet IRS investigated only 2.5 million (18 percent) of these cases accounting for about $6.5 billion (42 percent) of the total underreported taxes. This limited investigation activity results in billions of dollars in potential unpaid taxes annually that are not pursued. This limitation also affects IRS\u2019 ability to accurately assess the level of noncompliance, both for the general population and for the population of federal workers and annuitants.", "In addition, IRS also does not always actively pursue cases in which outstanding taxes have been assessed, resulting in potentially billions of dollars in lost revenue to the government. During both our fiscal year 1999 and 2000 financial audits, we found a number of cases that IRS was not actively pursuing, including some in which we noted that the taxpayer had financial resources to pay at least some of the amounts owed. IRS enforcement data indicate that from fiscal years 1997 through 2000, the number of case dispositions and the number of revenue officers available to work those cases declined. Enforcement activities such as lien filings, levy notices, and seizures all showed substantial declines during this period. IRS attributes its inability to pursue such collections to a decrease in staff, reassignment of collection employees to support customer service activities, and additional staff time needed to implement certain taxpayer protections that were included in RRA98.", "Despite IRS\u2019 \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy then in effect for federal workers and annuitants with outstanding taxes, we also found cases in our sample in which IRS was not actively pursuing some federal workers and annuitants who had resources that could have been used to pay some of the amounts owed. Further, of the $390 million in outstanding taxes owed by federal workers and annuitants that IRS classified as CNC, about 580 cases, with a total outstanding balance of over $1.8 million, appeared on IRS\u2019 records as closed due to resource and workload constraints, despite IRS policy that all federal worker and annuitant cases be actively pursued.", "As we have previously acknowledged, like any large agency, IRS is confronted by the ongoing management challenge of allocating its limited resources among competing priorities. However, IRS does not have the management data necessary to prepare reliable cost-benefit analyses to ensure that its resource allocation decisions are appropriate. We have previously reported on this issue and recommended that, using the best available information, IRS develop reliable cost-benefit data relating to its enforcement and collection programs.

For example, IRS is authorized to share taxpayer information to assist agencies in enforcing and determining eligibility requirements for child support programs, family assistance programs, and Medicaid. IRS can also share taxpayer information with agencies if the taxpayer has consented to the disclosure of this information with the agency. A federal agency becomes aware of an employee\u2019s tax delinquency status if (1) the employee voluntarily discloses this information to the employer, (2) the employee enters into a payroll deduction agreement to pay off the outstanding tax debt, (3) IRS files a federal tax lien and the lien is brought to the attention of the employer, (4) the employer receives a summons from IRS regarding an employee tax liability, or (5) the employee is criminally charged with tax violations and these charges become public.", "IRS is authorized to collect outstanding taxes that federal employees owe by garnishing, or levying, the employees\u2019 salaries.

In late December 1999, both IRS\u2019 legal counsel and the U.S. Department of Justice concluded that, while such use of return information may be permissible, the issue is a close legal question and IRS should thus not encourage this practice. Instead, both IRS\u2019 legal counsel and the Department of Justice concluded that IRC Section 6103 should be amended to specifically permit IRS to disclose information on the tax delinquency status of federal employees to the head of the employing agency to determine if an ethics violation has occurred.", "RRA98 contained a requirement for both the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Secretary of the Treasury to each conduct a study on the scope and use of IRC Section 6103 provisions regarding taxpayer confidentiality. The Joint Committee\u2019s study was issued in January 2000 and contained no recommendations on amending the provisions of Section 6103 that presently exist. The Treasury study, which was issued in December 2000, recommended amending Section 6103 with respect to sharing information on federal employee tax delinquencies with the employing agency. Specifically, the study recommended that Section 6103 be amended to clarify that federal employees working in federal payroll offices who receive tax information pursuant to Section 6103(k)(6) are not subject to redisclosure restrictions of Section 6103 for such information.

As agreed to with our requesters, we used data in IRS\u2019 records as of October 1999 because this was the latest available information on federal workers and annuitants and was the basis for IRS\u2019 last published information on taxes pertaining to federal workers and annuitants at the time we commenced our fieldwork. Specifically, the objectives for our sample were to determine an estimate of the amount IRS could reasonably expect to collect on the subpopulation of unpaid assessment balances and to gauge the degree of IRS\u2019 collection efforts by reviewing specific cases.", "The sample population was developed from the federal employee and annuitant caseload of six IRS field offices. These offices were selected based on their proportion of the dollar value of outstanding taxes owed by federal workers and annuitants to the total dollar value owed by the entire federal worker and annuitant population. These six offices together accounted for $861 million, or 35 percent of the total federal worker and annuitant unpaid assessments of $2.5 billion as of October 1999. While the sample of unpaid assessments was statistically representative of those taxpayers under the jurisdiction of the field offices included in the subpopulation, it is not strictly representative of the entire population of federal workers and annuitants with unpaid assessments as the sample, according to the agreement with our requesters, was not selected from that entire population. The population and associated amounts were obtained from the information contained in the FERDI file as of October 2, 1999. The FERDI file contains information on taxpayers for which (1) a third-party information match identifies a potential nonfiler condition and a tax assessment has not been made against the taxpayer\u2019s account and (2) IRS has assessed taxes based on a filed return or a completed nonfiler investigation or other investigation, and the taxes remain unpaid.", "Using the FERDI file, we summarized unpaid assessment balances in the following 6 selected IRS field offices: Los Angeles, Oakland, Laguna- Niguel, Baltimore, Richmond, and Atlanta. The field offices were selected based on the extent of unpaid tax assessment balances. From the subpopulation, we selected a statistical sample of unpaid taxpayer accounts on which to conduct detailed testing using a classical variables sampling approach. We used classical variables sampling to project a statistically valid estimate of the amount of unpaid assessments that IRS could reasonably expect to collect from that subpopulation. We stratified the population into five dollar ranges to (1) decrease the effect of variances in the subpopulation, (2) gain assurance that the sample amounts were representative of the subpopulation, and (3) obtain assurance that the resulting net collectible amount is a reliable estimate of the amount IRS can reasonably expect to collect. Separate random samples were then selected for four of the five strata. For the remaining strata, which consisted of unpaid assessment items in excess of $500,000 individually, all items were selected for testing. We used a 95-percent confidence level, and a planned precision level of plus or minus $96.6 million. This approach resulted in a total sample size of 152 unpaid tax accounts, totaling $47.3 million or 5.5 percent of the subpopulation of unpaid assessments.", "To determine if and to what extent IRS could reasonably expect to collect the outstanding unpaid assessments for each sampled account, we examined detailed masterfile transcripts of the taxpayer\u2019s accounts and IRS collection case files, which, when submitted, could include documentation of the taxpayer\u2019s income and assets, earnings potential, other outstanding unpaid assessments, payment history, and other relevant collection information that affected our assessment of the taxpayer\u2019s ability and willingness to pay.

For example, in seven of these cases, the taxpayer made an OIC that was pending review by IRS. However, the amounts offered would not be sufficient to pay any of the balance in our sample cases. In these instances, the taxpayers owed outstanding amounts for multiple accounts, and any payments that would be received from the taxpayers under the OIC would be applied to accounts with an earlier CSED. In five other cases, IRS accepted the OICs, but again, the offer amounts were not sufficient to pay any of the balances owed in the sampled cases.

In some of these cases, the taxpayers owed amounts for multiple years. Because IRS applies payments received under the installment agreements to the accounts with the earliest CSEDs, only a portion of the payments IRS was expected to receive would be available to apply to the sampled cases. In one case we reviewed involving a federal annuitant with 6 years of outstanding tax liabilities who had entered into an installment agreement, only 3 percent of the $93,000 total balance of the sampled case would be paid before the CSED for the account expires, assuming that the individual continued to make payments under the terms of the installment agreement.", "In four cases, the taxpayers submitted OICs to pay less than the full amount owed to satisfy the outstanding taxes.
