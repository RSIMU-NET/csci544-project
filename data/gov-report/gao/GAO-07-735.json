CBP uses computer-based and manual targeting to determine which shipments it will examine, and both methods have strengths and limitations. Port practices for recording exam results vary, making it difficult for CBP to fully assess the effectiveness of its IP targeting efforts. Since 2001, CBP's IP enforcement outcomes have been concentrated among particular transport modes, product types, and ports. Rising numbers of low-value seizures from mail facilities have driven growth in seizure actions, but uneven seizures of high-value goods from sea containers have caused the estimated value of seizures to fluctuate. The vast majority of seizure and penalty outcomes in the last 6 years have been concentrated among 10 or fewer of CBP's 300-plus ports. For example, 10 ports account for 98 percent of the $1.1 billion in penalties assessed during fiscal years 2001 to 2006. CBP lacks agencywide performance measures in its strategic plan and an integrated approach across key offices to guide and improve IP enforcement. Narrowly focused initiatives led by offices now under OT have had limited results. CBP has not done a broader analysis to examine variances in port IP enforcement outcomes. For example, GAO found that some of the largest IP-importing ports had very small seizure rates relative to other top IP-importing ports. A lack of integration between OT and OFO impedes using this type of analysis to identify potential IP enforcement improvements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The illegal importation and distribution of counterfeit and pirated goods  poses an increasing cost to the United States economy and threatens the  health and safety of its citizens.

However, IP protection in many parts of the  world is inadequate, and as a result, U.S. goods are subject to substantial  counterfeiting and piracy in other countries. The Department of Justice  has reported on the growing threat of IP crime in the United States, noting  that IP has become increasingly more critical to our country\u2019s economic  security. Other federal agencies have testified that the economic benefits  of capitalizing on IP goods have drawn the attention of counterfeiters and  pirates, and that the magnitude and complexity of IP rights violations have  increased in recent years. In an effort to protect American public health  and safety and safeguard the U.S. economy, a number of federal agencies  are involved in keeping IP-infringing goods from entering the country and  investigating or prosecuting those responsible for their importation.

At the ports, we examined port organizational structures and practices for  enforcing IP rights, and we spoke with various CBP personnel who are  responsible for identifying, examining, seizing, and assessing penalties on  goods that involve IP violations. We analyzed CBP data on the volume and  value of trade entering U.S. ports and on its IP seizure and penalty activity.  Most of this analysis was based on data covering fiscal years 2001 through  2006, but some data were only available for fiscal years 2003 through 2006.  We identified certain limitations in the seizure and penalty data but found  them sufficiently reliable to indicate broad trends in enforcement  outcomes.

Manual targeting by port  employees is more ad hoc and flexible than computer-based targeting,  given its reliance on employee skill and availability, but determining its  effect on IP enforcement is difficult. Ports conduct exams on targeted  shipments, and determining whether infringement has occurred during an  exam can be a challenging process that requires training and input from  experts. Because of differing port practices, information on IP exams has  been unevenly recorded across ports, according to officials, making it  difficult for CBP to fully analyze the effect of its targeting efforts in this  area. CBP\u2019s process for enforcing IP concludes with ports seizing  infringing goods and, if warranted, referring cases to ICE and assessing  penalties.

When assessing 19 U.S.C. 1526(f) penalties against a first-time violator, the  amount of the penalty may be equal to or less than the MSRP. In the event  of a second or subsequent seizure, the amount of the penalty is assessed at  twice the value of the merchandise, based on the MSRP at the time of  seizure. For seizures valued over $100,000 in domestic value, OFO  maintains responsibility for reviewing the case before any legal action is  taken. For penalties that are assessed, CBP officials said that substantial  resources are dedicated to processing penalty cases, but they also said  that penalty amounts are seldom fully collected. CBP\u2019s collection issues  are discussed later in this report.", "Depending on the size and value of a seizure, CBP officers coordinate with  ICE agents who then consult the Department of Justice\u2019s U.S. Attorneys  Offices to determine if criminal investigation and prosecution is  warranted. For example, a repeat violator may warrant criminal action if  ICE has enough information to initiate a criminal investigation and build a  case.", "Seized goods have to be secured, as they have potential value but cannot  be allowed to enter U.S. commerce.

According to CBP officials, as seizures have increased, the  agency\u2019s storage and destruction costs have grown and become  increasingly burdensome. CBP reports that it spent over $9.1 million to  destroy seized property between fiscal years 2001 and 2006.

The total estimated domestic value of goods seized since fiscal year 2001,  however, has fluctuated due to variations in seizure activity involving  large, ocean-going containers in which the highest-value seizures tend to  be made. While the types of goods seized have varied over time, wearing  apparel, cigarettes, footwear, and handbags have accounted for the  majority of estimated seizure value in the past 6 years.

CBP publicly cites an 83 percent increase  in the number of seizure actions from fiscal year 2005 to 2006 as an  indicator of its growing IP enforcement success. However, our analysis  shows that this growth was driven primarily by smaller-value seizures. For  example, to date, the largest number of seizures for international mail  occurred in fiscal year 2006, with the number of seizure actions and their  domestic value more than doubling from the previous year. CBP officials  said they believed that while some of these seizures are personal  shipments ordered from Internet sites that sell counterfeit merchandise,  others have contained quantities of goods too large for personal use.

According to agency officials, based on these violations, CBP decided to  assess penalties against certain companies, but the intra-agency review  process for the penalties took about 1 year because of intra-agency  discussions about the legal basis for assessing penalties on goods that had  already entered commerce.

The penalty cases these ports opened  during this period ranged between 3 and 7 percent of their seizures. In  comparison, the second highest ranked port for seizure value, with an  average seizure value of about $88,000, was also one of the most active  ports for penalty actions, opening penalty cases for about 37 percent of its  seizures. Moreover, during our audit, we identified a sharp drop in penalty  outcomes for one of the top 10 ports, starting in fiscal year 2004, that  neither OT nor OFO had identified.

Overall outcomes or fluctuations might also be due to  variations in ports\u2019 enforcement techniques or changes in IP enforcement  resources or the availability of skilled personnel. For example, an official  at one port we visited told us that during fiscal year 2004, the port made an  important change in its methods for performing trade-related targeting, by  disbanding a seven-person team that had focused solely on trade targeting  and shifting these resources to security targeting. During our February  2005 visit to this port, the port official stated that this change had  contributed to significantly lower seizure activity at the port in 2005.

This port accounted for only about 1  percent of all IP import value that year, but over 7 percent of total seizure  value. In contrast, the IP seizure rates for several ports with relatively  larger IP import values were well below the group average. Figure 6 shows  the top 25 IP-importing ports by value in fiscal year 2005 and ranks them  by their seizure rate that year. The eight ports in which the seizure rate is  greater than the average (shown by the dotted line on the figure) are  highlighted in grey. The figure also shows that many ports had very low  seizure rates relative to the average.

We also examined these data over previous  years and found similar results. For example, Port A had the first or  second highest rate of any port in the top 25. Also, the eight ports with  above-average ratios in fiscal year 2005 are consistent with prior years.  Because of the wide range of factors that affect IP seizures (including the  unknown amount of goods actually involved in IP violations transiting a  given port), these data alone are not a complete measure of port  performance. Ports can be compared relative to each other, but port  performance in even those ports that appear relatively more successful  could still be potentially improved. For example, the majority of these top  25 ports had IP seizures that accounted for less than one hundredth of a  percent of their IP import value.

While CBP has publicly cited increases in enforcement  outcomes based on larger numbers and higher values of IP seizures,  indicating its success, it has not fully disclosed the composition of those  seizures or analyzed what has accounted for the increases.

Certain improvements to  existing data could make this type of review even more powerful. In  addition, such analysis could prove useful as CBP responds to  congressional directives to develop resource allocation models in order to  determine the optimal staffing levels needed to carry out its commercial  operations and other missions. CBP would be able to make more  measurable links between its strategic objectives and enforcement  outcomes, leading to more effective management practices and allocation  of limited resources.

However, CBP did not  regard our analysis of ports\u2019 IP seizures relative to IP imports as a useful  tool for addressing the threat of IP infringement and identified a range of  limitations with our analysis. We disagree. This simple presentation can be  a powerful tool to generate discussion among IP policymakers and port  management and staff about IP seizure patterns, risks, and outcomes. CBP  has not yet attempted to complete even this basic analysis or initiate such  discussions. Doing so would invariably lead to potential refinements of the  analysis; we suggest a number of these in the report, some of which CBP  identifies in its comments. We encourage CBP to refine this analysis and  develop and use other types of analysis to ensure that ports are helping the  agency achieve its IP enforcement objectives.", "CBP made certain additional comments about the draft law enforcement  sensitive report. For example, CBP said that our report focused on  transaction-level seizures and penalties, while not fully recognizing the  importance of additional elements of its IP enforcement approach. We  focused on seizures and penalties because they are the core IP  enforcement activities for which CBP is responsible, and we found that  CBP had not systematically analyzed its own performance of these  activities. However, we also discuss the risk model, the audits, and the  new penalty guidance; and these elements are reasonable components of a  broader approach, but we believe their effect on overall IP enforcement  has been limited. Moreover, we believe that CBP needs to continue to  ensure the robustness of its core enforcement activities. CBP also stated  that our report failed to note that the formation of OT in October 2006 was  designed in part to address the lack of integration between OT and OFO.  We disagree that the formation of this office has, in itself, addressed the  lack of integration that we identify in the report regarding IP enforcement.  Although OT consolidates CBP\u2019s trade policy and program development  functions, including those related to IP enforcement, front-line  implementation of policies and programs continue to be carried out at the  ports under the leadership of OFO.

At headquarters, we met  with officials in the Office of International Trade (OT) and Office of Field  Office Operations (OFO) and obtained documents. We reviewed agency  strategic plans, annual performance accountability reports, laws,  regulations, and policies that addressed agency goals and the roles and  responsibilities of these two key offices and field locations in enforcing IP  rights at the border, including CBP\u2019s internal plan for addressing IP  enforcement as a Priority Trade Issue. We also reviewed documents and  interviewed officials at OT\u2019s Los Angeles Strategic Trade Center, which  has been responsible for developing and implementing CPB\u2019s approach to  IP enforcement since approximately 2002. We analyzed data that the  center provided on the use and outcomes of using Cargo Selectivity  criteria to target for IP violations. In addition, we reviewed documents and  interviewed CBP officials at four field offices and seven ports (the names  of the ports where we conducted field work are not included in this report  for law enforcement reasons). We selected these ports in order to observe  CBP\u2019s IP enforcement practices at ports with high and medium import  levels (measured by value) and across a range of processing environments.  Five of these ports were among the top 25 IP-importing ports in fiscal year  2005, and five of them were among the six most active CBP ports as  measured by selected IP enforcement outcomes. We reviewed documents  on CBP\u2019s organizational structures at these ports and the ports\u2019  approaches for carrying out their overall missions, including IP  enforcement. The CBP officials we interviewed at these ports were  responsible for identifying, examining, seizing, and assessing penalties on  goods that involve IP violations. In addition, we reviewed relevant papers,  studies, and our reports that addressed key aspects of CBP\u2019s mission and  its IP border enforcement responsibilities.

First, to measure the value of IP-related trade entering U.S.  ports, we identified products, using detailed product codes, that are likely  to embody intellectual properties and obtained CBP data on the  importation of these products by port over fiscal years 2002 to 2005. In  order to identify these products, we reviewed the broad product groups  that CBP uses to categorize seizure actions and domestic value and then  identified all individual products that are covered by these groups within  the U.S. harmonized tariff schedule. We discussed our detailed product list  with CBP, which concurred with our list, and we obtained import data  from them according to the list. We reviewed these data for internal  consistency and any known limitations on its quality. We determined that  these data were sufficiently reliable to provide the value of IP imports by  port over the time period we examined. Second, we assessed CBP\u2019s IP  enforcement efforts on an aggregate, product, and port basis by analyzing  its seizure and penalty data. Specifically, we obtained data from CBP on  seizure and penalty outcomes for individual ports of entry for fiscal years  2001 through 2006. For fiscal years 2003 through 2006, we obtained data  on the mode of transport or processing environments in which seizure  were made. Finally, we obtained data on seizures by product category and  source country from CBP\u2019s external Web site. To assess the reliability of  the seizure and penalty data, we examined them for internal consistency  and discussed with CBP how the data are collected and reviewed. We also  reviewed our prior work that reported on CBP\u2019s seizure data. Based on  this prior work and our discussions with CBP officials, we identified some  limitations in the seizure data related to the precision of the seizure value  estimates and the veracity of the fields that indicate product types and  modes of transport or processing environments. We also found some  inconsistencies in the various data sets we received, which we reported to  CBP. The limitations and inconsistencies we identified, however, did not  indicate large discrepancies in the data, and we found the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of reporting on broad trends in  seizures and penalties over time and among ports. Based on our  discussions with CBP headquarters and port officials, we selected four  types of enforcement actions by which to analyze port outcomes: (1)  number of seizure actions, (2) domestic value of seizures, (3) number of  penalty cases opened, and (4) penalty amounts assessed. We aggregated  the data on these enforcement actions for fiscal years 2001 through 2006,  ranked ports by each of the enforcement actions, and identified the top 10  ports for each of the categories.", "To evaluate CBP\u2019s approach for improving border enforcement, we  discussed CBP\u2019s efforts with knowledgeable OT and OFO officials in  Washington, D.C., and the field offices and ports we visited. We reviewed  CBP\u2019s and OFO\u2019s strategic plans, CBP\u2019s annual performance and  accountability reports, and CBP\u2019s internal plan for addressing IP  enforcement as a Priority Trade Issue to identify CBP\u2019s goals, objectives,  and plans for conducting and improving IP enforcement at the border. We  also examined documents related to the administration\u2019s Strategy  Targeting Organized Piracy. From this, we identified key initiatives that  CBP has undertaken to improve the effectiveness of IP border  enforcement and discussed the status of these initiatives with  knowledgeable CBP officials. We also assessed the initiatives to determine  how they relate to CBP\u2019s IP enforcement goals. We analyzed IP  enforcement outcomes across ports, identified fluctuations that have  significantly impacted CBP\u2019s overall IP enforcement outcomes and  inconsistencies in outcomes at certain ports, and discussed these  observations with CBP officials. We compared IP seizures with IP imports  on a value basis for the top 25 IP-importing ports for fiscal years 2002  through 2005, determined the average seizure rate for these ports, and  compared the ports\u2019 individual seizure rates with the average. While  estimated domestic value of seizures and values for IP imports are not  equivalent measurements, we determined that these were sufficiently  reliable proxies for the purpose of seizure to import comparisons. We also  conducted interviews with CBP officials in headquarters and field  locations to obtain information on how OT and OFO carry out their  operations and in final meetings discussed ways in which OT and OFO  could better use their data to improve IP enforcement.", "This report is based on a law enforcement sensitive report issued on  March 20, 2007, as a restricted report, copies of which are available for  official use only.

We analyzed data  by port location for fiscal years 2001 through 2006. For four of these  categories, we found that six ports accounted for the bulk of enforcement  activity (see fig. 7). Four of these ports ranked in the top 10 for all four IP  enforcement categories and 2 ranked in the top 10 for three out of the four  categories. These ports may include multiple processing environments  (e.g., land, sea, air modes), and seizure associated with such ports may  stem from more than one processing environment. Because of  inconsistencies in how CBP records seizures by port, we were unable to  fully determine how many processing environments are reflected in the  enforcement data. We were able to determine the seizure reporting  practices of the seven ports that we visited. For example, at one location,  CBP has one port \u201ccode\u201d that includes seizures made at the seaport as well  as the nearby airport. However, seizure data for another location includes  seizures made at the seaport and from the international mail processing  environment, but does not include other air-based seizures made at the  nearby airport, which are reported separately. Neither OFO nor OT  officials at the headquarters level could provide us information to  understand the seizure reporting practices of CBP\u2019s ports.", "As figure 7 illustrates, CBP\u2019s data can be used to compare enforcement  outcomes across the ports (left to right) or compare outcomes within a  single port (top to bottom). With the exception of Port D, the scales are  uniform. When analyzing IP enforcement outcomes both across ports and  within a single port, we found wide variability when comparing outcomes  from year to year and among the enforcement categories. For example, the  Port F experienced increases in the number of seizure actions for fiscal  years 2002 and 2004; but in alternating years, the number dropped, in some  cases by as much as 50 percent. Penalty outcomes also fluctuated by port  location. For example, Port G had relatively constant numbers of penalty  cases opened and penalty amounts assessed until fiscal year 2005, when  these outcomes peaked, and then fell off sharply in fiscal year 2006. When  examining outcomes within a single port, we found that the fluctuations in  seizure outcomes did not mirror fluctuations in penalty outcomes. For  example, Port C had a relatively steady number of seizure actions between  fiscal years 2003 and 2006, but the number of penalty cases opened  fluctuated greatly during the same time period. While we did not expect to  find a direct correlation between seizure and penalty outcomes, given that  the seizure data consists of all IP-related activity and penalty data limited  to only those assessed under 19 U.S.C. 1526(f), we did not expect to find  such wide variations within the most active ports during the 6-year time  period we reviewed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s letter dated March 6, 2007, which commented on GAO\u2019s law  enforcement sensitive report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We disagree that OT\u2019s formation has, in itself, addressed the lack of  integration that we identify in the report regarding IP enforcement.  Although OT consolidates its legacy offices\u2019 trade policy and program  development functions\u2014specifically, the Office of Strategic Trade, the  Office of Regulations and Rulings, and a headquarters component of  the Office of Field Operations, front-line implementation of policies  and programs continue to be carried out at the ports under the  leadership of OFO. Because there is still separation between the office  that sets policy and the office that implements policy, there is no  evidence that the creation of OT will address the lack of integration  that initiated congressional action and that we identified in our review.  OT and OFO will need to work closely together to overcome the lack  of integration between policy development and implementation that  we refer to in the report. Regarding CBP\u2019s comment that we  inaccurately refer to OT throughout the report, we modified the report  to clarify references to OT and its legacy offices.   2.  CBP mischaracterizes the purpose and usefulness of our analysis of IP  imports and enforcement activity at its ports. Seizing IP infringing  goods is a core IP enforcement activity for which CBP is responsible,  but CBP has not conducted systematic analysis of its own data to  examine variations in enforcement outcomes over time or among  ports. This simple analysis can be a powerful tool to generate  discussion among IP policymakers and port management and staff  about IP seizure patterns, risks, and outcomes and to improve CBP\u2019s  approach to IP enforcement. We do not suggest using it to target  imports. We clearly state that our analysis is only illustrative of the  types of analysis that CBP could undertake and that CBP should refine  and develop its own approach. We support CBP\u2019s decision to follow  our recommendation to conduct such analysis.  3.  Our measure of IP imports is broader than CBP suggests, but it is not  intended as a measure of risk. CBP does not currently have such a  measure, and we believe our measure, which we reviewed with CBP, is  useful. Our measure is intended to identify the overall relative volume  of potential IP traffic that ports process, which is lower than total  import volume. Doing so enables us to examine IP seizure activity  relative to a meaningful measure of port volume. Our measure is based  not only on tariff classifications where CBP actually found IP  violations but also their related products groups. These classifications  may include both IP and non-IP goods that are not separated out in the  tariff schedule. Doing so is appropriate because CBP cannot easily  distinguish, based on the tariff information, whether goods involve IP  protection, have been purposely misclassified, or are being used to  smuggle infringing products. The draft report explained our selection  process and methodology, but we added clarity to further explain our  measure and how we developed it. We also state that this analysis is  one logical way to examine port performance and do not suggest, as  CBP states in its response to our third recommendation, that the  seizures-to-imports ratio is, in itself, a complete performance measure.  4.  We also agree that CBP should consider the range of factors that affect  IP goods in conducting its analysis. We clearly stated in the report that  our analysis was only one way to examine port performance. Our  analysis was not intended to be used for risk analysis or targeting, but  only to provide a measure of seizure activity relative to port size, and  we did not assume a direct correlation between the volume of IP  imports and risk.   5.  We agree that CBP\u2019s import data does not fully capture IP import  values at express consignment and mail facilities, but even with this  likely underreporting of such imports, several ports at which such  facilities are dominant ranked among the top IP importing ports. As we  state in the report, we agree that CBP should take differences across  port environments into account in developing its own analysis.   6.  We focused on \u201ctransaction-level seizures and penalties\u201d because these  are the core IP enforcement activities for which CBP is responsible,  and we found that CBP had not systematically analyzed its own  performance of these core activities. We also address additional  elements of CBP\u2019s approach to improve IP enforcement that fell within  the scope of our audit, including its IP audits. However, we found that  these efforts have had a limited impact on overall IP enforcement,  while perhaps drawing attention away from improvements to its core  activities. For example, CBP acknowledges that its audits, completed  thus far on 41 companies during a 2\u00bd-year period, are most effective  for improving IP enforcement among legitimate importers, but these  importers likely do not account for the bulk of IP infringing goods that  enter the United States.  7.  CBP mischaracterizes our analysis by asserting that our report states  across-the-board that CBP lacks performance measures for IP  enforcement. Our draft report stated that the agency\u2019s strategic plan  lacks specific measures for IP enforcement, but noted that CBP does  indeed measure and report internally on the number of IP seizure  actions and estimated seizure value. The draft report also discussed  certain actions that CBP has taken under its \u201cIntellectual Property  Rights Trade Strategy,\u201d an internal planning document that is the same  as what CBP calls the \u201cNational IPR Trade Strategy\u201d in its letter.  However, we disagree with CBP\u2019s assertion that this document serves  as an agencywide guide for CBP\u2019s IP enforcement efforts. In our  discussions with CBP about this document, CBP officials said the  document was written for internal planning purposes. We found that  the distribution of this document has been limited. For example, CBP  documents show that revisions to the IP Rights Trade Strategy have  not been distributed to the field since 2003. Moreover, certain CBP  officials told us that the ports are generally not familiar with this  document. Finally, given the document\u2019s classification as \u201cFor Official  Use Only,\u201d it is not distributed to Congress or the public, unlike the  agency\u2019s strategic plan, which limits its usefulness for holding CBP  accountable for its performance on IP enforcement. We added  information in our report to clarify the importance of agencywide  strategic plans and performance measures in communicating priorities  on an agencywide basis and establishing accountability. We added  information that the IP Rights Trade Strategy contains other indicators  related to IP enforcement. We also modified our recommendation to  clarify that we recommend that CBP include IP enforcement-related  measures in its strategic plan. Given the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s role in the strategic planning process, we also clarified that  CBP should work with the Office of Management and Budget to  include IP-enforcement related measures in its strategic plan.  8.
