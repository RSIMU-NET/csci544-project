First, HUD headquarters allocated the amount of appropriated funds for capital advances to each of the 18 regional offices using a funding formula, which accounted for regional housing needs and cost characteristics. Funding was further divided among 52 local offices using a set-aside formula and was also split between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas for Section 202. In 2010, HUD eliminated the set-aside which had guaranteed a minimum amount of funding for each local field office. The process for making capital advance awards did not change, but HUD was better able fund properties at a higher level. Second, applicants submitted applications to the applicable HUD regional office, and staff from these offices evaluated and scored applications based on various criteria, including capacity to provide housing and ability to secure funding from other sources. Applicants in each regional office were ranked highest to lowest and funded in that order. Any residual funds that were not sufficient to fund the next project in rank order were pooled nationwide and HUD headquarters used a national ranking to fund additional projects.", "Most but not all states (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico) had applicants that received capital advances for Section 202 and Section 811 in fiscal years 2008 through 2011. GAO found that some states had applicants that received capital advances in each of the years reviewed, while other states did not. In the period reviewed, four states had no applicants that received Section 202 capital advance awards, and eight states had no applicants that received Section 811 capital advance awards. HUD officials cited several reasons applicants from some states may not have received funding during this period, including applications that were submitted may have been ineligible or higher-scoring applications from other states may have been selected instead. The capital advance amounts varied. For Section 202, total capital advance amounts for fiscal years 2008-2011 for states that received at least one award ranged from less than $24 million to more than $75 million. For Section 811, total capital advance amounts for fiscal years 2008-2011 for states that received at least one capital advance award ranged from less than $4 million to more than $15 million."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has funded  through capital advances approximately 151,000 units for very low- income elderly households and persons with disabilities through the  Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section 202) and the  Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities (Section  811) programs. From November 1990 through November 2011, the  programs provided capital advances to nonprofit organizations to develop  affordable housing units.

We were not able to review individual  applications for capital advances to understand the score each  application received because HUD only retains these records for a period  of 3 years and records from the period under our review have been  destroyed. Our analysis allowed us to identify the number of awards and  the total award amount each state received in the years under our review.  To determine the reliability of these data, we reviewed information about  the system used to collect the data and agency statements on the data.  We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We also interviewed officials at HUD to better understand funding trends  and funding decisions.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2015 to May 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Housing Act of 1959, as amended, established the Section 202  Direct Loan Program to provide direct loans to nonprofit organizations to  develop housing and provide supportive services for low-income older  adults and individuals with disabilities. Under this loan program, over  278,000 units were funded from 1959 through 1990. In 1990, the  Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act amended the  Housing Act of 1959 and created separate programs: (1) the Section 202  Supportive Housing for the Elderly program to support affordable housing  for very low-income elderly persons and (2) the Section 811 program for  very low-income persons with disabilities. Section 202 households must  be very low income (at or below 50 percent of area median income) and  must include at least one member who is at least 62 years old. Section  811 households must also be very low income with at least one adult  member with a disability (such as a physical or developmental disability or  chronic mental illness). Since 1990, the Section 202 program has  provided approximately 120,000 affordable housing units for older adults.  As of fiscal year 2011, Section 811 has provided approximately 31,000  units for individuals with disabilities.", "Since 1990, the Section 202 and Section 811 programs have provided  financing to nonprofit organizations known as sponsors through capital  advances for the construction, acquisition, or rehabilitation of new  affordable housing units. Section 202 and Section 811 sponsors are not  required to repay the capital advance as long as they continue to make  supportive housing affordable to eligible households for 40 years. HUD  also provides rental assistance payments to Section 202 and Section 811  sponsors to cover the difference between the unit\u2019s rent and the  household\u2019s rental contribution, which is typically equal to 30 percent of  the household income. For Section 202, sponsors can also use rental  assistance payments to help pay for activities of daily living and  instrumental activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing, managing  finances, and managing medications.", "Funding for Section 202 and Section 811 capital advances and rental  assistance has decreased in recent years (see table 1). The combined  fiscal years 2010 and 2011 Notice of Funding Availability was the last  capital advance competition for new units in both programs. Beginning  with fiscal year 2012, appropriations have not been made for the  production of new units. In the combined fiscal years 2010 and 2011  capital advance competition cycle, HUD awarded 99 Section 202 capital  advances in 33 states and 86 Section 811 capital advances in 34 states.  With the suspension of funding for new construction or rehabilitation,  housing developers must now rely on other funding sources, such as Low  Income Housing Tax Credits, if they wish to build housing for these  populations. Although Congress continues to appropriate funds for  rental assistance for existing Section 202 and Section 811 units, these  appropriations also declined from 2011 to 2013. According to HUD, most  Section 202 and Section 811 projects that received funding in fiscal year  2008, fiscal year 2009, or the combined fiscal year 2010/ 2011 funding  cycle have been completed but some are still in the process of being  completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Allocated Capital Advances to Its Regional Offices Based on Relative Regional Housing Needs", "paragraphs": ["Until fiscal year 2012, when funding for new units ceased, HUD used a  two-phase process to allocate and award Section 202 and Section 811  capital advances (see fig. 1).

Second, applicants submitted applications online and  staff from the applicable regional office evaluated applications using a  technical review and a point system and awarded capital advances to the  highest-scoring applicants.

Under the Section 202  program, HUD allocated 85 percent of the total capital advance amount to  metropolitan areas and 15 percent to nonmetropolitan areas within each  regional office. HUD then applied a \u201cfair share\u201d factor for each  metropolitan and nonmetropolitan portion of each of the 18 regional  offices, which allowed it to adjust the allocated funds per region based on  the number of elderly very low-income adults with housing conditions and  geographic costs of providing housing in each region.", "According to HUD officials, in fiscal year 2010, HUD implemented  changes in the way it distributed capital advances among the regional  offices to better target resources for the Section 202 program. Prior to  2010, HUD allocated funds to each of the 18 regional offices and then  further subdivided the funds among 52 local program offices associated  with each regional office. At that time, each local program office received  a minimum set-aside for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. The  set-aside was intended to provide enough funding to support the  development of at least 20 units in metropolitan areas and 5 units in  nonmetropolitan areas. However, in the combined fiscal year 2010/2011  capital advance competition, HUD did not subdivide the funds to local  offices and discontinued the minimum set-aside of 20 units in  metropolitan and 5 units in nonmetropolitan areas in order to fund  properties at a higher level. According to HUD headquarters officials, by  eliminating the field office set-aside, HUD could develop affordable  housing in a more cost-effective manner. HUD officials said that while the  2010 Notice of Funding Availability no longer had a minimum set-aside,  the process for reviewing applications and making award determinations  remained the same.", "Prior to 2010/2011, under the Section 811 program, each local office  received capital advance funds for a minimum of 10 units. Similar to  Section 202, the Section 811 program applied a \u201cfair share\u201d factor to  distribute capital advances. The Section 811 funding formula for fiscal  years 2010/2011 used the number of institutionalized persons age 16 to  64 with a disability, as well as geographic costs of providing housing, to  allocate funding to each region. Unlike for Section 202, for Section 811  HUD did not require that a portion of the funding be allocated to  metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Regional Offices Scored Applicants for Section 202 and Section 811 Capital Advances in a Competitive Process", "paragraphs": ["Both Section 202 and Section 811 followed a similar competitive process  for awarding capital advances. After HUD announced the availability of  funds, applicants submitted applications online and were then routed on  to the applicable regional office. The review process involved a  technical review followed by a rating process. During the technical review,  regional office staff examined each application to determine adherence to  eligibility requirements, such as responsiveness to local housing needs,  project size, and development cost limits. They also assessed each  application to identify deficiencies that are curable\u2014for example,  incomplete information submitted by the applicant that is not part of the  scored application. If an application included curable deficiencies, the  regional office notified the applicant and provided a time frame for  resolving the deficiencies. Applications that did not pass the technical  review were rejected. HUD provided a written notice to rejected  applicants, which included the rationale for rejection and an opportunity  for appeal. According to HUD headquarters officials, common reasons for  rejection were noncompliance with environmental requirements and site  control. Rejected applicants could file an appeal with HUD.", "Applications that passed the technical review proceeded to the rating  process. During the rating process, the regional office evaluated each  application in several categories using a point system. These categories  were (1) capacity of the applicant and relevant organizational staff; (2)  need, or the extent of the problem; (3) soundness of approach; (4)  leveraging resources; and (5) achieving results and program evaluation.  Each application was scored on a number of criteria within each of these  categories, and applications were required to meet a minimum point  threshold in order to be considered for funding. According to HUD, once  scores were compiled, HUD awarded capital advances through a  competitive process to applicants selected in each region with the  greatest number of points in each regional office. Because the regional  offices received separate funding allocations for metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan areas for Section 202, they were required to first split the  applications into metropolitan and nonmetropolitan developments and  then rank each application within these areas. The funding levels  provided did not allow them to fund all eligible applicants. Each regional  office selected eligible applications from highest to lowest scores until no  more funding from the metropolitan and nonmetropolitan allocations  remained. If an applicant were next in rank order but needed more funds  than remained, regional offices were not permitted to skip over that  applicant in order to select another lower scoring applicant whose project  required less funds. Instead, according to HUD headquarters officials,  once each regional office had awarded all the funds it could based on the  stated criteria in the Notice Of Funding Availability (NOFA), HUD  headquarters combined any remaining metropolitan and nonmetropolitan  funds to select the next highest ranked application from either a  metropolitan or nonmetropolitan area.", "Once each regional office finished selecting applicants, any remaining  funds were returned to HUD headquarters, where the remaining eligible  applicants were entered into a nationwide competitive pool. Then HUD  headquarters awarded the remaining capital advance funds starting with  the highest rated application nationwide that had not already received  funding. HUD headquarters first selected the next highest ranked  nonmetropolitan applications in order to satisfy its statutory requirement  of 15 percent of the dollars going to nonmetropolitan areas. Any  remaining funds were then used to fund qualified metropolitan  applications. The allocation process continued until HUD headquarters  allocated all available funds to eligible applicants. During this process,  HUD headquarters was allowed to skip over a higher-rated applicant if  selecting a lower-rated applicant meant all the remaining funds would be  exhausted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most but Not All States Had Applicants That Received Capital Advances during Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2008 through 2011, most states had at least one  Section 202 applicant that received capital advance award dollars.
