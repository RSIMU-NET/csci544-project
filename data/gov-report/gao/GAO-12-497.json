In 2011, SSA paid more than $9 billion to about 1.3 million disabled children, the majority of whom received benefits due to a mental impairment. GAO was asked to assess (1) trends in the rate of children receiving SSI benefits due to mental impairments over the past decade; (2) the role that medical and nonmedical information, such as medication and school records, play in the initial determination of a child\u0092s eligibility; and (3) steps SSA has taken to monitor the continued medical eligibility of these children.", "To do this, GAO analyzed program data; interviewed SSA officials; conducted site visits to 9 field offices and 11 state DDS offices across the nation; reviewed a generalizable sample of 298 claims for select impairments from fiscal year 2010; reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; and interviewed external experts, among others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) child applicants and recipients with mental impairments has increased substantially for more than a decade, even though the Social Security Administration (SSA) denied, on average, 54 percent of such claims from fiscal years 2000 to 2011. Factors such as the rising number of children in poverty and increasing diagnosis of certain mental impairments have likely contributed to this growth. In fiscal year 2011, the most prevalent primary mental impairments among children found medically eligible were (1) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, (2) speech and language delay, and (3) autism, with autism claims growing most rapidly since fiscal year 2000. State disability determination services (DDS) examiners also consider the impact of additional, or \u0093secondary,\u0094 impairments when making a decision, and when present, these impairments were used to support 55 percent of those cases GAO reviewed that were allowed in fiscal year 2010. However, SSA has not consistently collected those impairment data, limiting its understanding of how all impairments may affect decisions.", "DDS examiners generally rely on a combination of key medical and nonmedical information\u0097such as medical records and teacher assessments\u0097to determine a child\u0092s medical eligibility for SSI. In its case file review, GAO found that examiners usually cited four to five information sources as the basis for their decision, and that being on medication was never the sole source of support for decisions. Moreover, examiners cited medication and treatment information, such as reports of improved functioning, as a basis for denying benefits in more than half of cases that GAO reviewed, despite a perception among some parents that medicating their child would result in an award of benefits. Examiners also reported they sometimes lacked complete information to inform their decision making. For example, several DDS offices reported obstacles to obtaining information from schools, which they believe to be critical in understanding how a child functions. Examiners also do not routinely receive information from SSA field offices on multiple children who receive benefits in the same household, which SSA\u0092s fraud investigations unit has noted as an indicator of possible fraud or abuse. Without such information, examiners may be limited in their ability to identify threats to program integrity.", "SSA has conducted fewer continuing disability reviews (CDR) for children since 2000, even though it is generally required by law to review the medical eligibility of certain children at least every 3 years. From fiscal year 2000 to 2011, childhood CDRs overall fell from more than 150,000 to about 45,000 (a 70 percent decrease), while CDRs for children with mental impairments dropped from more than 84,000 to about 16,000 (an 80 percent decrease). The most recent data show that more than 400,000 CDRs were overdue for children with mental impairments, with some pending by as many as 13 years or more. Of the more than 24,000 CDRs found to be 6 or more years overdue, 25 percent were for children expected to medically improve within 6 to 18 months of their initial allowance. SSA acknowledged the importance of conducting such reviews, but said that due to resource constraints and other workloads, such as initial claims, most childhood CDRs are a lower priority. SSA\u0092s process for issuing waivers from the CDR legal requirement lacks transparency, and without these reviews, SSA could continue to forgo significant program savings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that SSA take steps to ensure needed information, such as secondary impairment data and school records, is consistently collected; make its CDR waiver process more transparent; and conduct additional childhood CDRs.

In 2011, SSA paid almost $50 billion in SSI benefits to about 8  million recipients, of which about $9.4 billion was paid to 1.3 million  children. During the early and mid-1990s, the SSI program grew at an  unprecedented rate for children due, in part, to legal developments that  expanded program eligibility for children with mental impairments. For  example, from the end of 1989 through 1996, the number of children  receiving SSI benefits more than tripled from 265,000 to about 955,000.  Since that time, the overall number of children receiving SSI benefits has  continued to rise. In addition to this growth, the media has suggested that  many parents believe it is necessary that their child be prescribed  psychotropic drugs in order to qualify for benefits.", "In light of these developments, you asked us to assess, in part, the extent  to which SSA is monitoring the initial determination and continued  eligibility of children with mental impairments. Specifically, this report  addresses (1) the trends in the rate of children receiving SSI benefits due  to mental impairments over the past decade; (2) the role that medical and  nonmedical information, such as medication and school records, play in  the initial determination of a child\u2019s eligibility; and (3) the steps SSA has  taken to monitor the continued medical eligibility of these children.", "To examine these issues, we analyzed SSA data on trends and  characteristics of children applying for and receiving SSI benefits. We  assessed the reliability of the data presented in this report by performing  data testing, reviewing internal controls and related documentation, and  interviewing agency officials, and found potential limitations with the  extent to which primary and secondary impairment coding may be  present within SSA\u2019s 831 Disability file\u2014the computer file that contains  data on disability determinations. However, because SSA uses the 831  Disability file to make (and thus, reflect) the decisions regarding medical  determinations, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to  describe certain trends among children in the SSI program. To  corroborate these data and better understand what information sources  examiners use in determining a child\u2019s medical eligibility, we reviewed a  generalizable probability sample of 298 SSI cases from the 184,150  initial determinations performed in fiscal year 2010 for children with  alleged attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), speech and  language delay, and autistic disorder and other pervasive development  disorders (autism). We also conducted in-depth interviews with SSA  management and line staff at SSA headquarters and within six SSA  regions. These regions are Atlanta, Georgia; Dallas, Texas; Chicago,  Illinois; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Boston, Massachusetts; and San  Francisco, California. Our work included site visits to 9 field offices within  these regions, as well as 11 state disability determination services (DDS)  offices (state agencies under the direction of SSA that perform medical  eligibility determinations and continuing disability reviews of SSI  applicants). We selected these sites on the basis of (1) their geographic  location, (2) high volume of SSI applications for children with mental  impairments, and (3) benefit allowance rates for children with mental  impairments. In addition, we interviewed numerous external experts from  the medical and disability advocacy communities and reviewed relevant  studies, as well as relevant federal laws and regulations.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2011 to June 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

If the case is sampled, the reviewing component sends the case  to the servicing field office upon completion of its review. If the claimant is  determined to be disabled, the field office computes the benefit amount  and initiates benefit payment. If the claim is denied, a claimant has 60  days to request that the DDS reconsider its decision. If the claimant is  dissatisfied with the reconsideration, he or she may request a hearing  before an administrative law judge, whose decision may then be reviewed  by SSA\u2019s Appeals Council. When these administrative review options  have been exhausted, the claimant may request judicial review by filing  an action in a federal district court.", "If SSA determines that an individual is disabled, the agency is required by  law to conduct periodic reviews, known as continuing disability reviews  (CDR), to verify the recipient\u2019s continued medical eligibility for receiving  benefits in certain circumstances. More specifically, SSA is generally  required to perform CDRs (1) during the first year after birth for babies  whose low birth weight is a contributing factor to the determination of  disability and (2) at least once every 3 years for all other children under  age 18 whose conditions are considered likely to improve. DDS offices  determine when recipients will be due for CDRs on the basis of their  potential for medical improvement, and select and schedule a review  date\u2014otherwise known as a \u201cdiary date\u201d\u2014for each recipient\u2019s CDR.

In 1984, Congress  mandated the development of new disability standards for individuals with  mental impairments and the consideration of the impact of multiple  impairments in determining disability, among other things. SSA  subsequently expanded the list of mental impairments it considers  disabling in 1985 and again in 1990, when SSA added impairments such  as ADHD.", "In 1990, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Sullivan v.", "Zebley that SSA\u2019s use of medical listings of impairments for children\u2014 without conducting a functional analysis\u2014was incomplete. In response,  SSA established \u201cfunctional equivalence\u201d as a basis for SSI eligibility for  children, whereby a child can be found medically eligible for benefits if the  child\u2019s impairment limits his or her functional ability to the same degree as  described in a listed impairment. In deciding whether an impairment  functionally equals the listings, SSA examines how the child functions  compared to children of the same age who do not have impairments\u2014 rather than basing the decision on the child\u2019s medical diagnosis. The  Court\u2019s decision also resulted in the introduction of the individualized  functional assessment. This assessment was intended to be comparable  to SSA\u2019s method for evaluating adult impairments and to broaden the  evaluation of disability in children with physical and mental impairments to  include the effects of impairments on a child\u2019s ability to perform age- appropriate activities on a day-to-day basis. Awards to children,  especially those with mental impairments, increased dramatically for  several years following the Sullivan v. Zebley decision due partly to SSA  readjudicating nearly 300,000 determinations made between January  1980 and February 1991 under the revised disability criteria. By 1994,  SSA had reprocessed the majority of these cases, and subsequently  returned to processing their normal case loads. The Personal  Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996  (PRWORA) changed the standard for children, and the act was  expected to reduce the number of awards.

Despite this increase, SSA data indicated that  the agency has denied a majority of these child applicants each year. In  fact, for initial determinations in fiscal years 2000 to 2011, the average  denial rates for children with physical and mental impairments were about  63 and 54 percent, respectively, and allowance rates have remained  relatively stable over time for both groups of children.

Several DDS officials  we interviewed said that when making a determination, they consider the  totality of information related to the child\u2019s impairments, rather than one  piece of information in isolation. Based on our case file review, we  estimate that examiners generally cited four to five information sources as  support for their decisions in fiscal year 2010 for the three most prevalent  mental impairments. While examiners relied on multiple information  sources, we found that the extent they used these sources varied (see fig.  5).", "In more than 90 percent of the cases we reviewed, the examiner used  some form of medical evidence to support the decision, regardless of  whether the child\u2019s impairment met, medically equaled, or functionally  equaled the listings. SSA generally requires DDS examiners to assist  children and their parents or guardians in obtaining medical records in an  effort to develop at least a 1-year-long medical history prior to applying for  benefits. We estimate that examiners used observations from a treating  source, such as a pediatrician or psychologist, about a child\u2019s functioning  and testing by a treating source as support for 65 percent and 61 percent  of their determinations, respectively, making them among the most  commonly cited information sources. According to many of the DDS  officials we interviewed, examiners attempt to obtain medical evidence,  such as psychological tests, physician\u2019s notes, and mental health records,  for children with alleged mental impairments.", "If such evidence is not available or is inconclusive, DDS examiners may  purchase a consultative exam to provide additional medical evidence and  help them establish the severity of a child\u2019s impairment. This  examination is intended to provide the additional medical evidence, such  as results of a physical examination and laboratory findings, needed for a  determination. Based on our case file review, we estimate at least one  consultative examination was present in 52 percent of the cases. In some  cases, DDS offices requested multiple consultative examinations, such as  both a psychological and speech and language evaluation to address  different aspects of the alleged impairment. Consultative examinations  also provide information on the severity of the child\u2019s impairment. For  example, one examination provider described a case in which a child with  a speech and language delay had receptive and expressive language  skills that were nearly 2 years behind his chronological age. We  estimated that cases were more likely to be allowed if the consultative  exam provider described the child\u2019s impairment as severe. However,  many DDS officials told us that such examinations are only a \u201csnap-shot\u201d  in time and do not provide a longitudinal view of the child\u2019s functioning.  For this reason, some DDS officials said that information from a treating  source with a long-standing relationship with the child, such as a  physician, is more useful.", "In addition to medical evidence, SSA uses nonmedical information to  evaluate the severity of the child\u2019s impairment and functioning as part of   These sources include parents, day care the eligibility determination. providers, teachers, and others knowledgeable about the child\u2019s day-to- day behavior and activities. SSA field office staff may also provide  observations about the child, if the child is present for the disability  interview. (We estimate about 8 percent of child applicants were present  at the field office for the disability interview.)", "Several DDS officials told us school records and teacher assessments  (standardized questionnaires) are especially critical for determining  medical eligibility because these assessments provide information on a  child\u2019s functioning over time and are generally more objective than parent  assessments. According to some DDS examiners, parents primarily  observe their child in an unstructured home environment after the child\u2019s  medications have worn off, and may not know what behaviors are  developmentally normal, whereas teachers are generally in a position to  compare the child to other children and provide neutral observations on  how the child relates to peers, responds to medication, and performs in  school. We estimate teacher assessments and school testing were used  to support 63 and 43 percent of determinations, respectively. We also  identified several examples in the case files we reviewed where the  teacher\u2019s assessment was used to establish the child\u2019s level of  functioning and response to medication. For example:", "To support an allowance in one autism case, the examiner noted \u201cPer  teacher, he is virtually nonverbal. The teacher confirms he is not toilet  trained or independent in any area of self care.\u201d", "To support a denial decision in one ADHD case, the examiner noted  that the teacher\u2019s assessment indicated that the child\u2019s medication  \u201chas \u2018helped tremendously\u2019 with  ability to concentrate.\u201d  Additionally, according to the teacher the child \u201chas many friends and  is very social. She has no problems interacting with others. Claimant  has no problems with self care. She participates in the softball and  dance team.\u201d", "To support a denial decision in one autism case, the examiner  reported that the \u201cteacher\u2026notes he is more controlled on his meds.\u201d", "After the necessary information is collected to make a disability  determination, several examiners said that they compare all the  information to identify inconsistencies and assign weight to the various  sources. For example, some officials told us examiners assess the  credibility of parents\u2019 assessments of children\u2019s functioning by comparing  it to physicians\u2019 and teachers\u2019 statements. SSA policy notes that an  inconsistency does not necessarily mean that a determination cannot be  made because often most of the evidence or the most substantial  evidence outweighs the inconsistent evidence and additional information  would not change the determination or decision. Among the 298 alleged  ADHD, speech and language delay, and autism cases we examined,  there were 25 in which material inconsistencies could not be resolved  between sources, requiring the examiner to assign more or less weight to  certain sources. Examiners assigned more weight to teacher  assessments or information from school testing in 11 of the 25 cases.  Examiners also generally assigned more weight to testing and  observations of functioning by a consultative examiner (10 of the 25  cases) or by a treating source (10 of the 25 cases). In contrast, parents\u2019  assessments were given less weight in 14 of the 25 cases, although  decisions were made on a case by case basis. In one ADHD case, the  child\u2019s mother alleged a developmental delay, but a psychological  consultative exam did not find evidence of such a delay. The child\u2019s  teacher also stated that the child performed well academically when not  under timed conditions. In this case, the examiner gave less weight to the  parent\u2019s assessment and denied the claim."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "When Used in Eligibility Decisions, Medication and Treatment Information Is Frequently a Basis for Denying Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Despite a media report that prescription medication is considered by  some parents as key to obtaining SSI benefits, we found that medication  and treatment information is frequently a basis for denying benefits. SSA  and DDS officials told us that medication is generally given no more  weight than any other medical or nonmedical information in determining a  child\u2019s medical eligibility. In addition, several DDS officials told us  medication is considered in the context of other sources of information as  \u201cjust one piece of the puzzle.\u201d Our case file review confirmed that  information on medication and treatment was never the sole source of  support for an allowance or denial. In fact, we found that applicants were  more likely to be denied than allowed when medication was reported (see  fig. 6).", "When applying for benefits, parents reported that their children were  prescribed some form of medication in 58 percent of the cases we  reviewed. Of cases where medication was reported as present, 65  percent were denied and 35 percent were allowed. By comparison, 47  percent of cases were denied and 53 percent were allowed when  medication was not reported as present. We found that in cases in  which psychotropic drug use was reported, applicants were also more  likely to be denied. In these cases, 68 percent were denied and 32  percent were allowed. Nevertheless, our case file review suggests  examiners did not decide whether to allow or deny a claim based on the  absence or presence of medication. Although medication was reported as  present in 58 percent of cases, it was only cited as support for a  determination in 38 percent of cases.", "Beyond examining cases where parents reported that their children were  prescribed medication, we also specifically looked at cases where  examiners cited information on medication or treatment as part of the  rationale for their determinations. We found examiners generally  considered how the child responded to these interventions when making  a determination, and in 66 percent of the cases where information on  medication or treatment was used to support a determination, the  applicant was denied. When examiners cited medication and treatment as  a basis for denials, they noted that the child\u2019s functioning improved due to  these interventions. For example, in one denied ADHD case, the  examiner wrote that the claimant \u201chas responded well to medication and  while on medication has no problems functioning, completing work on  time and getting along with others.\u201d In one denied speech and language  delay case, the examiner noted that the claimant \u201chas been through  multiple therapies\u201d and that \u201chese therapies have been successful.\u201d To  the extent that medication improves functioning, DDS officials told us they  could potentially find that the child is not disabled under program rules. In  contrast, in cases where the child\u2019s functioning was not improved by  medication, this information generally helped support an allowance. For  example, in one allowed ADHD case, the examiner noted that the child  was \u201cot able to complete work independently despite tx  with  psych meds and special supervision in a partial  inclusion  setting.\u201d In another allowed ADHD case, the examiner observed that both  the treating source and teacher\u2019s assessment \u201cindicate marked limitations  in attention and concentration even with stimulant meds.\u201d", "Despite the examiners\u2019 focus on how medication affects functioning,  certain field office and DDS officials acknowledged that they believe some  parents are under the impression that medicating their children will  improve their likelihood of being found eligible for benefits. For example,  in one denied ADHD case the child\u2019s mother did not cooperate with the  DDS\u2019s efforts to obtain a consultative exam. The mother argued the  DDS should already have enough evidence to support an allowance  because the child was taking medication.

Several DDS offices reported difficulty obtaining  school records or teacher assessments, which they partly attributed to  school and teacher concerns about the time involved to compile this  information, potential liability issues, or confusion about how such  information is used in the disability decision-making process. For  example, some DDS examiners told us that in certain instances teachers  view their completion of the assessment as affirming that a child is  disabled and thus endorsing SSA\u2019s decision to award benefits. They do  not understand that examiners base their determinations on the totality of  evidence or that the assessment could be used to support a denial. In  one of the cases we reviewed, a teacher returned a blank teacher  assessment with a note stating \u201cwe are not allowed to fill these out  anymore.\u201d", "Our case file review estimated that teacher assessments were absent for  57 percent of cases for children age 7 or younger\u2014which is unsurprising,  given that many of these children may not yet be school age\u2014but such  assessments were also absent for 25 percent of cases for children older  than age 7. To address this challenge, SSA officials told us that some DDS  offices have dedicated staff to conduct outreach to schools in order to  emphasize the importance of information from schools as an evidence  source. However, they added that these staff have competing priorities,  including recruiting consultative exam providers and other medical  professionals, which limit the amount of outreach they can perform. In  addition to strengthening relationships with school personnel, disability  advocates told us that SSA could revise the teacher assessment by using  clearer language to make it more inviting to teachers. They also noted that  SSA could further emphasize that by completing the assessment, teachers  are not endorsing SSA\u2019s ultimate decision as to whether the child is  disabled or qualifies for benefits. Because schools and teachers are not  required to provide records or teacher assessments, some DDS offices pay  a fee for school records, but state laws prevent others from doing so,  according to SSA officials. SSA officials did not know the extent to which  DDS offices have paid for school records or the amount they had paid.", "SSA officials informed us they have heard reports of some DDS offices  facing challenges in obtaining information from schools, but they do not  know the degree to which these challenges exist nationwide, nor has SSA  conducted an empirical analysis of challenges related to obtaining  information from schools. SSA did issue guidance on steps DDS offices  can take to mitigate processing delays associated with obtaining school  evidence during extended school breaks, such as summer vacation, but  the agency has not issued guidance regarding year-round challenges  associated with obtaining information from schools. Without further study  to determine how widespread these obstacles are, it will remain unclear  whether additional guidance is warranted.", "In addition to the challenges they sometimes face in obtaining information  from schools, DDS examiners said that they do not routinely receive  information from SSA field offices on multiple siblings receiving SSI  benefits within the same household even though they are directed to be  alert for such cases. SSA\u2019s policy operations manual states that  disabilities may occur in more than one member of a family or household,  but notes prior case experience has shown this type of situation is an  indicator of possible fraud or abuse, particularly where certain mental  impairments are involved. For example, one of SSA\u2019s Cooperative  Disability Investigations Units investigated a case in which parents  applied for SSI benefits on behalf of their four children, alleging that they  all suffered from ADHD and conduct issues.found that the school guidance counselor had never observed them  exhibiting symptoms of ADHD despite seeing the four children daily, and  that a doctor had rescinded an order authorizing the school to administer  ADHD medication to the children. In this instance, SSA subsequently  denied the siblings\u2019 applications for SSI benefits. SSA\u2019s policy operations  manual directs examiners to refer such cases to SSA\u2019s Cooperative  Disability Investigations Unit or Office of the Inspector General for further   However, investigators  development, if questionable issues cannot be resolved. Based on our  interviews, it appears that SSA field offices do not consistently notify DDS  examiners when an applicant\u2019s siblings are already receiving SSI  benefits, nor are they always made aware of concurrent sibling  applications.

Examiners have also increasingly based allowance decisions on a finding  of functional equivalence for children with the most prevalent mental  impairments, requiring more complex decision making. Yet because  some examiners face obstacles in obtaining information from schools\u2014 which they consider critical to understanding how a child functions\u2014SSA  cannot ensure that examiners have the necessary information to arrive at  the most accurate determinations. Additionally, as a key program  gatekeeper, DDS examiners are in a unique position to identify program  integrity threats related to multiple children receiving SSI benefits within  the same household. However, without better information on these types  of arrangements they are unable fulfill this role in preventing potential  fraud and abuse.", "The fact that more than 430,000 childhood CDRs are overdue raises  concerns about the agency\u2019s ability to manage limited funds in a manner  that adequately balances its public service priorities with its stewardship  responsibility. When reviews are not conducted as scheduled, some child  recipients may receive benefits for which they are no longer eligible,  potentially costing taxpayers billions of dollars in overpayments.  Furthermore, CDRs provide an important check on program growth by  removing ineligible recipients from the rolls, even while new applicants  are added. If these reviews are not conducted in sufficient numbers, the  agency will continue to struggle to contain growth in benefit payments,  placing added burden on already strained federal budgets. Congress  appropriated funding for SSA to conduct more CDRs in recent years, and  SSA is evaluating how to manage its overall CDR workload. However,  because SSA considers SSI childhood CDRs a lower priority than other  CDRs, it is unclear whether the agency will use this funding to review  children most likely to medically improve\u2014reviews that could yield a high  return on investment. If SSA continues to rely heavily on the use of  waivers to conduct fewer CDRs than would otherwise be required by law,  SSA will potentially forgo future program savings. Furthermore, while we  consider SSA\u2019s decision to begin issuing formal waivers in order to clearly  comply with the CDR legal requirement to be a good start, that action  alone is not sufficient to fully alleviate our concerns with the waiver  process.

Our observations were limited by the extent to which examiners  documented their analysis and rationale on these forms.
