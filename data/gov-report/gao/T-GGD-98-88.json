However, in nearly all cases we reviewed in the early 1990s, agencies followed basic veterans\u2019 preference requirements leading up to the actual selection decision. At that point, hiring officials returned unused hiring certificates that were headed by the names of preference-eligible veterans more often than they did those headed by the names of individuals lacking such preference."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preference Procedures During Hiring", "paragraphs": ["When agencies want to fill positions, several hiring alternatives are available. Agencies can promote, transfer, or reassign a current federal employee; reinstate a former federal employee who has career status; make a new appointment from a hiring list, or hiring certificate (i.e., use competitive authority); or use noncompetitive appointment authorities. Of these hiring alternatives, veterans\u2019 preference applies only to competitive hiring. When agencies hire individuals from outside the federal government through competitive means, they can use the following methods: certificates from OPM or either of two authorities delegated from OPM (i.e., delegated examining authority or direct hire authority).", "Under the first method, OPM receives and examines applications for federal employment, which can include reviewing a written test and/or reviewing qualifications, and determines whether an applicant is qualified for a specific occupation or related occupations. If an applicant is rated as qualified, then the applicant is assigned a score that is used to place the individual in rank order on a federal employment register. As part of this ordering process, OPM is responsible for ensuring that veterans receive all preference points that are due them. When OPM receives and examines applications from veterans, it is to (1) verify veterans\u2019 preference points that are claimed by applicants, (2) add the preference points to the veterans\u2019 scores, and (3) rank all applicants by score. Qualified veterans with service-related disabilities are to be placed at the top of hiring lists, or certificates.", "Agency hiring officials can then request a certificate from OPM containing the top-rated candidates from the register. Agencies are generally required to select from among the top three available candidates on a certificate. However, they cannot select a nonveteran if a higher placed preference-eligible veteran is available on the list unless the selecting official obtains approval for passing over the higher ranked veteran. Justifications for passing over a higher ranked preference-eligible veteran must be based on qualifications or suitability. Only OPM is authorized to grant such approvals.", "Under the second method, rather than use certificates developed by OPM, agencies may receive delegated examining authority from OPM to prepare their own certificates. Under such authority, agencies are to follow the same scoring, ranking, and selection rules that OPM follows. In addition, when shortages of qualified candidates exist, OPM provides agencies with direct hire authority, which permits agencies to directly receive applications, examine applicants, and make selections. Effective January 9, 1992, OPM directed agencies to apply regular scoring and ranking procedures, including application of veterans\u2019 preference, whenever more than three candidates apply for a job or whenever both veterans and nonveterans are available. Until that date, direct hire authority, which accounted for almost one-third of all competitive hiring in fiscal year 1990, did not always provide for qualified veterans to receive preference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Veterans Received Appropriate Preference Points and Placement on Fiscal Year 1990 and 1991 Hiring Lists We Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["candidates was also correct.

Under existing civil service laws and regulations, hiring officials have the option of using a variety of methods to identify and recruit potential candidates for a position. These officials may also leave a position vacant rather than fill it with a candidate who is qualified for the position but with whom they are not satisfied. Therefore, certificates of eligible job candidates may be requested but not used if federal managers are dissatisfied with the choices presented to them.", "In our 1992 report on federal hiring, we reported that 57 percent of all certificates were returned unused. We found that a greater chance existed that hiring officials would return certificates unused to OPM or the personnel office of their agencies when the name of a preference-eligible veteran was at the top of the hiring list. We reported that of the 1,136 certificates of eligible job candidates we reviewed, about 71 percent of certificates had been returned unused if they were headed by a veteran. About 51 percent of certificates were returned unused if they were headed by a nonveteran.", "One explanation for this difference is that managers in executive agencies may have less flexibility in selecting from a certificate if the name of a veteran is at the top. For example, if a certificate lists nonveterans in the top three positions, a manager can select any of the three. However, if a certificate is headed by a preference-eligible veteran and nonveterans are in the next two positions, the manager generally has no choice but to select the veteran or return the certificate unused, unless the manager receives approval from OPM to pass over the veteran. certificate, OPM did not enforce this requirement. When agencies did provide reasons for not selecting a candidate, OPM did not collect data on or analyze those reasons to determine their legitimacy, the possibility of antiveteran bias, or whether certificates met managers\u2019 needs. In our 1992 report on federal hiring, we recommended that the Director of OPM establish a tracking system to monitor the use of federal hiring certificates. We also recommended that the Director use the data gathered by this system to analyze veteran hiring patterns. By February 1994, according to OPM, OPM developed a tracking system for evaluating unused certificates and automated portions of it. We have not reviewed this tracking system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Employees With Veterans Preference During RIFs", "paragraphs": ["When agencies reduce their workforces through RIFs, veterans also have certain retention rights that are derived from the 1944 Veterans\u2019 Preference Act.

First, management determines the number and types of positions that are to be abolished and the \u201ccompetitive areas\u201d affected by the decision. Second, management identifies the employees within a competitive area and their relative status in the competition for retention. Employees\u2019 retention status and assignment rights to other positions are essentially determined by their tenure, veterans\u2019 preference, and length of service, with additional years of service credit provided based on how well they did on their performance ratings.", "When the identified positions are abolished, incumbents of those positions may have assignment rights to other positions that are not being abolished, depending on their retention status and qualifications. Once the initial decisions are made that define the numbers, types, and locations of positions to be abolished, determining the retention status of employees and their exercise of assignment rights is a relatively mechanical process with little flexibility.

We testified that the RIFs resulted in separations of minorities in numbers disproportionate to their numbers in the workforce at the three locations reviewed. Women were separated in disproportionate numbers at two of the locations. In some cases, disproportionate numbers of separations occurred largely because minorities and women did not have the retention factors\u2014tenure, veterans\u2019 preference, or performance-adjusted seniority\u2014of nonminorities or men. Our analysis of the retention factors for civilian workers employed by the military services at the end of fiscal year 1991 showed that minorities and women ranked lower than their nonminority counterparts in all retention factors, including veterans\u2019 preference.", "For purposes of this hearing, we analyzed the data from our 1994 testimony to determine how well preference-eligible veterans fared during the RIFs at the three installations. Overall, we found that those without veterans\u2019 preference were from about two to seven times more likely to have lost their jobs during the RIFs than were those employees with veterans\u2019 preference. At the Alameda, California, Naval Aviation Depot, those without veterans\u2019 preference were seven times more likely to have lost their jobs in the RIF than were those who had the preference. At Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, those without veterans\u2019 preference were about twice as likely to have lost their jobs. And at the Watervliet, New York, Army Arsenal, those without veterans\u2019 preference were six times more likely to have lost their jobs.", "In 1996, we reported on a RIF conducted at the USGS during October 1995. This RIF took place within the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s Geologic Division and was somewhat unusual in that the overwhelming majority of Geologic Division employees were each placed in competitive levels that included only one employee. Employees within a single-person competitive level have less opportunity to move into another position during a RIF.

However, those without veterans\u2019 preference were four times as likely to lose their jobs than were employees who had veterans\u2019 preference.", "Although you were interested in our updating and adding to these RIF-related retention statistics, we were not able to obtain comparable data on the retention rates for preference-eligible veterans for a wider number of more recent RIFs in the limited time we had to prepare for this hearing. Data are available from OPM\u2019s Central Personnel Data File on the total number of veterans who have lost their jobs during RIFs over the past several years. However, these data alone do not indicate whether preference-eligible veterans were separated as a result of a RIF at rates disproportionate to others. Determining whether veterans have been disproportionately affected during RIFs would require data on the full population that was at risk of losing their jobs during a RIF. This is the population of the competitive area that would have been established by agencies for each specific RIF. Such data are not available from any central database that we were able to identify.", "In summary, Mr. Chairman, preference-eligible veterans remain a larger portion of the federal workforce than veterans overall in the general civilian workforce. In those job applications we reviewed for fiscal years 1990 and 1991, agencies properly followed veterans\u2019 preference procedures in the hiring process in virtually all cases. However, selecting officials were more likely to return certificates unused if they were headed by the names of veterans than they were if veterans did not head those certificates. Finally, in four specific RIFs we reviewed, employees who did not have veterans\u2019 preference were much more likely to lose their jobs during a RIF than were their colleagues who had veterans\u2019 preference.", "This concludes my prepared statement.
