Round 1 started in 2008, and round 2 and the national mail-order program started in 2013. CMS estimated that the first 2 years of round 2 and the national mail-order program saved Medicare approximately $3.6 billion. GAO has reported on several prior CBP rounds.", "GAO was asked to continue to review the implementation of the CBP. In this report, GAO examines the extent to which round 2 and the national mail-order program have affected (1) utilization of CBP-covered DME items, and (2) beneficiaries' access to DME items. This report also (3) describes the number and market shares of the round 2 and mail-order program suppliers.", "To examine the effect of CBP on utilization, GAO used Medicare DME claims data from 2012 and 2014\u2014the year before and the year after implementation of round 2\u2014to compare the number of beneficiaries who received CBP-covered DME items. To examine the effect of CBP on beneficiary access, GAO reviewed information about CMS's efforts to monitor the effects of the CBP, and interviewed selected Medicare beneficiary organizations and state hospital associations. To describe the supplier markets, GAO analyzed 2014 Medicare claims data, the latest year with complete available data when GAO began this engagement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of beneficiaries receiving durable medical equipment (DME) items covered under the competitive bidding program (CBP) generally decreased after implementation of two CBP phases that began July 1, 2013\u2014round 2 and the national mail-order program for diabetes testing supplies. Under the CBP, (administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)), only competitively selected contract suppliers can furnish certain DME items at competitively determined prices to beneficiaries in designated competitive bidding areas. From the year before (2012) to the year after (2014) implementation, the number of beneficiaries receiving covered items in round 2 areas decreased 17 percent, compared with a 6 percent decrease for beneficiaries in non-CBP areas. The number of beneficiaries that received diabetes testing supplies through the national mail-order program also decreased 39 percent between 2012 and 2014, with a corresponding 13 percent increase in the number of beneficiaries receiving these items through retail outlets. CMS officials stated that CBP has helped limit fraud and abuse and may have curbed unnecessary utilization of some CBP-covered items in competitive bidding areas.", "CMS reports that available evidence from the agency's monitoring efforts indicates that the implementation of round 2 and the national mail-order program have had no widespread effects on beneficiary access. In particular, CMS has reported that its health status monitoring tool has not detected any changes in health measures attributable to the CBP, and the results of its 2014 post-CBP beneficiary satisfaction surveys remained positive. In addition, the number of CBP inquiries and complaints generally decreased throughout the first 2 years of round 2 and the national mail-order program. CMS officials told GAO that CMS took measures to ensure that contract suppliers met their contract obligations, such as investigating complaints using secret shopping calls, and terminating contracts of suppliers that remained noncompliant after receiving targeted education. However, some beneficiary advocacy groups and state hospital associations reported specific access issues, such as difficulty locating contract suppliers that will furnish certain items and delays in delivery of DME items.", "Round 2 and the national mail-order program included 801 separate competitive bidding area and product category competitions. Most of these competitions had at least five active contract suppliers in 2014. However, 11 percent of the competitions had three or fewer active contract suppliers and 1 percent had just one active contract supplier. In addition, while multiple suppliers had substantial shares of the market for most competitions, in some competitions a single supplier had a majority. For example, in 6 percent of the competitions, one contract supplier had at least 90 percent of the market. Conversely, 11 percent of contract suppliers did not furnish any CBP-covered items for any competitions in their contract. CMS officials told GAO that CMS monitors these suppliers to help ensure that they are meeting their contractual obligations, such as being willing to service all beneficiaries in their areas and to furnish the same items to Medicare beneficiaries that they make available to other customers.", "The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicare, a federal health insurance program administered by the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), within the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS), spent $6.7 billion in 2015 on fee- for-service (FFS) payments for durable medical equipment (DME),  including prosthetics, orthotics, and related supplies for beneficiaries.  Most Medicare beneficiaries enroll in Medicare Part B, which helps pay  for DME items, such as oxygen, wheelchairs, hospital beds, and walkers,  if they are medically necessary and prescribed by a physician. Medicare  beneficiaries typically obtain DME items from suppliers, who then submit  claims for payment to Medicare on behalf of beneficiaries.", "Historically, Medicare paid for DME items by using a fee schedule  generally based on what suppliers charged for the items and services  during the 1980s, and these amounts were increased annually. However,  both we and the HHS Office of Inspector General reported that Medicare  and its beneficiaries sometimes paid higher than market rates for various  DME items, and there were long-standing concerns about the high rates  of improper payments related to DME. To achieve savings and address  improper payment concerns, Congress, through the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA),  directed that CMS change the way it pays for DME and other items by  implementing a competitive bidding program (CBP). The CBP changed a  long-standing policy that any qualified provider could enroll in Medicare  and furnish DME items to instead having CMS conduct a competitive  process to select suppliers eligible to provide certain DME product  categories to Medicare beneficiaries in designated competitive bidding  areas. The CBP also based DME payments on competitive bids, rather  than on the fee schedule. DME suppliers that win competitions, called  contract suppliers, are awarded contracts based on their bid amounts and  are paid at the competitively determined payments for CBP-covered DME  items. These payments, referred to as single payment amounts, are  calculated for each DME item included in the CBP and must be equal to  or lower than Medicare\u2019s traditional FFS payments for the same items.", "CMS and its competitive bidding implementation contractor, Palmetto  GBA, have implemented the CBP in several phases\u2014referred to as CBP  rounds or programs. The first phase, round 1, initially included 10  competitive bidding areas, but following the termination of round 1, it was  subsequently rebid in 9 of the 10 same areas. Round 2 began July 1,  2013, and expanded the CBP to an additional 100 competitive bidding  areas for 8 product categories. At the same time, CMS also began  another phase of the CBP, called the national mail-order program, which  included diabetes testing supplies received through mail-order. CMS also  announced that it will implement additional phases of the CBP in 2016  and 2017. In addition, beginning January 1, 2016, as required by law,  CMS began using CBP rates to adjust FFS payments in areas where  CBP had not been implemented.", "According to CMS, the competitive bidding process has produced savings  through lower payment rates and has decreased unnecessary utilization.  Specifically, CMS estimated that the first 2 years of round 2 and the  national mail-order program (July 1, 2013-June 30, 2015) saved Medicare  approximately $3.6 billion. CMS reported that round 2 single payment  amounts were, on average, 45 percent less than Medicare\u2019s current FFS  payments, and the national mail-order program payments for diabetes  testing supplies were, on average, 72 percent less than the FFS  payments at the time the programs began. In addition to these savings,  CMS has also reported that CBP has helped limit fraud and abuse and  may have curbed unnecessary utilization of some CBP-covered items in  competitive bidding areas. For example, CMS reported that by bringing  Medicare payments for DME items more in line with the prices paid by  others, CBP-covered items are a less profitable target area for suppliers  involved with fraudulent billing practices. However, some stakeholder  groups have raised concerns that the lower payment rates and smaller  number of suppliers in CBP have disrupted beneficiary access to quality  DME items, and may have led to increased adverse health outcomes.", "We previously reported that the CBP round 1 rebid was generally  implemented successfully, but that it was important to continue monitoring  CBP to determine effects that CBP may have on Medicare beneficiaries  and DME suppliers as CMS expands the program into additional areas  and product categories. You asked us to continue monitoring the CBP by  examining the possible effects of round 2 and the national mail-order  program on beneficiaries and DME suppliers. In this report, we examine  changes in utilization of CBP-covered DME items after the  implementation of round 2 and the national mail-order program,  the extent to which round 2 and the national mail-order program may  have affected Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to covered DME items,  and  the number and market share of contract suppliers in round 2 and  national mail-order program competitions.", "To examine changes in utilization of DME items after the implementation  of round 2 and the national mail-order program, we used Medicare claims  data and other CMS data to calculate the percentage change in the  number of beneficiaries receiving CBP-covered items and in the number  of items received in 2012 and 2014\u2014the years before and after  implementation. For the round 2 analysis, we examined changes in  beneficiary utilization and how these changes varied for items across  each of the 8 product categories\u2014which included a total of 202  Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes\u2014and  100 areas. We also compared these changes in utilization to those for  items and areas not included in round 2\u2014non-CBP items and areas.  For the national mail-order program analysis, we examined changes in  beneficiary utilization for all 8 HCPCS codes included in the program, and  whether beneficiaries received the items through mail order or a retail  location.", "To examine the extent to which round 2 and the national mail-order  program may have affected Medicare beneficiary access to covered DME  items, we analyzed CMS data from the first 2 years of implementation,  July 2013 through June 2015, including both CBP inquiry data from the 1- 800-MEDICARE beneficiary help line and CBP complaint data. We also  examined CMS\u2019s health status monitoring tool that tracks health  measures in both CBP and non-CBP areas as well as pre- and post-CBP  round 2 and national mail-order program beneficiary satisfaction survey  results. We interviewed CMS and CBP contractor officials, and CMS\u2019s  Competitive Acquisition Ombudsman. In addition, we also interviewed five  beneficiary advocacy groups representing Medicare beneficiaries that  may have specific conditions requiring DME items, such as diabetes and  disabilities requiring wheelchairs. Specifically, we asked about their  experiences with CBP round 2 and the national mail-order program and  the extent to which their members had reported issues related to access  and choice of DME items. We also contacted four state hospital  associations from states with several competitive bidding areas. These  associations provided us contact information to speak with stakeholders  such as referral agents, discharge planners, case managers, and other  staff who assist CBP-covered beneficiaries in obtaining DME items. In  response to concerns raised by some stakeholders we contacted, we also  reviewed the national average length of stay in hospitals for beneficiaries  who underwent a hip or knee replacement. We selected hip or knee  replacements because beneficiaries would likely need DME items  following this surgery and because CMS reported it was the most  frequently occurring FFS discharge code in the year that round 2 was  implemented. We reviewed the length of stay for those beneficiaries who  both did and did not receive a DME item between one day before and  after the date of discharge from the hospital in 2014 as compared to 2012  in both CBP and non-CBP areas.", "To examine the number and market shares of contract suppliers in round  2 and national mail-order program competitions, we used 2014 Medicare  claims data, the latest year with complete available data when we began  this engagement, and a list of contract suppliers from CMS. We defined  a contract supplier as active in a given market during 2014 if it furnished  at least one item in that competition and defined a contract supplier\u2019s  market share as its Medicare allowed charges in a competition as a  percentage of the total charges in that competition across all suppliers  (including non-contract suppliers). For each competition, we calculated  the market share of the top contract supplier, which is a measure of the  extent to which the market is competitive. We also examined the extent to  which this measure varied by product category. Additionally, we  calculated each contract supplier\u2019s market shares across all competitions  included in its contract, as well as the number of suppliers that did not  furnish any items in one or more of the competitions included in their  contract.", "We assessed the reliability of Medicare claims data, which we obtained  from CMS\u2019s 100 Percent Standard Analytic Files, by reviewing existing  information about the data and the systems that produced them,  performing appropriate electronic data checks, and interviewing CMS  officials. To assess the reliability of the data we received from CMS and  Palmetto GBA, we reviewed relevant documentation, performed  electronic data checks, and interviewed CMS officials. We determined  that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to September 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit  objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CBP Contract Supplier Bidding and Award Process", "paragraphs": ["CMS and Palmetto GBA administer and implement the CBP and its  bidding phases. In each CBP bidding phase, suppliers that want to  participate in the CBP may submit a bid in one or more product  categories in one or more designated competitive bidding areas. To be  offered a CBP contract, suppliers must be qualified, meaning they have  met general Medicare enrollment and quality standards as well as CBP\u2019s  financial and applicable licensing standards; be eligible to bill Medicare  for DME items; have a DME surety bond; and be accredited and  licensed.", "After CMS and Palmetto GBA review qualified suppliers\u2019 bids, the bids  are ordered by lowest to highest price, and CMS then makes offers to all  those needed to meet or exceed CMS\u2019s estimated beneficiary demand  who submitted the lowest prices. If a bidding supplier accepts an offer to  furnish a specific product category in a specific competitive bidding area,  it must agree to furnish all of the items included in the product category to  all eligible Medicare beneficiaries residing in the competitive bidding area  at the applicable single payment amounts. Because the single payment  amount is the median of the winning bid price offers for each DME item in  a product category for each competitive bidding area, the payment can be  less or more than a particular winning supplier\u2019s actual bid for an item.  Furthermore, because each competitive bidding area and product  category combination is a separate competition, the same DME item may  have a different single payment amount in each area. For example, the  round 2 single payment amounts for a new foam rubber mattress ranged  between $111.38 in the Palm Bay and Deltona, Florida, competitive  bidding areas to $178.62 in the Honolulu, Hawaii, competitive bidding  area. Contracts are generally awarded for 3 years and can include one or  many competitions. While generally only contract suppliers that accepted  a contract for a given product category and competitive bidding area are  eligible to furnish those items, there are circumstances in which suppliers  not awarded a CBP contract\u2014referred to as non-contract suppliers\u2014may  be grandfathered to continue to furnish some CBP-covered items to  certain beneficiaries for a limited time. In addition, physicians, treating  practitioners, and hospitals can furnish walkers, folding manual  wheelchairs, or external infusion pumps to their own patients as part of  their professional services or during hospital admission or discharge  without a CBP contract.", "When offering contracts, CMS takes steps that it believes will ensure  beneficiary access and choice. For example, CMS\u2019s goal is to award at  least five contracts for each product category and competitive bidding  area competition. To help meet this goal, CMS caps the estimated  projected capacity of any single supplier at 20 percent of the total  projected beneficiary demand for each product category, in each  competitive bidding area, regardless of the capacity estimated by the  supplier in its bid submission.

However, CMS stated that CBP has helped limit  fraud and abuse and may have curbed unnecessary utilization of some  CBP-covered items in competitive bidding areas. Additionally, in recent  years CMS began implementing several broader antifraud efforts that  were not limited to CBP-covered items or areas, such as taking additional  steps to identify aberrant or suspicious billing patterns among all  Medicare FFS claims before making payments, and implementing new  safeguards to better screen existing and new Medicare suppliers.", "Looking at each of the eight product categories individually, the number of  beneficiaries receiving covered items generally decreased after  implementation of round 2, and these decreases were generally larger  than those for the same items in non-CBP areas.

The 1,156 complaints recorded in the first 2 years  occurred across multiple round 2 product categories, rather than being  concentrated in a few specific categories. The complaints varied, but  included complaints that contract suppliers refused to serve beneficiaries  residing in their competitive bidding areas or had provided poor customer  service, that beneficiaries had experienced delays in receiving DME or  had received the wrong DME, and that beneficiaries had difficulty  obtaining specific brands and models of DME items that had been  prescribed by their physicians. For example, Palmetto GBA received  several complaints indicating that contract suppliers refused to provide  the U-Step walker, a specific brand of walker, furnished under a specific  HCPCS code. According to CMS, U-Step walkers are infrequently  prescribed, and Palmetto GBA worked with beneficiaries on a case-by- case basis to obtain them from contract suppliers.

According to CMS,  Palmetto GBA may conduct dozens or hundreds of focused secret  shopping calls to investigate a single complaint to thoroughly investigate  an allegation or verify contract supplier compliance. CMS told us that  during secret shopping calls, Palmetto GBA representatives may pose as  referral agents on behalf of beneficiaries and request items, such as  specific diabetes testing supplies from contract suppliers, to determine  whether the suppliers offer the supplies they claim to furnish. According  to CMS, if those calls find that the contract supplier refused to provide  DME items according to the terms of its CBP contract, Palmetto GBA  describes the results of the call to the supplier\u2019s representative and sends  an educational letter reiterating contract obligations.

The surveys asked beneficiaries to record their satisfaction ratings  on a five-point scale for six questions: the beneficiary\u2019s initial interaction  with DME suppliers, the training received regarding the DME item, the  delivery of the DME item, the quality of the item provided by the supplier,  the customer service provided by the supplier, and the supplier\u2019s overall  complaint handling. In both the pre- and post-implementation surveys, a  majority of the beneficiaries who responded to each of the six questions  rated their experiences as either \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good,\u201d although there  were slightly fewer positive responses in the post-implementation survey.

For example, individuals we spoke with from the Florida  Hospital Association told us that prior to CBP, DME suppliers typically  delivered DME within 24 hours of the request, 7 days a week. However,  since CBP round 2 was implemented, contract suppliers in Florida\u2019s  competitive bidding areas no longer delivered on weekends and also  delivered only during certain hours Monday through Friday. The planners  and agents from the Florida Hospital Association told us that delays in  delivery can extend the length of beneficiaries\u2019 hospital stays when the  DME is necessary prior to discharge, such as DME for orthopedic-related  injuries.
