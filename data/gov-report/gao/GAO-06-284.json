To correct this shortage, Congress is temporarily allowing DOD to use contract security guards to fulfill roles previously performed by military employees. The U.S. Army has awarded contracts worth nearly $733 million to acquire contract guards at 57 Army installations, an investment far greater than those made by other DOD services so far. The requesters asked GAO to assess how the Army has been managing and overseeing its acquisition of security guard services, particularly with regard to the Army's (1) acquisition strategy, (2) employment screening, (3) training of contract guards, and (4) award fee process. This report also discusses DOD's mandated November 2005 report to Congress on the contract guard program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army's three-phased approach for acquiring contract security guards has relied heavily on sole-source contracts, despite the Army's recognition early on that it was paying considerably more for its sole-source contracts than for those awarded competitively. The Army has devoted twice as many contract dollars--nearly $495 million--to its sole-source contracts as to its competed contracts and has placed contract security guards at 46 out of 57 installations through sole-sourcing. These sole-source contracts were awarded to two Alaska Native corporation firms under the Small Business Administration's 8(a) Business Development Program. Congress has provided these firms with special advantages in the 8(a) program. During initial planning, the Army worked with a contractor who had not performed guard services before to refine the contract performance work statement. The Army's procedure for screening prospective contract guards is inadequate and puts the Army at risk of having ineligible guards protecting installation gates. The Army found that, at two separate installations, a total of 89 guards were put to work even though they had records relating to criminal offenses, including cases that involved assault and other felonies. Thorough background checks lag far behind the rate at which contract guards are put to work, and the initial screening process relies on prospective guards to be honest when filling out job application forms. In response to an earlier GAO report, DOD agreed to revise its antiterrorism standards to put into place a better mechanism for verifying the trustworthiness of contractors. The Army has given its contractors the responsibility to conduct most of the training of contract guards, and the Army cannot say with certainty whether training is actually taking place and whether it is being conducted according to approved criteria. GAO found that there is no requirement for the Army to certify that a contract guard has completed required training and that Army performance monitors do not conduct oversight of training as a matter of course. GAO also found missing or incomplete training records at several installations. At three installations, guards were certified by the contractor before training had been completed. An investigation discovered that at one installation, contractor personnel had falsified training records; the Army subsequently paid the contractor over $7,000 to re-qualify the guards. The Army has paid out more than $18 million in award fees, but the fees are based only on compliance with basic contractual requirements, not for above-and-beyond performance. Over the life of the contract guard program, the Army has paid out almost 98 percent of the available award fees. The practice of routinely paying contractors nearly the entire available award fee has created an environment in which the contractors expect to receive most of the available fee, regardless of acquisition outcomes. GAO found that many Army performance monitors were not conducting all of the required inspections of contractor activity in order to rate performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks, the Department of  Defense (DOD) sent numerous active-duty, U.S.-based personnel to  Afghanistan, Iraq, and other destinations to support the global war on  terror. These deployments depleted the pool of military security guards at  a time when DOD was faced with increased security functions at its U.S.  installations. To ease this imbalance, Congress temporarily authorized  DOD to waive a prohibition against the use of contract security guards at  domestic military installations. Subsequently, DOD has turned to  contractors to help fulfill the security guard function at a growing number  of installations. We recently reported that the government\u2019s increasing  reliance on contractors for missions previously performed by government  employees highlights the need for sound planning and contract execution.", "The congressional authority allowing DOD to hire contract guards initially  was to expire in December 2005, but Congress extended the waiver  authority through September 2006, on the condition that DOD submit a  report to Congress addressing various aspects of the security guard  program. DOD submitted the report in November 2005. The National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 has further extended the  waiver authority through September 2007. The Army, the first service to  use the authority, has awarded contracts worth nearly $733 million to  acquire contract guards at 57 installations. We were asked to assess how  the Army has been managing and overseeing its acquisition of security  guard services. Specifically, we determined (1) what acquisition approach  the Army used, (2) whether the Army ensures that the guards are  effectively screened for employment, (3) whether the Army ensures the  guards are adequately trained, and (4) the Army\u2019s rationale for providing  the contractors with award fees and how the award fee process is being  implemented. This report also discusses DOD\u2019s November 2005 report to  Congress.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and analyzed key documents,  including Army and contractor policies, procedures, and records, as well  as policies and procedures followed by the U.S. Air Force and the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Federal Protective Service for their  contract security guards. We selected 11 Army installations to visit by   (1) ensuring that each of the Army\u2019s security guard contractors were  included and (2) choosing installations that represented a range of  contractor performance evaluation outcomes, from perfect scores to  lower average scores (according to March/April 2005 Army assessments).  These installations are cited in appendix II. In addition, we met with  officials at the Army\u2019s Installation Management Agency, the Army\u2019s Office  of the Provost Marshal General, and the Army Contracting Agency. We  also met with the contractors and subcontractors that provide security  guards to the Army. We examined the November 2005 \u201cDepartment of  Defense Installation Security Guard Requirement Assessment and Plan\u201d  and met with the head of the working group that prepared the report.  Further details on the scope and methodology of our review can be found  in appendix I. We conducted our review from May 2005 to February 2006  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since late 1982, Congress has, for the most part, prohibited DOD from  contracting for security guards at U.S. domestic installations. According to  the legislative history, the prohibition was originally enacted because of  concerns about the uncertain quality and reliability of private security  guard services, base commanders\u2019 potential lack of control over  contractor personnel, and the right of contractor personnel to strike.  Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, however, DOD directed  installation commanders to ensure that all vehicles, identification cards,  badges, and other forms of identification were inspected for authorized  access to military installations. These increased security requirements  created an increased demand for personnel to perform security-related  tasks. Initially, security requirements were filled at military installations  with active duty and reserve component personnel. However, as reserve  personnel reached their mandatory release dates from active duty and as  competing demands for both reserve and active component personnel  grew, resources became constrained. DOD reported that contracting for  security guard services was deemed necessary and practical to allow it to  simultaneously support increased demands for military forces and to meet  heightened security requirements for continental U.S. installations and  facilities. Accordingly, in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2003, Congress temporarily authorized DOD to waive  the prohibition against contracting for security guard functions, thereby  minimizing the department\u2019s need to use military personnel to perform  these functions.", "The congressional waiver authority was predicated on an expectation that  without the contract guards, military personnel would be used to perform  the increased security function. In addition, it was expected that contract  guards would perform their jobs as well as the military personnel who had  previously served in that capacity. The 2003 authorization act required that  in order to use the authority, the following stipulations must be met:    Recruiting and training standards for contract security guards must be  comparable to standards for DOD personnel who perform security  guard functions.", "Contract security guards must be effectively supervised, reviewed, and  evaluated.", "Employment of contract security guards must not cause a reduction in  the security of the military installation.", "The waiver authority was initially set to expire in December 2005, but the  Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005  extended the authority through September 2006, provided that DOD  submit a report to Congress on the contract guard program. The report,  entitled \u201cDepartment of Defense Installation Security Guard Requirement  Assessment and Plan,\u201d was submitted to Congress on November 22, 2005.  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 again  extended the waiver authority an additional year, through September 2007.", "The Army, Air Force, and Navy each have employed contract security  guards under the waiver authority. The Army was the first to begin  acquiring guards and has used the waiver authority most extensively; as of  December 2005, it had contracted for security guards at 57 installations,  whereas contract guards are being used at 18 Air Force and 5 Navy  installations. Several key players are involved in the Army\u2019s contract  security guard program.", "Army Office of the Provost Marshal General: This office directs  policy for all matters relating to Army law enforcement, police  intelligence, physical security, criminal investigations, provost marshal  activities, and military police and provides oversight of these  resources. The Office of the Provost Marshal General was the requiring  agency that determined and prioritized security guard requirements at  each installation and identified the number of guards needed.", "Installation Management Agency (IMA): Formed in 2002, IMA is  responsible for centralized oversight of U.S. Army bases and for  administering all aspects of the contract guard program according to  the requirements set by the Provost Marshal General.

It awarded six fixed-price,  award-fee contracts and has issued task orders under these contracts  for guards at 57 installations. The contracting officer has designated an  IMA official as the government\u2019s primary oversight representative for  the guard program.", "Army installations: These are the recipients of contract guards.", "Installation officials are responsible for ensuring that the contractor\u2019s  performance is evaluated daily and that the guards are screened and  trained by reviewing contractor-supplied records.

ANCs were created by Congress to help settle Alaska  Native land claims and to foster economic development for Alaska  Natives, have been accorded special advantages under SBA\u2019s 8(a)  Business Development Program. 8(a) ANC firms are considered small  disadvantaged businesses, and as long as they meet relevant size  standards for the procurement and other eligibility requirements, they  can be awarded contracts noncompetitively for any dollar amount.  Generally, acquisitions offered to other 8(a) businesses where the  contract value is more than $3 million or $5 million (for manufacturing)  must be competitively awarded. The other two contractors are not ANC  firms.", "When acquiring services, a federal agency\u2019s first course of action is  typically to develop an acquisition strategy. Ideally, this would involve  examining and weighing several alternatives. Once the Army decided to  use contract security guards, it began analyzing its contracting options.  ACA could have chosen from among numerous contract vehicles available  to acquire the guard services. It had the option of awarding a new contract  or using existing interagency contracts through other federal agencies. For  example, the General Services Administration (GSA) awards   governmentwide contracts, including contracts for security guard services,  under its Federal Supply Schedule (Schedule) program to help federal  agencies make purchases in less turnaround time on a competitive basis  for commonly used items or services.", "To motivate contractors to perform well, the Army chose to use monetary  incentives called award fees. Award fees allow agencies to adjust the  amount of fee paid to the contractor based on performance. We recently  questioned how effectively these fees are being used at DOD because its  programs have paid contractors large amounts of fees on acquisitions that  are experiencing problems. We reported that DOD has little evidence to  support its belief that these fees improve contractor performance and  acquisition outcomes.", "Separately, we have reported on concerns involving the trustworthiness of  contractors and subcontractors who have access to U.S. military  installations. DOD officials have told us that they have not evaluated the  trustworthiness of some contractors because the department\u2019s existing  antiterrorism standards do not specifically require them to do so. In  response to our recommendations, DOD officials are in the process of  revising the standards to verify trustworthiness of contractors and  subcontractors and better control access to installations, facilities, and  sensitive areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s Approach for Acquiring Contract Security Guards Relies Mostly on 8(a) Sole-Source Contracts", "paragraphs": ["The Army has awarded two sole-source contracts, totaling almost   $495 million, to 8(a) ANC firms to acquire the bulk of its contract guards,  even though contracting officials pointed out that using competed GSA  Schedule contracts would have been just as fast and less costly.

Table 1 presents the three-phased approach and shows  in which phase the Army used 8(a) sole-source contracts or competitive  contracts.", "Since the Army\u2019s contract security guard program began in 2003, the Army  has devoted almost twice as many contract dollars to sole-sourcing under  the 8(a) program as it has to full and open competition. Figure 1 shows  that 46 out of 57 Army installations received their contract guards through  8(a) sole-source contracts in phases one and three and that the guards for  the remaining 11 installations were acquired through competed contracts.", "Table 2 shows how the acquisition approach began taking shape before  the Army settled on its three-phased approach and who the key players  were."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army\u2019s Sole-Source Approach Centered on Contracting with 8(a) ANC Firms", "paragraphs": ["Even though the use of the GSA Schedule was identified as a possible  acquisition approach, the Army decided that the best course of action for  the first acquisition phase was to award contracts to 8(a) ANC firms,  believing that use of the GSA Schedule would have taken longer, would  not have allowed a consolidated approach at the national level, and would  have diluted the Army\u2019s purchasing power. The Army was not able to  provide us with any analysis showing how it made these determinations.  We found that other federal agencies, such as the U.S. Air Force and the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Federal Protective Service, have used  GSA Schedule contracts to obtain their security guards. According to the  Air Force contracting officer, using GSA Schedule contracts was  considered the more efficient, faster method to obtain the guards. The Air  Force has used these contracts to obtain contract security guards at   18 bases at an annual estimated cost of $29 million. The Federal Protective  Service manages and oversees 10,000 armed contract security guards that  were mostly obtained under GSA\u2019s Schedule program.", "SBA\u2019s Alaska district office, in a May 2003 letter to ACA, stated that it was  \u201cmarketing\u201d a particular 8(a) ANC firm to meet the Army\u2019s security guard  requirements. According to ACA officials, this firm was already being  considered by the Army. A second 8(a) ANC firm that had approached the  Army was also considered. Before awarding the contracts to these  companies, the contracting office asked the Defense Contract  Management Agency to evaluate the firms\u2019 capabilities. The agency rated  one of the firms\u2014the one SBA had marketed to the Army\u2014as \u201chigh risk\u201d  for performance because it had experience manufacturing goods but no  experience providing services. The risk was mitigated somewhat because  of anticipated support and assistance from the company\u2019s parent  corporation, the Defense Contract Management Agency said, and because  the firm had chosen to team up with a subcontractor experienced in  providing security guard services. Subsequently, in a process known as  \u201calpha contracting,\u201d Army officials worked together with this ANC firm to  finalize the contract guard performance work statement by refining  specific tasks for feasibility and affordability. The resulting performance  work statement was then used on all of the security guard contracts.", "During a second acquisition phase in September 2003, the Army awarded  four competed contracts. In evaluating the contractors\u2019 cost proposals for  the second acquisition phase, the Army recognized that the same  contractors involved in the first phase submitted cost proposals  considerably higher than the winning proposals. But the Army turned  again to these same contractors in phase three, adding 37 more  installations to the 8(a) sole-source contracts. The Army took this action  despite knowing that the government was paying considerably less for the  phase-two competed contracts. An ACA analysis computing the cost per  contract employee showed that the competitive contracts cost about   25 percent less than the 8(a) sole-source contracts. ACA officials told us  that the Army returned to the ANC firms in part because doing so was an  easy method of obtaining additional security guards and because they  were pleased with the ANC firms\u2019 performance. In addition, IMA officials  asserted that because the phase three requirements were not finalized  until within 90 days of when the contract guards were required, a  competitive solicitation was not possible.", "In phase three, the ANC firms\u2019 contracts were modified to expand the  ceiling prices to a total value of $480 million each. When modifying the  contracts, ACA did not comply with a requirement to notify SBA. In  delegating procurement authority under the 8(a) program to DOD, SBA  requires that DOD provide a copy of contracts, including modifications, to  the SBA district office within 15 working days of the date of award or of  contract modification.

As of  December 2005, more than $200 million has been subcontracted under the  Army\u2019s guard contracts.", "The ANC firms have taken different approaches to dividing the workload  with their subcontractors. One divides the workload on an installation  basis, while the second firm decided to share workload by staffing the  gates at each installation partially with its own employees and partially  with the subcontractor\u2019s employees. In the latter case, the guards\u2019 uniform  patches reflect the names of both companies.", "The Army\u2019s contracting officer is responsible for determining whether the  ANC firms are complying with the 50-percent limit on subcontracting, but  this is not being done. The contracting officer told us that the contractors\u2019  proposed approach for complying with the limitation on subcontracting is  reviewed each time additional work is awarded to the ANC firms, but  actual performance is not monitored to ensure compliance. We found  confusion as to who is responsible for the monitoring. The contracting  officer pointed to SBA; the contracting officer representative in IMA  pointed to ACA.

The combined effect of these  weaknesses has put the Army at risk of staffing its gates with contract  security guards who are not qualified for the job and in fact has resulted in  applicants with criminal histories, including felons, being employed as  guards.

One of the guards had an active warrant and  was arrested while performing his duties. The Army found similar  circumstances at another installation in August 2005 with a different  contractor.

The contractor had been responsible for  initiating and submitting these checks between December 2003 and  March 2004, but did not follow through and was out of compliance with  the terms of its contract. In March 2004, it became the responsibility of  installation officials, rather than the contractors, to submit the national  agency checks. However, the officials told us they had not received the  new direction from IMA and thus did not comply with it.

The local agency check is  dependent on full and accurate disclosure on these forms.

The attorney concluded that he was unconvinced that adding  an award fee made good business sense and was in the best interest of the  government. Nevertheless, ACA prepared a written justification for use of  award fees which asserts, among other reasons, that award fees were  needed to motivate the contractors because of the \u201cextremely subjective\u201d  nature of the performance evaluation. The Federal Acquisition Regulation  states that fixed-price contracts, where the contractor\u2019s profit is already  built into the base price, may include award fees to motivate a contractor  when other incentives cannot be used because the contractor\u2019s  performance cannot be measured objectively.

As discussed above, the  contractors are merely required to comply with the basic terms of the  contract, not to perform above and beyond, to earn the fee. The initial  stated intent of having the award fee was that the fee would motivate the  contractors to provide security guards as quickly as possible\u2014within 90  days or fewer of contract award. The award-fee plan was subsequently  modified to remove the 90-day requirement now that guards are in place,  and it now reflects the evaluation criteria outlined in table 5. The Army\u2019s  continued need to use award fees well after the contractors have achieved  full operational capability is unclear. IMA officials said they like the award  fee because it gives them leverage to deal with the contractors and results  in the contractors being more responsive.", "In addition, the ACA contracting officer, who is handling all of the Army\u2019s  guard contracts and task orders, told us she finds the award-fee  administration time-consuming and cumbersome, because she must  modify each task order every 6 months to reflect the award-fee decisions.  We found errors in the administration of the program. For example, in one  incident the contractor was overpaid $47,548, but this administrative error  was not recognized for over a year.
