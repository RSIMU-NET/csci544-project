Studies of the impact of the grants on crime have been inconclusive. GAO was asked to evaluate the effect of the COPS program on the decline in crime during the 1990s. GAO developed and analyzed a database containing annual observations on crime, police officers, COPS funds, and other factors related to crime, covering years prior to and during the COPS program, or from 1990 through 2001. GAO analyzed survey data on policing practices that agencies reportedly implemented and reviewed studies of policing practices. GAO assessed: (1) how COPS obligations were distributed and how much was spent; (2) the extent to which COPS expenditures contributed to increases in the number of police officers and declines in crime nationwide; and (3) the extent to which COPS grants during the 1990s were associated with policing practices that crime literature indicates could be effective. In commenting on a draft of this report, the COPS Office said that our findings are important and support conclusions reached by others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["About half of the COPS funds distributed from 1994 through 2001 went to law enforcement agencies in localities of fewer than 150,000 persons and the remainder to agencies in larger communities. This distribution roughly corresponded to the distribution of major property crimes but less so to the distribution of violent crimes. For example, agencies in larger communities received about 47 percent of COPS funds but accounted for 58 percent of the violent crimes nationwide. From 1994 through 2001, COPS expenditures constituted about 1 percent of total local expenditures for police services. For the years 1994 through 2001, expenditures of COPS grants by grant recipients resulted in varying amounts of additional officers above the levels that would have been expected without the expenditures. For example, during 2000, the peak year of COPS expenditures by grant recipients, they led to an increase of about 3 percent in the level of sworn officers--or about 17,000 officers. Adding up the number of additional officers in each year from 1994 through 2001, GAO estimated that COPS expenditures yielded about 88,000 additional officer-years. GAO obtained its results from fixed-effects regression models that controlled for pre-1994 trends in the growth rate of officers, other federal expenditures, and local- and state-level factors that could affect officer levels. From its analysis of the effects of increases in officers on declines in crime, GAO estimated that COPS funds contributed to declines in the crime rate that, while modest in size, varied over time and among categories of crime. For example, between 1993 and 2000, COPS funds contributed to a 1.3 percent decline in the overall crime rate and a 2.5 percent decline in the violent crime rate from the 1993 levels. The effects of COPS funds on crime held when GAO controlled for other crime-related factors--such as local economic conditions and state-level policy changes--in its regression models, and the effects were commensurate with COPS funds' contribution to local spending on police protection. Factors other than COPS funds accounted for the majority of the decline in crime during this period. For example, between 1993 and 2000, the overall crime rate declined by 26 percent, and the 1.3 percent decline due to COPS, amounted to about 5 percent of the overall decline. Similarly, COPS contributed about 7 percent of the 32 percent decline in violent crime from 1993 to 2000. From 1993 though 1997, agencies that received and spent COPS grants reported larger changes in policing practices and in the subsets of practices that focus on solving crime problems or focus on places where crime is concentrated than did agencies that did not receive the grants. The differences held after GAO controlled for underlying trends in the reported use of these policing practices. From 1996 to 2000, there was no overall increase in policing practices associated with COPS grants. In its review of studies on policing practices, GAO found that problem-solving and place-oriented practices can be effective in reducing crime."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Provisions of the Public Safety Partnership and Community Policing Act of  1994, Title 1 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of  1994 (VCCLEA), authorized appropriations of $8.8 billion for fiscal years  1995 through 2000 for grants to states and local communities to increase  the hiring and deployment of community police officers and to promote  nationwide the concept of community policing\u2014an approach to policing  that involves the cooperation of law enforcement and community  residents in identifying and developing solutions to crime problems\u2014as an  effective strategy to improve public safety.  To administer the grants, in  October 1994, the Attorney General created the Office of Community  Oriented Policing Services (COPS).", "According to its Director, the COPS Office was responsible for \u201cone of the  greatest infusions of resources into local law enforcement in our nation\u2019s  history,\u201d and in a report to Congress the former Attorney General linked  increases in COPS-funded officers to declines in crime. By the summer of  2000, the former Attorney General reported, the COPS Office had awarded  more than $7.6 billion in grants to more than 12,000 local law enforcement  agencies\u2014primarily municipal, state, and county police and sheriff\u2019s  departments whose officers have general arrest powers\u2014and funded over  105,000 community policing officers.  The report claimed that the funded  officers led to an increase in the number of police officers that was well  above what would have been expected in the absence of the passage of  VCCLEA, and it cited research that showed that increased police presence  led to reductions in crime. As evidence that these officers led to  reductions in crime, the report showed that the average number of violent  crimes per police department declined as the number of COPS-funded  officers increased.", "A study funded by the COPS Office and released in 2001, which attempted  to control for some of the other factors that could influence crime rates  and also be correlated with the distribution of COPS funds, concluded that  COPS grants contributed to the reduction in crime in the 1990s. You  previously asked us to review this study, and we reported that its  methodological limitations were such that the study\u2019s results should be  viewed as inconclusive.", "In response to our assessment of the results of the study that we reviewed,  you asked us to undertake an independent evaluation of the impact of  COPS grants on the decline in crime that occurred during the 1990s. This  report provides results from our evaluation of interrelated questions about  COPS funds, officers, crime, and policing practices. Specifically, regarding  COPS funds: (1) From 1994 through 2001, how were COPS obligations  distributed among local law enforcement agencies in relation to the  populations they served and crimes in their jurisdictions, and how much of  the obligated amounts did agencies spend?  Regarding officers and crime:  (2) To what extent did COPS grants contribute to increases in the number  of sworn officers and declines in crime in the nation during the 1990s?  Regarding policing practices: (3) To what extent were COPS grants during  the 1990s associated with police departments adopting policing practices  that the crime literature indicates could contribute to reductions in crime?", "To address our reporting objectives, we created and analyzed a database  consisting of 12 years of data on local law enforcement agencies for the  years 1990 through 2001. We included data from the Department of  Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Office of Justice Programs (OJP) on federal law  enforcement grant obligations and expenditures (including COPS grants);  the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting  (UCR) Program on crime and sworn officers; the Department of  Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Economic Analysis on local economic conditions  such as employment rates and per capita income; and the National Center  for Health Statistics and U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s estimates of demographic  characteristics of local populations\u2014such as their age, race, and gender  composition. The UCR crime data that we used are data on crimes  reported to or known by the police and reported to the UCR Program. The  crimes in the UCR are based on the FBI\u2019s crime index. The index crimes  include the violent crimes of murder and non-negligent manslaughter,  forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault as well as the property  crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. The FBI  reports that there is limited reporting of arson offenses to the UCR  Program by law enforcement agencies. We therefore excluded arson  crimes from our analysis.", "Prior to developing and using the database to address our objectives, we  assessed the reliability of each data source, and in preparing this report,  we used only the data that we found to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. We also assessed possible biases in our estimates  of the effects of COPS funds on crime arising from our use of UCR data on  reported crimes. We concluded from our analysis that our estimates of the  impacts of COPS funds are likely to understate the effect of COPS funds  on crime. (See app. I for a more detailed discussion of our approach,  methods, and database construction.)", "To describe how COPS grant funds were distributed and spent, we  analyzed data on COPS obligations to and expenditures by local law  enforcement agencies, comparing them with several characteristics of the  agencies that received COPS funds, such as population size and crime  levels.", "To assess the possible relationships between COPS expenditures and  changes in the number of officers and rates of crime, we analyzed data on  the agencies that reported complete crime and officer data for at least 1  year from 1990 through 2001 using a two-stage regression model of these  relationships. In the first stage, we estimated the relationship between the  variation in the timing and amount of agencies\u2019 expenditures on COPS  grants that were for hiring officers and changes in the number of officers.  In the second stage, we estimated the relationship between changes in  COPS expenditures and changes in crime rates using fixed-effects  regression models. We used the results from these two sets of regressions  to calculate the amount of the change in crime (from the second stage)  due to changes in officers (from the first stage). As the relationship  between officer levels and crime rates may reflect a complex causal  relationship, we used COPS hiring grants as a statistical instrument to help  to identify the relationship between officers and crime. In both sets of  regression models, we used agency and year fixed effects to control for  unobserved sources of variation among agencies (within a given year) and  within agencies (over time). We also included variables to measure  agencies\u2019 pre-1994 trends in the growth of crime rates and officers. These  controls allowed us to compare agencies that had similar, pre-COPS trends  in these variables, thereby reducing further the differences among  agencies that are not due to COPS expenditures. To control for economic  factors that may be related to crime\u2014such as employment and income\u2014 we included measures of local economic conditions, and to control for  changes in the composition of local populations that could be correlated  with crime, we included measures of age and race composition of local  populations. Finally, to control for changes in state-level practices that  could affect crime rates, such as changes in state incarceration rates or  state sentencing policy, we included state-by-year fixed effects in our  regression models. (See app. VI for additional details about our regression  models.)", "To address the relationship between COPS grants and changes in policing  practices, we analyzed data from two surveys of nationally representative  samples of local law enforcement agencies on policing practices that they  reportedly implemented in various years from 1993 to 2000. The first  survey\u2014the Policing Strategies Survey\u2014was administered in 1993 and  1997 to provide information on the development and implementation of  community policing. The second survey\u2014the National Evaluation of  COPS Survey\u2014was administered in 1996 and 2000. We identified and  analyzed practices that are associated with problem-solving, place- oriented approaches to policing, community collaboration efforts, and the  use of crime analysis. We assessed changes in the levels of reported  practices between agencies that spent COPS grants over particular periods  with those that did not receive or spend COPS grant funds. To control for  the underlying trends in reported policing practices, we estimated fixed- effects regression models of the effects of COPS grants expenditures on  changes in reported policing practices.  To assess the possible relationship  between policing practices and crime, we analyzed systematic reviews of  the effectiveness of policing practices in reducing crime to identify the  types of policing practices that have been judged to be effective in  preventing crime. (See app. VII for details about the surveys and our  analytic methods.)", "In addition, we reviewed relevant economic and criminological literatures  that addressed issues related to estimating models of the effects of federal  grant funds on crime rates. We spoke with officials at the Department of  Justice about the operation of the COPS program, and we also spoke with  researchers about our approach and methods. We reviewed our approach  and methods with a group of experts in the field of policing and crime. The  group consisted of criminologists, economists, statisticians, and criminal  justice practitioners, and was convened for us by the National Research  Council of the National Academies to enable participants to offer their  individual views as experts in the field.", "We conducted our work between January 2004 and August 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Established in October 1994 by the Attorney General to implement the  administration of community policing grants under VCCLEA, the Office of  Community Oriented Policing Services announced it first grant programs  in 1994. Prior to its establishment, in December 1993 the Department of  Justice awarded community policing grants to hire officers under the  Police Hiring Supplement.", "The COPS Office distributed grants in a variety of program funding  categories. Hiring grants, which required agencies to hire new officers and  at the same time to indicate the types of community policing strategies  that they intended to implement with the grants, was the largest COPS  grant program category in terms of the amounts of grant funds obligated.  The hiring grants paid a maximum of $75,000 per officer over a 3-year  period (or at most 75 percent of an officer\u2019s salary) and generally required  that local agencies cover the remaining salary and benefits with state or  local funds. From 1994 through 2001, more than $4.8 billion in COPS  obligations (or about 64 percent of COPS obligations over this period)  were in the form of hiring grants. The Making Officer Redeployment  Effective (MORE) grant program, which provided funds to law  enforcement agencies to purchase equipment, hire civilians, and redeploy  existing officers to community policing was the second largest COPS grant  program, obligating more than $1.2 billion. Additional COPS grant  programs provided funds for specific innovations in policing and for a  variety of other purposes.", "Each year the COPS Office was required to distribute half of the grant  funds to agencies in communities whose populations exceeded 150,000  persons and half of the grant funds to agencies in communities with  populations of 150,000 or fewer persons.", "In the applications for hiring grants, the COPS Office requested agencies to  indicate the types of community policing practices that they planned to  implement with their grants. The various practices related to community  policing included practices such as identifying crime problems by looking  at records of crime trends and analyzing repeat calls for service, working  with other public agencies to solve disorder problems, locating offices or  stations within neighborhoods, and collaborating with community  residents by increasing officer contact with citizens and improving citizen  feedback. These types of policing practices also corresponded with  general approaches to policing. For example, problem-solving policing  practices may rely on crime analysis tools to help to identify crime  problems and develop solutions to them.  Place-oriented practices attempt  to identify locations where crime occurs repeatedly and to implement  procedures to disrupt these recurrences of crime. By collaborating with  community residents, agencies attempt to improve citizen feedback about  crime problems and effectiveness of policing to address these problems.", "In 2000, DOJ reported that COPS-funded officers helped to reduce crime  and reported that the drop in crime that occurred after 1994 was more  than what would have been expected in the absence of the passage of  VCCLEA and the creation of the COPS Office. The report suggested that  COPS had achieved its goal of funding 100,000 officers, and through  increases in officers and the practice of community policing, the COPS  program was credited with reducing crime. However, while COPS may  have funded 100,000 officers, it was not apparent that the funded officers  had resulted in new officers having been hired. Researchers at the Urban  Institute reported in 2000, for example, their estimates that by 2003, the  COPS program would have raised the level of police on the street by the  equivalent of 62,700 to 83,900 full-time equivalent officers. They also  indicated that it was unclear whether the program would ever increase the  number of officers on the street at a single time by 100,000.", "The COPS Office-funded study of the effect of COPS grants on crime in  over 6,000 communities from 1995 through 1999 that had received COPS  grants concluded that COPS grants were effective in reducing crime. The  study also reported that COPS grants that encouraged agencies to  implement a variety of innovative strategies to improve public safety had  larger impacts on reducing violent and property crime than did other  COPS grant types. However, a study released by the Heritage Foundation,  which was based upon an analysis of county-level data, was unable to  replicate the findings of the COPS Office-funded study.  Specifically, the  Heritage study found no effect of COPS hiring grants on crime rates, but it  did find that the COPS grants for specific problems\u2014such as gangs,  domestic violence, and illegal use of firearms by youth\u2014were associated  with reductions in crime. In addition, we questioned whether the sizes of  the effects of COPS grants on crime that were reported in the COPS  Office-funded study were large enough to be significant in a practical  sense and whether they could accurately represent the expected returns  on the investment of billions of dollars.", "Assessing the contribution of COPS funds to the decline in crime during  the 1990s presents challenges for evaluators. Nationwide, crime rates  began to decline in about 1991, before the COPS program announced its  first grant programs in 1994 (fig. 1). Hence the factors other than COPS  grants that were responsible for precipitating the decline in crime could  have continued to influence its decline throughout the 1990s. Researchers  have pointed to a number of factors that could have precipitated the  decline in crime, including increased use of prison as a punishment for  violent crimes, improved economic conditions, and the subsiding of  violence that accompanied the expansion of drug markets. To the extent  that any of these factors are correlated with the distribution of COPS  grants, they could be responsible for impacts that have been attributed to  COPS grants.", "Prior studies of the impact of COPS grants on crime have correlated COPS  funds with crime rates, controlling for other factors that could influence  crime rates. The authors of the prior studies describe various mechanisms  by which COPS grants may affect crime, but their statistical models do not  explicitly take these mechanisms into account in estimating the effects of  the grants. By identifying and explicitly modeling mechanisms through  which COPS funds could affect crimes\u2014such as increasing the number of  sworn officers on the street who are available for patrolling places or  contributing to changes in policing practices that may be effective in  preventing crime\u2014the possibility of a spurious relationship between inputs  (such as COPS funds) and outcomes (such as crime) can be minimized.  (For additional background information, see app. II.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis showed that from 1994 through 2001, COPS obligated more  than $7.32 billion to 10,680 agencies for which we were able to link Office  of Justice Programs financial data on COPS obligations to the records of  law enforcement agencies. About $4.7 billion (or 64 percent) of these  obligations were in the form of hiring grants.  About half of these funds  went to agencies serving populations of 150,000 or fewer persons and  about half was distributed to agencies serving populations of more than  150,000 persons. This distribution roughly corresponds to the distribution  of index crimes across the two size categories of jurisdictions. However, in  relation to violent crimes, the share of COPS funds distributed to larger  jurisdictions was smaller than the share of violent crimes that they  contributed to the national total. For example, agencies serving  populations of more than 150,000 persons contributed about 58 percent of  all violent crimes reported to the UCR during this time period while  receiving about half of all COPS funds. To be specific, the smallest  agencies\u2014those serving populations of fewer than 10,000 persons\u2014 received an average of $1,573 per violent crime reported to UCR. Agencies  serving populations of more than 150,000 persons received about $418 in  COPS funds per violent crime.", "By the end of 2001, the COPS grantee agencies in our sample had spent  about $5 billion (or 68 percent of the $7.3 billion obligated to them) from  1994 through 2001. Annually, the total amount of COPS expenditures made  by grantees increased each year from 1994 until 2000, and then declined,  while the number of agencies that drew down COPS funds peaked in 1998  at about 7,600 and declined to about 6,000 in 2001. From 1994 through  2001, a total of about 10,300 agencies spent COPS funds.  The maximum  number of agencies spending funds in any given year occurred during  1998, when about 7,600 agencies spent funds. From 1998 through 2000, the  amount of COPS expenditures per person in the jurisdiction served by an  agency increased from about $4 to about $4.80. COPS expenditures  amounted to an annual average of about 1 percent of total expenditures  for police services by local law enforcement agencies from 1994 through  2001.  This contribution varied by year.  For example, in 1999 and 2000,  COPS expenditures were about 1.5 percent of total local police  expenditures. (See app. III for a further discussion of COPS obligations  and expenditures.)", "For the years 1994 through 2001, we infer from our estimates that COPS  hiring grant expenditures contributed to increases in sworn officer levels  above the levels that would have been expected without these funds. The  additional number of sworn officers stemming from these funds varied  over the years, and it increased from 1994 though 2000 and declined in  2001 (fig. 2). For example, for 1997 we estimate that COPS funds  contributed about 14,000 additional officers in that year\u2014or about 2.4  percent of the total number of sworn officers nationwide\u2014and for 2000,  COPS funds contributed about 17,000 additional officers\u2014or about 3  percent of the total number of sworn officers nationwide. For all years  from 1994 through 2001, we estimate that COPS expenditures paid for a  total of about 88,000 additional officer-years over this entire period, where  the total number of officer-years equals the sum of the number of officers  due to COPS grant expenditures in each year. An officer-year refers to the  number of officers in a given year that we could attribute to COPS  expenditures, and the additional officers in a given year attributable to  COPS expenditures represent a net addition to the stock of sworn  officers. Using the results from our regression estimates of the effects of  COPS expenditures on the level of sworn officers, we set the values for  COPS expenditures to zero to predict the level of officers absent COPS  funds. The difference between this number and the actual number of  sworn officers yields the number of officers due to COPS expenditures.  Our analysis also shows that apart from the COPS hiring and COPS MORE  grants, other COPS grant types did not have a significant effect on officer  strength. (See app. IV for more detailed information about the results of  our analysis of COPS expenditures on officers.)", "We estimate that the COPS grant expenditures contributed to the  reduction in crime in the 1990s independently of other factors that we  were able to take into account in our analysis. Other factors that could  have contributed to the reduction in crimes in the 1990s that we took into  account included federal law enforcement expenditures other than COPS  grants, local economic conditions and changes in population composition,  and changes in state-level policies and practices that could be correlated  with crime, such as incarceration and sentencing policy. Specifically, from  our model of the effect of changes in sworn officers on crime, we estimate  that a 1 percent increase in the number of sworn officers per capita would  lead to a 0.4 percent reduction in the total number of index crimes.  Through their effects on changes in officers in a given year, COPS  expenditures led to varying amounts of declines in crime rates over the  years from 1994 through 2001. For example, the 2.4 percent increase in  sworn officers due to COPS expenditures in 1997 was responsible for  about a 1.1 percent decline in the total index crime rate from 1993 to 1997,  while the roughly 3 percent increase in officers due to COPS expenditures  in 2000 was responsible for about 1.3 percent decline in the total index  crime rate from 1993 to 2000.  Put into another context, the total crime  rate declined from 5,904 per 100,000 persons in 1993 to 4,367 per 100,000  persons in 2000, or by about 26 percent. Of this 26 percent drop, we  attribute about 5 percent to the effect of COPS.  From our analysis of  violent crimes, we estimated that declines in the violent crime rate due to  COPS expenditures also varied with the level of officers due to COPS  funds. The declines in violent crime rates attributable to COPS increased  from about 2 percent in 1997 to 2.5 percent in 2000, where both of the  amounts of decline attributable to COPS expenditures are based upon  comparisons with the 1993 violent crime rate (fig. 3). We further estimate  that at its peak in 1998, COPS accounted for about a 1.2 percent decline in  the property crime rate.", "Our estimates of the impacts of COPS expenditures on the broad  categories of crime are supported by our findings from our crime-type- specific regression models. We find significant reductions due to COPS  expenditures for the crimes of murder and non-negligent manslaughter,  robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, and motor vehicle theft. Our  analysis of larceny indicates that while the relationship between COPS  funds and larceny is a negative one, it is not statistically significant, nor is  the effect of COPS on rape statistically significant. Further, we estimated  the effects of COPS grants on the total crime rate under various  assumptions about lags between the receipt of COPS grants and  expenditures of COPS funds. The estimates for the amount of the decline  in the total crime rate that we report here\u2014for example, the 1.3 percent of  the decline in crime from 1993 to 2000\u2014are among the smallest effects  that we estimated from our various models.  Under different assumptions  about lags associated with COPS expenditures, the amount attributable to  COPS could be as high as 3.2 percent.  Interestingly, the 1.3 percent  decline in the index crime rate that we attribute to COPS expenditures in  2000 is on the same order of magnitude as the contribution of COPS  expenditures to total local spending on police.  In 2000, for example, COPS  expenditures accounted for about 1.5 percent of total local police  expenditures. We further find that factors other than COPS expenditures  account for the majority of the decline in the crime rate. (See app. IV for  more detailed information about the results of our analysis of COPS  expenditures on crime.)", "Our regression analysis of the Policing Strategies Survey data for 1993 and  1997 indicate that receipt of a COPS grant and the amount of per capita  COPS expenditures by agencies were associated with increases in the  agencies\u2019 reported use of problem-solving and place-oriented policing  practices but not crime analysis and community collaboration policing  practices (fig.4). According to our review studies of the effectiveness of  policing practices, problem-solving and place-oriented practices are  among those that the crime literature indicates may be effective in  reducing crime. With problem-solving practices, police focus on specific  problems and tailor their strategies to them. Place-oriented practices  include efforts to identify the locations where crime repeatedly occurs and  to implement procedures to disrupt these recurrences of crime. Crime  analysis includes the use of tools such as geographic information systems  to identify crime patterns. Community collaboration includes attempts to  improve or enhance citizen feedback about crime problems and the  effectiveness of policing efforts to address them. In our regressions, we  controlled for the underlying trends in the reported adoption of policing  practices, agency characteristics, and local economic conditions.", "Our analysis of the National Evaluation of COPS Survey\u2014which measured  practices in 1996 and again in 2000\u2014showed that while COPS grantee  agencies increased their reported use of all policing practices combined,  these changes were not statistically significant in regressions that  controlled for the underlying trends in the reported adoption of policing  practices, agency characteristics, and local economic conditions. (See app.  V for more detailed information about the results of our analysis of COPS  expenditures and policing practices.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["While we find that COPS expenditures led to increases in sworn police  officers above levels that would have been expected without these  expenditures and through the increases in sworn officers led to declines in  crime, we conclude that COPS grants were not the major cause of the  decline in crime from 1994 through 2001. Other factors\u2014which other  researchers have attempted to sort out\u2014combined to contribute more to  the reduction in crime than did COPS expenditures. This is not surprising,  as COPS expenditures\u2014while a large federal investment in local law  enforcement\u2014made a comparatively small contribution to local law  enforcement expenditures for policing.", "Nevertheless, our analysis shows that COPS grant expenditures did reduce  crime during the 1990s. Our models isolate the effects of COPS  expenditures from the effects of other factors.  We cannot identify another  variable that is correlated with changes in COPS expenditures, officers,  and crime rates in local communities that would explain away our  findings.  Thus, we conclude that the results of our model are sound.  Further, our results do not address whether the COPS program met its  goals of putting 100,000 officers on the street\u2014and the evidence suggests  that while it funded more than 100,000 officers, it may have fallen short of  achieving this goal.  Still, through the increases in officers that we attribute  to COPS expenditures, we find that COPS grants affected crime rates.  Therefore, as a demonstration of whether a federal program can affect  crime through hiring officers and changing policing practices, the evidence  indicates that COPS contributed to declines in crime above the levels of  declines that would have been expected without it.", "Our work cannot identify an optimum number of officers needed by any  individual agency to maximize the effect of officers on reducing crime, nor  can it identify the specific types of practices that agencies should adopt in  particular settings. It is highly likely that there is indeed a point where  additional officers no longer affect crime. The numbers of additional  officers hired as a result of COPS were relatively small compared with the  sizes of individual police agencies, and these small increases led to  commensurate reductions in crime rates.

By speculating that  agencies may have increased the quantity of a specific activity, the COPS  Office provides only one view of what may have happened.  Another view,  proffered by policing researchers, is that there is little evidence to suggest  that problem-solving policing was implemented with sufficient rigor in  enough departments to have contributed to declines in violent crime  during the 1990s.

We used the  OJP financial data to compute the amount of COPS funds obligated by  COPS grants and the amount expended by local police agencies during the  period from 1994 through 2001. To describe the overall COPS funding  trends by grant type, we analyzed the universe of agencies in the OJP data  that received any federal law enforcement grant during the period from  1990 through 2001, regardless of whether or not the agency received a  COPS grant during the period and regardless of whether we were able to  link the data from these agencies to records in the UCR.

In the first stage, we estimated the  relationship between per capita COPS expenditures and per capita sworn  officer rates in the agencies included in our sample. The per capita  measures were based upon the UCR population for the jurisdiction  covered by an agency. In the second stage, we estimated the relationship  between changes in per capita COPS expenditures and changes in crime  rates per 100,000 persons. As the relationship between officer levels and  crime rates may reflect a complex and interrelated causal relationship, we  used COPS hiring grants as an instrument to help to identify the  relationship between officers and crime. To use COPS hiring grant  expenditures as an instrument for sworn officers, we made use of the fact  that, unlike the purposes of other COPS grant types, the purpose of hiring  grants was limited to hiring officers. Given the number of officers,  variation in hiring grant expenditures should be uncorrelated with other  changes in crime. From our regression results, we calculated the elasticity  of crime with respect to officers or the effect of a 1 percent change in the  levels of officers on the percentage change in crime. To assess the  robustness of our results, we estimated several specifications of our crime  rate regression and calculated the elasticities of crime with respect to  officers for each specification. We estimated these equations separately  for each type of index crime. We compared the range of our estimated  elasticities with those in the published literature on officers and crime.

The number of  agencies that reported complete crime data and served populations of  10,000 or more persons varied over time, as in 1990 about 23 percent of all  agencies in the UCR data that we received from the FBI met these criteria,  and in 2001 about 21 percent did.  However, these agencies also reported  the majority of crimes to the UCR.  From 1990 through 2001, these  agencies reported between 86.8 percent and 88.8 percent of all index  crimes in the UCR data that we received from the FBI.

Given that we included  agencies based on the completeness of their crime data in each year, and  agencies provided complete crime data in different numbers of years over  our 1990 through 2001 analysis period, our models used an unbalanced  panel approach. In all of our models, we expressed expenditures, officers,  and crime in per capita amounts. The fixed-effects models provide  estimates of the amount of change in our dependent variables\u2014the per  capita sworn officer rate and the per capita crime rates\u2014that can be  attributed to changes in the per capita COPS hiring grant expenditures,  controlling for other factors that could also contribute to changes in the  per capita sworn officer rate. Our models included agency and year fixed  effects to control for unobserved differences between agencies and  changes over time within agencies in factors that could contribute to  declines in crime. We introduced state-by-year fixed effects into our  regressions to control for factors occurring at the state level\u2014such as  changes in incarceration or state sentencing practices\u2014that could affect  crime rates. Further, we included in our models variables that classify  each agency in categories based upon their pre-1994 trends in the growth  of officers and crime. These growth cell variables allow us to make  comparisons between agencies that were similar in their pre-COPS  program trends but that varied in the timing and amount of COPS  expenditures. Finally, we included in our models measures of other  federal law enforcement grant programs that also provided funds to state  and local law enforcement agencies for hiring officers and other crime- prevention purposes.

Problem-solving practices call for police to focus on specific  problems and tailor their strategies to the identified problems. Place- oriented practices include attempts to identify the locations where crime  occurs repeatedly and to implement procedures to disrupt these  recurrences of crime. Community collaboration practices include  improving citizen feedback about crime problems and the effectiveness of  policing efforts to address these problems.

If these crime rates diverge, the reported crime  rate would either decline at a faster rate or increase at a slower rate than  the rate for all crimes, and our analysis of the effects of COPS on the  reported crime would reveal either larger declines or smaller increases  than would occur if we had data on the rate for all crimes. A divergence  between the reported crime rate and rate for all crimes could arise for  either or both of two reasons: Citizens do not report all of the crimes they  experience to the police, or the police do not record and send to the UCR  all of the crimes that citizens report to them.", "To assess whether citizens decreased the rate at which they reported  crimes to the police, we reviewed data from the National Crime  Victimization Survey (NCVS). These data are drawn from a nationally  representative sample of households and are gathered independently of  the police agencies that report crime to the UCR. They therefore provide a  measure of crime that is independent of the reporting practices of police  agencies. Respondents in the NCVS are asked about their experiences as  victims of crimes. If respondents were victims of crime, they are asked if  they or others reported the criminal victimization to the police. Using the  NCVS data, it is possible to assess whether the rate at which citizens  report crimes to the police has changed over time. These data show that  during the 1990s, victims generally increased the rate at which they  reported crimes to the police. As figure 5 shows, the decline in violent  crime over the decade was steeper for all crimes reported in the survey  than for the violent crimes reported to the police. Consequently, because  the rates diverged rather than converged, victims\u2019 practices of reporting of  crime to the police during the 1990s are not likely to lead us to  overestimate the effects of COPS grants on the crime rate.", "For police recording practices to lead to overestimates of the effects of  COPS grants on crime, it would be necessary for the agencies that  received COPS grants to decrease the rate at which they recorded and  reported crimes to the UCR. Research on police recording practices  suggests that agencies are unlikely to underreport serious crimes, such as  murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Other studies found,  second, that as police agencies adopt computer technology and become  more sophisticated in recording crimes, they became more likely to  increase the rate at which they included all citizen-reported crimes to the  UCR. As COPS MORE grants provided funds for technology\u2014such as  laptop computers in police cars\u2014that would have increased the level of  sophistication within agencies, COPS grantee agencies would be more  likely to report a larger percentage of the crimes that citizens drew to their  attention. Consequently, changes in police reporting practices that stem  from COPS grants and lead to increases in police reporting of crimes to  the UCR are likely to lead us to underestimate the magnitude of effects of  COPS grants on reducing crime.", "Two other conditions that could affect our estimates include the following:  (1) Criminals who commit the crimes that are not reported to the police  are unresponsive to the effects of COPS expenditures, and (2) as the  number of police increase, the number of reported crimes increases,  independently of the true crime rate.", "If criminals who commit crimes that go unreported to the police are  unresponsive to police presence, then we would overestimate the effects  of COPS on crime only if criminals changed their behavior to victimize  more persons who would be unlikely to report crimes to the police. This  appears to be an unlikely occurrence, as the NCVS data show a  convergence between the total number of criminal victimizations,  especially for violent crimes, and the number of crimes reported to the  police.", "Second, if the size of the police force systematically affects the willingness  of victims to report crime to the police or a police department\u2019s likelihood  of recording and reporting to the UCR crime victims\u2019 reports, then these  changes could lead to biased estimates of the impact on the crime rate.  However, if changes in reporting behaviors occurred as the result of the  COPS program, the likely impact on our estimates of the effect of COPS  grants on crime through their effects on the number of officers is that we  would underestimate the effects of the grants on crime.", "Given these considerations, our analysis of the effects of COPS  expenditures on crime is more likely to underestimate than overestimate  the effect of COPS funds on changes in the true crime rate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Background on the COPS Program and Studies of the Impacts of COPS Grants on Crime", "paragraphs": ["Established in October 1994 by the Attorney General to implement the  administration of community policing grants under the Violent Crime  Control and Law Enforcement Act (VCCLEA) of 1994, the Office of  Community Oriented Policing Services announced its first grant program  in November 1994. Prior to its establishment, in December 1993 the  Department of Justice began making community policing grants to state  and local law enforcement agencies that the COPS Office monitored. In  1993, DOJ awarded community policing grants under the Police Hiring  Supplement Program, which was established by the Supplemental  Appropriations Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-50 (1993)).

The largest amount of COPS grant funds obligated\u2014about $4.8 billion, or  64 percent of the total\u2014was in the form of hiring grants. These grants  required agencies to hire new officers and at the same time to indicate the  types of community policing strategies that they intended to implement.  Hiring grants paid a maximum of $75,000 per officer over a 3-year period  (or at most 75 percent of an officer\u2019s salary) and generally required that  local agencies cover the remaining salary and benefits with state or local  funds. Hiring programs authorized under VCCLEA and administered by the  COPS Office included the Phase I program, which funded qualified  applicants who had applied for the Police Hiring Supplement but were  denied because of the limited funds available; COPS AHEAD (Accelerated  Hiring, Education, and Deployment) for municipalities with populations  50,000 and above; and COPS FAST (Funding Accelerated for Smaller  Towns) for towns with populations below 50,000. In June 1995, Phase I,  COPS AHEAD, and COPS FAST were replaced by the Universal Hiring  Program.", "The next largest grant category was the Making Officer Redeployment  Effective (MORE) grant program, which provided funds to law  enforcement agencies to purchase equipment and hire civilians, with the  goal of expanding the amount of time spent on community policing. COPS  obligated more than $1.3 billion\u2014or about 17 percent of total  obligations\u2014as MORE grants. Additional COPS grant programs provided  funds for specific innovations in policing. For example, the Distressed  Neighborhoods Pilot Project grants provided funds to communities with  high levels of crime or economic distress to hire officers and implement a  variety of strategies to improve public safety, and the Methamphetamine  Initiative provided funds to state and local agencies to support a variety of  enforcement, intervention, and prevention efforts to combat the  methamphetamine problem. About $418 million\u2014or about 5.5 percent of  the total\u2014was obligated under these innovative grant programs.

According to our analysis of  data that we obtained from OJP, from 1990 through 2001, the Byrne  Formula Grant Program distributed between $415 million and $520 million  in grants. States were required to pass through to local jurisdictions  amounts of funding based upon a variable pass-through formula.

However, a research report by the Heritage  Foundation questioned how effective the COPS Office had been in putting  100,000 officers on the street. The study analyzed trends in the number of  officers and concluded that the COPS program had not added 100,000  additional officers above historic trends. In its review of the COPS Office\u2019s  performance for the fiscal year 2004 budget, the Office for Management  and Budget (OMB) indicated that by 2002, COPS grants funding was  sufficient for almost 117,000 officers, a number that exceeded the  program\u2019s original commitment to fund 100,000 officers. At the same  time, OMB acknowledged that fewer than 90,000 officers had been hired or  redeployed to the street.

They further estimated that the permanent impact of COPS, after  taking into account postgrant attrition of officers and civilians, would be  between 69,100 and 92,200 officers.", "In addition to promoting the hiring of officers, the COPS Office sought to  promote community policing. COPS hiring grant applications asked  agencies to report the types of practices that they planned to implement  with their grants, such as identifying crime problems by looking at records  of crime trends and analyzing repeat calls for service, working with other  public agencies to solve disorder problems, locating offices or stations  within neighborhoods, and collaborating with community residents by  increasing officer contact with citizens and improving citizen feedback. In  2000, the Attorney General reported that 87 percent of the country was  served by departments that practiced community policing.", "Studies that have addressed the extent to which the COPS Office grants  caused the spread of community policing suggest that COPS grants  accelerated the adoption of these practices but did not launch the spread  of community policing. The Police Foundation\u2019s study of community  policing practices during 1993\u20141 year before the COPS Office began  making grants\u2014indicated that the practice of community policing was  fairly widespread, especially in larger police departments. The Police  Foundation researcher reported that 47 percent of the agencies surveyed  in 1993 reported that they either were in the process of adopting or had  adopted community policing, but that 86 percent of municipal agencies  with more than 100 sworn personnel were either in the process of  implementing or had implemented community policing. In their evaluation  of the implementation of the COPS program, Urban Institute researchers  credited COPS with promoting community policing, but the researchers  concluded that COPS funds seemed to have fueled movements that were  already accelerating rather than have caused the acceleration. In a later  report, they pointed out that for large agencies, the problem-solving  practices that they examined were already widespread by 1995, and almost  no COPS grantees reported adopting problem-solving practices for the  first time between 1998 and 2000.", "Some of the types of practices that agencies planned to implement with  their COPS grants correspond with approaches to policing that recent  reviews of policing practice suggest are effective in preventing crime.   For example, our review of policing practices indicates that problem- solving policing and place-oriented policing practices\u2014such as those in  which officers attempt to identify the locations where crime occurs  repeatedly and to implement procedures to affect crime\u2014are among the  types of practices that research has demonstrated to be effective in  preventing crime.

Analyzing changes in crime rates in communities that had  received COPS grants, the study concluded that COPS hiring grants were  effective in reducing crime and that COPS grants for innovative policing  practices had larger impacts on reducing violent and property crime than  did other types of COPS grants. However, a study released by the Heritage  Foundation, which was based upon the analysis of county-level data, was  unable to replicate the findings of the COPS-funded study.

Factors such as a downturn in handgun violence, the  expansion of imprisonment, a steady decline in adult violence, changes in  drug markets, and expanding economic opportunities are among those  suggested as related to the decline in crime\u2014especially violent crime\u2014in  the 1990s. To the extent that these factors also are correlated with the  disbursement of COPS funds, this increases the challenges involved in  isolating the effects of COPS grants.", "Other federal funds for local law enforcement could also have contributed  to expanding the number of police officers and contributed to declines in  crime. If the distribution of non-COPS funds such as LLEBG and Byrne  grants is correlated with that of COPS funds, and if research does not take  these funds into account, a study could attribute some of the effect on  crime of these other grant funds to COPS grants.", "COPS grants were distributed in ways that make rigorous evaluations of  their causal impacts difficult to implement. Receipt of a COPS grant was  not randomly assigned; therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the  agencies that received grants are the same ones that, in the absence of the  grant, would have experienced reductions in crime. The amount of funding  certain agencies receive may also relate to the agency\u2019s ability to combat  crime. For example, certain police chiefs may be more capable than others  at acquiring funds and also more up-to-date on policing methods.  This  underlying capacity of an agency to organize policing, rather than the  receipt of a particular grant, would then be the cause of a crime decline as  opposed to a particular grant. Additionally, COPS grants were fairly  widespread throughout police departments and the nation as a whole. This  distribution of grants leaves relatively few unfunded agencies to serve as  comparison groups against which to assess the performance of the  agencies that received COPS grants. The roughly 12,000 agencies that the  former Attorney General reported received COPS grants by 2000 represent  about 61 percent of the agencies that reported crime to the Uniform Crime  Reports.", "The mechanisms by which COPS funds could affect crime have not been  explicitly examined. For example, the two prior studies that we cited did  not examine whether COPS grants potentially affect crime through  changes in police officers or through changes in policing practices, both of  which may have been affected by COPS funds. Additional officers may  affect crime by increasing police presence, by increasing arrests that lead  to incapacitation of offenders, or by deterring offenders by increasing the  likelihood of capture. Changes in policing practices toward problem- solving or place-oriented practices that focus police resources on  recurring crime problems could also lead to reductions in crime.", "Appropriate methodologies from research on crime have been developed  to address issues that could confound efforts to assess the impacts of  COPS grants on crime rates. For example, if COPS grants are to affect  crime through their impacts on the number of officers, then isolating the  effects of increases in officers on crime presents a challenge in assessing  the direction of the relationship between officers and crime. If additional  officers are hired in response to increases in crime rates, then it could  appear that crime causes officers. Alternatively, if additional officers lead  to reductions in crime below the levels that they would have been without  the officers, then it would appear that officers caused changes in crime. To  isolate the causal effect of COPS grants, researchers employ the use of  instruments for causal variables. One suggestion in the research literature  for an instrument for police officers is COPS hiring grants. To the extent  that COPS hiring grants buy only officers, COPS hiring grants can be used  as an instrument for the actual number of police officers and therefore be  used to estimate the relationship between crime and police officers in a  way that takes into account the possibility of this simultaneous  relationship.", "Second, particular forms of statistical models take advantage of  information about the variation in the amount and timing of COPS grants  among agencies to assess how changes in the number of sworn officers  and crime rates are associated with these two sources of variation. These  fixed-effects regression models use a panel of data\u2014or repeated  observations on the same units, in this case, police agencies, over several  time periods\u2014to assess the effects of changes in the number of sworn  officers and crime rates that are associated with variation in the timing  and amount of COPS grant expenditures. These regression methods also  allow for the introduction of controls for unobserved preexisting  differences between units (agencies) and differences over time within  units. Incorporating each agency\u2019s underlying trajectories (or growth rate  trends) in crime rates and sworn officers into the modeling of the effects  of COPS funds allow for explicit comparisons within groups of agencies  sharing similar trajectories, which helps to control for potential biases  associated with preexisting trends. By identifying and explicitly modeling  the mechanisms through which a program could have its effects\u2014such as  COPS funds leading to increases in the number of officers and their effects  on crime\u2014the possibility of a spurious relationship between inputs (such  as COPS funds) and outcomes (such as crime) can be minimized."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: COPS Grant Obligation and Expenditure Patterns", "paragraphs": ["This appendix addresses how COPS obligations were distributed among  local law enforcement agencies in relation to the populations they served  and the crimes in their jurisdictions.

The increase and  decrease in the number of officers due to COPS followed the pattern of  COPS expenditures, which peaked in 2000 and then declined (see fig. 7 in  app. III). Adding up the number of officers due to COPS in each year  across the years from 1994 through 2001, we arrive at a total of about  88,000 sworn officer-years due to COPS expenditures.", "From 1997 through 2000, when COPS expenditures neared or exceeded $1  billion per year, we estimated that the expenditures led to increases in  sworn officers of between 2.4 percent and 2.9 percent above levels  expected without them.

Therefore, our estimate of the total number  of officer-years arising from COPS expenditures is not equivalent to the  number of officers that the COPS Office reportedly funded, nor does it  represent an estimate of the total number of officers as a result of COPS  grants.

The amounts of  decline in crime rates varied among crime types and across years. The  variation in the decline in crime rates in various crime types arose from  our estimates of the effects of changes in officers on crime rates, and the  variation over time within crime types arose from the variation in COPS  expenditures. For example, for the total crime rate, we found that the  impact of COPS peaked in 1998, as for that year, we estimated that COPS  led to a reduction in the total crime rate of almost 1.4 percent from the  level of crime in 1993. From 1999 and 2000, COPS expenditures of between  $920 million and about $1 billion led to reductions in the total crime rate of  about 1.3 percent, again, as compared with the 1993 level. In years prior to  1998 and in 2001, when COPS expenditures were lower than their levels in  1998 through 2000, the declines in total crime arising from COPS  expenditures also were less than 1.3 percent (table 10).", "Similarly, for violent and property crimes, we found that the amount of  decline associated with COPS expenditures varied from year to year, and  for both of these crime categories, the largest decline in crime occurred  during 1998. COPS expenditures led to a decline in violent crime of almost  2.6 percent in 1998, compared with violent crime levels in 1993. For 1999  and 2000, COPS expenditures led to about a reduction of about 2.4 percent  in violent crime, from the 1993 level. For property crimes, the impact of  COPS expenditures from 1998 through 2000 was between 1.1 percent and  1.2 percent, as compared to the 1993 level (table 10).", "Our estimates of the impact of COPS expenditures on crime through their  effects on the number of officers represent the effects of COPS  expenditures on crime net of the effects of other factors that we controlled  for in our model\u2014including changes in economic conditions, population  composition, and pre-COPS program trends in police agencies\u2019 growth rate  of sworn officers and growth rate in crime. By controlling for pre-COPS  program growth rates in officers and crime, we made comparisons  between agencies within population size categories that had similar  growth rates in officers and crime but which differed on the timing and  amount of COPS expenditures.

In another  paper that used electoral cycles to estimate the effect of increases in  officers on crime, the author provides a set of elasticities under different  model specifications. The elasticity for property crimes was calculated to  be about \u20130.3, and the elasticity for violent crimes was about \u20131.0.

The magnitude of the effects tended to  increase with the size of agencies, where agency size refers to the  population served by the agency. In general, as the size of agencies  increased, we found that the impact of COPS expenditures on the total  crime rate also increased.

From the various specifications, we estimated the elasticity of  crime with respect to officers. We found that the elasticity for total crimes  ranged from \u20130.41 to \u20130.95. The elasticity that we used to calculate the  impact of COPS on the decline in index crimes was \u20130.42, which is at the  lower end of the range of elasticities that we estimated.

Also, under the varying assumptions about how COPS expenditures are  related to crime, we estimated elasticities of violent crimes with respect to  officers and elasticities of property crimes with respect to officers. For  violent crimes, the elasticities derived from these regressions ranged from  \u20130.76 to \u20131.8. The elasticity that we used to estimate the impact of COPS  on the decline in violent crimes was \u20130.8.

This issue revolves around determining how to disentangle the  relationship between the number of police officers and crime, as  municipalities having higher crime rates generally also have more officers.  For example, Detroit has twice as many police per capita as Omaha and  four times the violent crime rate, but it would be incorrect to conclude  that the additional officers in Detroit were the cause of its higher crime  rate than Omaha\u2019s. By simply comparing a municipality\u2019s police force and  crime rate to those in other municipalities, one would incorrectly infer  that Detroit\u2019s higher crime rate was caused by its additional police  officers.", "Repeated observations on crime and police in a locality lead to a more  robust research design by controlling for the time-invariant differences in  rates of crime and police between areas. This is done by introducing fixed  effects into regression models. Using this approach, the question that the  analysis attempts to address becomes: Do we see the crime rate fall as the  number of police rises? By controlling for the \u201cbaseline\u201d crime rates in  different areas, some researchers have estimated a negative relationship  between police and crime.", "However, if the rise in the number of police in a locality is a response to  increasing crime rates, including fixed effects does not resolve the issue of  reverse causality raised by the Detroit example. A next step is to introduce  an instrument\u2014for example, a variable that affects the size of the police  force but that, given this size, does not affect crime. In one study, the  researcher made use of the fact that the size of a police force increases  before an election.

For example, we learn very little  about how agencies operate. If agencies were to use the additional officers  to employ different police tactics, and were able to reduce crime, we  would be unable to say whether it was the increase in officer numbers or  tactics that was the true cause of the decrease. Thus, we would be unable  to contribute to the question of whether increases in officer strength are  either necessary or sufficient to reduce crime, without a change in police  tactics.", "A second concern is that agencies that were more likely to take initiative  in applying for and receiving COPS grants might be those that were also  more effective in preventing crime.  These agencies might also be those  that achieved larger or more rapid declines in crime.  If this were the case,  we might incorrectly associate declines in crime with COPS grant  expenditures because of other possible factors.  To assess this potential,  we estimated a regression that predicted whether an agency spent COPS  funds in a given year from 1994 through 2001 based on demographic  characteristics, economic conditions, and lagged property and violent  crime rates.  From the regressions, we predicted the probability of  spending COPS grant funds\u2014or the propensity of agencies to spend COPS  funds.  Whether or not an agency actually spent COPS funds, it received a  propensity score, based upon the values of its characteristics in the model  that predicated the probability of spending COPS funds.  Agencies that  actually spent COPS funds can then be compared to similar agencies\u2014 those with similar propensity scores\u2014that did not spend COPS funds.

This analyst recorded, for each  practice discussed in the research review, (1) the types of crimes against  which the practices were used (e.g., all crimes, violent crimes, property  crimes, disorder); (2) whether the practice was generally effective in  reducing crime, had no effect in reducing crime, or the impact was  ambiguous; (3) whether there was displacement of crimes away from the  areas where the practices were used; and (4) whether there were negative  effects of the practices (e.g., complaints against the police or the diversion  of resources from other policing activities). A second, similarly trained  analyst then read the reviews and verified the accuracy of the information  recorded by the first analyst. We then summarized the findings about each  practice from the data collection instruments prepared for each of the six  reviews.

For example, problem-oriented  approaches that focus on criminogenic substances such as guns and drugs  appear to be effective in reducing both violent and property crimes. And  hot spots approaches\u2014place-oriented approaches that temporarily apply  police resources to discrete locations where crime is concentrated at  much higher rates than occurs jurisdictionwide\u2014have also been found to  be effective in reducing crime. However, the magnitudes of the effects of  these interventions are difficult to estimate, especially on citywide crime  rates, as the interventions that were reviewed as effective generally were  concentrated in comparatively small places. Further, the enduring nature  of these interventions is not fully understood. It is not known, for example,  how long the effects of a problem- or place-oriented intervention persist.  In addition, some of the reviews point out that research designs  undertaken to date make it difficult to disentangle the effects of problem- oriented policing from hot spots policing. There is suggestive, but limited,  evidence that the combination of these practices may be more effective in  preventing or reducing crime than any one strategy alone.", "In contrast to the findings on problem-oriented and place-oriented policing  practices, there is little evidence in the literature for the effectiveness of  community collaboration practices\u2014such as increasing foot patrol,  establishing community partnerships, and encouraging citizen  involvement\u2014in reducing or preventing crime."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of Justice", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above the following individuals made key  contributions to this report: William J.
