Because there is no statutory or regulatory definition of a mid- sized or large business, we applied multipliers to SBA\u2019s size standards.  We considered businesses with revenue or employees up to five times  above the SBA small size standard as mid-sized and businesses with  revenue or employees of more than five times the small size standard as  large. We used five times the small size standard to distinguish between  mid-sized and large businesses based on the distribution of contracts and  obligations among businesses in these two groups. We discussed this  approach and methodology with SBA officials and officials at three federal  agencies that had large obligations for small business contracts in fiscal  year 2017. These officials did not raise any questions about our  approach, and some reiterated that there was no legal definition of mid- sized businesses. To determine whether businesses that grew to be mid- sized continued to secure contracts, we used FPDS-NG data to  determine the number of businesses awarded set-aside contracts in 2008  that became mid-sized by 2013 and the extent to which they were  awarded any sort of contract (including competed contracts) in fiscal  years 2014 through 2017. We also determined the percentage of  competed contracts awarded to small, mid-sized, and large businesses in  fiscal year 2017. We assessed the reliability of the FPDS-NG data we  used by performing electronic testing and reviewing information about the  system. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of determining the extent to which small businesses that grew  to be mid-sized continued to secure contracts and the size of businesses  awarded contracts during a specific time period.", "For the second objective, we reviewed the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR)\u2014the principal set of regulations governing the federal acquisition  process\u2014and small business laws and regulations to identify provisions  that allow small businesses that grow into mid-sized businesses to  continue providing services and goods on contracts set aside for small  businesses. We also reviewed SBA documents related to its mentor- prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs, one way that mid-sized businesses can provide  services and goods under set-aside contracts. Using FPDS-NG and SBA  data on mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 joint ventures, we determined the number of mid- sized businesses that were awarded set-aside contracts by forming joint  ventures with small business prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.", "For the third objective, we reviewed literature such as trade association  reports, congressional testimonies, and research reports. To gather  feedback on strengths and limitations of proposed options to increase  contracting opportunities for mid-sized businesses, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 11 individuals or organizations representing  three types of stakeholders (trade associations, researchers, and federal  agencies). More specifically, we interviewed representatives from five  trade associations for small and mid-sized businesses, three researchers  who published on this topic, and directors of the Office of Small and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) at the same three agencies  previously mentioned.

This practice can be referred to as \u201con-ramping.\u201d  According to the stakeholder proposing this option, if a small business  contractor grew to mid-sized, but could not transition to the unrestricted  track, all the effort the business put into winning the contract would be  wasted simply because it grew.", "Some multiple-award contracts allow small businesses that outgrow the  size standard to move to the unrestricted track of the multiple-award  contract, but this is not always the case. Agencies have discretion when  making this determination. If a business is allowed to move to the  unrestricted track of such a contract, it would be able to place bids on  additional orders resulting from the contract. In cases in which a business  cannot move to the unrestricted track, it has to leave the contract after  completing any ongoing orders. For example, the General Services  Administration\u2019s One Acquisition Solution for Integrated Services allows  businesses that have outgrown their size standards to move to the  unrestricted track, while EAGLE II does not.", "Most stakeholders we interviewed said this option could increase  contracting opportunities for growing small or mid-sized businesses. An  OSDBU director said the option would let businesses that grew to be mid- sized move to the unrestricted pool of the multiple-award contract so they  could keep their existing contract. A researcher said the option gives  more time for small and mid-sized businesses to prepare for full and open  competition. But two stakeholders noted that mid-sized businesses  already in the unrestricted pool may be negatively affected by increased  competition from additional contractors placed in the pool for task orders.", "Stakeholders offered differing opinions on how this option would affect  agencies. Several stakeholders said that agencies would benefit from  being able to retain contractors even if the contractors outgrew their size  standard. For example, a trade association executive said it would be less  disruptive for the agency if the business could continue its contract. Two  stakeholders thought that moving a business to the unrestricted pool  would reduce agency time and paperwork (compared to re-competing the  contract and performing additional evaluations). However, several  stakeholders told us that allowing small businesses that grew beyond the  size standards to \u201con-ramp\u201d might increase administrative burden on  agencies. For example, it might take longer for an agency to evaluate  proposals for unrestricted task order competitions if the pool of  competitors grew.

We  used search terms such as \u201cfederal contracting,\u201d \u201cmid-size,\u201d and \u201csize  standards.\u201d We identified six trade associations using this process.  Because one did not respond to our request, our sample included  representatives of the remaining five associations.", "We also selected three researchers who published on mid-sized  businesses and federal contracting. In addition, we selected the directors  of the Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU)  at three federal agencies\u2014Department of Defense, Department of  Homeland Security, and General Services Administration\u2014that were  among the top five agencies in terms of total dollar obligations for small  business contracts in fiscal year 2017.", "We then interviewed the 11 stakeholders. For each interview, we asked  them to provide their views on the strengths and limitations of each option  in relation to small, mid-sized, and large businesses and for federal  agencies.", "We performed a content analysis to analyze the responses. First, we  created preliminary codes that represented key themes across the  interviews of the strengths and limitations of the 14 options, such as  \u201cwould increase administrative burden on agencies\u201d or \u201cwould increase  contracting opportunities for mid-sized businesses.\u201d A methodologist  reviewed the coding system to ensure it was logical. We pre-tested the  coding of responses from three interviews to ensure the appropriateness  of the codes. One analyst coded each response to a particular strength or  limitation of an option and a second analyst reviewed the coding. If a  response did not align with a strength and limitation, the response was  coded as \u201cunclassified.\u201d The team discussed the results of the initial  coding analysis and made some adjustments to the codes. Once the  coding scheme was finalized and the responses from the remaining eight  interviews were coded by an analyst, a second analyst reviewed the  coding. If the second analyst disagreed with the coding of a particular  response, the two analysts spoke and achieved concurrence. After  response coding was completed, we tabulated the responses based on  the codes. A second person verified the calculation of the stakeholders\u2019  response totals.", "Because we selected a nongeneralizable sample of stakeholders to  interview, their views are not generalizable to other stakeholders who  have knowledge about options for increasing contracting opportunities for  mid-sized businesses, but their views offered important perspectives. To  characterize the number of stakeholders who offered the same opinion,  we used \u201cnearly all\u201d for nine or 10 stakeholders, \u201cmost\u201d for seven or eight  stakeholders, \u201cmore than half\u201d for six stakeholders, \u201cseveral\u201d for four or  five stakeholders, and \u201csome\u201d for three stakeholders. We also interviewed  SBA officials to obtain their views on how the options might affect small  businesses, as well as to gather information related to our other two  objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to August 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
