To do this, GAO reviewed agency documentation, analyzed a sample of reports added to NTIS's collection from fiscal years 1990 through 2011 (reports from the period since GAO's last study and other older reports), and interviewed relevant agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As a component of the Department of Commerce, the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) is organized into five primary offices that offer the public and federal agencies a variety of products and services. As of late October 2012, NTIS was supported by 181 staff, all except 6 of which held full-time positions. NTIS reports its progress toward agency goals to the Deputy Secretary of Commerce, and the Director of NTIS reports to the Director of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology. In addition, NTIS receives oversight of its functions and strategic direction from an advisory board with members appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. NTIS's product and service offerings include, among other things, subscription access to reports contained in its repository in both print and electronic formats, distribution of print-based informational materials to federal agencies' constituents, and digitization and scanning services.", "NTIS revenues are generated exclusively from direct sales or subscriptions for its products and services. NTIS reported that net revenues from all its functions (products and services) totaled about $1.5 million in fiscal year 2011. However, over most of the last 11 years, its costs have exceeded revenues by an average of about $1.3 million for its products. While NTIS has not recovered all of its costs for products through subscriptions and other fees, it has been able to remain financially self-sustaining because of revenues generated from its services such as distribution and order fulfillment, web hosting, and e-training. The NTIS strategic plan states that the electronic dissemination of government technical information by other federal agencies has contributed to reduced demand for NTIS's products. As a result, the agency is taking steps to reduce its net costs, such as improving business processes and increasing the breadth and depth of its collection.", "NTIS's repository has been growing with mostly older reports, but the demand for more recent reports is greater. Specifically, NTIS added approximately 841,500 reports to its repository during fiscal years 1990 through 2011, and approximately 62 percent of these had publication dates of 2000 or earlier. However, the agency was more likely to distribute (by direct sale or through a subscription) reports published more recently. For example, GAO estimated that 100 percent of the reports published from 2009 through 2011 had been distributed at least once, while only about 21 percent of reports published more than 20 years ago had been.", "Of the reports added to NTIS's repository during fiscal years 1990 through 2011, GAO estimates that approximately 74 percent were readily available from other public sources. These reports were often available either from the issuing organization's website, the federal Internet portal (http://www.USA.gov), or from another source located through a web search. Reports published from 1990 to 2011 were more likely to be readily available elsewhere than those published in 1989 or earlier. Further, GAO estimated that 95 percent of the reports available from sources other than NTIS were available free of charge. NTIS's declining revenue associated with its basic statutory function and the charging for information that is often freely available elsewhere suggests that the fee-based model under which NTIS currently operates for disseminating technical information may no longer be viable and appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is suggesting that Congress reassess the appropriateness and viability of the fee-based model under which NTIS currently operates for disseminating technical information to determine whether the use of this model should be continued.

Specifically,  we determined whether each report was first available at no cost on the  issuing organization\u2019s website and, if so, concluded the Internet search at  this point. However, if the report was not available, then the search  continued to the second source, and so on, until either the report was  found to be available at one of the remaining sources, or all sources were  exhausted. We then used our results to estimate the percentage of the  total population of NTIS reports added to the repository during fiscal years  1990 through 2011 that was available from other public sources.", "All of the results derived from the sample analyses constituted estimates  that are subject to sampling errors. These sampling errors measure the  extent to which the sample size and structure are likely to differ from the  population they represent. Because we followed a probability procedure  based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large number of  samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have  provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision  of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval.

Increase revenue by enhancing the number of acquisitions, creating  new products, reaching more customers, and adding value to what  NTIS collects, and to reduce costs by reviewing and improving key  business processes. 2.  Improve NTIS\u2019s utilization by other agencies by increasing the breadth  and depth of its own collection and enhancing the suite of information  management services that it can provide. 3.  Achieve workforce excellence by focusing on identifying and acquiring  the critical workforce skills required to accomplish the agency\u2019s  mission in a rapidly changing world.", "Beyond these initiatives identified in the strategic plan, the Director of  NTIS also provided information on several other initiatives under way to  address the budget shortfalls from products. These initiatives include the  following product and organizational improvements:", "Enhancing the accessibility of federal science content by shifting from  a pricing model for stand-alone products (e.g., paper/print, microfiche,  and compact disk media) to one that is subscription-based.", "Repositioning NTIS to support open government initiatives in  science\u2014meeting with agencies such as NIST, the National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration, and the Government Printing Office  to address how NTIS can reposition its programs to support current  science information needs.", "Building collections of reports based on themes and categories that  will be supported through subscriptions.", "Adjusting the NTIS business model to support the increased demand  for subscriptions to customers.", "Reducing staff\u2014for example, the agency has received authorization  to provide early retirement for eligible employees and has stopped  hiring additional staff.

The agency\u2019s  net revenue now comes primarily from services that are less directly  related to its basic statutory function. The decline in sales of technical  information is due in part to the increasing availability of this information  from other sources, including websites and Internet search tools, and  often at no charge. Charging for information that is freely available  elsewhere is a disservice to the public and may also be wasteful insofar  as some of NTIS\u2019s customers are other federal agencies.

Commerce stated that, through its federal  clearinghouse and repository, the agency provides federally funded  reports that are not otherwise readily available, such as most of those  issued prior to l989. Additionally, Commerce stated that NTIS recognizes  that it cannot remain financially solvent solely through sales and  subscriptions of technical reports with expectations that these products  will be widely available for free. It added that NTIS is moving in the  direction of \u201copen and improved access\u201d to information, but recognizes  that it needs to maintain a sustainable financial model and continue  providing enhanced value to the information generated by other federal  agencies.

Further, as the agency acknowledged, its financial health is based on  both its information product and service missions. Also, as we state in   our report, the agency\u2019s net revenue now comes primarily from services  that are less directly related to its basic statutory function, while sales of  its technical information products have resulted in net losses. This decline  in sales of NTIS\u2019s technical reports is due in part to the increasing  availability of this information from other sources, including websites and  Internet search tools, and often at no charge.
