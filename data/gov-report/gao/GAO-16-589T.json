In particular, while IRS had improved some of its access controls, weaknesses remained in key controls for identifying and authenticating users, authorizing users' level of rights and privileges, encrypting sensitive data, auditing and monitoring network activity, and physically securing facilities housing its information technology resources. These weaknesses were due in part to IRS's inconsistent implementation of its agency-wide security program, including not fully implementing prior GAO recommendations. GAO concluded that these weaknesses collectively constituted a significant deficiency for the purposes of financial reporting for fiscal year 2015. As a result, taxpayer and financial data continue to be exposed to unnecessary risk.", "Identity theft refund fraud also poses a significant challenge. IRS estimates it paid $3.1 billion in these fraudulent refunds in filing season 2014, while preventing $22.5 billion (see figure). The full extent is unknown because of the challenges inherent in detecting this form of fraud.", "IRS has taken steps to combat identity theft refund fraud such as improving phone service for taxpayers to report suspected identity theft and working with industry, states, and financial institutions to detect and prevent it. However, as GAO reported in August 2014 and January 2015, additional actions can further assist the agency in addressing this crime, including pre-refund matching of taxpayer returns with information returns from employers, and assessing the costs, benefits, and risks of improving methods for authenticating taxpayers. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2016 includes a provision that would help IRS with pre-refund matching and also includes an additional $290 million to enhance cybersecurity, combat identity theft refund fraud, and improve customer service.", "According to IRS and industry partners, the 2016 filing season has generally gone smoothly, with about 95 million returns and $215 billion in refunds processed through April 1, 2016.

This crime burdens  honest taxpayers because authenticating their identities is likely to delay  processing their returns and refunds. Moreover, the victim\u2019s PII can  potentially be used to commit other crimes.

Regarding IRS  specifically, two recent incidents illustrate the impact on taxpayer and  other sensitive information:  In June 2015, the Commissioner of the IRS testified that unauthorized  third parties had gained access to taxpayer information from its Get  Transcript application. According to officials, criminals used taxpayer- specific data acquired from non-department sources to gain  unauthorized access to information on approximately 100,000 tax  accounts. These data included Social Security information, dates of  birth, and street addresses. In an August 2015 update, IRS reported  this number to be about 114,000, and that an additional 220,000  accounts had been inappropriately accessed. In a February 2016  update, the agency reported that an additional 390,000 accounts had  been accessed. Thus, about 724,000 accounts were reportedly  affected. The online Get Transcript service has been unavailable  since May 2015.", "In March 2016, IRS stated that as part of its ongoing security review, it  had temporarily suspended the Identity Protection Personal  Identification Number (IP PIN) service on IRS.gov. The IP PIN is a  single-use identification number provided to taxpayers who are victims  of identity theft (IDT) to help prevent future IDT refund fraud. The  service on IRS\u2019s website allowed taxpayers to retrieve their IP PINs  online by passing IRS\u2019s authentication checks. These checks confirm  taxpayer identity by asking for personal, financial and tax-related  information. The IRS stated that it was conducting further review of  the IP PIN service and is looking at further strengthening the security  features before resuming service.

IRS established  policies for identification and authentication, including requiring  multifactor authentication for local and network access accounts and  establishing password complexity and expiration requirements. It also  improved identification and authentication controls by, for example,  expanding the use of an automated mechanism to centrally manage,  apply, and verify password requirements. However, weaknesses in  identification and authentication controls remained.
