NNSA's budget materials are (1) its 2015 congressional budget justification that includes the President's fiscal year budget request and information about 4 additional years of planned budget requests, and (2) its update to its Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan that includes NNSA's long-range, 25-year plans for sustaining the stockpile and modernizing the nuclear security enterprise. Congress funds NNSA's 2015 budget estimates in four program areas: stockpile; infrastructure; science, technology, and engineering capabilities; and other weapons activities. GAO found that some budget estimates for individual programs within these four areas changed more significantly from 2014 to 2015 than the total budget estimates changed. For example, stockpile budget estimates to refurbish nuclear weapons through life extension programs (LEP) decreased by 31 percent in part due to changes in programs' production schedules. In contrast, infrastructure budget estimates for construction projects increased by 71 percent largely because the estimates were more complete than those GAO evaluated in 2014.", "For NNSA's major modernization efforts\u2014which include LEPs that are not in full scale production and major construction projects\u2014near-term budget estimates for two of three LEPs align with plans, but estimates for construction projects are too preliminary to assess alignment. NNSA's near-term budget estimates to refurbish its B61 bomb and W88 warhead align with its plans because annual budget estimates reflect internally developed estimated cost ranges for the programs. However, the near-term budget estimates for the cruise missile LEP are not aligned with NNSA's 2015 plans because annual budget estimates are below the low point of the program's internally developed estimated cost range. A 2008 internal review of NNSA's project management stated that failure to request full funding can result in risks to programs' goals such as increased program costs and schedule delays. GAO's prior work has emphasized the importance of transparency in federal agencies' budget presentations because such information helps Congress understand how new funding requests relate to program decisions. Including information in future versions of budget materials on the potential risks to achieving LEPs' goals when funding requests are not aligned with plans would improve the quality of budget materials.", "NNSA's infrastructure budget estimates are not adequate to address its reported $3.6 billion deferred maintenance backlog, and the backlog will continue to grow. One reason the backlog will continue to grow is that the 2015 budget estimates to address the problem fall below DOE infrastructure investment benchmarks for maintaining and recapitalizing existing facilities, activities that can reduce deferred maintenance. NNSA's goal to stop the growth of the backlog is stated in its budget materials, but these materials do not identify that budget estimates for maintenance and recapitalization fall below DOE's infrastructure investment benchmarks.

During the cold war, the nation designed,  tested, and produced new nuclear weapons. Since then, the strategy has  shifted to maintaining the existing nuclear weapons stockpile indefinitely  without underground nuclear testing as the United States has observed a  moratorium on such testing since 1992. To ensure a credible U.S. nuclear  deterrent under the moratorium, the United States uses a science-based  approach to stockpile stewardship. This approach combines nonnuclear  experiments, physics modeling, and computer simulations to predict  nuclear weapon performance over a wide range of conditions and  scenarios.

Of particular focus in  the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review is the need to recapitalize the nuclear  security enterprise\u2019s infrastructure by performing major renovations  needed to keep existing facilities modern and relevant. In addition to the  modernization goals included in the Nuclear Posture Review, the Nuclear  Weapons Council established in 2012 a long-term plan for the nuclear  weapons stockpile to align NNSA nuclear weapon life extension programs  (LEP), DOD programs to modernize the delivery platforms that carry  those weapons, and initial operations for NNSA\u2019s plutonium and uranium  infrastructure. According to a senior NNSA official, the agency considers  its current major modernization efforts to include three LEPs (currently at  various stages of development), as well as major construction projects to  replace aging, existing facilities for plutonium (the Chemistry and  Metallurgy Research Replacement-Nuclear Facility or its alternative) and  uranium (the Uranium Processing Facility).", "NNSA refers to the cost figures included in its budget materials over the next 5 years as  \u201cbudget requirements\u201d and those after 5 years as \u201cestimated budget requirements.\u201d We  refer to these figures as \u201cbudget estimates\u201d throughout this report.", "First, NNSA\u2019s Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan (SSMP)  provides information on modernization and operations plans and  budget estimates over the next 25 years.

These issues included the management of major  construction projects without firm cost and schedule baselines, which  could lead to project cost growth and schedule slippages that might  adversely affect NNSA\u2019s modernization plans, as well as challenges in  refurbishing weapons using aging infrastructure. In June 2012, we sent a  letter to the Senate and House Armed Services Committees that  explained that we could not complete our review of the 2013 budget  materials because NNSA did not issue the documents required for our  review. In December 2013, we reviewed NNSA\u2019s 2014 budget materials.

For example, research and  experiments funded in the ST&E area contribute to the design and  production of refurbished weapons, funded in the stockpile area. The  infrastructure area offers critical support to both the stockpile and ST&E  capabilities areas by providing a suitable environment for their various  activities, such as producing weapons components and performing  research and experimentation activities. The other weapons activities  area offers support to the three other areas by, for example, providing for  the security of nuclear weapons and nuclear material. In fiscal year 2015,  the President requested $8.3 billion in total appropriations for Weapons  Activities, and the Congress appropriated $8.2 billion.", "The stockpile area includes weapons refurbishments through LEPs and  other major weapons alterations and modifications; surveillance efforts to  evaluate the condition, safety, and reliability of stockpiled weapons;  maintenance efforts to perform certain minor weapons alterations or to  replace components that have limited lifetimes; and core activities to  support these efforts, such as maintaining base capabilities to produce  uranium and plutonium weapons components. Our analysis of NNSA\u2019s  data indicates that about 40 percent of the budget estimates for the  stockpile area from 2015 to 2039 is for LEPs. The U.S. nuclear weapons  stockpile is composed of seven different weapon types, including air- delivered bombs, ballistic missile warheads, and cruise missile warheads  (see table 1).", "The infrastructure area involves NNSA-owned, leased, and permitted  physical infrastructure and facilities supporting weapons activities.  NNSA\u2019s 2015 nuclear security budget materials include information on  budget estimates for three major types of infrastructure activities:  operating and maintaining the existing infrastructure, recapitalizing  (improving) existing facilities, and constructing new facilities. Our analysis  of NNSA\u2019s budget materials indicates that about 57 percent of the budget  estimates for infrastructure from 2015 to 2039 is for the operation,  maintenance, and recapitalization of existing facilities and about 27  percent is for new facilities construction.", "The ST&E capabilities area is composed of five \u201ccampaigns,\u201d which are  technically challenging, multiyear, multifunctional efforts to develop and  maintain critical science and engineering capabilities, including  capabilities that enable the annual assessment of the safety and reliability  of the stockpile, improve understanding of the physics and materials  science associated with nuclear weapons, and support the development  of code-based models that replace underground testing. Our analysis of  NNSA\u2019s data indicates that about 36 percent of the budget estimates for  the ST&E capabilities area from 2015 to 2039 are for the Advanced  Simulation and Computing Campaign.

Maintenance activities\u2014including the replacement of parts, systems, or  components\u2014are needed to preserve or maintain a facility in an  acceptable condition to safely operate. Regular maintenance throughout  a facility\u2019s service life can minimize deferred maintenance or prevent it  from accumulating. NNSA\u2019s budget materials contain two categories of  maintenance budget estimates: direct-funded and indirect-funded.  According to a NNSA official, estimates for direct-funded maintenance are  included in the budget in two places: (1) the maintenance account  specified in NNSA\u2019s budget materials and (2) the program budgets for  certain NNSA programs that are the major users of key scientific and  production facilities, such as the Advanced Simulation and Computing  Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Tritium  Extraction Facility at the Savannah River Site. Indirect-funded  maintenance represents activities that are budgeted and paid for as part  of a site\u2019s overhead costs. According to NNSA officials, some sites, such  as Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, use indirect-funded  maintenance as the primary way to budget and pay for maintenance. The  2015 budget materials estimate that NNSA will budget $1.6 billion for  direct-funded maintenance over the next 5 years and $2.3 billion for  indirect-funded maintenance over the next 5 years. NNSA identifies the  total direct and indirect budget estimates planned for maintenance at  each site and reports this information for the FYNSP in the congressional  budget justification. NNSA is required by DOE to collect this information  from its management and operating contractors through a DOE  prescribed tool known as the Integrated Facilities and Infrastructure  Crosscut Budget.", "NNSA can recapitalize facilities or their subsystems (e.g., roofing,  ventilation systems, and electrical systems) when they wear out or  become outdated (i.e., reach the end of their useful service life). For  example, in 2016 NNSA plans to replace approximately 500 sprinkler  heads, which are about 50 years old, in a building that manufactures  nonnuclear components at its Y-12 National Security Complex in  Tennessee. Similarly, in 2015, NNSA continues to upgrade a control  tower\u2019s electrical and mechanical components at its Sandia National  Laboratories site in New Mexico to support nonnuclear testing activities  for nuclear bombs. The 2015 budget materials estimate that $1.8 billion  will be spent on recapitalization over the next 5 years and that $11.5    billion will be spent on such recapitalization over the next 25 years. According to officials, if NNSA determines that a facility is no longer  needed for mission operations, the agency can demolish the facility. For  example, NNSA recently demolished building 9744 at the Y-12 plant  because the support structure was failing. Budget estimates for  demolition are included as a subprogram in the recapitalization estimates;  the 2015 budget materials contain 5-year budget estimates of $105  million and 25-year estimates of $230 million for demolition activities.", "The current process by which NNSA prioritizes infrastructure investment  is based on data on a facility\u2019s condition and importance to achieving  programmatic goals. Contractors that manage and operate each site  within the nuclear security enterprise are required by a DOE order to  inspect all facilities on their site at least every 5 years and are to update  DOE\u2019s infrastructure database annually with information relating to the  condition of the site\u2019s facilities. This information includes estimating the  amount of a facility\u2019s deferred maintenance and its replacement plant  value, which is the cost to replace the existing structure with a new  structure of comparable size using current technology, codes, standards,  and materials.

According to NNSA documents and  officials, one reason for this decrease in budget estimates is delayed  production schedules. The 2015 budget materials state that NNSA will  complete three LEPs\u2014the W76-1, B61-12, and the cruise missile\u2014as  well as the W88 alteration over the next 25 years, whereas the prior  year\u2019s budget materials stated that the agency planned to complete these  and an additional LEP. The program that will no longer be completed  within the 25-year time frame of the 2015 budget materials is the  Interoperable Warhead 1 (IW-1) LEP. The first production unit for the  IW-1 LEP is now estimated to be in 2030, which is a 5-year delay over the  prior year\u2019s plans, and no programmatic activities are planned to occur  during the 5-year FYNSP period from 2015 through 2019. According to  NNSA documents, this schedule delay is due, in part, to the agency  providing more time to study the concept of interoperability and to reduce  uncertainty about the agency\u2019s ability to achieve necessary plutonium and  uranium capabilities to support the LEP. In addition, the 2015 budget  materials included a 3-year delay to the first production unit of the IW-2  LEP (now estimated in 2034) and a 4-year delay to the first production  unit of the IW-3 LEP (now estimated to be no earlier than 2041)  compared with the prior year\u2019s plans. These schedule delays move some  budget estimates previously included in the 2014 budget materials  outside the 25-year time frame covered by the 2015 budget materials.  See figure 3 for a summary of changes to the production schedules for  the planned LEPs from the 2014 to the 2015 budget materials, and see  appendix II for a summary of schedule changes to major modernization  efforts since the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review.", "Second, according to NNSA officials, DOD and NNSA made  programmatic decisions about one LEP\u2019s scope that reduced  uncertainties and risks. Specifically, NNSA officials said that the agency  selected the W80 warhead for the cruise missile LEP (the B61 and the  W84 were also under consideration). The selection of a specific warhead,  according to NNSA officials, removed certain risks and uncertainties  associated with the potential of conducting research and development on  three separate warheads and allowed the agency to significantly lower its  program cost estimate. Further, NNSA officials said that the selection of  the W80 warhead allowed the agency to eliminate uncertainties related to  component design, technology development efforts, and certification  requirements. The 2015 budget materials estimate that $6.8 billion will be  needed to complete the cruise missile LEP, while the prior year\u2019s  materials estimated that $11.6 billion would be needed. This change  represents a decrease of $4.8 billion or 42 percent.", "Finally, to develop LEP budget estimates for the 2015 budget materials  NNSA used either (1) budget estimates contained in Selected Acquisition  Reports or (2) the midpoint between the high and low bounds of the  ranges in their cost estimates for LEPs and then applied a percentage  inflation rate, which was calculated based on numbers provided by the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB), according to NNSA officials.  This methodology differed from that in the prior year\u2019s report, in which  NNSA used the low point of the estimated cost ranges and used an  inflation rate higher than that which would result from the application of  OMB guidance to account for uncertainties and risks.

An  additional $150 million would be needed in the 5-year budget estimates  for these estimates to reflect the approximately $850 million midpoint of  the internally developed cost range for the cruise missile LEP.

Among other things, NNSA\u2019s current  process for prioritizing infrastructure budget estimates focuses on  those facilities and infrastructure identified as mission critical, but this  designation may not accurately target infrastructure investment  requirements because it understates the importance of some key  facilities and other infrastructure to its mission. For example, agency  officials said that current plutonium research and production facilities  at Los Alamos National Laboratory are designated as mission critical,  but the facility that treats the associated radioactive and hazardous  waste is designated mission dependent, not critical. According to  NNSA officials, if the waste treatment facility experienced an  unexpected shutdown, the research and production facilities could  slow down or stop operations since the waste could not be treated.  However, the designation assigned to the waste facility does not  elevate it to the highest priority for infrastructure investment. Elevating  the importance of all mission dependent, not critical, facilities does not  provide an optimal solution because doing so could similarly overstate  the importance of some facilities and infrastructure that are less  essential to mission achievement. NNSA officials with whom we  spoke agreed that improved data on the importance of facilities and  infrastructure to mission achievement, beyond the designations  defined by the Federal Real Property Council, could help NNSA better  identify needed infrastructure investment and improve the planning  basis for its budget estimates. To improve this information, NNSA is  planning to implement a \u201cmission dependency index\u201d that will  measure a facility\u2019s importance based on (1) the direct loss of  capability and (2) how that loss effects other assets. According to  agency officials, this new index may result in increased investment for  supporting and enabling infrastructure (e.g., waste processing  facilities, power lines, HVAC systems, etc.) that is currently  considered mission dependent, not critical.

These officials told us that a facility\u2019s overall condition  can be assessed as good even if the facility has a failing subsystem  that is essential to its operation. A failure of a critical subsystem could  stop programmatic activities at the entire facility. For example, a leak  in the fire suppression system shut down operations at the Device  Assembly Facility, a mission critical facility at the Nevada National  Security Site, for 10 days. Further, according to officials, a  subsystem within a facility could be in better condition than the rating  of the entire facility might otherwise indicate making prioritization  within such facilities challenging. NNSA officials with whom we spoke  agreed that improved data about the condition of subsystems could  help NNSA better identify needed investment and improve the basis  for its budget estimates. To improve this information, NNSA is  adopting a standardized condition assessment process and  infrastructure database used by the Department of Defense.

NNSA\u2019s budget materials are composed of two  key policy documents that are issued annually: the agency\u2019s budget  justification, which contains estimates for the 5-year Future-Years Nuclear  Security Program (FYNSP), and the Stockpile Stewardship and  Management Plan (SSMP), which provides budget estimates over the  next 25 years. We compared the budget estimates down to the  subprogram and line item construction project level. If we identified  changes between the 2015 and 2014 budget materials, we reviewed both  versions of the materials and interviewed knowledgeable officials from  NNSA to determine the reasons for those changes. We reviewed prior  GAO reports on modernization and specific programs or projects included  in the plans to provide context for NNSA\u2019s plans and changes in the  plans. A list of related GAO products is included at the end of this report.  We also reviewed the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide,  which highlights best practices for developing, managing, and evaluating  cost estimates for capital programs.", "To assesses the extent to which the total 2015 budget estimates align  with plans for major modernization efforts\u2014which the agency defines as  nuclear weapon life extension programs (LEP) and projects for plutonium  and uranium infrastructure\u2014we compared the budget estimates included  in NNSA\u2019s 2015 budget materials with its long-range plans included in the  SSMP. In addition to new issues that we identified as part of our review of  the 2015 budget materials, we also followed up on the findings identified  in our December 2013 report, such as the extent to which NNSA\u2019s 2015  budget materials include estimates for plutonium and uranium infrastructure projects that were omitted in the prior year\u2019s materials.Additionally, we reviewed prior GAO reports to provide context for the  concerns we identified and discussed areas where budget estimates did  not appear to align with its modernization plans with knowledgeable  officials from NNSA. If we identified areas in the 2015 budget materials  where estimates did not appear to align with modernization plans, we  reviewed the 2016 FYNSP included in NNSA\u2019s 2016 budget justification  to determine the extent to which this misalignment persisted.", "To determine the extent to which NNSA\u2019s budget estimates for  modernizing the nuclear security enterprise address its stated goal of  stopping the growth of the deferred maintenance backlog, we compared  budget estimates contained in the 2015 budget materials over the 5 years  of the FYNSP for (1) maintenance and (2) recapitalization to infrastructure  investment benchmarks contained in the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE)  2005 Real Property Asset Management Plan. DOE\u2019s 2005 plan states  that budget estimates for maintenance should be at least 2 percent of the  replacement plant value, which is the cost to replace the existing structure  with a new structure of comparable size using current technology, codes,  standards, and materials. NNSA\u2019s 2015 budget materials include the total  replacement plant value for all eight sites in the nuclear security  enterprise. DOE\u2019s 2005 plan states that budget estimates should be  dedicated toward recapitalization activities, but the plan did not provide a  specific benchmark. The plan\u2019s associated 2015 budget guidance (issued  in March 2013) states that DOE programs, including NNSA, should  institute a \u201crecapitalization strategy\u201d that is equal to 1 percent of  replacement plant value if the program\u2019s overall facility condition fell   According to NNSA data, its overall facility  below a certain threshold.condition was below the established threshold. These \u201crecapitalization  strategy\u201d budget estimates were to be added to the agency\u2019s  maintenance budget account because NNSA at that time did not have a  separate recapitalization budget account. NNSA made its first targeted  request for recapitalization in the 2015 budget materials. We compared  the budget estimates contained in the specific recapitalization control to  the investment benchmark of 1 percent of replacement plant value. NNSA  officials confirmed that this approach was reasonable. We then calculated  the amount of budget estimates for maintenance (2 percent of  replacement plant value) and recapitalization (1 percent of replacement  plant value) that would be equal to DOE\u2019s own infrastructure investment  benchmarks.  We then compared these benchmarks with annual budget  estimates in NNSA\u2019s 2015 budget justification for maintenance and  recapitalization over each year of the FYNSP to determine if the total  budget estimates met, exceeded, or fell short of the benchmarks. We  discussed with knowledgeable officials from NNSA areas where these  budget estimates did not appear to align with the stated policy goal.", "We also reviewed NNSA\u2019s Infrastructure Data Analysis Center system to  identify the estimated value of NNSA\u2019s real property and the total amount  of deferred maintenance across the nuclear security enterprise. We did  not assess the reliability of these estimates because they were mostly  used to determine whether NNSA was meeting its own stated goal of  reducing deferred maintenance and dedicating benchmarked proportions   We also  of replacement plant value to maintenance and recapitalization.reviewed documentation and received briefings from NNSA officials on  the agency\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve its infrastructure data and  resource prioritization.", "To assess the reliability of NNSA\u2019s budget estimates and DOE\u2019s real  property management system, we conducted manual and electronic tests  of the data, looking for missing values, outliers, or other anomalies.  Additionally, we interviewed knowledgeable NNSA officials about the data  and their methodologies for using the data to construct their estimates,  including discussing missing data that we identified in our tests of the  data. During our review, we found that NNSA had omitted 20 years of  budget data for site operations at the Y-12 National Security Complex in  Tennessee after 2019. We brought this to the attention of agency officials  who confirmed the omission and provided GAO with corrected budget  estimates. We determined that the corrected Y-12 data and the data  underlying the budget estimates were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes, which was to report the total amount of budget estimates and  those estimates dedicated to certain programs and projects. We also  found that the limited amount of data we used from DOE\u2019s real property  information management system were also sufficiently reliable for our  purposes, which was to report the total amount of deferred maintenance  and replacement plant value in the nuclear security enterprise, as well as  the amount of deferred maintenance and replacement plant value  associated with specific facility designations (i.e., not mission dependent).  However, we did not assess the reliability of NNSA\u2019s underlying budget  estimating processes or independently verify the reliability of specific  budget estimates because such analysis exceeds the scope of our  mandate.", "We limited the scope of our review to NNSA\u2019s Weapons Activities  appropriation.

In particular, the Nuclear Posture Review identified three planned  LEPs, one for the W76\u2014a warhead delivered by submarine launched  ballistic missile\u2014another for the B61\u2014a gravity bomb delivered by  aircraft\u2014and also discussed the potential for a common warhead  developed through refurbishment and for use on both Navy and Air Force  delivery vehicles. NNSA\u2019s planning documents for 2015 continue to  include LEPs for the W76 and B61 and the 2015 SSMP further developed  the concept of a common warhead, now termed an \u201cinteroperable\u201d  warhead (IW), including long-range plans for three IWs. In addition,  NNSA\u2019s 2015 planning documents include an LEP for the Air Force\u2019s  cruise missile warhead and a major alteration (ALT) of the Navy\u2019s W88  warhead, also delivered on a submarine launched ballistic missile, neither  of which was discussed in the Nuclear Posture Review. The Nuclear  Posture Review also discussed major line item construction projects to  replace aging facilities for NNSA\u2019s plutonium and uranium processing  missions. The project for plutonium processing is known as the Chemistry  and Metallurgy Research Replacement-Nuclear Facility (CMRR-NF), and  the project for uranium processing is known as the Uranium Processing  Facility (UPF). Both projects are being reconceptualized as a result of  project execution challenges and increasingly escalating cost estimates.
