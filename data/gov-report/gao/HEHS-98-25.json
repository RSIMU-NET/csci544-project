Because of these concerns, you asked us to evaluate the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) oversight of transplanted human tissue as well as to evaluate potential safety problems. Specifically, we sought to identify gaps in the current regulation, determining whether and how FDA plans to address them in the approach it has proposed for regulating tissue banking.

Traditionally, most human tissue used in medicine comprised such body components as skin, bone, corneas, and heart valves that were transplanted for replacement purposes as well as semen and ova implanted for reproductive purposes. In recent years, scientists have developed innovative methods of manipulating and using human cells and tissues for therapeutic purposes. For example, in what is known as somatic cell therapy, scientists are studying the use of human cells that have been manipulated in the laboratory to treat viral infections, Parkinson\u2019s disease, diabetes, and other diseases and conditions. Other tissue research includes the use of blood from the placenta and umbilical cord to treat leukemia and other diseases.", "Two events in the early 1990s initiated concern about the safety of human tissue recovered for transplantation. The first was the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus from a donor to a number of recipients of the donor\u2019s organs and fresh-frozen bone tissue. The other event was the importation from foreign countries of human tissue for which there was no record of source or testing for infectious diseases. As a result of these events, FDA issued interim regulations on December 14, 1993, to help prevent the transmission of HIV and hepatitis B and C. This action was taken under section 361 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C. 264), which authorizes the secretary of HHS to make and enforce regulations necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the United States or from state to state. The interim regulations provided for donor screening, documentation of testing, FDA inspections of tissue facilities, and the recall of potentially unsafe tissue, but they were limited in the types of tissue they covered.", "On July 29, 1997, FDA issued a final rule (to become effective January 26, 1998) for the regulation of human tissue intended for transplantation. The rule requires facilities engaged in the recovery, screening, testing, processing, storing, or distributing of human tissues to ensure that specified minimum required medical screening and infectious disease testing are performed and that records documenting screening and testing for each human tissue are available for FDA\u2019s inspection. The rule also contains provisions for retaining, recalling, or destroying human tissue for which appropriate documentation is not available. However, the rule does not cover reproductive tissue and stem cells.", "In concert with the final rule, FDA issued guidance for industry for screening and testing donors of human tissue intended for transplantation. This document represents FDA\u2019s current thinking on screening and testing donors and does not bind FDA or the public to its recommendations. Tissue facilities can choose to follow this guidance or alternatives. The document outlines recommended tests and algorithms for accepting donors and gives information pertaining to screening donors to determine their acceptability.", "CDC has also set forth voluntary guidelines for screening and testing for HIV and hepatitis B and C. In 1994, CDC published a guideline on preventing the transmission of HIV through the transplantation of human tissues and organs. The guideline outlined recommendations on donor screening, donor testing for infectious diseases, laboratory and other medical exclusionary criteria for donors, record keeping for tracking recipients and tissues, testing recipients, and recalling stored tissue. In 1991, a Public Health Service interagency guideline was published covering issues relating to the screening of donors of blood, plasma, tissues, organs, and semen for evidence of hepatitis B and C that included information on screening, testing, medical evaluations, and counseling.", "Several industry associations are also involved in standard setting, and some conduct inspections.

Processing procedures vary by tissue type. Some tissues undergo procedures to remove or inactivate viruses; others do not. Tissues that can be processed and sterilized include bone, tendons and cartilage, and fascia. These procedures can be employed on such tissues because they can function even though they are rendered acellular and nonviable. Cornea, skin, stem cells, and semen cannot undergo such processing because they contain viable cells that could be damaged.", "All tissues are stored in containers capable of withstanding appropriate storage conditions and are labeled with the tissue identification number, tissue facility name and address, expiration date (if applicable), acceptable storage conditions, disinfection or sterilization procedure and preservatives or potential residues of processing (if applicable), and an instruction to \u201csee the package insert.\u201d The package insert supplies additional information for the health professional, including possible contraindications and adverse reactions.

It is less prescriptive than traditional FDA regulation and it has generally been well received by industry. Although it is clearly open to broad interpretation, it would expand the current FDA oversight to include reproductive tissues and stem cells. The approach would focus on three main areas: (1) preventing unwitting use of contaminated tissues with the potential for transmitting infectious diseases, (2) preventing improper handling and processing that might contaminate or damage tissues, and (3) ensuring that clinical safety and efficacy are demonstrated for tissues that are highly processed (more than minimally manipulated), used for other than their normal function (nonhomologous), combined with nontissue components, or used for metabolic purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Proposed Approach Addresses Certain Omissions in Current Regulation", "paragraphs": ["We have three concerns about omissions in the current regulation that FDA has identified and plans to address under its proposed approach: (1) lack of registration of tissue facilities, (2) some types of tissue facilities not covered under the current regulation, and (3) misleading and false advertising in cord blood banking.

FDA recognizes this deficiency and is drafting a regulation that would require registration.", "FDA previously inspected tissue facilities \u201cfor cause\u201d but now intends to conduct a small number of routine inspections. According to data obtained from FDA on its inspection activities, the agency conducted 14 inspections in 1997. With resources of 2.8 full-time staff equivalents, the agency expects in fiscal year 1998 to inspect 44 of the approximately 200 known tissue facilities now covered by the current regulation.

AATB standards also state that semen is not to be distributed to private individuals without a physician\u2019s written order, but according to some in the industry, some sperm banks do, in fact, sell semen samples directly to private individuals. Furthermore, officials from ASRM stated that each semen donor is limited to 10 resulting pregnancies to limit the possibility of genetic offspring unknowingly intermarrying. However, some sperm banks do not abide by this limit.", "To date, FDA has inspected approximately 80 tissue banks and has issued 15 notices for the recall of tissues at 10 tissue facilities. FDA has also issued letters of opportunity for voluntary corrective action. For example, in a December 1996 letter, FDA notified one EBAA-accredited eye bank that it had procured eye tissues from 43 donors between December 1993 and January 1994 that were subsequently processed, distributed, and transplanted without any testing for anti-HIV 2. FDA has also performed an initial analysis of 30 Form 483s issued to 27 tissue facilities between January 1994 and June 1996 that resulted in 216 observations.Approximately half of these observations were related to section 1270.5(e) of the interim rule, which stated that it should be determined that a donor of tissue intended for transplantation is suitable, including ascertaining the donor\u2019s identity and adequately completing and recording relevant medical histories to ensure freedom from risk factors for or clinical evidence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection.", "Potential problems among association nonmembers and those that do not abide by industry standards, as well as clear problems identified in FDA initial inspections, illustrate that FDA inspection is necessary to maintain the safety of human tissue intended for transplantation. Only through registration of all tissue facilities will FDA have an adequate means by which to plan its inspection activities.

If provided at all, the extremely low probability of ever requiring the cord blood unit for transplantation into the child or a family member is rarely, if ever, completely portrayed. Nor are parents always told of other sources of stem cells, such as peripheral blood and bone marrow, that can be collected and transplanted when they are needed. Current scientific knowledge suggests that umbilical cord blood stem cells are less likely to initiate graft versus host disease (GVHD) in a recipient than bone marrow and, perhaps, peripheral stem cells. However, new techniques and immune suppression therapies are constantly improving GVHD rates, thus increasing the likelihood that the future transplant needs of a family could be met without the costly collection and storage fees associated with cord blood. Moreover, because GVHD rates associated with the transplantation of unrelated\u2014even highly genetically mismatched\u2014cord blood stem cells from public banks appear to be so low, the need for a highly genetically matched family member is not the gravely important issue that it is in the transplantation of bone marrow stem cells.", "Table 3 illustrates the type of misleading and false information that prospective parents can find on the Internet as they research decisions to store their unborn child\u2019s cord blood. For example, while one company claims that \u201cautologous transplants are the most common type of transplant performed,\u201d there have not, in fact, been any published reports of autologous cord blood transplants in patients for treatment of a malignant disease. Moreover, scientific controversy surrounds the use of a young child\u2019s own stem cells to reconstitute a diseased immune system. We found unsubstantiated and exaggerated claims, both implied and explicit, in four areas relating to umbilical cord blood: its safety relative to bone marrow transplantation, scientific research establishing the feasibility and efficacy of transplanting it, the number and type of transplants to date, and the state of the art of collecting, processing, and storing it.", "Clearly, consumers have the right to collect and store umbilical cord blood for personal use.

This facility follows this practice because obtaining consent in advance can be highly problematic. For instance, some mothers do not receive prenatal care and, thus, do not afford the cord blood facility the opportunity to obtain informed consent before delivery. An FDA official stated that since the placenta and umbilical cord are normally discarded following delivery, these tissues typically become the property of the hospital. For other tissues removed and discarded (as in surgery), consent to collect portions for other uses is not generally required. Therefore, an argument can be made that consent is needed for umbilical cord blood testing and use but not collection.", "Two safety concerns are raised when informed consent is not obtained until after collection. First, the health implications to recipients of umbilical cord blood from mothers who may not have received prenatal care are currently unknown. Second, an essential safety control is to ask the mother a series of screening questions regarding her behavior and exposure to disease. A new mother might not answer truthfully questions on high-risk behavior (such as illicit drug use) that could otherwise result in removing her newborn from her care.", "The public cord blood bank that obtains consent after collection is operating under an FDA-approved investigational new drug (IND) protocol and has obtained institutional review board approval from the hospital where the cord blood is collected.

Until these analyses have been conducted, the safety of seeking consent after delivery remains unknown.", "There is also an ethical concern in obtaining consent after collection. A recent consensus statement from the Working Group on Ethical Issues in Umbilical Cord Blood Banking noted that informed consent should be obtained before procuring placental blood for transplantation because not obtaining consent runs counter to the explicit reasoning behind informed consent\u2014that is, providing an individual with the information and opportunity to make a decision before a procedure is performed.", "Obtaining consent before delivery affords the mother the opportunity to deliberate more fully on the decision before the birth.", "The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) multicenter study examining cord blood transplantation will require consent before delivery.

Donors may be unaffected carriers of these anomalies with no family history of such disease. Such genetic diseases arise when a child inherits an affected gene from both the mother and father.

Also, 1 of 100 donor applicants was found to be a heterozygous carrier. The researchers determined that the chance was 1 in 16,100 that an individual who had no family history of cystic fibrosis and who used a DNA-tested donor would bear a child with the disease.

Genes for some diseases, such as those discussed above, are determinative when both parents pass them on and their offspring have the disease. Other genes are not determinative, such as the recently discovered gene for breast cancer; scientists still do not know what it means to carry this gene. Some reproductive tissue facilities go beyond the AATB standards and perform chromosomal analyses and testing for the gene that has been implicated in breast cancer. Genetic testing is an emerging science, none of these tests are 100-percent accurate, and FDA has not approved or cleared them for the intended use of screening reproductive donors; therefore, FDA does not plan to require that such tests be performed.

FDA officials believe that requiring facilities to record and investigate errors and accidents without reporting to the agency even a subset of the most serious ones is sufficient to monitor the industry. In fact, FDA interprets section 361 of PHS (which authorizes regulations to control the spread of communicable disease) as authorizing regulations requiring the reporting of tissue failures based on problems associated with processing, among other events, because repeated tissue failures may require repeated tissue transplants, thereby increasing potential exposure to communicable disease. But because errors and accidents are often early warning signals of noncompliance or poor practices, FDA is missing an opportunity to identify tissue facilities that would benefit from additional FDA oversight.

A 1994 survey of 54 tissue facilities reported that only 34 percent of the respondents were always capable of identifying the patient who received their tissues, and only 10.5 percent routinely received feedback on tissue use from hospitals.", "AATB standards state that the records management system of a facility should permit the reciprocal tracing of tissues from donors to those who receive them and back. Also, the standards state that upon discovering the need for recalling tissues, facilities should promptly notify all entities to whom affected tissue was distributed or dispensed. For this reason, some within the tissue industry have called for regulations requiring that receiving institutions or clinicians be responsible for keeping records of the final disposition of tissues so that tissue facilities can identify recipients of tissues that might be contaminated.", "Moreover, a CDC guideline for preventing the transmission of HIV through the transplantation of human tissue and organs recommends that all facilities involved in the acquisition of tissues or organs from a single donor be able to communicate among themselves for the purpose of tracking tissues and organs to recipients who should be notified when HIV transmission is confirmed.", "Imposing tracking requirements is not without precedent within FDA. Presently, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health has a tracking requirement for approximately 20 percent of the devices it regulates that is based on the potential for serious adverse health consequences. Specifically, section 519(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360i) requires that manufacturers track certain devices from the manufacturer through the distribution chain to the patient. Devices covered under this section include heart valves, vascular grafts, breast and penile implants, and pacemakers. This tracking permits manufacturers to directly notify patients of a recall when a problem has been identified. Similarly, blood facilities are required to track units from donors who subsequently test positive for HIV to the recipients of those units (C.F.R. 610.47(b)).", "To date, however, a significant gap remains in the tracing of tissues. FDA officials stated that the proposed approach addresses this problem, but tissue tracking is mentioned in the proposed approach only as an example of good tissue practices and its role in the transmission of communicable diseases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stem Cell Therapies Are Not Yet Well Characterized", "paragraphs": ["Under the proposed approach, tissues transplanted from one person to another for their normal function (homologous use) without undergoing extensive processing (minimal manipulation) would be subject to infectious disease screening and testing, and to requirements for good tissue practices, but would not need FDA review or premarket approval.Thus, most processors of conventional and reproductive tissues would not be required to submit information about their products to FDA or to seek its permission to market those products.", "The proposed approach would require premarket approval for tissues that were processed extensively (more than minimally manipulated), combined with nontissue components, used for purposes other than their normal function (nonhomologous use), or contained a metabolic mode of action. This latter category would include stem cells that were obtained for allogeneic use, defined in the proposed approach as unrelated allogeneic transplants. Stem cells that were obtained for autologous use or from a close blood relative (related allogeneic) would not require FDA approval.", "A current moratorium on the requirement for IND and premarket approval applications allows the stem cell community time to collect information that may provide FDA with adequate data to promulgate standards. If sufficient data do not become available to establish processing and product standards after a specified period of time, stem cell products will be subject to IND and marketing application requirements. The approach notes that FDA intends to invite professional groups and individuals to submit data and standards that they believe would ensure the safety and effectiveness of stem cell transplantation. FDA intends to list in the Federal Register questions relevant for collecting data on volume, storage temperature limits, limits on microbial or other contamination, viable cell number, and functionality. In addition, FDA will request information on procedures for handling, transporting, storing, and thawing materials and for when and how contamination and viability testing should be carried out.", "For several reasons, we are concerned about the demarcation that the proposed approach makes between unrelated allogeneic and related allogeneic donations. Efficacious collection, processing, and storing methods are not yet well characterized within the cord and peripheral blood stem cell community. The mitigation of this problem is not related to the source of stem cells (autologous, family-related, or unrelated allogeneic), even though the proposed approach makes a demarcation between the source of the stem cells and whether premarket approval should be required. Furthermore, the academic medical community considers the collection of data on the safety and efficacy of umbilical cord blood transplantation to be at the investigational phase. For example, a 1996 scientific research report of 18 allogeneic transplantations described its research as \u201ca phase I clinical trial.\u201d", "Stem cells from umbilical cord blood are typically collected by attending obstetricians or nurses during delivery. Most collections are performed by medical personnel who have had no formal collection training and, indeed, may be collecting cord blood for the first time. Meanwhile, research has shown that different collection and processing techniques affect levels of bacterial contamination and the viability of cells. For example, the rate of bacterial contamination was 3.3 percent for collections that used closed systems and 12.5 percent for collections that used open systems.", "Cord-clamping time was also found to influence the volume of cord blood collection and, therefore, the potential to obtain more stem cells. However, many facilities instruct obstetricians to \u201cclamp the cord as you normally would.\u201d Additionally, the efficacy of separation procedures to obtain stem cells from the cord blood was markedly reduced when the cord blood samples were stored for more than 12 hours before separation. Cord blood collected for private banking is usually not processed before 24 or even 48 hours. The investigators also questioned the validity of some traditional methods of determining the potential for the collected cells to engraft sufficiently to restore a patient\u2019s immune system.", "Similarly, much is still not known about the optimal collection and assessment of viable stem cells from peripheral blood. Because the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell has not yet been isolated, all current methods of measuring the efficacy of the collection and quality of peripheral or cord blood progenitor cells are indirect. Some studies have examined collection and processing methods to determine which ones yield more viable stem cells for transplantation, but investigators have noted that the protocols and procedures used to collect peripheral blood cells have not been standardized.", "While some information points to greater success in transplants from related donors, the factors that influence the success of cord blood transplants are just emerging. For example, recent research has pointed out that patients who received cord blood from an unrelated donor had significantly lower estimates of survival at 1 year\u201429 percent versus 63 percent for recipients of related donors. As with bone marrow transplants, greater success was achieved with a donor with identical human leukocyte antigen (HLA), which is more likely to occur with a related donor. GVHD was different between HLA-matched and unmatched donors and recipients. GVHD occurred in 9 percent of 60 recipients of HLA-matched cord blood and in 50 percent of 18 recipients of mismatched cord blood. However, none of the GVHD cases were life-threatening. This study also found that for the 143 transplants examined at 45 participating centers, methods of collecting, cryopreserving, storing, and thawing cord blood varied widely. For example, the number of cells infused after thawing ranged from 7 million to 300 million. This factor was a significant predictor of successful outcomes. Other important factors included a recipient\u2019s age and weight, diagnosis, and cytomegalovirus-negative test results.", "As a result of the issues raised above, some experts in the field of stem cell transplantation have noted that FDA should require premarket approval for cord and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, whether or not the cells were obtained from a close blood relative or a stranger, because such transplants are not yet well characterized. Other experts in stem cell transplantation from both academia and industry, including FACHT and the American Society for Clinical Oncology, have opposed such an approach. Private cord blood banks also disagree, stating that they would be put out of business by premarket approval requirements because federal statutes forbid profitmaking when a product has premarket approval status.", "In sum, several safety issues arise when transplanting metabolic cells. Stem cells and other products characterized by a metabolic mode of action usually rely on viable, functioning cells. They are therefore sensitive to collection, processing, and storage perturbations and may not retain normal function after transplantation. Because transplantation therapy is routinely used to reconstitute the blood of patients whose own defective blood cells have been completely destroyed by chemotherapy or irradiation, the failure or improper functioning of such products could end in a broad variety of systemically adverse events, including death. We are concerned that the state of knowledge about these tissue therapies is not well characterized and poses equivalent risks to recipients whether the source of stem cells is a relative or an anonymous donor."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Processing Techniques May Affect Safety and Efficacy", "paragraphs": ["The proposed approach considers the processing of cells and nonstructural tissues to be more than minimal manipulation when it alters the biological characteristics (and, thus, potentially the function or integrity) of the cells or tissues or when it is unknown whether it will alter them. Examples include cell expansion, activation, and genetic modification. More than minimally manipulated cells or tissues would be subject to processing controls and to premarket requirements to determine safety and effectiveness. FDA would evaluate the processing techniques in the course of reviewing premarket applications and would inspect firms to assess their operations and review their processing techniques before granting marketing approval.", "The proposal is different for minimally manipulated tissues. For these tissues, FDA would require that the validation of the procedures be documented and available when FDA inspects a facility but would not require the submission of any information on processing. The proposed approach considers the processing of cells and tissues to be minimal manipulation when it does not alter their original relevant characteristics, such as those relating to the ability of cells or tissues to carry out the function of reconstruction or repair. Examples include cutting, grinding, and shaping; soaking in antibiotic solution; sterilization by ethylene oxide or gamma irradiation; cell separation; and cryopreservation. Tissues that were processed with minimal manipulation would be subject to good tissue practices relating to contamination, integrity, and function that FDA would establish in future rulemaking. However, FDA currently has limited information on which to base criteria for these practices, and we found few processing techniques that had been validated by tissue facilities and evaluated by FDA for safety and effectiveness.", "In several interviews, we obtained information regarding processes some facilities use that may be harmful to the efficacy of tissues or that have no established safety or efficacy record (for example, the use of bleach and peroxide or \u201cair drying\u201d). We did not independently verify what we were told. Below, we present information we gathered from these interviews and from the scientific research that highlights potential safety and efficacy issues. Some procedures that remove or destroy bacteria hamper the ability of tissue to remain viable. For instance, sterilization can destroy the viability of grafts, and irradiation and freeze-drying both reduce biomechanical strength. Therefore, cryopreserved skin, heart valve, and osteochondral bone grafts cannot be treated with these methods. Furthermore, chemical sterilization by exposure to ethylene oxide or demineralization techniques may adversely affect the regenerating properties of bone, although the evidence is controversial. Similarly, although many tissue facilities use dimethyl sulfoxide in their cryopreservation practices, FDA has not approved this product for such purposes.", "Ethylene oxide has been used with fluorocarbon (or freon) in an inactivation technique for tendons. However, it has been shown to result in residuals that were carcinogenic and deteriorated the tendons. Some tissue facilities use bleach and peroxide on bones, although this causes structural weaknesses. Also, other facilities have advertised the use of \u201cair drying,\u201d although this technique is unfamiliar to some tissue facility officials as an efficacious tool for inactivation. Gamma radiation is also used to process bone. For weight-bearing transplants, this process has been found to increase susceptibility to fracture (not all processors use this technique, but some do). Irradiation may be a good viral inactivation procedure, but it can cause mechanical problems in the processed bone.", "Although some physical and chemical agents have been shown to reduce the likelihood of isolating virus from treated solid tissues, we found no conclusive evidence that those processes render solid tissue completely safe and structurally intact. In a case of HIV transmission through the use of fresh-frozen bone allografts from a donor who was negative on HIV screening but who infected four organ recipients and three of four recipients of fresh-frozen bone, it was found that more than 25 other recipients of tissue from this donor did not become infected. The latter group were transplanted with tissues that were relatively avascular; thus, it is unclear whether HIV transmission was absent because of processing or vascularity or both.", "Although processes used to clean, sterilize, and render infectious agents harmless may affect the safety and efficacy of the tissue being processed, FDA officials agree that they have little information about the types of techniques currently in use and that they have not specified the processes that can be used safely and efficaciously. The proposed approach would require that facilities validate their procedures for safety and efficacy and make this information available to FDA upon inspection. However, the proposed approach would not require facilities to notify FDA of processing techniques defined as minimal manipulation, nor would facilities be required to submit safety and efficacy data on those processes. Submitting this information to FDA would provide the agency with a baseline understanding of industry practice."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In its proposed approach, FDA addresses three problems we identified as not covered in the current regulation: registration of tissue banks, oversight of reproductive and stem cell facilities, and false product claims. However, the proposed approach is still in its formative stages and will be codified over a number of years. Until then, these concerns will remain.", "We identified two problems that are not addressed in either FDA\u2019s current regulation or its proposed approach. We found that some public umbilical cord blood banks obtain informed consent after collecting the blood. The safety implications of using units from mothers who may not have received prenatal care or who are called upon to answer questions postcollection about high-risk behavior are unknown. Requesting informed consent before delivery provides the mother with the information and opportunity to make a decision before a procedure is performed. Second, the lack of disclosure of genetic testing for donated reproductive tissues limits vital information that, if otherwise available, might alter a recipient\u2019s decision to use tissues from donors who could introduce genetic anomalies.", "In four instances, we found that the proposed approach addresses issues that are not covered in the current regulation but does so in a manner that is inadequate to eliminate potential safety problems. First, the proposed approach would not require the reporting of any errors or accidents, even those that could have serious consequences. Without such reporting, FDA will miss an opportunity to provide warranted oversight. Second, FDA has an inadequate system for tracking tissues to recipients from donors who are later determined to have been virally infected or whose tissues should otherwise not have been transplanted. The inability to trace potentially infectious or otherwise hazardous tissues could have serious public health consequences. Third, FDA plans to require premarket approval for therapies using stem cells if the cells are obtained from an unrelated allogeneic donor. As a matter of policy, FDA will waive this requirement if the cells are obtained from oneself (autologous) or from a close blood relative (related allogeneic). However, the scientific community has not determined optimal collection, separation, processing, and storage procedures for these cellular-based tissues. Because these products are used to reconstitute a patient\u2019s entire immune system, the treatment poses great risk, regardless of whether the source is a relative or an anonymous donor. Fourth, we found that facilities have validated and FDA has evaluated few processing procedures. Some procedures currently in use may, in fact, harm the viability of grafts, reduce their biomechanical strength, and negatively affect the regenerating properties of bone. Without baseline knowledge of industry practice, FDA is hampered in its ability to fully monitor the safety of this aspect of human tissue banking.", "We believe that steps that would generally incur minimal additional cost to the tissue-banking industry could be taken to address these concerns. Many of these steps, requiring little change in the majority of tissue-banking facilities, would correct practices that are not up to industry standards. Two areas could require that additional, more costly, steps be taken: the creation of a system for tracking tissues to recipients and the imposition of premarket controls upon related allogeneic stem cell therapies if FDA determines that adequate safety and efficacy data are not available after the moratorium it has proposed.

We believe that the current umbilical cord blood banking protocols, operating under FDA-accepted INDs, will be worthwhile in ascertaining the safety consequences of obtaining informed consent for cord blood collection after delivery. This information should be used to determine the manner and time at which collection is to take place. However, it should be noted that a working group on ethical issues in cord blood banking concluded that informed consent should be obtained before procuring placental blood for transplantation because not obtaining consent before delivery does not allow mothers to make decisions before collection.Additionally, obtaining consent before birth accords mothers sufficient time to deliberate any decisions they might have made before the collection began. 2. We believe that FDA\u2019s requirement that facilities maintain records of error and accidents and make them available for FDA review during inspections is worthwhile. However, we believe that serious errors and accidents, such as the distribution of unacceptable tissues, should be reported to FDA so that the agency may take immediate action if such problems threaten the public health. Presently, FDA might not learn of such incidents until after it has performed an inspection. FDA officials have noted that they do not plan to conduct routine inspections of tissue facilities. Furthermore, FDA\u2019s present authority to seize tissue products and enjoin tissue facilities is available only for products that are more than minimally manipulated, nonhomologous, and so on. By requiring tissue facilities to report serious errors and accidents, FDA would be able to obtain information pertinent to activities that might compromise human tissue safety or effectiveness. 3. We understand that FDA intends to allow the cord blood stem cell community time to collect information that would provide the agency with adequate data to promulgate standards. FDA officials have stated that if they cannot determine that adequate safety and effectiveness data are available, unrelated allogeneic cord blood stem cell transplants would require an IND. These officials have also noted that an IND would not be required for family-related allogeneic stem cell transplants because FDA is trying to accommodate the concerns and needs of families. However, as we point out in our report, different collection and processing techniques can affect levels of bacterial contamination and the viability of the stem cells, and collection, processing, and storing methods are not yet well characterized within the cord and peripheral blood stem cell communities. The mitigation of these problems is not related to where one obtains these stem cells (autologous, family-related, or unrelated allogeneic). As a result, there is no scientific basis on which to make a demarcation for premarket submissions based on the source of the stem cell, and we believe that patients whose source of stem cells is a family member should be afforded the same safety considerations as those who obtain stem cells from someone unrelated. 4. We agree with FDA\u2019s position that certain products should require premarket review (for example, more than minimally manipulated or not homologous) that would also include an evaluation of their manufacturing processes. We also agree with FDA\u2019s position that tissue facilities should be required to validate processing procedures for products that do not fall under such categories and have documentation available for FDA inspection. However, we have provided information in our report on processing techniques that may result in only minimal manipulation but may destroy the viability of grafts, affect biomechanical strength, and hamper the regenerating properties of bone. Thus, we are concerned about these processes still being employed before the codification of a requirement to maintain validation studies. Additionally, since FDA does not intend to conduct routine inspections of tissue facilities, the agency will not have adequate opportunity to evaluate the documentation of these validation studies. Once facilities are required to document the validation of their procedures, it would pose little burden to ask that the documentation be submitted to FDA rather than waiting for inspections.
