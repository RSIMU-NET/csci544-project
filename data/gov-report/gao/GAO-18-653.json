Since 1999, OBO has built 77 embassies under its Capital Security Construction Program (CSCP), at a total cost of about $24 billion as of fiscal year 2017. CSCP's pace has been affected by unexpected additional building requirements, such as office annexes and Marine quarters. Also, CSCP received only one program funding adjustment for inflation since 1999, and State does not intend to seek annual adjustments. Currently, OBO does not provide information on inflationary effects on CSCP or an estimated total capital investment or feasible time frames for the nearly 50 embassies identified for replacement beyond 2022. Lack of such information may affect stakeholders' ability to make informed budget decisions.", "While cost growth occurred on a majority of completed embassy projects and durations averaged about 36 months, these were generally within budgeting and planning allowances.

Without an OBO-wide workforce analysis, it is unclear whether OBO's staffing is commensurate with its workload needs. OBO maintains that its office overseeing project design reviews is understaffed, adversely affecting some of its critical functions. Contractors also expressed concerns about the quality of design reviews, which may be affected by a staffing shortage and the use of temporary contractors.

More than 86,000  U.S. government employees are housed in these facilities. On August 7,  1998, terrorists bombed the U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar  es Salaam, Tanzania, killing over 220 people and injuring more than  4,000 others. Following those attacks, the Secure Embassy Construction  and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 required State to develop and report a  list of diplomatic facilities scheduled for replacement, prioritized on the  basis of their vulnerability to terrorist attack.

However, as we\u2019ve previously  reported, State completed only 24 of the 57 planned construction  projects, in part due to poor planning, systemic weaknesses in program  management, difficulties acquiring sites, schedule delays, cost increases,  and subsequent funding limitations. Following the demise of the Inman  program in the early 1990s, State initiated very few new embassy projects  until after the two 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.  Following the bombings in Africa, the Secure Embassy Construction and  Counterterrorism Act of 1999 required State to develop and report a list of  diplomatic facilities scheduled for replacement based on their vulnerability  to terrorist attack. One of the congressional findings in the Secure  Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999 was that unless  embassy vulnerabilities are addressed in a sustained and financially  realistic manner, the lives and safety of U.S. employees in diplomatic  facilities will continue to be at risk from further terrorist attacks. State  subsequently initiated the CSCP to construct new embassies. The CSCP  is administered by OBO, which in April 2018 had about 1,135 direct-hire  civil service personnel, U.S. Foreign Service officers, and personal  services contractors stationed in Washington, D.C., and overseas.", "The Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999  calls for new diplomatic facilities to be sufficiently sized to ensure that all  U.S. government personnel at a post are located on a single secure site  and that those facilities are set back not less than 100 feet from the site\u2019s  perimeter boundary. Before constructing a new embassy, State must  certify to Congress that, among other things, the facility\u2019s design  incorporates adequate measures for protecting classified information and  activities as well as personnel working in the facilities. OBO contracts  with architectural and engineering firms (design firms) to develop bridging  or full designs meeting security and other project requirements. These  design firms submit their designs for reviews by OBO and Diplomatic  Security to ensure conformance with building code and security  standards, respectively. Diplomatic Security, in consultation with the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence, must certify that the design  meets security standards prior to the start of construction. While this  certification occurs during the design phase of a project, Diplomatic  Security also has other roles in the process, such as participating in site  selection, ensuring OBO contractors have necessary security clearances,  and ensuring facilities are securely constructed.", "After passage of the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism  Act of 1999, State determined that embassies at 180 posts\u2014out of 260  posts at the time\u2014needed to be replaced to meet security standards.  State adjusted this milestone\u2014to building 150 embassies by 2018\u2014in  2005, when it worked with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  to establish the Capital Security Cost-Sharing Program (cost-sharing),  with a primary goal of accelerating the replacement of embassies.  Under cost-sharing, nearly 30 U.S. agencies with a presence in U.S.  embassies were to provide a total of $17.5 billion for constructing the  150 new embassies by 2018\u201412 years sooner than had been projected  without cost sharing.

The SED was a set of documents providing  prototypical plans for a medium-sized embassy including specifications  and design criteria, and explaining how to adapt those to a particular site  and project. The SED was not a complete design but rather a  standardized template for the structural, spatial, and security  requirements of a new embassy compound to guide a contractor\u2019s final  design. Compound elements described by the SED generally included the  main office building; U.S. Marine security guards\u2019 living quarters; a  warehouse; a utility building; compound access control buildings and  perimeter walls; and parking facilities. The SED also allowed for the  standardization of building components such as security windows and  doors.

Under this model, the design-build  contractor is responsible for both design and construction and thus  generally bears the risks, such as added cost, for any design problems  because the contractor hires the design firm to bring the design to  completion. Under the SED approach, OBO hired its own design firms  beforehand to conduct project development activities such as planning  surveys, site studies, and other analyses needed to inform the project\u2019s  design. OBO would utilize these design firms to develop a scope of work  and provide the design-build contractor a concept or schematic design  showing how OBO expected the office chancery and supporting embassy  facilities to be arranged on the site using the SED prototypical design to  include standard site and building plans, technical specifications, design  criteria, and instructions for its adaptation for a particular project and  contract requirements.

This was nearly 3 years faster  than embassies built during the Inman era. However, while the SED approach enabled OBO to accelerate the construction of new embassies,  some stakeholders raised concerns about the aesthetics, quality, location,  and functionality of those facilities. Criticisms included that the SED  embassies had a \u201cfortress-like\u201d appearance that detracted from their  symbolic value in presenting American ideals of openness and  innovation; that the emphasis on speed and cost control resulted in  poorer-quality buildings and removal of functional elements such as  warehouses; that the 10-acre lot specified by the SED required siting  embassies too far from urban centers where foreign government offices  are located; and that the standardized aspects of its design were difficult  to adapt to unique site conditions and post needs.", "To address some of these criticisms, OBO began to use design-build with  bridging (bridging) as a delivery method in 2008 with the first construction  project awarded in 2009. Generally under this method, OBO first  contracts with a design firm (the bridging architect) to develop a project- specific, partial design package (bridging design) that conveys State\u2019s  design vision and a higher level of detail for key design requirements.  Such details that State might convey in a bridging design could include  the selection of specific building systems (e.g., the types of structural  foundation systems to be used for each building on the site) or post- specific security features (e.g., location, types, and heights of security  walls and bollards to be used around and within the site). Unlike the SED,  each bridging design is project-specific, customized, and separately  executed by an outside design firm contracted by OBO. The extent of  each bridging design varies by project but generally approximates an  overall 35- to 50-percent completed design, according to OBO officials.  OBO\u2019s procedure is to then separately contract with a construction  contractor (and its own design firm) to complete the design and build the  project. Figure 3 provides an overview of the embassy construction  process under bridging.", "Although customized, OBO\u2019s bridging designs continued to use the SED  as a starting point for several years after OBO adopted bridging in 2008.  However, criticisms aimed at the underlying SED elements continued, for  instance, that the standardized design sometimes hindered adaptation of  designs in response to different climates, countries, or unique post  functions. In 2011, OBO initiated the Excellence approach, which placed  greater emphasis on custom designs for each project. OBO subsequently  phased out the SED as the basis for embassy designs, and according to  OBO officials, SED specifications, standards and guidance were  incorporated into OBO\u2019s Design Standards and Design Guide.  According to OBO officials, by 2014, design firms hired by OBO to  develop bridging designs no longer used the SED as a starting point. In  addition, OBO shifted to greater use of the design-bid-build delivery  method alongside bridging. Generally under design-bid-build, OBO first  solicits and contracts with a design firm to develop a 100-percent design.  Under this method, OBO then uses the completed design to solicit bids  from prospective construction contractors. According to OBO  documentation, OBO selects a project\u2019s delivery method, either bridging  or design-bid-build, based on an evaluation of a project\u2019s local context,  complexity, construction factors, and urgency. Figure 4 provides an  overview of the embassy construction process under design-bid-build.", "Under both bridging and design-bid-build, OBO generally bears greater  risk than it did under strict design-build in the SED approach.

The 1999 ARB following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania  and Kenya recommended that embassy construction and other security  improvements be funded at $1.4 billion per year over 10 years. With the  introduction of cost-sharing in 2005, State set an annual CSCP funding  goal of $1.4 billion, as the 1999 ARB had recommended, as well as the  goal of completing 150 new embassies by 2018 for a projected funding  total of $17.5 billion. However, State officials indicated that when the  program was established, no provision was made for potential inflation  over the life of the program. Therefore, while CSCP funding generally  increased from 2005 through 2010, OBO officials stated that CSCP  funding gradually purchased less than anticipated due to the lack of an  inflation adjustment. This absence of inflation as a built-in factor in  program planning is in contrast to OBO\u2019s cost estimates for individual new  embassy projects. Those project-level cost projections account for  inflation and recognize that the projects will typically take at least 3 years  to build.

For example, the U.S. Department  of State (State) reported moving over 30,000  people (out of more than 86,000) into more  secure facilities from 2000 through 2014.      We attempted to assess CSCP performance  on this measure on a project-by-project basis  but found it unreliable for the purpose of  establishing how many staff have been  moved into newly constructed facilities.  State\u2019s Bureau of Overseas Buildings  Operations (OBO) officials explained that the  \u201cnumber of staff moved\u201d metric was based on  the projected desk and non-desk positions  within each embassy construction contract.

Rather, OBO\u2019s approach is to request $2.2 billion annually in  accordance with the Benghazi ARB\u2019s recommendation. According to  these officials, this approach allows agencies that contribute to cost- sharing to consistently plan for a predictable funding level, and OBO will  work to complete as many projects as soon as possible within this annual  funding level. Further, they noted that State does not intend to seek  annual inflation adjustments for the CSCP.", "In general, according to OBO policy, the CSCP is guided by Diplomatic  Security\u2019s annual Security Environment Threat List of security rankings  for posts, from which OBO develops a \u201cTop 80\u201d list of the 80 most at-risk  posts needing a new embassy. OBO uses the Top 80 list to develop  and adjust the CSCP schedule, which presents planned embassy awards  for the current fiscal year and for each of the next 5 fiscal years. For  example, the November 2016 CSCP schedule (current at the end of fiscal  year 2017) listed the 5 posts slated for awards in fiscal year 2017. In  addition, it listed the 25 posts slated for awards in fiscal years 2018  through 2022, grouped by the specific fiscal year when OBO anticipated  being able to award the relevant construction contracts. The nearly 50  embassies planned for beyond fiscal year 2022 were broadly categorized  in an \u201cout-year\u201d category in the November 2016 CSCP schedule.", "According to leading practices in capital decision-making we have  previously identified, agencies\u2019 long-term capital plans should provide  insight into likely funding and other resources and time frames needed to  achieve organizational mission goals. We also noted in our guide to  leading practices that, while out-year cost estimates are preliminary, they  help provide decision makers with an overall sense of funding needs and  that such long-range planning assists in developing both current and  future budgets.", "OBO\u2019s fiscal year 2017 CSCP schedule does not identify estimated costs,  either at the project or aggregate level. According to OBO officials,  scope, cost, and size estimates are communicated on a project-specific  basis to stakeholders through briefings and each fiscal year\u2019s  congressional notifications listing projects to be implemented in the  coming years. According to these officials, the CSCP schedule is  intended to be a flexible way to communicate a snapshot of OBO\u2019s  prioritization of posts to receive embassy awards over the next 5 fiscal  years, emphasizing that the exact list can change. For example, a new  embassy project might be advanced sooner than originally planned due to  a change in State\u2019s security or policy priorities. Conversely, a project may  be moved out to a later fiscal year due to challenges that OBO believes  may be posed by the host government or other challenges identified  during or after site acquisition. Although the CSCP does track the  projected timing of some specific projects, State lacks a strategic planning  document that estimates longer term CSCP resource needs. For  example, the CSCP schedule contains no estimated 5-year program cost  for the next 25 embassies OBO plans to build, nor does it provide  stakeholders an estimate or cost range for the total capital investment  and feasible time frames needed to address the 47 embassies that OBO  has identified for replacement beyond the next 5 years.", "Additionally, guidance from OMB indicates that when developing budget  estimates agencies should consider the effect that economic or other  changes can have on program levels beyond the budget year. OMB  guidance further states that agencies should be prepared to discuss the  impact that program levels and changes in methods of program delivery  will have on program operations and administration. OMB guidance  states that for discretionary programs, agencies may include an  allowance for the full rate of anticipated inflation, less than the full rate, or  no allowance for inflation. The guidance recognizes that agencies must  make trade-offs between budget increases for inflation versus other  increases for programmatic purposes.", "Given that it contains no cost information, the CSCP schedule is not  meant to be a tool to forecast and convey to stakeholders the long-term  effects of inflation on program capacity. Therefore, considering the 72  embassies yet to be replaced, past inflationary effects, and the CSCP\u2019s  pace thus far, it is unclear what pace OBO will be able to maintain without  some level of inflation adjustment to its funding goal of $2.2 billion per  year.

The bridging design called for all metal site furnishings  and railings to be a bronze tone in color. The bridging designer  specifically indicated the use of bronze color throughout the design was  intended to relate to the local metal craft of the region. An OBO official we  spoke with indicated that while he understood there might be some  savings for changing the handrail to aluminum, he felt the designer\u2019s  intent in specifying the use of a bronze handrail was clear and was  approved by OBO during the design review process, and thus he did not  feel it would be appropriate to make a change.

For example, OBO  project documentation shows the use of a customized glass exterior wall  designed for the Jakarta, Indonesia, embassy significantly impacted cost  and schedule after contract award, adding at least $18 million to the cost  and 180 days to the schedule. According to project documentation as well  as OBO and contractor officials, OBO\u2019s decision to employ a unique glass  curtain-wall system for that project and subsequent questions raised by  Diplomatic Security about the design, led OBO to modify the contract to  add (1) $2.2 million and 180 added days to explore alternative designs  and conduct redesign work in order to obtain Diplomatic Security  certification; (2) $13.3 million, which OBO told us was for a dedicated  facility to be established in the United States to securely fabricate the  glass curtain wall before secure shipment to the site; and (3) $3 million to  have cleared American workers install portions of the wall. OBO had not  previously employed such a system in a completed embassy project and  could not provide us with documentation analyzing the risks of such a  feature to cost and schedule\u2014which might have included potential delays  to get Diplomatic Security\u2019s approval of the design\u2014compared with  conventional concrete construction.

Senior management expressed concerns about the appearance of  the screen, mainly that the screen was too traditional compared with the  spirit of the design of the building and the rest of the campus and that the  pattern of the screen needed more variation for daylight and views. To  respond to this concern, OBO issued two contract modifications to OBO\u2019s  architect for additional design work for the exterior screen. OBO told us  that subsequent design development for three alternatives for the screen  contributed an additional design cost of about $750,000, raising the final  bridging design cost to approximately $10.5 million.

The second approach, increasing the  workforce, proposed that OBO hire more Design and Engineering staff to  support all the office\u2019s responsibilities. According to a senior OBO official,  OBO\u2019s Deputy Director at the time determined the best course of action  was to implement a workforce increase, and in 2016 he instructed Design  and Engineering\u2019s Director to plan to increase the office\u2019s authorized staff  from approximately 150 to 250 people over several years. However,  OBO officials told us this decision was a goal at that time and did not  reflect any formal staffing authorization by OBO or State; for that reason,  it was not reflected in any OBO human capital staffing assessment or  plan.

It notes that partnering  itself is not a contractual agreement and it does not create any legally  enforceable rights. Instead, partnering seeks to create a new cooperative  attitude in completing government contracts. The three basic steps in  partnering identified by State\u2019s supplement are as follows:  1.  Establish the new relationship through personal contact among the  principals for the government and the contractor before the work  begins.  2.

We reported similar  collaboration concerns raised by OBO contractors in 2009 when we  examined contractor participation in the embassy construction program  and the decline in the number of contractors participating in the  program. In 2009, 10 of 17 construction contractors rated State as a  poor or fair business partner. Of the 17 construction contractors surveyed  in 2009, 3 had received about 62 percent of OBO\u2019s construction contract  awards from 2001 through 2007.

They suggested that OBO should utilize more formal partnering to  bring new contractors into the program. They also cited the need to have  both formal and informal processes for elevating and resolving issues in  order to provide accountability at all levels and ensure that issues are  addressed in a timely manner. The contractor believes that formal  partnering could lessen the learning curve for new firms, reduce the  conflicts between OBO PDs and the contractors\u2019 project managers on- site, and keep more firms in the program.", "Formal partnering, particularly with firms that have less experience with  embassy construction, could help avoid adversarial working relationships  between OBO and contractors that inhibit swift resolution of, or even  exacerbate, challenges experienced on already-complex projects.

In his view, it seemed like the  contractors at that time were using the partnering agreement to claim that  OBO was not partnering properly. However, other OBO officials stated  that they understood the practice of partnering by some federal agencies  has evolved since that time. OBO officials agreed that although OBO had  not considered formal partnering recently, it could potentially be useful, particularly if tried on smaller projects with new contractors or those less  experienced with embassy construction.

State\u2019s CSCP made  steady progress through fiscal year 2017, completing 77 new embassies  and starting construction on 21 more at a cost of just over $24 billion.  However, State will not achieve its 2005 forecast for building 150  embassies by 2018 because progress has been hampered, in part, by  unforeseen building requirements and inflation that were not originally  factored into CSCP funding levels. These issues will affect State\u2019s  progress as it continues to replace embassies that do not meet security  standards. Because State does not currently intend to seek annual  inflationary adjustments for CSCP, although individual projects do  address inflation to some extent, the CSCP\u2019s pace of embassy production  is likely to be reduced over time. As State continues to work with the  Congress to chart the future course, priorities, and funding levels for the  program, regular information on the effects of cost inflation would be  helpful as stakeholders reassess the CSCP program\u2019s funding level from  year to year.", "Moreover, State plans to begin the construction of 25 new embassies  within the next 5 years and has identified the need to replace nearly 50  additional embassies in later years. While the CSCP schedule identifies  future embassy replacements, it does not address the projected cost and  time needed to achieve the CSCP\u2019s ultimate critical goal of replacing  embassies that do not meet State\u2019s security standards. Recognizing that  precise estimates cannot be easily made for later years, even a notional  long-term estimate of the CSCP\u2019s overall capital funding investment and  time frames, along with an assessment of risk factors such as inflation,  would strengthen State\u2019s ability to support and sustain its funding needs,  encourage dialogue with congressional committees, and promote  consensus by decision makers in the executive and legislative branches  on funding levels and expectations for program progress.", "Additionally, State\u2019s shift to the Excellence approach was predicated on  the idea that customized designs would produce embassy compounds  that are more innovative, functional, and sustainable than those built  using the SED approach, and would also be at least as secure and more  cost efficient to operate. It is too early to tell whether this greater upfront  investment in design will yield cost and schedule benefits during  construction of Excellence embassies or over their life cycle. While past  embassies have generally been completed within expected cost and  schedule allowances, given the number of embassies yet to be built to  meet urgent security needs amid a constrained resource environment, it  remains incumbent upon State to realistically assess its ability under  Excellence to deliver embassies as efficiently as possible. By  comprehensively evaluating its human capital needs against CSCP  priorities and other workload demands, OBO can provide program  stakeholders\u2014including State, OMB, and Congress\u2014the ability to make  fully informed choices as to the capacity of OBO\u2019s design and  construction organization to support embassy production of these  embassies in the near and longer term.", "Furthermore, formal partnering could provide OBO with a tool to enhance  collaboration both on-site and between contractors and OBO  headquarters. This could mitigate the unforeseen issues that arise on all  of these challenging overseas projects, but which may be more  complicated to resolve for Excellence projects because each one is  unique.

We chose fiscal year 2008 because that year  OBO modified its Standard Embassy Design (SED) delivery program to  allow for more bridging design to better tailor the SEDs to specific sites.  This time frame would also capture Excellence-like projects awarded  between the introduction of Excellence in 2011 and the full  implementation of Excellence in 2014, as well as pure Excellence projects  awarded in 2014 and later. Of the embassy construction projects awarded  since fiscal year 2008, we identified 22 completed projects and another  21 underway.", "To assess the cost performance of these projects, we used cost data  drawn from the Federal Procurement Data System and back-checked  against OBO-provided contract data, which we found to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. We then compared any increases in cost from  the contract value at award to OBO\u2019s general cost contingency for  unforeseen changes on embassy construction projects, which ranges  from 5 to 10 percent. To assess schedule performance, we compared  construction durations from contract documentation with a benchmark of  36 months. We used that benchmark because, in the past, OBO has  maintained that a SED would generally take no more than 36 months to  construct and that construction durations would not be any different under  Excellence. This benchmark was further informed by past GAO  reporting. We did not assess the cost or schedule performance of the 21  projects still ongoing at the end of fiscal year 2017. Because these were  ongoing projects at different stages of construction, we could not  determine whether they would finish within their budget contingency, nor  could we assess their final schedule performance. Furthermore, because  no pure Excellence projects had been completed by the end of fiscal year  2017, we could not compare cost increases or schedule performance of  Excellence projects with SED projects.", "To examine factors that have affected State\u2019s ability to deliver  construction projects efficiently, we selected nine construction case  studies out of our universe of projects awarded in fiscal year 2008  through fiscal year 2015, and funded through CSCP.
