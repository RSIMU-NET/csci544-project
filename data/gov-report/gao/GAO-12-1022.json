They explained that in a  collaborative process, the participants may not have the same overall  interests\u2014in fact they may have conflicting interests. However, by  establishing a goal based on what the group shares in common, rather  than on where there is disagreement among missions or philosophies, a  collaborative group can shape its own vision and define its own purpose.  When articulated and understood by the members of a group, this shared  purpose provides people with a reason to participate in the process.

In particular, the mental health care line director\u2019s performance  agreement included improvement goals related to mental health for the  entire VISN. To make progress towards these goals, this care line director  had to work across each of the VISN\u2019s four medical centers with the  corresponding care line managers at each medical center. As part of this  collaboration, the care line director needed to establish consensus among  VISN officials and external stakeholders on the strategic direction for the  services provided by the mental health care line across the VISN;  develop, implement, and revise integrated clinical programs to reflect that  strategic direction for the VISN; and allocate resources among the  centers for mental health programs to implement these programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Bridging Organizational Cultures", "paragraphs": ["What are the missions and organizational cultures of the participating  agencies?", "What are the commonalities between the participating agencies\u2019  missions and cultures and what are some potential challenges?", "Have participating agencies developed ways for operating across  agency boundaries?", "Have participating agencies agreed on common terminology and  definitions?", "Different agencies participating in any collaborative mechanism bring  diverse organizational cultures to it. Accordingly, it is important to address  these differences to enable a cohesive working relationship and to create  the mutual trust required to enhance and sustain the collaborative effort.  To address these differences, we have found that it is important to  establish ways to operate across agency boundaries. This can involve  measures such as developing common terminology, compatible policies  and procedures, and fostering open lines of communication. We reported  in 2012 that the Interagency Council on Homelessness had taken initial  steps to develop a common vocabulary for discussing homelessness and  related terms, as recommended in our June 2010 report. The Council  held a meeting with participants from stakeholder organizations in  January 2011 and issued a report to Congress in June 2011 that  summarized feedback received during the meeting.

Experts explained that  designating one leader is often beneficial because it centralizes  accountability and can speed decision making. For example, as we  reported in 2007, under the National Pandemic Strategy and  Implementation Plan, HHS and DHS share leadership responsibilities for  pandemic response. In a pandemic, HHS is responsible for areas such as  the public health response, while DHS is responsible for areas such as  border security and critical infrastructure protection. In 2007, we  reported that it was unclear from the strategy and plan how this shared  leadership model would be implemented. In that regard, we  recommended that HHS and DHS clarify these roles through tests and  exercises. As we reported in 2011, these tests and exercises had not  occurred at the start of the H1N1 pandemic and we found that HHS and  DHS were not able to effectively coordinate their release of information to  state and local governments. Once it became clear that the H1N1  pandemic required primarily a public health response, HHS had  responsibility for most of the key activities.that centralized leadership is not always the best model, particularly when  the collaboration needs to have buy-in from more than one agency. By  sharing leadership, agencies can convey their support for the  collaborative effort.", "However, one expert said  Top-level Commitment: Influence of leadership can be strengthened by  a direct relationship with the President, Congress, and/or other high-level  officials. According to a number of former practitioners we interviewed,  their association with the President, members of Congress, or other high- level officials enabled them to influence individuals and organizations  within the federal government to collaborate with one another. As we  reported in 2008, Department of Energy officials said to us that the fact  that the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative was a presidential initiative with  congressional backing helped Hydrogen Fuel Initiative managers garner  support from industry and within the federal government. Our subsequent  work found that the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative worked well as an  interagency effort for a number of years and research and development  progressed rapidly. However, as one agency official noted, when  congressional funding and presidential support waned, so did the  program. In developing the interim federal government priority goals  required under GPRAMA, a majority of the goal leaders designated by  OMB are in the Executive Office of the President, which provides a direct  connection to the President.", "Continuity in Leadership: Given the importance of leadership to any  collaborative effort, transitions and inconsistent leadership can weaken  the effectiveness of any collaborative mechanism. As we illustrate below,  lack of continuity is a frequent issue with presidential advisors or  mechanisms that are tied to the Executive Office of the President,  particularly when administrations change. As we reported in 2011, the  future of the presidentially-appointed Food Safety Working Group was  uncertain. We explained that this uncertainty was based on the  experience of the former President\u2019s Council on Food Safety, the  predecessor to the Food Safety Working Group, which was disbanded  less than 3 years after it was created.

To  facilitate the incentive program, Congress established a U.S. Treasury  account to fund the Joint Incentive Fund activities and required DOD and  VA each to contribute a minimum of $15 million each year to the account.  This program is authorized through September 2015. Additionally, as  we reported in 2011, in the case of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic,  Congress appropriated more than $6 billion in direct and contingent  funding into an HHS emergency fund in order to prepare for and respond  to an influenza pandemic.

These host agencies provide  varying levels of staffing, usually one or two full-time positions\u2014an  executive director and an executive assistant. Some agencies also  temporarily detail employees to the FEB staff to assist their local boards  and to provide developmental opportunities for their employees.  Additionally, the FEBs are supported by member agencies through  contribution of funds as well as in-kind support, such as office space,  personal computers, telephone lines, and Internet access. We noted in  our report that FEBs had previously been limited in the methods available  to fund operations because of the governmentwide restriction against  interagency financing of boards, commissions, councils, committees, and  similar groups without statutory approval. Under this restriction, it was  permissible for one participant agency with a primary interest in the  success of the interagency venture to pay the entire cost of supporting  the functions and administration of the group, but it was not permissible to  support the group through cash and in-kind support from participating  agencies. FEBs were exempted from this restriction in 1996, which then  permitted the interagency financing through member agency contributions  of funds and in-kind support.", "In addition, working capital funds have been used to finance the  sharing/leveraging of business-like services between agencies. As we  reported in 2010, the National Institute for Standards and Technology  (NIST) serves as the focal point for conducting scientific research and  developing measurements, standards, and related technologies in the  federal government. In 1950, Congress established NIST\u2019s working  capital fund, giving the agency broad statutory authority to use the fund to  support any activities NIST is authorized to undertake as an agency.  NIST\u2019s working capital fund is a type of intragovernmental revolving fund.  These funds\u2014which include franchise, supply, and working capital  funds\u2014finance business-like operations. An intragovernmental revolving  fund charges for the sale of products or services it provides and uses the  proceeds to finance its operations. In another example, as we reported in  2011, federal customer agencies use the Department of the Census\u2019  nationwide polling structure, expertise, and address lists, which would  otherwise be uneconomical for them to replicate on their own. For  example, Census supports HUD\u2019s American Housing Survey by gathering  information on the size and composition of the housing inventory in the  United States.", "Regardless of the funding model used, participating agencies need to find  compatible methods for tracking funds for accountability. For example,  the M\u00e9rida Initiative is a partnership between the United States and  Mexico to combat narcotics. As we noted in a December 2009 report,  tracking funds for the M\u00e9rida Initiative was difficult because each of the  three bureaus in the Department of State managing M\u00e9rida funds had a  different method for tracking the money. Each bureau used different  budgeting terms as well as separate spreadsheets for the M\u00e9rida funds it  administered, and the State Department had no consolidated database  for these funds.", "Relying on agencies to participate can present challenges for  collaborative mechanisms. In cases where staff participation was  insufficient, collaboration often failed to meet key objectives and achieve  intended outcomes.

As we have previously reported, having a clear and  compelling rationale to work together\u2014such as that described above\u2014is  a key factor in successful collaborations. Agencies can overcome  significant differences when such a rationale and commitment exist.", "Not all collaborative arrangements need to be documented through  written guidance and agreements, particularly those that are informal.  However, we have found that at times it can be helpful to document key  agreements related to the collaboration. One expert we interviewed  stated that the action of two agencies articulating a common outcome and  roles and responsibilities into a written document was a powerful tool in  collaboration. Accordingly, we have recommended many times that  collaborations would benefit from a formal written agreement, such as a  memorandum of understanding (MOU). For example, in 2008, we  recommended that the Chairman of the Council on Environmental  Quality, working with the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior, direct  an interagency task force to identify goals, actions, responsible work  groups and agencies, and time frames for carrying out the actions needed  to implement the Cooperative Conservation Initiative, including  collaborative resource management, and document these through a  written plan, memorandum of understanding, or other appropriate  means. This recommendation was implemented in January of 2009  when the Council on Environmental Quality, and other departments  involved in cooperative conservation, signed an MOU to create a  framework for collaborative resource management.", "We have also reported that written agreements are most effective when  they are regularly updated and monitored. For example, we reported in  2008, that the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Rural  Development offices of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Rural  Development) entered into an MOU in 2000 that provided an approach to   The MOU expired in 2003 and  collaborate on rural lending activities. SBA and Rural Development did not appear to have implemented the  MOU when it was active. We found that the ineffective implementation of  the MOU had likely contributed to the sporadic and limited amount of  collaboration that was taking place between the two agencies.", "GAO, Rural Economic Development: Collaboration between SBA and USDA Could Be  Improved, GAO-08-1123 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 18, 2008).", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees and other interested parties.

We reviewed these  articles to further determine the extent to which they were relevant to our  engagement, that is, whether they discussed approaches used by the  federal government to lead and implement interagency collaboration or  provided definitions of collaborative governance or interagency  collaboration. We found that 24 (32 percent) of these documents were  relevant to our objectives.

To do this we  first selected a judgmental sample of reports that were published between  January 2005 and August 2011 that contained detailed information  regarding collaborative mechanisms. During this search, we identified  over 200 reports. In order to reduce the size of the sample, we selected  reports that met two or more of the following criteria: discussed collaboration between more than one federal department,  included a mechanism for collaboration, and provided an in-depth discussion of the collaborative mechanism.", "To make our final selection, we identified reports that we generally agreed  met the criteria and reached agreement over selection of reports when  there was disagreement. To refine the sample and ensure that we  covered collaboration across the federal government, we divided the  reports by topic area, and selected reports to ensure that each area was  covered. The reports fell into the topic areas listed in table 1:  We assessed the depth of each report\u2019s discussion on collaborative  mechanisms, and constructed a sample to ensure representation of the  range of categories above and mechanism types.

We then organized and grouped the  mechanisms according to the main types that we found in our review. For  example, we identified three distinct mechanisms that involved positions  and personnel details, including interagency collaborator positions,  liaisons, and personnel details between agencies. Our goal was to  identify and understand the major mechanisms that have been reported in  academic literature and our prior work that have examined interagency  collaboration. As a result, we did not attempt to identify all possible  collaborative mechanisms. After developing a draft list of mechanisms,  we shared it with our collaboration experts and practitioners to gather  their feedback and identify any additional mechanisms, as discussed  above. Five experts agreed that our list of mechanisms was complete,  and we made a number of technical changes to the list based on the  feedback we received.", "This engagement had two phases, which required some updating of the  sample to include more recent reports. As a result, we used the GAO  database to find an additional 100 reports, which were published between  August 2011 and June 2012. This brought the total number of reports in  our sample to 300. Through this process, we selected an additional 9  reports of the 100, which brought the total number of reports we reviewed  to 45. We did not add any mechanisms or key features to the list as a  result of this judgmental sample. We relied on this sample to supplement  the analysis of key issues to consider in implementing the interagency  collaborative mechanisms.", "To identify the purposes for which collaborative mechanisms can be  used, we reviewed our sample of academic literature, discussed the  purposes of interagency collaboration in our interviews with experts, and  analyzed our judgmental sample of prior work. We found that academic  experts and practitioners have used a variety of methods to categorize  the purposes of collaborative mechanisms. The purposes we identified in  our analysis are supported by a number of experts and our prior work.", "To identify the categories of the issues for consideration, we identified  issues that had been raised in expert interviews and the reports that we  reviewed. We selected and organized the issues into the key features that  we present in this report based on factors such as the number of times  issues were raised, the importance experts attached to issues, and the  evidence of their importance that we found in prior GAO work.  Additionally, where possible, we looked for areas where there was  overlap between the issues that we identified and the practices that we  identified in GAO-06-15. While we have generally found that when  agencies address as many of these issues as possible it leads to more  effective implementation of the collaborative mechanisms, we also  recognize that there is a wide range of situations and circumstances in  which agencies work together. Consequently, in some cases, addressing  a few selected issues may be sufficient for effective collaboration.", "We conducted our work from July 2011 to September 2012 in accordance  with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant  to our objectives.
