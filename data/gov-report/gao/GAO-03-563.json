That is, INS has implemented or has defined plans for implementing most of the legislatively mandated requirements for the plan's content, which include such areas as capital planning and investment control, acquisition, and systems acquisition management. However, key issues related to understanding and implementing system requirements, such as developing a system security plan and assessing system impact on the privacy of individuals, remain to be addressed. Moreover, INS reported that it had obligated some entry exit funding before it submitted the plan to the Appropriations Committees. Since then, INS officials told GAO that they have de-obligated and reclassified these obligations to other available funding sources. GAO observed that INS has preliminary plans showing that it intends to acquire and deploy a system that has functional and performance capabilities that satisfy the general scope of capabilities required under various laws. These include the capability to (1) collect and match alien arrival and departure data electronically; (2) be accessible to the border management community (including consular officers, federal inspection agents, and law enforcement and intelligence agencies responsible for identifying and investigating foreign nationals); and (3) support machine-readable, tamper-resistant documents with biometric identifiers at ports of entry. Each of these capabilities is integral to supporting our nation's border security process. However, GAO also observed that the initial plan does not provide sufficient information about INS commitments for the system, such as what specific system capabilities and benefits will be delivered, by when, and at what cost, and how INS intends to manage the acquisition to provide reasonable assurance that it will meet these commitments. Without sufficiently detailed information on system plans and progress, the Congress will be impeded in its efforts to oversee the system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Congress has long recognized the need for a border security system  that collects information about foreign nationals entering and exiting the  United States and identifies those who have overstayed their visits.

More recently, the Congress has passed additional entry exit legislation,  requiring, for example, that the system be integrated with other law  enforcement databases and that it use biometric technologies to better  identify persons entering and exiting the United States.", "To exercise close oversight over the entry exit system, the Congress also  prohibited the INS from obligating funds for the system that were made  available in fiscal year 2002 supplemental appropriations until the agency  submitted to the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations an  expenditure plan (1) that meets the capital planning and investment  control review requirements established by the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB), including Circular A-11, part 3; (2) that complies with the  acquisition rules, requirements, and guidelines and systems acquisition  management practices of the federal government; and (3) that is reviewed  by GAO.", "This report responds to our legislative mandate to review INS\u2019s fiscal year  2002 entry exit system expenditure plan.

The United States  shares over 7,500 miles of land border with Canada and Mexico, and it has  approximately 95,000 miles of shoreline and navigable waterways to  protect. All people and goods that legally enter the United States must  come through one of about 300 land, air, or sea ports of entry and must  undergo what is referred to as \u201cprimary inspection.\u201d In fiscal year 2002,  INS reported that over 440 million persons passed through primary  inspections; approximately 81 percent of these inspections were at land  ports of entry (see table 1).", "Following primary inspection, some persons seeking admission into the  United States go through a more detailed, secondary inspection before  they can be admitted. In fiscal year 2002, INS reported that about 8 million  of the approximately 279 million foreign nationals entering the United  States were admitted through secondary inspections (see table 2). INS  reported that 738,396 were denied admission."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of the Border Security Process", "paragraphs": ["As we previously reported, our nation\u2019s current border security process  for controlling the entry and exit of individuals generally consists of four  primary functions: (1) issuing visas, (2) controlling entry, (3) managing  stays, and (4) controlling exit. Figure 1 depicts these functions, each of  which is described below.", "The visa issuance process begins with the Department of State, which  issues immigrant and nonimmigrant visas to foreign nationals at more  than 200 diplomatic consular posts in approximately 180 countries.  Officials at these consular posts review visa applications, sometimes  interviewing applicants, before issuing a visa. As part of their review of  visa applications, the officials run the applicant\u2019s name through one of the  State Department\u2019s watch lists, the Consular Lookout and Support  System (CLASS), and its Consular Consolidated Database (CCD). If an  application is approved, a visa is issued; if an application is rejected, the  rejection is recorded in CLASS, and the person\u2019s name is electronically  forwarded to the Interagency Border Inspection System (IBIS). The State  Department reports that the majority of visa applications are for  nonimmigrant travel. Canadian citizens and citizens of countries  participating in the Visa Waiver Program who travel to the United States  on business or pleasure for a period of 90 days or less are examples of  two classes of noncitizens that are exempt from these processing  requirements. Figure 2 depicts the visa issuance process.", "Foreign nationals seeking entry into the United States are screened for  admission by INS or U.S. Customs Service inspectors at official air, land,  or sea ports of entry. Generally, this screening consists of questioning each  traveler regarding his or her identity and purpose of visit. The inspector is  to review the person\u2019s travel documents and query IBIS to determine  whether there is a \u201clookout\u201d for the person or vehicle. Once the inspector  has the necessary information, an admission decision is made. If additional  review is necessary, the person is referred to secondary inspection, where  a more detailed review of the travel documents, further questioning, and  queries of multiple systems are to occur. Travelers who are deemed  inadmissible are detained, and they are subject to enforcement actions as  required.", "Arriving foreign nationals must also complete a paper Form I-94, which is  an arrival/departure record. For each arrival, the inspector is to review  the form for accuracy, and if the foreign national is deemed admissible, the  inspector annotates the admission classification and stamps the \u201cAdmit  Until\u201d date on the form. The foreign national is then given the departure  portion of the form for proof of status while in the United States. INS  keeps the arrival portion for entry into the Non-Immigrant Information  System (NIIS) database.", "The previously described inspection process may vary, depending on  travelers\u2019 nationalities. As of October 2002, the National Security Entry  Exit Registration System (NSEERS) program required nonimmigrant  foreign nationals over the age of 16 from certain countries to register with  INS. At the port of entry, these persons are to be fingerprinted,  photographed, and interviewed under oath at the time they apply for entry  into the United States. The inspector also annotates the Form I-94 with a  Fingerprint Identification Number to show that the person has registered.  (App. III provides more information on NSEERS, as well as the Visa  Waiver Support System, which according to INS officials, are recently  implemented systems that will be integrated into the entry exit system.)", "The entry control process also varies by type of port of entry. At air and  sea ports of entry, commercial carriers are required to submit passenger  and crew manifests before arrival. Manifest data are submitted to the  Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) and include (among other  things) the person\u2019s full name, date of birth, nationality, and passport  number. Using the manifest data, INS inspectors conduct a name check  through IBIS before the persons arrive, identifying those who will be  subject to secondary inspection.", "Land ports of entry differ from air and sea ports of entry in that no  requirements for passenger or crew manifests are imposed on commercial  carriers. Further, the procedures differ for pedestrians and occupants of  vehicles. As a general rule, pedestrians have all travel documents checked,  and if IBIS is available, a name search is conducted. (Exceptions to this  rule are Canadians, who are not required to have a passport when entering  a land port, and Mexicans with a border-crossing card, who are not  required to present a Mexican passport or a U.S. visa.) For vehicles,  license plates are checked through IBIS, and documents and names of the  vehicle\u2019s occupants are checked randomly or when an inspector has  reason to be suspicious. Figure 3 depicts the entry control process.", "Until recently, foreign nationals admitted into the United States were not  actively monitored. However, with the implementation of NSEERS, certain  foreign national males over the age of 16 are now required, within 30 days  of arrival, to report to an INS office and register, a process that includes  providing information consistent with their visas, such as proof of  residence and proof of employment. If the foreign national stays in the  United States for more than 1 year, he must also report to a designated INS  location within 10 days of each registration anniversary. If the foreign  national changes his address, school, or employer, he is required to notify  INS by mail within 10 days. Those who violate these rules will have their  photographs, fingerprints, and other information added to the National  Crime Information Center (NCIC) \u201cwants and warrants\u201d list for  enforcement purposes. NSEERS violators who are caught by police are  transferred to INS custody for removal or criminal prosecution. Figure 4  depicts the stay management process.", "At air and sea ports of entry, carriers are responsible for collecting from  exiting foreign nationals the departure portions of the Form I-94 and for  forwarding them to INS, which in turn sends them to a data entry  contractor for manual input into the Non-Immigrant Information System.  Carriers are also required to electronically submit to APIS manifest  information of passengers leaving the United States from an air or sea port  of entry. The departure manifest information is transmitted from APIS to  the Arrival Departure Information System (ADIS), which uses name- matching algorithms to match the arrival and departure records and  identify persons who have overstayed their authorized visits. At land ports  of entry, there is no collection point for the departure portion of the Form  I-94. The foreign national is responsible for returning the departure  portion, although there is no penalty for not doing so, unless the person is  subject to NSEERS requirements. Persons subject to NSEERS must depart  the United States from an INS-designated port of entry and report to an  INS agent for examination and endorsement of departure. If these persons  do not report their exit, they become ineligible to return to the United  States.

We agree that the development of a system security plan and privacy  impact assessment of the system is a significant matter. We also  acknowledge that on May 6, 2003, the department provided us with a  draft document entitled Technical Architecture and Security  Requirements. However, we reviewed the document and found that it  does not include information consistent with a security plan and  privacy impact assessment. The Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  have issued security planning guidance. In general, this guidance calls  for developing risk-based security plans that (1) provide an overview  of system security requirements, (2) describe the controls in place or  planned for meeting requirements, and (3) define responsibilities and  expected behavior for all individuals who access the system. The draft  document provided by the department acknowledges the need to  address but does not include many of these security plan elements,  such as rules of behavior for individuals who access the system and  the consequences for violating those rules; methods for identifying,  appropriately limiting, and controlling interconnections with other  systems; and procedures for periodically reviewing the effectiveness of  security controls.

As we state in this report, the  legislative requirement to develop an expenditure plan is intended to  provide lawmakers with a sufficient understanding of the system  acquisition to permit effective oversight and to allow for informed  decision-making about the use of appropriated funds. For this to  occur, the plan needs to disclose a sufficient level and scope of  information for the Congress to understand what system capabilities  and benefits are to be delivered, by when, and at what cost, and what  progress is being made against the commitments that were made in  prior expenditure plans. Further, the plan should disclose how the  acquisition will be managed to provide reasonable assurance that  system capability, benefit, schedule, and cost commitments will be  met. Consequently, pending policy decisions that affect plans for the  entry exit program are precisely the kind of detail missing in this  expenditure plan that should be disclosed. To the extent that detailed  planning information is not known, this should be explained and a  timetable for obtaining this information included in the plan.  3.  We agree that we concluded in this report that INS\u2019s Information  Technology Investment Management (ITIM) process generally satisfies  OMB\u2019s requirement to establish a process that defines how the agency  (1) selects projects included in its information technology portfolio;  (2) controls these projects to achieve the intended cost, schedule, and  performance outcomes; and (3) evaluates information technology  projects\u2019 performance to maintain a positive return on investment. We  do not, however, state that the program office is in full compliance  with the ITIM process, and therefore the entry exit system is in  compliance with OMB requirements. Further, we concluded that of  particular significance going forward will be how effectively the  department implements the investment management controls provided  for its plan and related documentation. Accordingly, we recommended  that the department fully implement planned investment management  controls in accordance with relevant federal requirements and  guidance.  4.  We have modified this report to recognize that an entry exit system  business case has yet to be developed, and we have added a  recommendation that the department develop a business case as part  of implementing planned investment management controls.  5.
