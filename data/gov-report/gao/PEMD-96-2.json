When evaluating 510(k) applications, FDA makes a determination regarding whether the new device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed predicate device. Performance data (bench, animal, or clinical) are required in most 510(k) applications, but clinical data are needed in less than 10 percent of applications.", "An alternative mode of entry into the market is through the premarket approval (PMA) process. PMA review is more stringent and typically longer than 510(k) review. For PMAs, FDA determines the safety and effectiveness of the device based on information provided by the applicant.

The second measure is the time that FDA has the application under its review process (FDA time).

If a PMA application is incomplete, depending on the extent of the deficiencies, FDA may place the application on hold and request further information. When the application is placed on hold, the FDA review clock is stopped until the agency receives the additional information. With minor deficiencies, the FDA review clock resumes running upon receipt of the information. With major deficiencies, FDA resets the FDA clock to zero upon receipt of the information. In this situation, all previously accrued FDA time is disregarded. (The resetting of the FDA clock can also be triggered by the applicant\u2019s submission of unsolicited supplementary information.)

The percent of applications that remained open increased from 4 percent in 1989 to 81 percent in 1994.

To answer that question, we also looked at a subset of applications that were approved, distinguishing the portion of time spent in FDA\u2019s review process (FDA time) from that spent waiting for additional information (non-FDA time). For applications that were approved, we present the average number of amendments that were subsequently added to the initial application as well as the average number of times FDA requested additional information from the applicant. (Both of these activities affect FDA\u2019s review time.)", "We used both the median and mean to characterize review time. We use the median for two reasons. First, a large proportion of the applications have yet to be completed. Since the median is the midpoint when all review times are arranged in consecutive order, its value can be determined even when some applications requiring lengthy review remain open. In contrast, the mean can only be determined from completed applications. (In this case, applications that have been completed by May 18, 1995.) In addition, the mean will increase as applications with lengthy reviews are completed.", "To illustrate, for applications submitted in 1993, the mean time to a decision was 269 days for 510(k) applications that have been closed. However, 3 percent of the applications have yet to be decided. If these lengthy reviews were arbitrarily closed at May 18, 1995 (the cutoff date for our data collection), the mean would increase to 285 days. In contrast, the median review time (230 days) would remain the same regardless of when these open applications were completed.", "The second reason for using the median is that the distributions of review time for 510(k), original PMA, and PMA supplement applications are not symmetric, that is, having about the same number of applications requiring short reviews as lengthy reviews. The median is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean. As a result, the review time of a single application requiring an extremely lengthy review would have considerably more effect on the mean than the median. Figure 7 shows the distribution for 510(k)s submitted in 1993, the most recent year in which at least 95 percent of all 510(k) applications had been completed. The distribution is skewed with a mean review time of 269 days and a median review time of 222 days for all completed applications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Frequency", "paragraphs": ["Mean = 269 Median = 222 To provide additional information, we report on the mean review times as well as the median. The discrepancy between the two measures gives some indication of the distribution of review time. When the mean is larger than the median, as in the case of the 510(k)s above, it indicates that a group of applications required lengthy reviews. Another reason we report the means is that, until recently, FDA reported review time in terms of means.", "In appendix I, we provide the categories we used to designate the different FDA decisions and how our categories correspond to those used by FDA. Detailed responses to our study objective are found in tabular form in appendixes II, III, and IV for 510(k)s, PMAs, and IDEs, respectively.", "We report our findings according to the fiscal year in which the applications were submitted to FDA. By contrast, FDA commonly reports review time according to the fiscal year in which the review was completed. Although both approaches measure review time, their resultant statistics can vary substantially. For example, several complex applications involving lengthy 2-year reviews submitted in 1989 would increase the average review time for fiscal year 1989 in our statistics and for fiscal year 1991 in FDA\u2019s statistics. Consequently, the trend for review time based on date-of-submission cohorts can differ from the trend based on date-of-decision cohorts. (See appendix V for a comparison of mean review time based on the two methods.)", "The two methods provide different information and are useful for different purposes. Using the date-of-decision cohort is useful when examining productivity and the management of resources. This method takes into consideration the actual number of applications reviewed in a given year including all backlogs from previous years. Alternatively, using the date-of-submission cohort is useful when examining the impact of a change in FDA review policy, which quite often only affects those applications submitted after its implementation. To minimize the effect of different policies on review time within a cohort, we used the date-of-submission method.", "We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards between May and June 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["Officials from FDA reviewed a draft of this report and provided written comments, which are reproduced in appendix VI.

We agree with FDA that our report \u201cdeals only with calculations of averages and percentiles\u201d\u2014that is, with means, medians (or 50th percentile), as well as the 5th and 95th percentiles. However, FDA\u2019s suggested additions do not extend beyond such descriptive statistics.", "We also agree that mean review times in the presence of numerous open cases may not be meaningful. For this reason, we have included open cases in our tables that report review time, but we have excluded them from the calculation of means. FDA suggests that we include open cases in our calculation of medians. We have adopted this suggestion and presented our discussion of trends in terms of the median review time for all cases. It should be noted, however, that including open cases increases our estimate of review time. (For example, including open cases raises the calculation of 510(k) median review time from the 126 days we reported for 1994 to 152 days.)", "Figure VI.1 depicts the relationship among the three measures of elapsed time for 510(k) submissions: the mean of closed cases, the median of closed cases, and the median of all cases. The two measures of closed cases reveal roughly parallel trends, with median review time averaging some 45 days fewer than mean review time. The two estimates of median review time are nearly identical from 1989 through 1990 since there are very few cases from that period that remain open. The divergence between the two medians increases as the number of open cases increases in recent years until 1995, when the median, including open cases, is larger than the mean of closed cases.", "Mean (Closed Cases)", "Median (Closed Cases)", "Median (All Cases)", "4. While we are unable to reproduce the calculations performed by FDA, we agree in general with the trends indicated by FDA. Specifically,", "Our calculations, as presented in our draft report tables II.7 and following, showed a decrease from 1993 to 1994 in FDA review time for finding a 510(k) submission substantially equivalent. By our calculation, this declined from a mean of 173 days in 1993 to 100 days in 1994.", "The proportion of 510(k) applications reaching initial determination within 90 days of submission increased from 15.8 percent in 1993 to 32 percent in 1994 and 57.9 percent between October 1, 1994, and May 18, 1995.", "Clearly, since 1993, more 510(k) cases have been determined within 90 days, and the backlog of undetermined cases has been reduced. Because a review of the nature and complexity of the cases still open was beyond the scope of this study, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when these cases are ultimately determined, average review time for 1995 cases will be shorter than for cases submitted in 1993. 5. FDA time was reported in our draft report tables II.7 through II.12, and findings contrasting the differences between FDA time and non-FDA time were also included. Additional language addressing this distinction has been included in the text of the report. 6. FDA\u2019s contends that 1989 was an atypical year for 510(k) submissions and therefore a poor benchmark. However, we do not believe that starting our reporting in 1989 introduced any significant bias into our report of the 510(k) workload. Indeed, our draft report concluded that the number of 510(k) submissions had \u201cremained relatively stable\u201d over the 1989-94 period. If we had extrapolated the data from the first 7-1/2 months of 1995 to a full year, we would have concluded that the current fiscal year would have a substantially lower number of 510(k) submissions (16 percent to 31 percent) than any of the previous 6 years. 7. The tier classification was created by FDA to manage its review workload; however, it was not our intention to evaluate or in any way assess the use of tiers for such purposes. The tier classification was based on \u201cthe potential risk and complexity of the device.\u201d Accordingly, both class and tier provide a rough indication of a device\u2019s complexity. 8. We agree that our draft report aggregated original PMA submissions and PMA supplements in summarizing its findings. We have now disaggregated PMA statistics throughout. 9. We interpret the figures presented by FDA to represent the mean number of days elapsed between receipt (or filing) of a PMA submission and a given month for cases that have not been decided. We agree with FDA that the average review time for open original PMAs does not appear to have increased substantially since the beginning of calendar 1994 and that the average review time has decreased for PMA supplements since late 1994. Decreasing these averages is the product of either an increasing number of new cases entering the system or of closing out older cases in the backlog or both. Since the number of PMAs (originals and supplements) submitted in recent years has declined, the evidence suggests that the drop in average time for pending PMA supplements resulted from eliminating lengthy backlogged cases. 10. As noted earlier, assessing the impact of specific management initiatives is beyond the scope of this report. However, we do agree with FDA that the approval rate for initial IDE submissions doubled between 1994 and 1995; by our calculations, it increased from 25 percent to 54 percent. We have not independently examined the total time to approval for all IDEs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program Evaulation and Methodology Division", "paragraphs": ["Robert E.
