This policy initiative has generated questions from the Congress about the capability and future viability of existing in-house logistics activities, particularly that of the military depots that have traditionally performed the largest share of the Department\u2019s depot maintenance work. DOD is required under 10 U.S.C. 2464 to identify and maintain within government-owned and -operated facilities a core logistics capability, including the equipment, personnel, and technical competence required to maintain weapon systems identified as necessary for national defense emergencies and contingencies. Specifically, the Secretary of Defense is to identify the workloads required to maintain the core logistics capabilities and assign to government facilities sufficient peacetime workload to ensure cost efficiency and technical competence, while preserving capabilities necessary to fully respond to national defense emergencies and contingencies.", "Your committees have expressed concerns about the need to continue the performance of mission-essential, or core, maintenance activities in military depots and the long-term viability of military industrial facilities in light of DOD\u2019s increased reliance on the private sector to accomplish logistics support activities such as the maintenance of weapon systems.", "The Report of the House Committee on Armed Services, Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (2001 Defense Authorization Act), directed that we review various issues related to the Department\u2019s logistics support planning and capabilities. As agreed with your offices, in this report we are addressing the extent to which (1) core depot maintenance policy and practices will result in military depots being able to perform core work in support of national defense emergencies and contingencies; (2) investments in facilities, equipment, and human capital are adequate to support the long-term viability of military maintenance depots; and (3) non-maintenance core logistics capabilities have been identified.", "In November 1993, the Department approved a standard methodology for the military services\u2019 use in computing core depot maintenance requirements in terms of the number of direct labor hours required to accomplish the identified work and relating the core requirements to its war planning scenarios. Direct labor hours represent a measurement of output core capabilities generated by using such input factors as facilities, equipment, and trained personnel. The direct labor hours are associated with capabilities for specific weapons identified by the various war plans. The standard methodology was designed to identify the weapon systems tied to the various war plans and determine peacetime depot maintenance workloads that would provide the capability for maintaining those systems in wartime. The Department recently completed the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), a strategic review of its defense goals, objectives, and capabilities. Implementation of the QDR could influence the way DOD approaches its future management of its core logistics capabilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, Congress and DOD have had an ongoing debate concerning core depot maintenance capabilities and the work needed to support these capabilities; the role of military depots; and the size, composition, and allocation of depot maintenance work between the public and private sectors. Since the mid-1990s, DOD policy and advisory groups have called for contracting with the private sector for a greater share of the Department\u2019s logistics support work, including depot maintenance, and related activities such as supply support, engineering, and transportation. An integral part of the policy shift is the debate over how DOD identifies its core logistics capabilities that are to be performed by federal employees in federal facilities. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics is responsible for maintenance issues, including core. We recently testified on core capabilities, DOD management of the depot system, and related issues.", "DOD estimates that it will spend about one-third of its $297 billion budget for fiscal year 2001 on logistics support activities at military maintenance, supply management, engineering, distribution, and transportation activities and at thousands of contractor locations. As a result of force structure reductions, depot closures under the base realignment and closure process in fiscal years 1988 to 2001, and DOD\u2019s desire to place greater reliance on the private sector for the performance of depot maintenance, the number of \u201cmajor\u201d depots (those employing more than 400 persons) was halved from 38 to 19. During this same period, the total amount of work (measured in direct labor hours) accomplished at the military depots was cut in half and the depot maintenance workforce was reduced by about three-fifths (from 156,000 in fiscal year 1987 to about 64,500 in fiscal year 2001) as shown in figure 1.

The concept of core work is not unique to DOD. However, the term gained increased importance in its relationship to military depots in the 1980s and 1990s. The concept of core and the identification of core capabilities for depot maintenance began in the 1980s; and until the early 1990s, each of the services used its own processes for determining core workloads needed to support the identified depot maintenance capabilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Core Concept as Used in the Private Sector and DOD", "paragraphs": ["The concept of core is one that has usage in the private sector and in the government with respect to decisions over whether support functions might best be provided in-house or outsourced to contractors. In recent years, as private sector firms have approached decisions on whether or not to outsource various activities or functions, they first evaluate the business to identify those activities that are critical to the performance of the mission of the business and which the owners or managers believe they should perform in-house with workers in their employment. These \u201ccore\u201d activities are not evaluated for contracting out. Remaining activities are studied to determine if in-house performance can be improved and/or costs can be reduced. The results of this assessment are compared with offers from external businesses. The criteria for outsourcing would generally be that the external business would provide these non-core activities for less cost and/or would provide improved capability or better service than can be provided using internal resources. Essential to an understanding of how private businesses use this concept is the fact that decisions over what is core is a somewhat subjective determination, one that is not absolute. What one business considers core and not subject to contracting out, another business might identify as a candidate for outsourcing. For example, Disney World retains as company employees the maintenance workers who keep their rides functioning at a high readiness condition while another recreation facility might decide to contract out the responsibility for equipment maintenance.", "Within the government, the concept of \u201ccore\u201d and a related concept of \u201cinherently governmental\u201d are a key part of the government\u2019s policy regarding what activities it should perform with federal employees and what activities the private sector should perform. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, which was first adopted in 1966, sets forth the general government policy that federal agencies are to obtain commercially available goods and services from the private sector when it is cost-effective to do so. A commercial activity is one that is performed by a federal agency and that provides a product or service, such as base operating support or payroll, that could be obtained from a commercial source. The handbook implementing A-76 provides the procedures for competitively determining whether commercial activities government agencies are currently performing should continue to be done in-house (or by another federal agency) or whether they should be contracted to the private sector.", "At the outset, inherently governmental activities\u2014those that are so intimately related to the exercise of the public interest as to mandate performance by federal employees\u2014are reserved for government performance. These activities are thus in a sense \u201ccore\u201d and outside the coverage of A-76. The core concept appears again within the universe of commercial services covered by A-76. The circular exempts from its cost comparison provisions activities that make up an agency\u2019s \u201ccore capability.\u201d Thus, under the circular, the government will retain a minimum core capability of specialized scientific or technical in-house employees necessary to fulfill an agency\u2019s mission responsibilities or to meet emergency requirements. Again, these activities are reserved for government performance. While the term \u201cinherently governmental\u201d is defined in statute and in the circular and the term \u201ccore\u201d is defined in the circular, agency officials exercise broad discretion in applying them to agency functions. Depot maintenance workloads valued at $3 million or more are exempt from the A-76 process by 10 U.S.C. 2469.", "The use of the A-76 process in DOD has proven to be controversial with concerns often expressed about the fairness of the process and of the cost comparisons between the public and private sectors. Section 852 of the 2001 Defense Authorization Act provided for a panel of experts to be convened by the Comptroller General to review process and procedures governing the transfer of commercial activities from government personnel to the private sector. The panel is required to report its findings and recommendations to the Congress by May 1, 2002.", "Legislation was enacted in 1984 that sought to add clarity to the meaning of \u201ccore\u201d as it applies to logistics activities involving military facilities.The provision, codified at 10 U.S.C. 2464, provides for a concept of core to be applied to DOD logistics activities. Under the current provision the Secretary of Defense is required to identify and maintain a \u201ccore logistics capability\u201d that is government-owned and operated to ensure the existence of a ready and controlled source of technical competence and resources so that the military can effectively and timely respond to mobilizations, national defense emergencies and contingencies. The capabilities are to include those necessary to maintain and repair the weapon systems and equipment that are identified by the Secretary in consultation with the Joint Chiefs of Staff as necessary to meet the nation\u2019s military needs.", "Further, the Secretary is to identify the workloads required to maintain the core capabilities and to require their performance in government facilities. Finally, the Secretary is to assign these facilities sufficient workloads to ensure peacetime cost efficiency and technical competencies and surge capacity and reconstitution capabilities to support our military strategic and contingency plans.", "In addition to the 10 U.S.C. 2464 requirements described above, 10 U.S.C. 2466 specifies that no more than 50 percent of the funds made available for depot maintenance may be spent for private sector performance. This sets aside 50 percent of the funding for public-sector performance of these workloads    in essence establishing a minimum public-sector core for depot maintenance. Before the 1997 amendment, private-sector performance was limited to no more than 40 percent. The trend in DOD in recent years has been toward increasing reliance on the private sector for depot maintenance work and increasing reliance on original equipment manufacturers for long-term logistics support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Depot Maintenance Core Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In November 1993, the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics outlined a standard multi-step method for determining core requirements and directed the services to use this method in computing biennial core requirements. In 1996, the core methodology was revised to include (1) an assessment of the risk involved in reducing the core capability requirement as a result of having maintenance capability in the private sector and (2) the use of a best-value comparison approach for assigning non-core work to the public and private sectors.", "The current core methodology provides a computational framework for quantifying core depot maintenance capabilities and the workload needed to sustain these capabilities. It includes three general processes:  The identification of the numbers and types of weapon systems required to support the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2019s wartime planning scenarios;  The computation of depot maintenance core work requirements measured in direct labor hours to support the weapon systems\u2019 expected wartime operations as identified in the war planning scenarios; and  The determination of industrial capabilities (including the associated personnel, technical skills, facilities, and equipment) that would be needed to accomplish the direct labor hours identified above that is generated from the planning scenarios. That determination is adjusted to translate those capabilities into peacetime workloads needed to support them. These peacetime workloads represent the projected core work requirements for the next program year in terms of direct labor hours. For example, the estimate made in fiscal year 2000 projected the core requirements for fiscal year 2001.", "To conclude the process, the services then identify specific repair workloads and allocate the core work hours needed to accomplish the maintenance work at the public depots that will be used to support the core capabilities.", "During the latter part of the 1990s, DOD made significant changes in specific maintenance workloads it identified as supporting core capabilities. For example, in 1996 the Air Force privatized in place work on aircraft and missile inertial guidance and navigation systems performed at the Aerospace Guidance and Metrology Center in Newark, Ohio. Prior to closure of this depot, the workload\u2014about 900,000 hours annually\u2014 had been identified as necessary to support core capabilities. Workload at the Sacramento Air Logistics Center, which next to the Newark Depot had the Air Force\u2019s highest percentage of core workload relative to total workload, was reclassified as non-core work when the center was to be closed. Similarly, maintenance of the Army\u2019s tactical wheeled vehicles had always been considered core work, with over 1 million hours of work performed in an Army depot. But after the closure of the Army\u2019s truck depot at Tooele, Utah, this work was contracted out; and in 1996 it was categorized as non-core work. More recently the Army has again categorized about 26,000 direct labor hours of truck maintenance work as core support work\u2014less than 1 percent of the workload that the Army identified as necessary to support its core capabilities.", "Figure 2 shows the services\u2019 biennial computations of depot maintenance core work requirements in direct labor hours for fiscal years 1995-2001. The reported combined core work requirements for all the military services declined by about 30 percent over that period. The Navy aviation and the Marine Corps support work stayed relatively constant while the Army\u2019s declined by 33 percent, the Air Force\u2019s declined by 33 percent, and the Navy ship requirement declined by 37 percent.", "Figure 2 shows the computed core work requirements for each of the services in labor hours.

The maintenance guidance prescribes a source-of-repair decision process designed to determine whether new and upgraded weapon systems and subsystems should be repaired in military depots or contractor facilities. This guidance provides that repair decisions should be justified through rigorous, comprehensive business case analyses that consider the relative costs of public and private support options, mission essentiality, existing public and private industrial capabilities, and required core capabilities. The source-of-repair process is also supposed to consider workload allocation requirements specified by 10 U.S.C. 2466 that not more than 50 percent of annual depot maintenance funding made available to each military department be used for private sector performance."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Core Policy and Implementation Leave Little Assurance That Capabilities Will Be Developed to Support Wartime Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Department\u2019s core depot maintenance capabilities policy and related implementation procedures and practices provide little assurance that core maintenance capabilities are being developed to support future national defense emergencies and contingencies. Much of the current core workload supports systems that are soon to retire; however, the core policy is not comprehensive in that it does not provide for a forward look at new weapon systems that will replace the ones that are being retired and at associated future maintenance capabilities that will likely be identified as needed to repair those systems. Further, the core policy is not linked to the department\u2019s source-of-repair policy and processes. These policy shortfalls limit the timely identification of equipment, facilities, and workforce technical skills needed to establish and retain future core capabilities. Advance planning for replacement of retiring systems and introduction of new systems and technologies into the depots is critical because it can take up to 5 years or more to establish a new in-house capability.", "Further compounding the future core capabilities concerns are various core policy implementation procedures and practices that also affect the establishment of core capability. For example, services are using, to varying degrees, concepts such as like workloads and risk assessments that have the impact of further reducing the amount of core workloads that are actually performed on systems such as the C-17 that support contingency plans. These varying practices affect both the quantification of core requirements and the identification of workloads used to support core capabilities. They may also preclude defense managers or the Congress from assessing the extent to which overall core policy objectives are being met. The net effect of these practices is to reduce the amount of new repair technology being introduced into the military depots. Also, actual direct labor hours on workloads assigned to public depots are less than called for in identified core support work requirements and the need to support core capabilities is not adequately considered in service source- of-repair decisions on new and upgraded systems. Both of these situations further negatively impact the development of future core capabilities by reducing the amount of workforce training and again decreasing the extent to which new repair technologies are introduced to the depot.

Also, expected decreases in the core workload supporting systems that are soon to retire and changes from in-house to contractor support on replacement or upgraded systems are not being adequately considered. If the services do not plan for the retiring systems\u2019 replacements in the military depot system, support for future core capabilities and the economic viability of the depots will be affected.", "The Navy\u2019s consideration of core support work related to its helicopter fleet illustrates how future capability needs are not being taken into account. Maintenance and repair on the H-46 utility helicopter currently provides much of the core support workload at the Navy\u2019s Cherry Point depot. The H-46 is to be phased out of the inventory and replaced by the V- 22 tilt rotor aircraft. The Cherry Point aviation depot accomplishes about 600,000 hours of work annually on the H-46, which represented about 15 percent of that depot\u2019s entire workload in fiscal year 2000. However, as the H-46s are retired, depot officials expect that workload to dwindle to zero by fiscal year 2012. Navy officials have decided that the V-22 engine will be supported commercially and are evaluating plans for all other V-22 support.  Officials told us that they were considering outsourcing some component workloads, originally identified as requiring a core capability, in concert with current DOD policy preferences for outsourcing depot maintenance activities. While Cherry Point\u2019s core capability position looks favorable today, the process does not take into consideration the expected loss of H-46 work. Similarly, as the Air Force\u2019s C-141 cargo aircraft is being phased out of the inventory, the core methodology has provided for accomplishing little support work for the new generation C-17 cargo aircraft in military depots.", "Consideration of new and replacement workloads is important because of the advance planning time needed to establish an in-house capability. In some cases, it may take 5 years or more to establish this capability. For example, a depot business planner estimated that about 5 years would be needed from the time the core capability work requirement was first identified to fund, design, and build a C-5 painting facility, assuming that all went according to plan. Funding availability, priorities of this project relative to others, external events, and other factors could slow the acquisition of support resources. Timeframes for acquiring capabilities that are identified as core would typically be longer than this if the depot was not already formally assigned the workload."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Core Policy Not Linked to Source-of-Repair Process", "paragraphs": ["Existing core policy is not directly linked to the source-of-repair decision process for new systems and major system upgrades, which negatively impacts the development of core capabilities.

Our review of recent and ongoing source-of-repair decisions, however, found that core capabilities are considered inconsistently, if at all, in many of the decisions on new systems and upgrades. The lack of linkage between these two processes contributes to the decline of future repair capability for critical mission-essential systems.", "In both 1998 and 1996, we reported that DOD\u2019s new policy for determining source of repair for weapon systems had weaknesses that could impact the retention of core logistics capabilities that the military is supposed to identify and maintain to ensure the support of mission-essential weapon systems. We determined that (1) acquisition program officials had not followed the services\u2019 approved processes for making source-of-repair decisions, (2) information concerning core capabilities and other input from logistics officials were not major factors in these decisions, and (3) weaknesses in guidance contributed to these conditions.", "Also, the Army Audit Agency and the Naval Audit Service issued reports in 2000 that identified similar deficiencies still occurring in those services.Army auditors concluded that system managers for 13 of 14 weapon systems identified as required for the Joint Chiefs of Staff warfighting scenarios had not performed complete and adequate source-of-repair analyses and specifically had not accomplished core assessments to identify workloads that were needed to support core capabilities. Navy auditors found that acquisition offices had not accomplished 80 of 179 (45 percent) required independent logistics assessments (the process used to identify and provide for logistics support requirements during weapon systems acquisition) and did not always disclose results of logistics assessments to program decisionmakers. Both cited inadequate, inconsistent, and conflicting acquisition and logistics guidance and uncertainty or lack of information on core support needs and repair analyses as contributing factors.", "During our current review of DOD\u2019s core process, we found that this overall condition has not changed. Acquisition policy and acquisition officials\u2019 preferences for using contractor support were reflected in source-of-repair decisions for new and upgraded systems going to contractors, with the result that the depots have not been receiving much new workload in recent years and may not in the future. In the Air Force, for example, 48 of the 66 systems and components being reviewed for source-of-repair decisions in March 2001 were at that time recommended for private sector support. We also reviewed some new systems and upgrades representing all the services and found that they had decided or were leaning toward the private sector in 10 of the 13 cases for the bulk of their depot maintenance work. In those cases where the public sector is expected to get some portion of the work, it was typically on the older technology and legacy systems while contractors were expected to perform most of the repairs on the newer technology items. In most of the cases, core capability issues had either not been considered or were not major factors in the decisions. In some instances, the final decision on systems had been delayed or stretched out for years, which may make it difficult, more costly, and less likely that the eventual decision would be that the military depots perform this maintenance work."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Implementing Procedures and Practices Further Compound Future Core Capability Concerns", "paragraphs": ["The services\u2019 core procedures and practices further raise concerns about the extent to which core capabilities are being established and preclude defense managers or the Congress from assessing the extent to which overall core policy objectives are being met. To put the methodology for determining standardized core requirements into effect, each service developed its own approach, criteria, and assumptions to adapt the methodology to individual circumstances. Each service has different procedures and practices to implementing the core methodology and identifying and establishing core capabilities that reduce the development of core capabilities. These procedures and practices include the concepts of capability for like workloads; the use of risk assessments for reducing the amount of core; the use of peacetime workload factors; and having insufficient peacetime workloads to retain core capability because the core process is not linked to defense planning and budgeting."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establishing Capability By Using Like Workloads is Questionable", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force and the Naval Sea Systems Command, and to a lesser extent the Army, rely on the questionable concept of \u201clike\u201d workloads to identify core support workloads used to satisfy core requirements. The critical assumption is that peacetime work on like (similar) types of systems and repair processes provides sufficient skills and repair capabilities that government facilities, equipment, and maintenance personnel could, within the short timeframes required by national defense emergencies and contingencies, quickly and effectively transfer to new workloads on systems and equipment currently repaired in the private sector. The theory is that capabilities on a wide range of commodities would be transferable during a defense emergency to repair systems not currently maintained in the defense depots. The like-workload concept as it is applied to specific weapon systems is portrayed in figure 3, and specific examples of concerns about the use of the concept in the various services are discussed below.", "The Air Force, the most extensive user of the concept of like work, focuses its efforts on providing its depots with the capabilities to accomplish broad categories of repairs. Officials compute core work requirements based on categories of equipment repair such as avionics, instruments, engines, and airframes rather than on specific weapon systems, which is the approach generally used by the Army, Navy, and Marines. Using professional judgement and knowledge of existing in-house work, officials then designate which maintenance workloads will be accomplished to satisfy the required level of repair capability in each category. To illustrate, maintenance workloads on the KC-135, C-141, and C-130 are designated as core workloads for Air Force depots to satisfy computed core capabilities for repairs in the large-airframe cargo aircraft category. As a result, repair workloads on some Air Force weapon systems that are heavily relied on in wartime planning scenarios are not identified as core support work. For example, only a very small amount of avionics workload for the C-17 aircraft\u2014which is expected to be heavily used in all scenarios\u2014is identified as core support work in the latest computation. Also, there are no in-house workloads on some mission-essential systems identified in war plans, notably the F-117, the E-8 (Joint Stars), and the U-2. While the Air Force policy is to provide core capabilities for their systems through like workloads, the Air Forcer core capability calculations do not include these contractor-supported systems.", "The assumption that depots could quickly and easily transition to repair new and different weapon systems is questionable. It is unlikely that all needed core capabilities could be established in a timely manner because in relying on the private sector, the services have not procured the support resources that would be required to establish in-house capability and it would take time and funding to establish the required capability. For example, Air Force Materiel Command officials stated that it could take 2 years or more to build up a sufficient capability to handle major C-17 repairs if required. Even though one depot maintains other large cargo aircraft, it would not have specialized and unique support equipment, technical data, and mechanics trained and certified on the unique and advanced C-17 features. For comparison purposes, the Warner Robins depot took about 2 years to effectively assume the C-5 workload after the San Antonio depot was closed. Warner Robins had been doing similar work for many years on other airlifters, the C-141 and C-130, and had access to C-5 technical data, depot plant equipment, and mechanics. Similarly, the Air Force relies on B-1 and B-52 workloads to support core capabilities for the B-2 airframe, which is repaired by a contractor. The assumption is that a military depot repairing the B-1 or B-52 could take care of emergency depot requirements for the B-2. However, the technology, repair processes, and equipment needed for the B-2 are much different than those used on the B-1 and B-52 fleets. Further, workers are not trained on unique characteristics or modern repair techniques and do not have the proper clearance to accomplish repairs on low observable characteristics of stealth systems.", "The Naval Sea Systems Command employs a variant of the like-work concept, which identifies core capabilities based on the number and types of ships. Although Navy officials said all 316 ships in the Navy are mission- essential, the public shipyards primarily overhaul nuclear-powered ships and large-deck surface ships, and private shipyards repair most surface combatants, amphibious, and auxiliary support ships. Ship repair managers assume that, in an emergency, the public shipyards have the necessary facilities, equipment, and skilled personnel to repair any Navy ship and components. This assumption includes those classes of ships and components currently maintained solely by contractors. It is unclear whether, in an emergency, the nuclear facilities, specialized support and test equipment, and dry dock space could be cleared and reconfigured and that government workers could take over repairs on classes of ships currently maintained in the private sector.", "In contrast with the process used by the Air Force and for Navy ships, the Army, Marines, and the Naval Air Systems Command focus more attention on performing repair workloads on specific weapon systems. Officials initially compute core capabilities by weapon system, making more explicit the linkage between weapon systems that are tied to war planning scenarios and core capabilities and supporting workloads. Officials identify core capabilities based on the number of each specific weapon system identified in the war plan and generally assign at least a portion of the workload on each system and its subsystems to a military depot. As a result, these commands have some degree of active in-house workloads on almost every weapon system identified in the war plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Risk Assessments Approach Can Hinder the Development of Capability", "paragraphs": ["Another area of concern in how services compute core is the use of risk assessments to determine if work initially determined to be core support work could instead be provided by the private sector at an acceptable level of risk. The standard DOD core methodology was revised in 1996 to incorporate risk assessments as a way of evaluating repair capability in the private sector to determine whether capability could be provided by contractors rather than by a military depot. The Air Force makes extensive use of risk assessments to significantly reduce its computed in-house core capability; the Marines Corps and Naval Sea Systems Command apply the concept in more limited fashion; and the Army and Naval Air Systems Command did not use risk assessments at all.", "Air Force officials developed an extensive risk assessment process and criteria, which identifies private sector capability and reduces its identified core capability because of the availability of this private sector capability. For example, for airframe repairs, the Air Force reduced its core capability by 66 percent through the risk assessment process. As a practical consequence, the Air Force\u2019s application of risk has resulted in at least some portion of the core support workloads needed to maintain every weapon system and commodity being identified as available for contracting out.", "Officials of the Naval Sea Systems Command and the Marine Corps said that they do risk assessments. However, these appear to be perfunctory and do not change how maintenance work is allocated. As discussed earlier, the Naval Sea Systems Command initially identifies all ships to be strategically necessary, but allocates maintenance work to the public and private shipyards based on type of ship and historical basing considerations. Marine Corps officials said that their last risk assessment was done as an undocumented roundtable discussion in 1998. For the 2001 core capability assessment, the Corps\u2019 computed core of 3.1 million hours was offset by 1.1 million hours because of the perceived availability of risk acceptable contracted workload. The Marines reported a final core figure of 2 million hours to be accomplished in the public sector. Officials said the core process would be more meaningful if it influenced the assignment of repair work for new systems and was tied to the budget process.", "Conversely, the Army and Naval Air Systems Command revised their processes to eliminate the private sector risk assessments and did not use them in their most recent core determinations. Army and Navy aviation officials said that they think risk assessments are not appropriate. They believe that to have a real capability means that the depots need to have at least some workload on every mission-essential system. In the opinion of these officials, military items are generally best supported in the public sector and commercial items best supported in the private sector.", "The differing interpretations and applications of risk assessments can result in significant differences in the ultimate core capability requirement computed by each service and in the core support work assigned to the depots. If the result of the risk assessment process is to include private sector capability as a portion of the identified core logistics capability under 10 U.S.C. 2464, that in our view would be inconsistent with the statute.", "As we understand it, the risk assessment process was intended to assess whether existing private sector sources could provide logistics capability on mission essential systems at an acceptable level of risk, reliability, and efficiency. While one could argue that under 10 U.S.C. 2464 as it was worded prior to 1998, that commercial capability could be considered as a portion of the identified core depot maintenance capabilities, we do not think such is the case under the current version of the statute. The provision was amended by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 to state that; \u201cit is essential for the national defense that the Department of Defense maintain a core logistics capability that is government-owned and government operated (including government personnel and government-owned and operated equipment and facilities).\u201d Similarly, section 2464 further provides that \u201cthe Secretary of Defense shall require the performance of core logistics workloads necessary to maintain the core logistics capabilities identified\u2026at government-owned, government-operated facilities of the Department of Defense.\u201dConsequently, we do not view a risk assessment process implementing 10 U.S.C. 2464 that results in the inclusion of private-sector capabilities as a portion of the identified core logistics capabilities as consistent with the statute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Peacetime Workload Factors Affect Computed Capability Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The difference in services\u2019 use of the methodology factor used to reduce computed wartime requirements to peacetime workloads also raises concerns about the extent to which core capabilities are being developed. The factor reflects the ability of depots to surge (increase) work during an emergency. The Air Force, Naval Air Systems Command, and the Marine Corps use the same factor; the Naval Sea Systems Command uses a smaller factor; and the Army does not use an adjusting factor. The factors used result in higher peacetime core workload requirements for the Army and Sea Systems Command relative to their wartime needs compared to the other services. For example, in using a factor of 1.6, the Air Force assumes that in emergency situations, existing in-house facilities could increase their production by 60 percent by working increased time. If the Army had used the same factor used by the Air Force, its computed 2001- core capability support requirement would have been reduced from 9.8 million direct labor hours to 6.1 million hours. Conversely, if the Air Force had not used an adjustment factor, its computed 2001 core support requirement would have been increased from 18.2 million direct labor hours to 29.1 million hours."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Workloads Do Not Optimize the Development of Core Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Our review identified concerns that, after computing the core capabilities, actual workloads assigned to the depots during peacetime are not always sufficient to fully support core capability requirements. Not meeting workload goals can mean that the workforce is getting less than optimal work experience on core workload. According to 10 U.S.C. 2464, DOD policy, and the core requirements determination process, the services are to assign sufficient peacetime workloads to the depots to maintain the expertise and competence in core capabilities. However, as discussed below, this is not happening in all cases.", "The volume of assigned peacetime workloads in the Army fell short of the 9.2-million-hour total core workload needed to support its core capabilities by about 1.4 million direct labor hours in fiscal year 2000 and about 1 million hours in fiscal year 2001. For example, the Army\u2019s most recent update of the core support work requirement for the Apache helicopter totals 420,000 direct labor hours for fiscal year 2001. However, its funded workloads assigned to military depots totaled only 126,000 direct labor hours in fiscal year 1999 and about 264,000 hours in fiscal year 2000. Depot officials told us the principal Apache aircraft work in the depot involves disassembly and overhaul of selected components that the contractor will later use in the remanufacturing process. Logistics officials pointed out that one reason peacetime work has lagged behind calculated core support workload requirements is the continuing trend for outsourcing maintenance services involving weapon system upgrades and conversions. The depot officials pointed out that to alleviate the financial impact from the shortfall in actual workload, the Army established direct appropriation funding to reimburse its depots for fixed overhead costs associated with underutilized plant capacity. In fiscal years 2000 and 2001, the Army provided its depots a total of about $20 million in direct funding for underutilized capacity.", "Shortfalls also exist in the Air Force. For example, in fiscal year 2001, the Air Force anticipates about an 800,000-hour shortfall in depot-level software maintenance workload compared to its core capability support work requirement. Air Force officials originally computed a core work requirement of 3.7 million hours for software maintenance. Air Force management reduced the computed requirement by 600,000 hours because the depots were not considered capable of accomplishing that much workload. As a result, the Air Force only included 3.1 million hours for software maintenance in the total 18.2 million-hour core work requirement reported to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Even at this lower number, the Air Force expects to accomplish only about 2.9 million hours in 2001, increasing the real core shortfall by another 200,000 hours to a total shortfall of more than 800,000 hours. We also determined that the Air Force understated core support work for airframe repairs by 528,000 hours because tasked contractor logistics support systems were inadvertently omitted in the roll-up of core requirements. Additionally, the Air Force potentially understated hours for component workloads because officials could not support how wartime flying hours were converted into commodity repair hours.", "Air Force officials repeatedly identified capability shortfalls in qualified software technicians and engineers as one of their most severe concerns at the depots. The Air Force Materiel Command initiated a study of software maintenance to assess the ability of the depots to support future depot level software workloads and to identify steps needed to perform greater amounts of workload. The study noted that the three Air Force depots were experiencing difficulty in accomplishing about 2.6 million hours per year. The study recommended changes aimed at improving recruiting, hiring, paying, and retaining software maintenance personnel.", "In fiscal year 2000, the Marines anticipated a required depot core support workload of 2 million hours but executed only about 1 million hours. Officials told us that not all items could be worked on due to financial constraints, readiness requirements, and operational force priorities. They noted that tying the core process to the budget process would help resolve this problem.", "Because the biennial core computation process operates largely as a stand-alone exercise and is not explicitly linked to the planning, programming, and budgeting system or to DOD\u2019s strategic planning processes, it has little direct impact on resource allocation decisions and management priority setting. The identification of shortfalls in core capability, for example, does not generate budget requirements for making capital investments in facilities, equipment, and other resources needed to establish the capability. The 1993 core policy statement directed that implementation plans and decisions be reflected in future annual planning and budget submissions, as well as be input to the depot maintenance strategic plan, but this has not been done. If the core process were tied more explicitly to the budget and strategic planning process, the assignment of actual work to the depots should better support the establishment and continuation of required core capability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Results of DOD Initiatives to Improve Core and Core- Related Processes Are Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["While the Office of the Secretary of Defense and each service, to varying extents, have taken steps to improve core and core-related processes, the results of these initiatives are uncertain.

The study produced four sets of alternatives designed to improve and transform core policy and methodology into a management tool and explicitly integrate it into DOD\u2019s strategic planning processes. Those alternatives, discussed in appendix I, ranged from making a few minor administrative adjustments to the core process, to making substantive changes to the process such as eliminating the risk assessment as a tool for reducing the core requirement, and to undertaking an extensive revamping of the process which would include the elimination of the requirement for maintaining a core capability in military depots.", "In October 2001, Office of the Secretary of Defense management selected the alternative that would streamline the existing core process and establish explicit linkage with the DOD planning, programming, and budgeting system.

It expects to divide functions into three broad categories: (1) Functions directly linked to warfighting and best performed by the federal government. In these areas, DOD plans to invest in process and technology to improve performance. (2) Functions indirectly linked to warfighting capability that must be shared by the public and private sectors. In these areas, DOD will seek to define new models of public-private partnerships to improve performance. (3) Functions not linked to warfighting and best performed by the private sector. In these areas, DOD will seek to privatize or outsource entire functions or define new mechanisms for partnerships with private firms and other public agencies.", "It is not clear where depot maintenance and other logistics functions contributing to weapon systems sustainment and performance will be placed in this framework.

In recent years, funding has started to increase slightly as the services have recognized the need to modernize the depots. As with any business, modernizing and refurbishing plant and equipment for optimal operating efficiency, as well as acquiring new capabilities and cutting-edge technologies linked to new workloads, are important to future viability of the military depots. Figure 4 depicts depot investments from fiscal years 1990 through 2000 from the three primary funding sources\u2014the capital purchases program, military construction, and new weapon systems procurement and upgrade programs. The depiction has been adjusted for inflation.", "Of the estimated $3 billion in capital investment funding the military depots received between fiscal years 1990 and 2000, about 60 percent was for the capital purchases program that buys equipment to replace old depreciated equipment. Funding for this program was much lower during the 1990s than under its predecessor programs in the 1980s. More recently, funding levels have increased; but almost one-half of the funds went to meet environmental requirements, to purchase general use computers, and to do minor construction\u2014requirements that may be needed for business purposes but typically do not increase maintenance production capabilities or add new technological capabilities to accomplish new workloads.", "The military construction appropriation funds new and replacement depot facilities. Military construction represents about 26 percent of the total depot capital investments between 1990 and 2000. For example, a 1998 project at Corpus Christi Army Depot provided a power train cleaning facility to add capability to clean new, specialized metals on Apache and Blackhawk helicopters. The bulk of military construction funding has gone to replace or modernize existing facilities or to increase capacity.", "Since the military depots have not been assigned much new work, they have received relatively little funding from the third source of funds    procurement funds provided by weapon system program offices.", "Available data shows that the depots received about $403 million through capital investments from program offices between 1990 and 2000\u2014 representing about 14 percent of the total capital investment in the depots during that period.

System program managers are responsible for providing these funds to support new weapon systems being acquired. A complete and accurate accounting of the historical and planned amounts contributed to capitalizing the depots by weapon system program offices does not exist since the services do not centrally track and account for these funds. With the repair of newer technology items remaining with the private sector for most new systems, the military depots have not been getting the peculiar support equipment, technical data, and other resources needed to build a depot capability for supporting the new systems. For example, the Air Force recently attempted to identify contract workloads that could be brought in-house to help it meet the 50-percent limit on private sector performance of depot maintenance set forth in 10 U.S.C. 2466 but found that the depots were unable to take on these workloads without investment in new capability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Aging Workforce Presents Significant Human Capital Challenges for Succession Planning", "paragraphs": ["DOD faces significant management challenges in succession planning to maintain a skilled workforce at its depot maintenance facilities.

Competition with the private sector for skilled workers and pay issues add to the current challenging situation.", "Reductions in the civilian workforce by more than half since the end of the Cold War have left an aging depot workforce. As a result of depot closures and other downsizing initiatives, the civilian depot workforce has been reduced by about 60 percent since 1987. Many of the youngest industrial workers were eliminated from the workforce while at the same time there were few hiring actions. An aging depot workforce has advantages in terms of the skill levels of the employees, but it also has disadvantages such as lack of familiarity with the newest technologies because the latest weapons have not generally been repaired in the military depots. With large numbers of retirement-eligible personnel, depot managers are concerned about the need to manage the losses of critical skills and regrow the talents that are needed to maintain a high quality workforce. The skills and institutional experience are necessary to maintain an effective and flexible workforce that is capable of performing the required work efficiently and effectively. If production capability similar to current levels is to be maintained, many new workers will be needed. With an average age of 46 and about one-third eligible to retire within the next 5 years, these data are comparable to other studies of DOD\u2019s total civilian workforce.

Two facilities\u2014one Air Force and one Army\u2014 share the position of having the oldest workers. The extent of the aging depot workforce problem is influenced by the extent to which the depots retain work requirements in the future. If current levels are retained, large numbers of new workers will be needed; but if the workload levels continue to decline, the problem will be less severe. Marine Corps officials told us that while the Marine Corps has an aging workforce problem, the primary challenge is lack of work.

Thus, the aging workforce issue is less problematic if this workload reduction occurs.", "In most cases, depot managers report they have been relatively successful in meeting their recruitment goals in the past; but they said they have had difficulty hiring younger workers and sufficient numbers of workers with specialized skills such as software maintenance. A Department of Labor standard sets a 4-year apprenticeship for acquiring trade skills, and some depot managers said workers in some of the industrial skill areas require 3 or more years of training before they reach the journeyman level. Depot managers indicate that they are behind where they should be in hiring new workers to revitalize human capital resources. Surveys of young adults entering the general workforce indicate that fewer are considering careers in government, and this is particularly true for the depots since workers are uncertain what future there is for these activities.

Since this plan is not yet available, we do not know whether it will provide the roadmap needed to effectively manage this critical resource.

For example, efforts to expand the apprenticeship, cooperative training, and vocational-technical programs are just starting and involve relatively small numbers to date. Increased funding to support expanded training needs has not been completely identified and programmed, and the priority of this initiative relative to other military requirements is questionable. Personnel officials of the Air Force Materiel Command, for example, identified a need for $326 million over the next 5 years to implement its human capital initiatives, including payment incentives and training costs. Only $15 million has been approved. Related efforts to develop a multi-skilled workforce essential to more efficient operations of depots have been limited. Very importantly, future requirements for hiring and training a workforce capable on new systems and high technology repair processes are not fully known.

The Department stated that it has not identified any core logistics capabilities beyond those associated with depot maintenance and repair as that term is defined in 10 U.S.C. 2460. Therefore, the Department saw no need to establish milestones and accountability for developing core policies for non- maintenance activities. In further discussions of this matter, officials reiterated their earlier comments that the coverage of 10 U.S.C. 2464 for non-maintenance activities was not clear.", "We recognize that there is some question about the applicability of 10 U.S.C. 2464 to non-maintenance logistics activities.

Providing military readiness through the logistics support of military forces in an operational environment requires a complex set of functions and activities such as maintenance, supply support, transportation, and engineering. The interrelatedness of the entire spectrum of logistics activities would argue that attention to core capabilities is important to non-maintenance as well as depot maintenance activities. For example, program managers and depot officials have raised management concerns including oversight of weapon systems support and retention of in-house technical skills and expertise given increased outsourcing of logistics activities. Further, the best practices of private sector companies, business reengineering principles, and OMB A-76 guidance all support the importance of an enterprise determining which vital and cost-effective functions and business processes should be retained in-house and which are appropriate for outsourcing. Our recommendation that the department extend its core analysis beyond wrench-turning maintenance activities to include those other logistics activities that are linked to the depot maintenance function is intended to assure that the Department appropriately consider what specific activities should be retained inhouse to assure the continued support of essential warfighting capability. We continue to believe it should be adopted.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

It would not involve any significant changes to the core methodology. This alternative would realign somewhat and standardize the categories in which the services report core maintenance workloads. Core depot maintenance capability requirements would continue to be computed biennially, addressing only existing systems; and the overall core determination process would continue to be relatively independent of the DOD planning, programming, and budgeting system.", "Alternative 2 proposes building on the first alternative by streamlining the existing core methodology and establishing an explicit linkage with the DOD planning, programming, and budgeting system. It also would divide the core methodology into two distinct parts to more clearly distinguish between core capability requirements and the depot maintenance workloads needed to satisfy those requirements. Detailed core computations would be performed on a biennial basis in conjunction with the planning, programming, and budgeting system in order to address both requirements for new systems and changes to existing systems. Also, core computations would be reviewed annually to assess the impact of unanticipated budgetary adjustments.", "Alternative 3 proposes building on the second alternative by incorporating a value-driven source-of-repair evaluation process for workloads that are not required to support core depot maintenance capabilities. This appears to be a more prescriptive expansion of the current version of the core methodology concerning the types of analysis that should be done as a part of the value-driven decision. Depending on the amount and ultimate source-of-repair decisions reached through the value-driven process, implementation of alternative 3 could necessitate issuance of waivers from the 10 U.S.C. 2466 (50-50) requirements.", "Alternative 4 proposes doing away with the core process as it is known today and using a value-driven source of repair evaluation process for all depot maintenance workloads. In this context, it would be used to allocate depot maintenance workloads among public, private, and integrated maintenance activities.

Largely because of this, we found a heightened awareness of the need to put more emphasis on incorporating core capability analysis with the source-of-repair process to drive some future workloads into the military depots. Air Force officials have taken some steps designed to better integrate the source-of-repair process and logistics considerations with acquisition program decisions. For example, senior Air Force officials issued a series of policy memos in 1999 and 2000 that were aimed at integrating the source-of-repair process with acquisition program decisions. The intent was to ensure that sustainment plans for new and modified weapon systems consider the future impacts on depot workloads allocated to the public and private sectors. These changes are designed to ensure that core capability, life-cycle costs, and other logistics considerations such as the 50-50 rule are considered at all stages of the acquisition process and figure prominently in decisions on lifetime support. Officials also revised guidance to incorporate recommended improvements and to specify both the acquisition and sustainment communities\u2019 roles and responsibilities.", "While these are steps in the right direction, we have not yet seen substantive change reflected in the source-of-repair decisions. Materiel Command officials acknowledged that although the Air Force has made an effort to identify systems to redirect for repair by a military depot, program office officials have been reluctant to make changes. Officials said that since program funds to cover the acquisition of technical data, depot plant equipment, and other resources needed to establish capability in military depots have not been programmed, there is little flexibility in the short term. In a March 2001 hearing held by the House Committee on Armed Services, Air Force officials said they are working on a longer-term plan to consider options for reassigning some new systems maintenance work to Air Force depots. This plan is expected to be completed in December 2001, but it is uncertain whether any workloads will be identified for reassignment to an Air Force depot for repair."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The Navy is in the very early stages of implementing a process to improve its management of aviation maintenance issues; and, while in an early phase, Navy officials have identified core support repair work in the Navy\u2019s North Island depot for the F/A-18 E/F, its newest fighter upgrade. In August 2000, the Naval Air Systems Command instituted a Depot Program Management Board to improve its source-of-repair process. The board is supposed to corporately manage the naval aviation industrial enterprise, which encompasses the combined capabilities and resources of organic Navy, interservice, and commercial aviation depots. The board includes key logistics and acquisition officials from within the Command whose responsibilities and authority have a major impact on the size, shape, and cost of the naval aviation industrial base. Its responsibilities include determining and sustaining core naval aviation industrial capability and capacity and guiding best-value, industrial source-of-repair decisions. At its inaugural meeting in August 2000, the board concluded that the industrial enterprise needed a more unified corporate source-of-repair decision process to ensure that the technology for core capability is maintained.

Prior to 1999, the acquisition community operated under policy guidance advocating contractor performance and the development of long- term support relationships with private sector contractors. Some officials believe that Army policy and practice is trying to better use the Army depots and achieve improved efficiencies.
