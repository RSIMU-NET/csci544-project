Consequently, HHS's needs were not always aligned with the resources that its support agencies could provide, resulting in some deployed resources not being properly and efficiently utilized. For example, HHS requested Department of Defense medical teams, but these teams specialized in trauma and surgical care, not the chronic and primary care needed.", "HHS lacked plans for the territories that accounted for the chronic and primary care needs in isolated communities.

According to Department of Homeland  Security documentation, decision makers  gather at emergency operations centers to  ensure they receive the most current  information, which allows for improved  communication and decision-making during a  response.", "During the initial weeks after the hurricanes, ASPR liaison officers  were not always stationed at the emergency operations centers in St.  Thomas and St. Croix. Instead, the liaisons rotated between the  emergency operations center, hospital, and airport on each island to  manage patient evacuations, or stayed at the hospital, according to  ASPR officials. This led to confusion with regard to the ESF#8  response status on the ground, according to FEMA, DOD, and  territory health officials. For example, FEMA officials stated that when  they needed information on patients\u2019 health needs and evacuation  status, they had to spend time trying to locate an ASPR liaison officer  to obtain it. The FEMA officials then had to relay this information to  DOD, territory health officials, and hospital representatives who were  making numerous requests for this information to FEMA in ASPR\u2019s  absence at the centers. FEMA officials stated that relaying medical  information was outside their areas of expertise as were other  activities they conducted in ASPR\u2019s absence, such as addressing  public health issues at shelters. One FEMA official stated that he had  to read handwritten notes from the hospital that contained patient  information, such as vitals and prescription needs, and provide this  information to other responders. Without a medical background, he  did not know the meaning of a lot of the medical terms used.  Furthermore, these FEMA officials stated that given communication  systems were down on the islands, having a reliable, physical  presence at the emergency operations centers in St. Thomas and St.  Croix became even more critical.", "After a few weeks into the response, ASPR liaison officers were  stationed at emergency operations centers, according to ASPR  officials, but the officers generally rotated about every 2 weeks with  limited time to hand off information and were often not from Region II.  This limited ASPR\u2019s leadership of the response and put undue  resource strain on other responders, according to FEMA and territory  health officials. For example, according to FEMA and U.S. Virgin  Islands health officials, the liaison officer would not necessarily  understand the big picture, the tasks to be done, or the players  involved. Thus, FEMA and territory health officials would have to take  time to bring the ASPR liaison officer up to speed on the pressing  public health and medical services issues, and shortly thereafter the  officer would leave to be replaced by someone else, who would also  need to be brought up to speed.", "ASPR officials provided two different reasons for the staffing challenges  encountered at the emergency operations centers in the U.S. Virgin  Islands.", "First, some ASPR officials cited personnel resource constraints.", "Specifically, these officials stated that ASPR personnel had already  been deployed multiple times, given the prior hurricane (Hurricane  Harvey) and concurrent events that ASPR was responding to in  multiple locations. As a result, officials said there was not enough time  to educate rotating officials on issues faced in the U.S. Virgin Islands  and deployments were shorter than ideal.", "Second, other ASPR officials stated that a lack of transportation from  Puerto Rico to the U.S. Virgin Islands may have resulted in minimal  overlap of liaison officers. According to these officials, they had to  request such transportation from FEMA, and FEMA did not always  prioritize their needs, since it was also managing transportation needs  from other ESFs. However, FEMA officials contested this statement  and stated there was ample opportunity for ASPR liaison officers to  get to the U.S. Virgin Islands.", "In retrospect, ASPR officials acknowledged that staffing emergency  operations centers, as well as other strategic locations is ideal. ASPR  documentation after the response states that the officers\u2019 presence at  emergency operations centers is important because they need to be  working at the operational and tactical levels on the ground. In addition to  staffing emergency operations centers, ASPR officials agreed with  statements from FEMA and DOD officials who told us that the ideal  scenario would be to have at least one other liaison officer (if not more) to  support the lead liaison officer at all strategic locations. The officials noted  that the number of liaison officers may vary depending on the response  needs. In the case of patient evacuations, for example, this would include  having a liaison officer at the airport and one at the hospital, in addition to  the lead at the emergency operations center. In contrast, DOD officials  stated that after Hurricane Irma, one ASPR liaison was on St. Croix trying  to manage all the ESF#8 activities, including patient evacuations and  hospital assessments, which was too much for one person.", "In May 2019, ASPR officials told us they have a long-term goal of creating  an incident response team that will comprise 17 full-time response  personnel. If implemented, this strategy may allow ASPR to provide more  liaisons on the ground during a response and address the staffing  deficiency we identified. However, ASPR officials did not provide us with  a draft strategy or a timeline for the creation of such a team. Until ASPR  develops a response personnel strategy to ensure it has sufficient liaison  officers available to consistently lead a response from emergency  operations centers and other strategic locations, the agency risks  repeating the challenge encountered in the U.S. Virgin Islands\u2014notably,  a situation with inadequate liaison officer presence to effectively lead a  response on the ground.", "Delay in tracking evacuated patients. Tracking NDMS evacuated  patients and ensuring their care is a critical component of the public  health and medical services response. The ESF#8 Annex of the National  Response Framework states that patients should be tracked from their  point of entry into NDMS.", "However, our review found that ASPR did not track patients evacuated  through NDMS from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Puerto Rico immediately  after Hurricane Irma. This occurred because of delays in getting HHS  tracking personnel to the territories, according to VA documentation, as  well as ASPR, DOD, VA, FEMA, and U.S. Virgin Islands Department of  Health officials. Specifically, HHS teams that track patients were not  deployed to the region until about 5 days after patients were already  being evacuated through NDMS. These teams are (1) Joint Patient  Assessment and Tracking System (JPATS) teams, which enter patient  information into JPATS\u2014ASPR\u2019s tracking system\u2014and (2) service  access teams, which track and monitor the status of evacuated patients,  including facilitating movement to home or other final destination after  being discharged from care.", "As a result of the delayed deployment of the tracking teams, ASPR  officials did not initially know the locations of some NDMS evacuated  patients in Puerto Rico. For example, once in Puerto Rico, the service  access teams had to drive around the territory looking for evacuees,  according to ASPR officials. ASPR officials explained that there was a  delay in tracking patients after Hurricane Irma because it takes time for  JPATS and service access teams to deploy to a region. ASPR officials  told us that they did not pre-deploy the tracking teams before the  hurricane, because the U.S. Virgin Islands officials did not request  ASPR\u2019s help with patient evacuations until after Hurricane Irma hit.", "ASPR officials also stated that at the time of the hurricanes, the agency  had no policy for tracking patients from the start of NDMS evacuations;  however, since the hurricanes, the agency has developed a federal  patient movement framework that may help prevent future delays in  patient tracking. This framework describes the pre-deployment of JPATS  and service access teams, which would allow for tracking to start at the  beginning of NDMS evacuations. ASPR officials told us this is the optimal  solution. However, during an event such as a hurricane, sufficient notice  for pre-deployment is not always possible. One option identified in  ASPR\u2019s federal patient movement framework is for FEMA to track  patients initially and share these data with ASPR and for DOD to provide  patient movement manifests to ASPR so that the data can be manually  entered into JPATS once deployed, which will contain the overall dataset  for patient tracking. By working with DOD and FEMA, ASPR may be able  to consistently track patients from the start of evacuations even when  there is a deployment delay in HHS\u2019s own tracking capabilities.", "While ASPR\u2019s development of the framework is an important step forward  to address delays in patient tracking, ASPR has not exercised the  framework with its NDMS partners to ensure it is sufficient and reliable.  For example, given the potential need to manually enter information into  JPATS, there could still be a delay in HHS knowing where patients are  located and being able to inform family members. An exercise of the  framework could help determine if this is indeed a concern that needs to  be addressed. We have previously reported that exercises are a key tool  for testing and evaluating preparedness. ASPR officials told us that  exercising the framework prior to the next hurricane season had been  discussed, but as of May 2019, nothing had been scheduled. Without a  framework that has been exercised with the other agencies involved in  federal patient movement and tracking, ASPR risks delays in patient  tracking when conducting future NDMS patient evacuations.", "Final status of one-fourth of evacuated patients not readily available.  The ESF#8 Annex of the National Response Framework states that  NDMS evacuated patients should be tracked to their final disposition.  Further, federal internal controls standards stress the importance of  information controls to ensure quality information is used to achieve  objectives, which includes information that is complete and accurate.", "However, we found that of the approximately 800 NDMS patient  evacuations during the response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the  agency could not readily provide us with the final status of approximately  200 of these patients. ASPR officials stated they did not have  information indicating the final status of the 200 evacuated patients,  because case workers are not required to report this information to  ASPR. ASPR officials explained that the case workers on the service  access teams deployed during the response are responsible for keeping  track of patients\u2019 final status. However, we found that without conducting  a review of files in which the case workers recorded patients\u2019 final status,  ASPR officials could not determine if the patients were appropriately  discharged and returned back to the U.S. Virgin Islands, left the system  against medical advice, or were otherwise unaccounted for.", "Additionally, as of June 2019, ASPR did not provide documentation  indicating the steps the agency takes to ensure the data held by case  workers are accurate. Until ASPR has controls in place to ensure that  data on NDMS evacuated patients are complete and accurate, the  agency cannot ensure it is sufficiently tracking all NDMS evacuated  patients and risks losing track of patients when conducting future patient  evacuation efforts.", "Limited focus on chronic and primary care needs in isolated  locations. As the coordinator, ASPR is responsible for ensuring that  appropriate planning and preparedness activities are undertaken. This  includes planning for the care of elderly and chronically ill patients in  isolated areas.", "Our review found that at the time of the hurricanes, ASPR Region II\u2019s  response plans for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico\u2014known as  Incident Response Plans\u2014did not account for the need for chronic and  primary care in isolated communities. This type of care was greatly  needed, given that many people, especially the elderly, could not easily  access hospitals, according to officials from ASPR, DOD, the Puerto Rico  Department of Health, and three stakeholders we interviewed. Consistent  with the views of these officials, the HHS Deputy Inspector General  reported that during Hurricane Maria, hundreds of patients across Puerto  Rico sought access to urgent care, primary care, and pharmacy services  at community-based health care centers, known as Federally Qualified  Health Centers, because they could not travel to hospitals for treatment.  Further, we reported in May 2019 and heard from two stakeholders that  because of the widespread power outages and infrastructure damage in  both territories, the chronically ill often did not have access to electricity to  power their medical devices\u2014such as ventilators\u2014and gasoline to run  generators was scarce.", "ASPR\u2019s initial response activities\u2014which generally focused on supporting  the hospitals and patients with acute care needs\u2014were based on  response plans with assumptions that did not hold true given the  unprecedented level of destruction in the areas. Specifically, according to  ASPR officials, the agency focused its response planning on managing the surge of patients at hospitals, assuming that individuals would make  their way to hospitals, and projecting that smaller communities could care  for one another until further needs assessments could be conducted. For  example, ASPR Region II and Puerto Rico health officials assumed in  their planning that patients in the harder to reach areas, such as the  mountainous areas, would make their way to the coast where hospital  care was available, according to ASPR officials.", "ASPR officials also stated that preparedness planning for an immediate  response is generally focused on managing the surge of patients at  hospitals, with the assumption that after about a week into the response,  assessments would be conducted to determine other needs, such as  chronic care needs. However, ASPR officials told us that in retrospect,  the planning and the assumptions used for planning for the U.S. Virgin  Islands and Puerto Rico were not adequate given the unprecedented  level of destruction in the areas, which affected communications and  transportation. FEMA officials also said that given how difficult it was to  assess the situation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, having prior  knowledge of the situation on the ground that could affect the response  (such as the general public health and medical needs in the territories  during non-disaster times) was a lesson learned that applies to them, as  well as ASPR.", "ASPR has taken steps to better account for the need for chronic and  primary care in isolated communities in future public health and medical  services responses. However, these efforts have not been finalized or  incorporated into ASPR Region II Incident Response Plans for the  territories, which according to a lead HHS Region II official, are internal  agency plans that serve as a playbook for HHS officials during an ESF#8  response in these territories. Specifically, ASPR is working with the  Puerto Rico Department of Health officials to map the locations of health  care facilities in Puerto Rico\u2014such as clinics, Federally Qualified Health  Centers, urgent care centers, and hospitals\u2014including their bed,  generator, communication, and surge capacities. This is the first time all  such information has been brought together, and ASPR continues to work  on this effort as it helps the territory recover, according to agency  documentation. ASPR officials also told us that moving forward they  would like to involve Federally Qualified Health Centers in planning and  response activities, including involving them in the provision of primary  care during responses.", "We agree that these are important steps that ASPR can take to address  this deficiency. However, until ASPR Region II Incident Response Plans  for the territories include the provision of chronic and primary care in  isolated communities, there is a risk that disaster survivors will not receive  needed care. For example, this could include the incorporation of  Federally Qualified Health Centers or other local health clinics into these  plans.", "Misalignment of support agencies\u2019 capabilities to response needs.  As the coordinator, ASPR is responsible for ensuring that appropriate  planning and preparedness activities are undertaken, including monitoring  the progress in meeting the ESF#8 core capabilities. Further, FEMA  guidance issued in June 2015 states that each ESF coordinator should  maintain a capabilities inventory for the ESF.", "However, our review found that ASPR did not have a sufficient  understanding of ESF#8 support agencies\u2019 capabilities prior to the  hurricanes. Consequently, ASPR\u2019s resource needs for the response in  the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were not always aligned with the  resources its support agencies\u2014DOD, VA, and FEMA\u2014could provide.  According to ASPR documentation and DOD officials, this resulted in  some deployed resources not being properly and efficiently utilized.", "As an example of the misalignment of resources, DOD officials told us  that, through FEMA, ASPR requested that DOD provide stand-alone  medical assistance teams (i.e., teams of medical personnel and  equipment, similar to ASPR\u2019s Disaster Medical Assistance Teams) to  deliver medical care to the hurricane survivors in the U.S. Virgin Islands  and Puerto Rico. However, since DOD does not have stand-alone teams,  it deployed Area Support Medical Companies, which included facilities,  equipment, and supply packages. These teams are equipped to serve the  military population\u2014those approximately 18-60 years of age, wounded,  and requiring trauma and medical-surgical care. However, trauma and  medical surgical care was not the primary need in the islands, which, in  general, have an older population with chronic and primary care needs.", "ASPR documentation also shows that ASPR had trouble defining how  FEMA and DOD assets fit into the overarching ESF#8 response. For  example, ASPR documentation states that it took the agency nearly a  week to fully realize that the two Area Support Medical Companies  provided by DOD were not equivalent to the five stand-alone medical  assistance teams that HHS had requested. According to DOD officials,  the misalignment of resources during the response was troublesome as  the Department\u2019s involvement in the ESF#8 response activities affected  patient care for military health beneficiaries and potentially increased  overseas contingency response risks for the Department. In another  example, during the response, there were conflicting expectations about  VA personnel\u2019s role in supporting the Federal Medical Stations, with VA  responders thinking they would run shelter operations and ASPR  believing the VA staff would support medical operations, according to  ASPR documentation.", "According to ASPR officials, the agency had never anticipated needing\u2014 and therefore did not plan for\u2014certain ESF#8 agency support, such as  teams similar to ASPR\u2019s Disaster Medical Assistance Teams. ASPR\u2019s  role in a response has traditionally been to support states or territories;  however, because of the catastrophic nature of the hurricanes, ASPR  effectively led the territories in the response as opposed to playing a  supporting role. ASPR\u2019s response system was not designed to handle  that large of a role, according to officials.", "Since the hurricanes, ASPR has taken steps to understand the resources  available from its support agencies, but ASPR officials agreed that it is an  activity that the agency needs to continue to undertake. Specifically,  ASPR officials stated that the agency is currently working with its NDMS  partners (FEMA, DOD, and VA) to develop memorandums of agreement  that outline the roles and responsibilities of each organization; however,  the discussions are in the preliminary stages as ASPR continues to  collaborate with each organization to understand their resource gaps and  capabilities. Continuing to understand each ESF#8 support agency\u2019s  potential capabilities and its limitations\u2014knowing that the actual capacity  of these capabilities may fluctuate\u2014is important, as evidenced by the  misalignment that occurred during the response. Until ASPR can better  identify the capabilities and limitations of support agencies to meet ESF#8  core capabilities, ASPR cannot, as the coordinator, determine whether  the ESF is prepared for future disasters.", "Reliance on DOD support. As the coordinator, ASPR is responsible for  ensuring that appropriate planning and preparedness activities are  undertaken. This includes planning for a scenario in which DOD  assistance is unavailable. We have previously reported that DOD  provided much of the ESF#8 support during the initial response to  Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which may not always be available in future  responses. DOD\u2019s support included providing the core capabilities of  patient care (through the provision of Area Support Medical Companies,  among other medical facilities) and patient evacuations (through the  provision of personnel and transportation to conduct aeromedical  evacuations), as mentioned above.", "We found that ASPR does not have a response strategy that will account  for the core capabilities needed to be filled by itself or other support  agencies in a large or long-term ESF#8 response if DOD were unable to  assist. For example, DOD\u2019s 2017 hurricane after-action report included  reliance on DOD as a concern and recommended that HHS and FEMA  establish contracts with the commercial sector to ensure the federal  government has other options available for larger ESF#8 responses  should DOD not have the needed capability or available capacity.  Similarly, in September 2018, we reported that ESF lead agencies\u2019  (including ASPR for ESF#8) dependence on DOD capabilities was a  challenge for DOD during the response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria. We  reported that the increased reliance may create vulnerability, if in the  future, DOD capabilities are needed to conduct its primary mission\u2014to  defend the nation from threats\u2014at the same time its support is needed for  a domestic disaster response.", "ASPR told us that it does not have a contingency plan for a response in  DOD\u2019s absence, because for large-scale events, such as Hurricanes Irma  and Maria, ASPR has to rely on DOD, given ASPR\u2019s own resource  constraints. ASPR officials stated that, in general, ASPR\u2019s resource  response capacity\u2014personnel and supplies\u2014can support a response to  two simultaneous events that occur in different areas in the Continental  United States for 30 days. Beyond that, ASPR has to rely on other  agencies, including DOD, which occurred with Hurricanes Irma and  Maria.", "However, ASPR officials did state that the agency has recently taken  some steps to reduce its reliance on DOD. Specifically, in September  2018, ASPR entered into a contract with a private company to provide  medical personnel teams similar to Disaster Medical Assistance Teams  that can be utilized to supplement ASPR response personnel, especially if  DOD resources are not available. Similarly, to assist with future patient  evacuations, in October 2018, the agency entered into contracts with  private companies for commercial air ambulance transport. In addition,  ASPR officials told us that through ASPR\u2019s participation in the Whole of  Government Logistics Council, the agency has begun to further discuss  air transport options during major disasters with other agencies including  FEMA, DOD, and VA. However, ASPR officials also stated there is a  need to hold discussions with all agencies involved in the ESFs to  prioritize and coordinate air transportation during a response in the event  that DOD is not available.", "While these are important steps to potentially minimize reliance on DOD,  ASPR\u2019s own capacity constraints make it all the more important for ASPR  to a develop response strategy that includes other support agencies in  the event that DOD support is unavailable. For example, such a strategy  could involve conducting an exercise to simulate a large-scale ESF#8  response without DOD capabilities. Until ASPR develops a strategy  demonstrating how ESF#8 core capabilities can be provided through HHS  and its support agencies without DOD\u2019s assistance, it risks being  unprepared to respond to a large-scale disaster or multiple disasters if  they occur when DOD\u2019s capabilities are limited due to other events, such  as military missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While ASPR Has Completed a Draft After-Action Report to Evaluate Its Response, It is Missing Key Perspectives", "paragraphs": ["ASPR completed a draft after-action report in February 2018 after several  months of collecting feedback from HHS staff on the strengths and areas  for improvement in the agency\u2019s 2017 ESF#8 response activities;  however, the draft is missing the perspectives of key parties involved in  the response. Not collecting the perspectives of key parties involved in  the response is inconsistent with federal standards for information and  communication, which state that management needs access to relevant  information from external parties to help achieve objectives and address  related risks. Further, the Standard for Program Management states  that program managers should actively engage key stakeholders  throughout the life cycle of a program, which would include any evaluation  activities.", "Specifically, when collecting feedback, ASPR did not reach out directly to  support agencies, territorial governments in the U.S. Virgin Islands and  Puerto Rico, or other stakeholders intimately involved in the response.  Instead, ASPR gathered observations through facilitated discussions, or  \u201chotwashes,\u201d with HHS personnel stationed at key response sites in  headquarters and the field, such as personnel stationed at the HHS Secretary\u2019s Operations Center and those stationed at medical sites in  Puerto Rico. In addition, ASPR distributed an electronic feedback link to  all personnel involved in the HHS ESF#8 response, both in the field and  headquarters.", "ASPR officials stated they did not obtain feedback directly from outside  parties, such as support agencies or territorial governments, during the  after-action review because the review was focused on internal aspects of  the HHS response. Instead, the officials said that FEMA\u2014as the overall  lead for the federal response\u2014typically writes the overall after-action  report for the whole federal government, and those perspectives would be  captured there. However, FEMA\u2019s after-action report was focused only on  its response activities for the 2017 hurricanes and did not include any  strengths or areas for improvement related to ESF#8.", "Because ASPR did not obtain feedback from its ESF#8 support agencies  and other partners, its draft after-action report dated February 2018 has  key gaps in its assessment. For example, three of the deficiencies we  identified based on our review of documentation and interviews with  agency and territory officials\u2014the delay in tracking evacuated patients,  the final status of some evacuated patients not readily available, and the  reliance on DOD support\u2014were not included in ASPR\u2019s draft after-action  report. This indicates that key perspectives, and related lessons learned,  were missing from ASPR\u2019s after-action review. Similarly, FEMA officials  said that during the course of soliciting feedback on its own response  actions, FEMA\u2019s provider of NDMS medical evacuation transportation for  Hurricanes Irma and Maria said that if ASPR had reached out, it would  have identified challenges with the NDMS patient evacuations conducted.  In particular, the provider told FEMA that patients were evacuated to an  airport in the continental United States with limited hours of availability,  and if patients had to be evacuated outside of those hours, they were  sent to other airports with inadequate medical care, so the patients  needed to be transported again as a result.", "Without an after-action report that includes the perspectives of all key  parties\u2014including ESF#8 support agencies\u2014ASPR management is likely  to lack the necessary information to comprehensively identify all strengths  and areas for improvement of its ESF#8 response."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The catastrophic destruction encountered as a result of Hurricanes Irma  and Maria proved overwhelming to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto  Rican governments and resulted in a large federal disaster response,  complicated by losses of power, communication, transportation, and  health care infrastructure in the territories.

The deficiencies also resulted in  service access teams having to search for evacuated patients, ASPR\u2019s  inability to readily and reliably identify the final status of all evacuated  patients, and disaster survivors in isolated areas potentially not receiving  needed health care. ASPR\u2019s leadership also led to an inefficient use of  federal resources. Many of the deficiencies were a function of ASPR  policy and its preparedness planning, and as such, they could be  repeated unless ASPR addresses them. Additionally, the agency remains  unprepared to respond to future large-scale disasters if DOD is  unavailable.
