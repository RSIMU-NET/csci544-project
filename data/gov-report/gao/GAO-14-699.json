Corps headquarters officials said that the agency does not have a policy instructing its district offices to enter into their databases projects that are authorized but have not been appropriated funds and that it is up to the discretion of the district offices to do so. Corps officials also stated that the agency does not include studies on its backlog, nor does it have a policy instructing district offices to track studies. Federal internal control standards state that agencies are to document internal controls in management directives, administrative policies, or operating manuals to help ensure consistent treatment. Officials at 15 of 16 district offices told GAO that they enter projects into the databases only after funds are appropriated. The Corps has begun to take steps to include all authorized projects in a new agency database; however, this database will not include studies. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to have mechanisms to appropriately document transactions and other significant events. Without written policies requiring districts to track all projects and studies and a mechanism to track studies, the Corps may continue to have an incomplete backlog list. The absence of a complete backlog list of projects and studies will likely make it difficult for the Corps to know the full universe of unmet water resource needs of the country, and Congress to make informed decisions when authorizing projects and studies, and appropriating funds.", "The Corps has not identified all eligible construction projects and studies for deauthorization and has not complied with statutory requirements to notify Congress of all projects and studies eligible for deauthorization. The agency is unlikely to identify those projects that have been excluded from the databases and had no funds obligated for 5 fiscal years, because, as discussed above, the Corps does not require districts to enter all authorized projects into its databases. Officials GAO interviewed from 5 of 16 districts said they likely would not identify and add projects to the draft deauthorization eligible list because they were not required to do so. Moreover, the Corps has not complied with statutory requirements to notify Congress of all projects that have not had obligations in 5 fiscal years. Specifically, the Corps cannot demonstrate it transmitted a list of projects eligible for deauthorization 8 times in the 12 years it was required to do so since 1997. Corps headquarters officials said that the process and communication mechanisms for deauthorizing projects are not in Corps policies or procedures. Without documented policies and procedures consistent with federal standards for internal control, the Corps may continue its inconsistent publishing of deauthorization lists. In addition, the Corps has not complied with requirements to identify studies for deauthorization because officials have said the agency does not have the policies and procedures in place to do so.

These Corps construction projects can be  found in 47 of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and Puerto  Rico and range from constructing levees for flood risk management, to  waterway deepening for navigational purposes, to building structures to  control invasive species for ecosystem restoration. Before the Corps can  proceed with a construction project, it must first be authorized and  appropriated funds to complete a study to determine, among other things,  whether the project warrants federal participation, how the water resource  problem can be addressed, and the level of interest of local sponsors for  cost sharing. Once the study is complete and the Corps recommends a  project for construction, Congress must authorize the project and  appropriate funds before construction can begin. Since fiscal year 2007,  annual appropriations for the Corps\u2019 civil works construction projects have  generally decreased from about $2.4 billion to $1.7 billion in fiscal year  2014. Reports have found that declining appropriations, coupled with the  backlog of authorized projects, has left communities uncertain when or if  their projects will be completed.", "The Corps has been required to identify projects for possible  deauthorization since 1974 and studies for possible deauthorization since  1986. The requirements appear in various Water Resources  Development Acts. Once a study or project is deauthorized, it generally  must be reauthorized for study or construction to resume. Since the  Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986, as amended, the  Corps has been required to identify all incomplete water resources  studies that have not had funds appropriated in 5 consecutive fiscal years  as well as being required to identify all projects that had not been  obligated funds in 5 consecutive fiscal years and submit those lists to  Congress., If funds are not (1) appropriated to studies within 90 days or  (2) obligated to projects by the end of the fiscal year following the  submission of the lists to Congress, those studies or projects would be  deauthorized. Most recently, the Water Resources Reform and  Development Act (WRRDA) of 2014 was enacted into law. Among other  things, it creates a process to identify and deauthorize $18 billion in  authorized projects that are no longer viable for construction and to  compile and publish a comprehensive backlog report including all projects  and separable elements of projects that have been authorized but for  which construction is not yet completed.", "You asked us to review the Corps\u2019 construction backlog and  deauthorization processes.

For purposes of this report, the reference to construction  backlog includes any project or study that was authorized but for which  the construction or study is not yet complete.", "We addressed these objectives through a variety of steps. Specifically,  we reviewed pertinent federal laws and the Corps\u2019 policies and  procedures related to data collection and deauthorization processes. We  also reviewed obligations data contained in the Corps\u2019 databases used to  guide its deauthorization processes. To assess data reliability, we  reviewed data dictionaries, user guides, and other documentation that the  Corps provided for the agency\u2019s databases. Unless otherwise stated, any  data reported were found to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  review. We interviewed Corps headquarters officials to obtain additional  information about the agency\u2019s policies, procedures, and processes for  tracking its construction backlog and to determine its process for creating  a list of projects and studies eligible for deauthorization. We also  interviewed officials from a nonprobability sample of 16 of 38 domestic  civil works district offices to determine how district offices track projects  and implement the deauthorization process. We selected district offices  based on geographical representation and number of projects, and we  included those district offices with the most projects and the least projects  in their respective divisions. The results of such a sample are not  generalizable to all domestic civil works district offices, but provide  illustrative examples of how district offices track projects and implement  the deauthorization process. In addition, we interviewed nonfederal  sponsors of Corps projects, selected through discussions with national  associations, to determine how they were affected by the backlog and  deauthorization process. We selected these associations to represent  Corps water resources projects and with membership that includes  nonfederal sponsors of Corps water resources projects. The views of  representatives from these associations are not generalizable, but they  provided perspectives on the Corps\u2019 backlog and deauthorization  processes. We collected and reviewed deauthorization documents  produced by the Corps from 1997 to 2013.

Located within the Department of  Defense, the Corps has both military and civilian responsibilities.  Through its Civil Works Program, the Corps plans, constructs, operates,  and maintains a wide range of water resources projects. The Corps\u2019 Civil  Works Program has nine major functional areas, also known as business  lines: Navigation, Flood Risk Management, Environment, Recreation,  Hydropower, Water Supply, Emergency Management, Regulatory  Program, and Support for Others.organized into three tiers: a national headquarters in Washington, D.C., 8  regional divisions, and 38 local district offices (see fig. 1)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Process for Developing Corps Projects", "paragraphs": ["The major steps in developing a Corps construction project are shown in  figure 2.", "Usually, the Corps becomes involved in water resource construction  projects when a local community perceives a need or experiences a  problem that is beyond its ability to solve and contacts the Corps for  assistance. If the Corps does not have the statutory authority required for  studying the problem, the Corps must obtain authorization from Congress  before proceeding. Studies have been authorized through legislation,  typically a WRDA, or, in some circumstances, through a committee  resolution by an authorizing committee. Next, the Corps must receive an  appropriation to study the project, which it seeks through its annual  budget request to Congress.", "Under WRDA 2007 amendments, after receiving authorization and an  appropriation, studies were conducted in two phases: reconnaissance  and feasibility. at full federal expense to determine if the problem warranted federal  participation in a feasibility study and how the problem could be  addressed. During the reconnaissance phase, the Corps also assessed  the level of interest and support from nonfederal entities such as state,  tribal, county, or local governments or agencies that may become  sponsors. If the Corps determined that further study was warranted, the  district office typically sought agreement from the local sponsor to share  costs for a feasibility study. WRRDA 2014 eliminated the reconnaissance  phase to accelerate the study process and allow the Corps to proceed  directly to the feasibility study. The conference report accompanying  WRRDA 2014 also states that the Corps may terminate a study when it is  clear there is no demonstrable federal interest for a project or that  construction of the project is not possible for technical, legal, or financial  reasons.guidance on the elimination of the reconnaissance phase.", "Pub.

Corps guidance  states that typical feasibility studies should be completed in 18 to 36  months. According to Corps documents, the district office conducts the  study and the needed environmental studies and documents the results in  a feasibility report that includes a total project cost estimate based on the  recommended plan. The Chief of Engineers reviews the report and  decides whether to sign a final decision document, known as the Chief\u2019s  Report, recommending the project for construction. The Chief of  Engineers transmits the Chief\u2019s Report and the supporting documentation  to Congress through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works  and the Office of Management and Budget. Congress may authorize the  project\u2019s construction in a WRDA or other legislation. When Congress  approves a project for construction, it typically authorizes a total cost for  the project based on estimates prepared by the Corps.", "Most construction projects are authorized during the preconstruction  engineering and design phase. The purpose of this phase is to complete  any additional planning studies and all of the detailed, technical studies  and designs needed to begin construction of the project. Once the  construction project has been authorized and preconstruction engineering  and design has been funded through completion of the plans and  specifications for the first construction contract, the Corps seeks funds to  construct the project through the annual budget formulation process. As  part of the budget process, the Army, with input and data from Corps  headquarters, division, and district offices, develops a budget request for  the agency. Beginning in fiscal year 2006, the Corps introduced what it  refers to as performance-based budgeting as a way to focus funding  requests on those projects with the highest anticipated return on  investment, rather than a wider set of projects that meet budget policies  as it sought to do in the past. Under its current budget formulation  process, the Corps uses performance metrics to evaluate projects\u2019  estimated future outcomes and gives priority to those it determines have  the highest expected returns for the national economy and the  environment, as well as those that reduce risk to human life. Budget  justification materials are provided to the House and Senate  Appropriations Committee for consideration. Through the conference  committee reports accompanying appropriations acts, Congress directs  funds for individual projects in increments over the course of several  years. The Corps considers a project or study to have been appropriated  funds if the project or study has received such direction in a committee  report. If the project has been appropriated funds, the district enters into a  cost-sharing agreement with the nonfederal sponsor. Once funds have  been appropriated and a cost-sharing agreement is in place, the  construction phase can begin and the Corps may obligate funds for a  project. Construction is generally managed by the Corps but performed  by private contractors.

Corps officials said, and our review found, that some  projects that were authorized are included on the backlog list, but not their  associated cost, therefore raising questions about the validity of the $62  billion estimate.

Officials from two district offices we interviewed said that they do not  maintain a list of authorized projects that did not have funds appropriated,  but nonfederal sponsors often contact them regarding these projects, so  the officials were aware of them. Officials from three districts we  interviewed said they do not maintain a list of all authorized projects in  their district and are unable to estimate how many projects from their  district are not included in the Corps\u2019 databases.

One of the goals of  this initiative is to create a database to include all authorized projects.  Headquarters officials said the agency hired a contractor in February  2014 to create an inventory of all projects that were authorized since the  passage of WRDA 1986. This inventory is a major component of a new,  centralized project database called the Civil Works Integrated Funding  Database. They said to create this inventory, the contractor will search  WRDA 1986 and other legislation, such as appropriations acts, that may  include project authorizations, and then match those projects with  information contained in the Corps\u2019 databases.

Additionally, officials from 2 Corps district offices  said some projects may not receive priority in the agency\u2019s budget   For example, an official from the Alaska district said that  request.projects within his district tend to rank lower than projects in high-traffic  ports, such as New York and Long Beach, but authorized construction  projects are still important to the Alaskan community and should not be  deauthorized.", "Reports show that having a large backlog can have negative effects. For  example, a 2007 report by the National Academy of Public Administration  states that a backlog complicates the budgeting process and provides an  incentive to spread funding widely, over many projects, rather than to  complete high priority projects that have already begun construction. That report recommended that the Corps and Congress work to eliminate  the backlog of projects that have little chance of being funded. Similarly,  the National Academy of Sciences reported in 2011 that the backlog  leads to projects being delayed, conducted in a stop-start manner, and  contributes to overall inefficient project delivery.", "National Academy of Public Administration, Prioritizing America\u2019s Water Resources  Investments: Budget Reform for Civil Works Construction Projects at the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers (Washington, D.C.: February 2007)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Corps Cannot Demonstrate It Has Consistently Notified Congress of Projects That Meet Deauthorization Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["Current federal statute requires the Secretary of the Army to transmit to  Congress a list of authorized projects or separable elements of projects  that have had no obligations during the previous 5 full fiscal years.

Although the Corps has taken the initial steps  of compiling a database to include all authorized projects, the agency  faces challenges in identifying backlogged projects and projects eligible  for deauthorization. Specifically, the agency does not have complete data  on its backlogged projects, because it does not have documented policies  or procedures to enter projects into its databases when authorized as  called for by federal standards for internal control. Without such guidance,  it is likely that the Corps will continue to have incomplete data on such  projects and cannot know the full extent of the construction project  backlog, making it difficult to effectively deauthorize all eligible projects  and for the Corps and Congress to effectively prioritize projects and plan  the agency\u2019s work. In addition, the Corps was unable to locate all of the  lists of projects eligible for deauthorization that it has been required to  transmit to Congress since 1997, and the Corps has published lists of  deauthorized projects in the Federal Register inconsistently during that  time period.

For  purposes of this report, the Corps\u2019 backlog includes any study or project  that was authorized but for which the study or the construction is not yet  complete. Our work focused on the deauthorization processes for  construction studies and projects in fiscal years 1997 to 2013. We chose  this time frame based on amendments to the deauthorization  requirements enacted in WRDA 1996 and because the Corps did not  have complete obligations data for fiscal year 2014 at the time of our  review.", "To determine the extent to which the Corps tracks data on its backlog of  construction studies and projects as well as the extent to which the Corps  identifies eligible construction studies and projects for deauthorization, we  reviewed relevant federal statutes and the Corps\u2019 policies and procedures  related to data collection and deauthorization processes. We also  obtained the Corps\u2019 obligations data for fiscal years 1997 to 2013 in an  attempt to recreate the Corps\u2019 methods to identify projects for  deauthorization. However, after multiple interviews with Corps  headquarters officials responsible for the agency\u2019s databases to discuss  discrepancies, we determined the data were not reliable for our purposes  because not all authorized projects were contained in the databases. We  found that the obligations data that the Corps had were sufficiently  reliable for us to compare those projects with the projects the Corps  includes in its backlog and to compare with the Corps\u2019 draft  deauthorization lists. We also reviewed data dictionaries, user guides,  and other documentation that the Corps provided for the agency\u2019s  databases. We reviewed these documents to help determine how the  Corps used its databases to guide its deauthorization processes and to  assess data reliability. We also reviewed deauthorization documents  produced by the Corps from 1997 to 2013. These documents included  draft deauthorization lists created by Corps headquarters, draft  deauthorization lists that were verified by the division and district offices,  lists of projects eligible for deauthorization that were sent to Congress,  and Federal Register notices pertaining to deauthorized projects. Corps  headquarters officials located one year of draft deauthorization lists that  were verified from the division and district offices. We also reviewed any  draft deauthorization lists that were provided by district officials we spoke  with. Corps headquarters officials provided us with four (2006, 2010,  2011, and 2012) lists of projects eligible for deauthorization the agency  sent to Congress from 1997 to 2013. We interviewed Corps headquarters  officials to obtain additional information on the agency\u2019s policies and  procedures for tracking its construction backlog and to determine the  process the agency uses to create a list of studies and projects eligible for  deauthorization. In addition, we spoke with nonfederal sponsors of Corps  projects who are members of two national associations, to determine how  they were affected by the Corps\u2019 backlog and deauthorization process.  We selected these associations to represent the Corps\u2019 water resources  projects and with membership that includes nonfederal sponsors of Corps  water resources projects. The views of representatives from these  associations are not generalizable, but they provided perspectives on the  Corps\u2019 backlog and deauthorization processes.", "We also interviewed officials from a nonprobability sample of 16 of 38  Corps domestic civil works district offices to determine how district offices  track data on studies and projects and implement the deauthorization  process. We selected a non-probability sample of district offices that met  our selection criteria of (1) geographical representation of two district  offices in each of the Corps\u2019 8 civil works division offices and (2) number  of projects per district office. Specifically, we selected the district offices  with the most projects and the district offices with the least projects in  each of the 8 division offices, based on a list, provided by Corps  headquarters officials, of construction projects by division and district.  Project data was obtained from headquarters officials and included active  projects in each of the Corps districts. We used this data for the purpose  of selecting our non-probability sample, and determined it was sufficiently  reliable for this purpose. Because this is a non-probability sample, the  experiences and views of the Corps district officials are not representative  of, and cannot be generalized to, all Corps districts. However, these  experiences and views provide illustrative examples of how district offices  track projects and implement the deauthorization process.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2013 to August 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
