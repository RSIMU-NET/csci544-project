However, civil monetary  penalties can lose their effectiveness to punish and deter if they are not  timely adjusted for inflation.", "In 2016, federal agencies assessed and collected millions of dollars in  civil monetary penalties for violations of statutory requirements, such as  opening deposit accounts and issuing and activating debit cards without  consumers\u2019 authorization.

In  2003, we assessed federal agencies\u2019 implementation of the 1990 Act, as  amended by the Debt Collection Improvement Act (DCIA), and found that  several provisions in the act prevented some agencies from fully adjusting  their penalties for inflation, including a cap on initial adjustments and  exemptions of certain penalties from adjustments. Subsequently, the  Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015  was enacted, further amending the 1990 Act.

Congress  would occasionally adjust individual penalties or specific groups of  penalties through various statutes but not all civil penalties. As a result,  many penalties had not been changed for decades. When the Federal  Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (the 1990 Act) was  enacted, Congress noted in the \u201cFindings\u201d section of the legislation that  inflation had weakened the deterrent effect of many civil monetary  penalties. The stated purpose of the 1990 Act was \u201cto establish a  mechanism that shall (1) allow for regular adjustments for inflation of civil  monetary penalties; (2) maintain the deterrent effect of civil monetary  penalties and promote compliance with the law; and (3) improve the  collection by the federal government of civil monetary penalties.\u201d  However, the act did not give agencies the authority to adjust their civil  monetary penalties for inflation.", "In 1996, Congress enacted section 31001(s)(1) of DCIA, amending the  1990 Act to require agencies to issue regulations adjusting their covered  penalties for inflation. The 1990 Act as amended by DCIA required  agencies with covered penalties to adjust them by regulation published in  the Federal Register by October 23, 1996, and at least once every 4  years thereafter. The 1996 Inflation Adjustment Act amendment limited  the first such adjustment to 10 percent of the penalty amount. It required  specific calculation and rounding procedures to be followed and excluded  penalties under certain statutes (e.g., the Occupational Safety and Health  Act of 1970, the Social Security Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,  and the Tariff Act of 1930). However, as we reported in March 2003, the  10 percent cap on initial adjustments prevented some agencies from fully  adjusting for inflation in the hundreds of percentages since last set or  adjusted by Congress.", "The 1990 Act was further amended in 2015 to improve the effectiveness  of civil monetary penalties and to maintain their deterrent effect.  Specifically, the Inflation Adjustment Act requires:  1.  agencies to adjust each civil monetary penalty with an initial catch-up  adjustment through an interim final rulemaking (IFR) in the Federal  Register, no later than July 1, 2016, and to take effect no later than  August 1, 2016;  2.  agencies to include in the annual AFRs, submitted under OMB  Circular A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements, information about  the civil monetary penalties within the agencies\u2019 jurisdiction, including  the inflation adjustment of the civil monetary penalty amounts; and  3.  OMB to issue guidance to agencies for implementing the inflation  adjustments.", "In response to the Inflation Adjustment Act, in February 2016, OMB  issued OMB Memorandum M-16-06, Implementation of the Federal Civil  Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, for  agencies implementing the civil monetary penalty inflation adjustment  requirements of the Inflation Adjustment Act and, in October 2016,  revised OMB Circular A-136 to include guidance to federal agencies for  including inflation adjustments in annual financial reporting.", "Consistent with OMB guidance for implementing inflation adjustments,  federal agencies are responsible for identifying the civil monetary  penalties that fall under the statutes and regulations they enforce.  Agencies with questions on the applicability of the inflation adjustment  requirement to an individual penalty should first consult with their offices  of general counsel and then seek clarifying guidance from OMB if  necessary. In addition, agencies may request OMB concurrence that they  be allowed to adjust the amount of a civil monetary penalty by less than  the amount required under the Inflation Adjustment Act (a reduced catch- up adjustment determination), if they demonstrate that the otherwise  required increase of the penalty or penalty range would have a negative  economic effect or that the social costs would outweigh the benefits.  Consistent with the Inflation Adjustment Act, agencies should consult with  OMB before proposing a reduced catch-up adjustment determination.
