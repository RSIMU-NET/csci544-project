The use of offsets, specifically coproduction agreements, began in the late 1950s and early 1960s in Europe and Japan. A country\u2019s desire to coproduce portions of weapon systems was based on needs such as maintaining domestic employment, creating a national defense industrial base, acquiring modern technology, and assisting its balance of payments position. In 1984, we reported that offsets were a common practice and that demands for offsets on defense sales would continue to increase. The United States is the world\u2019s leading defense exporter and held about 52 percent of the global defense export market in 1994 (the latest year for which statistics are available).", "Offsets are often an essential part of defense export sales. Offset agreements may specify the level of offset required, normally expressed as a percentage of the sales contract. Offset agreements may also specify what types of activity are eligible for offset credit. Offset activities that are directly related to the weapon system sold are considered \u201cdirect\u201d offset, while those involving unrelated defense or nondefense goods or services are considered \u201cindirect.\u201d An offset may directly relate to the weapon system being sold or to some other weapon system or even nondefense goods or services. Countries may also include conditions specifying the transfer of high technology and where and with whom offset business must be done. Other provisions include requirements that offset credit be granted only for new business and that credits be granted only if local content exceeds a minimum level.", "Negotiating offset credit is an important part of implementing offset agreements. Countries can grant additional offset credit to encourage companies to undertake highly desirable offset activities. For example, countries may offer large multipliers for advanced technology or training that can greatly reduce a company\u2019s cost of meeting its offset obligation.However, a country can also establish criteria that make it difficult for a company to earn offset credit.", "Some countries, such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, cite restrictions in the United States and other defense markets and note that their offset policies are needed to ensure that their defense industries are given an opportunity to compete. The United States does not require offsets for its foreign military purchases, but it does have requirements that favor domestic production. The Defense Production Act of 1950 allows the Secretary of Defense to preserve the domestic mobilization base by restricting purchases of critical items from foreign sources. While not precluding foreign suppliers, regulations implementing the Buy America Act of 1933 allow price preferences for domestic manufacturers, and annual Department of Defense (DOD) appropriation acts sometimes contain prohibitions on foreign purchases of specific products.", "The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) prohibits the practice of offsets in government procurement, except for procurement of military weapons. In 1990, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) proposed a code of conduct for defense trade to regulate offsets in military exports, but did not adopt it.

These changes include targeting offset activities and granting offset credit only for new business rather than existing business. For example, Canada and the United Kingdom are less willing to grant offset credit for a company\u2019s existing business in the country, and South Korea has increased its demands for technology transfer and training as part of any offset agreement.", "Since 1990, Kuwait, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates have all established a new policy for offsets on foreign military purchases. They are now using offsets to help diversify their economies or promote general economic development. Although these countries are new entrants, company officials said they are knowledgeable about the defense market, and their offset policies can be equally as demanding as countries with existing offset policies. For example, the United Arab Emirates requires 60 percent of the value of the contract to be offset by commercially viable business ventures and grants offset credit based only on the profits generated by these investments.", "Singapore and Saudi Arabia have both recently reinstated their offset policies.

Meeting Spain\u2019s offset demands was more difficult because its defense industry is not as advanced as other Western industrialized countries.
