In 2003, the Congress authorized the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, a 5-year, $15 billion initiative under the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. The Emergency Plan focuses on 15 developing countries, with a goal of supporting treatment for 2 million people. Treatment regimens use multiple antiretroviral medications (ARV), which can be original or generic. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) combine two or three ARVs into one pill. Questions have been raised about whether the plan is providing ARVs preferred by the focus countries at reasonable prices. GAO compared the selection of ARVs provided under the plan with that provided under other major treatment initiatives, compared the prices of those selections, and determined what the Coordinator's Office is doing to expand the plan's selection of quality-assured lower-priced ARVs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Emergency Plan provides a smaller selection of recommended first-line ARVs than other major HIV/AIDS treatment initiatives in developing countries. The plan's selection includes six original ARV products--the only ARVs that have met the plan's quality assurance requirement--and does not include some FDCs that are preferred by most of the focus countries because they can simplify treatment. In contrast, the other initiatives provide a selection that in addition to the six original ARVs includes generic ARVs and more of the preferred FDCs. The original ARVs provided under the plan are generally higher in price than the generic ARVs provided under the other initiatives. The differences in the prices, quoted to GAO during June and July 2004 by 13 manufacturers, ranged from $11 less to $328 more per person per year for original ARVs than for the lowest-priced corresponding generic ARVs provided under the other initiatives. At these prices, three of the four first-line regimens recommended by the World Health Organization could be built for less--from $40 to $368 less depending on the regimen--with the generic ARVs provided under the other initiatives than with the original ARVs provided under the plan. Such differences in price per person per year could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars of additional expense when considered on the scale of the plan's goal of treating 2 million people by the end of 2008. The Coordinator's Office has worked to expand the selection of quality-assured ARVs--including FDCs and lower-priced generics--that it provides to the focus countries under the plan. The selection of ARVs available under the plan is primarily limited by its quality assurance requirement. The Coordinator's Office is working with manufacturers to take the steps necessary for more ARVs to meet this requirement. However, if generic ARVs meet the plan's quality assurance requirement, a statutory prohibition on the purchase of any medication manufactured outside the United States if the manufacture of that medication in the United States would be covered by a valid U.S. patent could become a barrier to expansion because all ARVs are currently under U.S. patents. Unless the patent holders for ARVs that have met the plan's quality requirement give permission or the Coordinator's Office exercises its authority to purchase these products notwithstanding the patent requirement, the selection of ARVs provided under the Emergency Plan may not expand rapidly enough to address the AIDS emergency."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates  that 3 million people worldwide died from HIV/AIDS in 2003, and an  estimated 38 million or more people are currently living with HIV/AIDS.  Although there is no cure for the disease, there are treatments that can  slow its progression. Yet in developing countries only about 7 percent of  people living with HIV/AIDS receive treatment. Since the mid-1980s the  United States has supported HIV/AIDS initiatives in developing countries  directly and through its contributions to multinational organizations such  as agencies within the United Nations (UN) system\u2014including the World  Bank and UNAIDS\u2014and, more recently, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS,  Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund). In 2004, the President\u2019s  Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Emergency Plan)\u2014a 5-year initiative  under the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (the Coordinator\u2019s  Office) within the Department of State\u2014added over $9 billion of funding  for HIV/AIDS treatment, care, and prevention in certain developing  countries to its ongoing commitments, bringing the total U.S. commitment  to addressing the worldwide HIV/AIDS emergency to $15 billion through  2008.", "The goals of the Emergency Plan, which focuses on 15 developing  countries with high rates of HIV/AIDS, are to support treatment to 2  million people living with HIV/AIDS, prevent 7 million new HIV infections,  and support care to 10 million people infected or affected by HIV/AIDS,  including orphans, by the end of fiscal year 2008. The plan allocates more  than half its budget to treatment, approximately $4 billion of which is  specifically for the purchase and distribution of antiretroviral medications  (ARV)\u2014the standard treatment for HIV/AIDS\u2014in the focus countries. An  HIV/AIDS treatment regimen includes multiple ARVs. ARVs are marketed  as either original versions\u2014all of which are currently under U.S. patents\u2014 or as copies of the originals, that is, generic versions. In addition, some  manufacturers are marketing products that combine two or three ARVs  into one pill\u2014known as a fixed-dose combination (FDC).", "The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends five specific ARVs  that are used to build four regimens as the first line for treatment  programs in countries in which health care resources are limited, such as  the focus countries. WHO recommends one of the four regimens as the  first choice for rapid implementation of large-scale treatment programs in  these countries. Most focus countries have indicated a preference for  FDCs, which can simplify treatment and facilitate adherence to the  recommended treatment regimens, and for lower-priced generics in their  national treatment strategies.", "While the Coordinator\u2019s Office has specified multiple objectives to achieve  the Emergency Plan\u2019s goals, two are most relevant to the purchase of ARV  products under the plan: first, coordination with the national treatment  strategies of the focus countries, and, second, provision of ARV products  of assured quality at the lowest possible price. Officials from organizations  involved in treating HIV/AIDS in developing countries, such as Doctors  Without Borders and Catholic Relief Services Consortium, have criticized  the plan for not including the FDCs preferred by the focus countries in the  selection of ARV products it provides. In addition, concerns have been  raised about the plan\u2019s ability to provide ARV products at reasonable  prices. You asked us to examine the provision of ARVs under the  Emergency Plan, as compared with the provision of ARVs under the  initiatives of major multinational organizations.", "In this report, we determine (1) how the selection of ARV products  provided under the Emergency Plan compares with the selection provided  under the initiatives of the World Bank, the United Nations Children\u2019s  Fund (UNICEF), and the Global Fund; (2) how the prices of the ARV  products provided under the Emergency Plan compare with the prices of  the ARV products provided under the other initiatives; and (3) what the  Coordinator\u2019s Office is doing to expand the selection of quality-assured  ARV products at the lowest possible price under the Emergency Plan.", "To compare the selection of ARV products provided under the Emergency  Plan to that provided under the other initiatives, we reviewed the  requirements that apply to the purchase of ARV products under the  Emergency Plan, as well as the requirements that apply to the purchase of  ARV products under the HIV/AIDS treatment initiatives funded by three  multinational organizations\u2014the World Bank, UNICEF, and the Global  Fund. We interviewed officials from the Coordinator\u2019s Office and the U.S.  agencies primarily responsible for implementing the Emergency Plan, such  as the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), regarding how  they oversee the purchase of ARV products consistent with applicable  requirements. We also interviewed officials from the multinational  organizations regarding their requirements and the ARV products they  provide through their initiatives. In addition, we reviewed documentation  from U.S. agencies, nongovernmental organizations (NGO) that are  participating in the Emergency Plan, and the multinational organizations  showing the ARV products that have been purchased under their  initiatives. We focused specifically on the ARVs that are recommended by  WHO for first-line treatment of HIV/AIDS in countries where health care  resources are limited. We identified the quality assurance process applied  to each product, but we did not evaluate the different quality assurance  processes or independently determine the comparative quality of the  products.", "To compare the prices of different ARV products provided under the  Emergency Plan and the other initiatives, we obtained price information  from selected manufacturers of ARV products that are generally available  to the focus countries. We report prices for the focus countries quoted to  us during June and July 2004 by 13 manufacturers. We asked ARV  manufacturers to quote prices according to a standard set of terms.  Because the price information we requested is proprietary to each  manufacturer, we could not directly assess the reliability of the price data  given to us. However, we checked the price data against several published  sources and determined that they are sufficiently reliable.", "To determine what the Coordinator\u2019s Office is doing to provide an  expanded selection of ARV products at the lowest prices possible, we  interviewed officials from the Coordinator\u2019s Office regarding their efforts  to address potential barriers to providing additional ARV products under  the Emergency Plan. Because the Coordinator\u2019s Office is working with the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) to support the ability of additional ARV  manufacturers to meet the Emergency Plan\u2019s quality assurance  requirement, we also interviewed officials from FDA regarding these  efforts. Aspects of implementing treatment programs other than  purchasing ARVs, such as human resources and supply chain  management, and treatments other than ARVs, such as medications to  treat opportunistic infections, are outside the scope of this report.

Twenty distinct ARV medications can be used  to treat people living with HIV/AIDS. The standard treatment is a regimen  that combines three or more ARVs. People receiving ARV treatment can  develop strains of HIV that are resistant to some or all of their ARVs, and  as a result their treatment regimens become ineffective and they must  switch to a different regimen.

Of the four first-line regimens,  WHO recommends d4T + 3TC + NVP as the first-choice regimen for rapid  implementation of large-scale treatment programs in resource-limited  settings because, for example, it is expected that most people will be able  to tolerate it without developing side effects that would require switching  to another regimen. Each of the focus countries highlighted in the  Emergency Plan has selected one or more of these first-line regimens for  its national treatment strategy, and most have selected d4T + 3TC + NVP  as their first-choice regimen.", "For people who have developed strains of HIV that are resistant to their  initial treatment regimen, WHO recommends one of four second-line  regimens. The second-line regimens use a different set of five ARVs.  Second-line regimens can have disadvantages, which may be magnified in  resource-limited settings. The disadvantages include the need to take more  pills, the potential for additional side effects, the need for refrigeration  during transportation and storage, and prices that are generally higher  than those for first-line regimens. WHO emphasizes that promoting better  adherence to a first-line regimen, thereby reducing the occurrence of  resistance and delaying the need to shift to a second-line regimen, is  particularly important in resource-limited settings because of these  disadvantages.", "The Coordinator\u2019s Office, FDA, and the Institute of Medicine, as well as  the Global Fund, the World Bank, UNAIDS, and WHO, have endorsed the  use of FDCs, which combine two or more ARVs into one pill, as an  important strategy to promote adherence to ARV regimens. These  organizations have determined that the benefits of FDCs include  promoting adherence, by reducing the number of pills a person has to take  at one time, reducing the time and costs associated with procurement and  distribution of ARVs, and simplifying the selection and prescribing of  ARVs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for HIV/AIDS Treatment in the Focus Countries", "paragraphs": ["Both national initiatives\u2014such as the Emergency Plan\u2014and multinational  initiatives provide funding for HIV/AIDS treatment in the focus countries.

To assure quality, USAID requires that ARV  products purchased under the plan have either FDA approval or the  approval of another acceptable regulatory authority.

We conducted our review from January 2004 through  January 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comparing Selection of ARV Products the Emergency Plan Provides to That Provided under Other Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["To compare the selection of ARV products provided under the Emergency  Plan to that provided under the other initiatives, we reviewed the  requirements that apply to the purchase of ARV products under the  Emergency Plan. Specifically, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and  guidance from which the plan\u2019s requirements arise. We also reviewed  documentation from the Coordinator\u2019s Office and the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) to determine which products had  been provided under the plan as of December 2004. In addition, we  interviewed officials from the Coordinator\u2019s Office, USAID, and the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office of Global Health  Affairs, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) about experience within federal programs  with purchasing ARVs for developing countries. Lastly, we interviewed  officials at the nongovernmental organizations (NGO) that have received  funding under the Emergency Plan to purchase ARVs in the focus  countries. These NGOs include Catholic Relief Services Consortium,  Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, Elizabeth Glaser  Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and Harvard University School of Public  Health.", "To determine the selection of ARV products provided under the other  initiatives, we reviewed the requirements that apply to the purchase of  ARV products under the HIV/AIDS treatment initiatives funded by the  World Bank, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), and the  Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund).  Specifically, we reviewed guidance documents from the Global Fund, the  World Bank, UNICEF, and WHO related to the purchase of ARVs under  these initiatives. We also interviewed officials from these organizations  regarding the requirements that apply to the provision of ARVs under their  treatment initiatives and to confirm the accuracy of information obtained  from their Web sites. In our comparison we determined the quality  assurance process applied to each product, but we did not evaluate the  different quality assurance processes required under the Emergency Plan  as compared with those required under the other initiatives or determine  the comparative quality of the products.", "Our review of the ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan and  the other initiatives focuses specifically on the ARVs that are  recommended by WHO for treatment of HIV/AIDS in countries with  limited health care resources. In order to determine the appropriate  treatment recommendations to focus on in this report, we reviewed  literature on the use of ARVs in general and in countries with limited  health care resources in particular. Our literature review included  searches of scientific publications using electronic databases, including  the National Library of Medicine\u2019s PubMed, as well as the Web sites of the  New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical  Association, and The Lancet. We reviewed literature on ARV treatment  available from the Coordinator\u2019s Office, USAID, HHS, FDA, CDC, the HHS  Office of the Inspector General, the Congressional Research Service, the  Congressional Budget Office, and the Institute of Medicine. We also  reviewed treatment guidelines and related documentation from WHO, the  Global Fund, the World Bank, the Joint United Nations Programme on  HIV/AIDS, UNICEF, and the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for  International Development. We also interviewed officials from several of  these organizations. To understand the issues involved in providing ARVs  in countries with limited health care resources, we interviewed officials  from several NGOs that are working in these settings\u2014including Doctors  Without Borders, the William Jefferson Clinton Foundation (Clinton  Foundation), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, John Snow  Incorporated (JSI), Family Health International (FHI), and Management  Sciences for Health (MSH). We also reviewed documentation on the focus  countries\u2019 national HIV/AIDS strategies and treatment guidelines, including  information that we obtained from the Coordinator\u2019s Office and NGOs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Determining Prices of ARVs for the Focus Countries", "paragraphs": ["The prices we report are prices that 13 selected manufacturers quoted to  us during June and July 2004 for the focus countries. We surveyed the  manufacturers from which the major organizations that support treatment  programs in the focus countries have considered purchasing their ARVs.  These organizations include JSI, FHI, MSH, the Clinton Foundation, the  Global Fund, the World Bank, WHO, UNICEF, Doctors Without Borders,  the International Dispensary Association, and MissionPharma. We selected  a manufacturer for inclusion in our report if it makes at least one of the  ARVs included in the WHO-recommended first-line regimens and was  selling or willing to sell its ARV product to at least one of the focus  countries. Thirteen of the 15 manufacturers that we considered met these  criteria and were willing to quote their prices for the first-line ARVs for the  focus countries. We did not select products based on registration with the  focus countries\u2019 national drug regulatory authorities because information  on country-level registration was incomplete or not available.", "Because some of the manufacturers we surveyed offer their products at  significantly lower prices to developing countries than to developed  countries, we requested price quotes specifically for the focus countries.  We did not attempt to determine the prices that specific purchasers are  paying for these products because at the time we conducted our analysis  there was limited experience in the focus countries with using the funding  sources discussed in this report for large-scale purchase of ARVs. Because  different manufacturers offer their reduced prices according to differing  criteria, in some cases the lowest price offers are not available to all of the  focus countries. Specifically, Guyana and Vietnam are not eligible to  purchase ARVs at some manufacturers\u2019 lowest price. In addition to these  two focus countries, other developing countries outside the scope of this  report may not be eligible for the prices we present.", "To help ensure that the manufacturers\u2019 prices we present are as  comparable as possible across different manufacturers of the same ARV,  we surveyed manufacturers using a standard set of questions. We  developed our questions on the basis of our literature review and  discussions with various officials from U.S. government agencies, officials  from other initiatives, representatives from NGOs, and representatives  from pharmaceutical manufacturers. These questions took into account  differences in purchasing agreements, including price negotiation based  on volume and length of contract, inclusion of shipping and insurance, and  financing guarantees. Some of the manufacturers we spoke with told us  that they offer prices that are negotiable depending on the volume of the  purchase, the length of the contract for purchase, and the degree to which  financing can be guaranteed. Therefore we requested prices based on the  following purchase scenarios, all of which assume financing has been  guaranteed: (1) purchase of enough medication to treat 500 patients for 1  year, (2) purchase of enough medication to treat 10,000 patients for 1 year,  and (3) purchase of enough medication to treat 10,000 patients for 3 years.  All manufacturers were given the opportunity to provide prices according  to these scenarios, although some told us that their prices were not  negotiable. We developed the scenarios based on estimates of the scale of  existing treatment programs in the focus countries, and the potential scale  of programs over the next 3 years. We verified, with officials from USAID  and other experts in ARV procurement, that these scenarios represented  plausible purchasing arrangements both now and over the next 3 years as  treatment programs expand in developing countries. Because the price  information we requested is considered proprietary by the manufacturer,  we could not directly assess the reliability of the price data given to us.  However, we checked the prices quoted to us against other published  sources from our literature search and manufacturers\u2019 Web sites and  determined they were reliable for our purposes.", "In some cases a manufacturer\u2019s prices include costs that other  manufacturers do not include\u2014such as shipping and insurance charges.  We note where these differences exist, and have determined that they do  not undermine the essential comparability of the prices presented in our  report. In making this determination, we first requested specific  information from each manufacturer about what is included in its price  and the terms of the purchase agreements it uses. The manufacturers we  surveyed for this report used one of six standard agreements to cover  shipping and insurance (see table 2). We also asked multiple purchasers  about the shipping and insurance costs they have incurred when  purchasing ARVs. While systematic evidence was not available, the  organizations we spoke with provided estimates ranging from 3 to 15  percent additional cost for shipping and insurance for large-scale ARV  purchases. One NGO that was purchasing ARVs under the Emergency Plan  told us that purchasing the same ARV product through two different  distribution channels\u2014one directly from the manufacturer with shipping  and insurance costs included in the price and one through a distributor  that added those costs to its price\u2014made no appreciable difference in the  final cost of the product. We also found, after reviewing responses to our  survey, that manufacturers of both original and generic products used a  range of purchase agreements, both more and less inclusive of shipping  and insurance costs. Other factors that may contribute to the total cost of  ARVs to a specific treatment program, such as taxes and distribution  surcharges, are beyond the scope of this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examining the Efforts of the Coordinator\u2019s Office to Expand the Selection of ARVs It Provides", "paragraphs": ["To examine the efforts of the Coordinator\u2019s Office to expand the selection  of quality-assured ARV products provided under the Emergency Plan to  the focus countries, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidance  from which the plan\u2019s quality assurance and patent requirements arise.
