If these efforts are not completed, IRS\u2019 tax processing and collection systems may fail to operate or may generate millions of erroneous tax notices, refunds, interest calculations, and account adjustments. IRS has less than 9 months to complete the work that it believes is necessary to reach its goal of having all of its systems Year 2000 compliant by January 31, 1999.

Thus far, IRS has made more progress in converting its applications than in converting its information systems infrastructure, such as hardware, systems software, and telecommunications, that support and affect IRS\u2019 mission-critical systems. As of March 31, 1998, IRS reported that it had converted the applications for 59 (46 percent) of the 127 systems it has identified as mission-critical. IRS officials said they are on schedule for converting the applications for the other 68 systems by January 31, 1999. IRS either is assessing or in the early stages of converting the hardware and systems software for two of its three computing levels. Of the infrastructure areas, telecommunications networks will likely present the most significant challenge and may be at the highest risk for not being completed by January 31, 1999.

These efforts are necessary because IRS\u2019 information systems, many of which are over 25 years old, were programmed to read two-digit date fields. Therefore, if unchanged, beginning January 1, 2000, these systems would interpret 2000 as 1900, and thus would seriously jeopardize critical tax processing and collection operations. According to IRS, the failure to change two-digit date fields before 2000 could result in generating millions of erroneous tax notices, refunds and bills. IRS has less than 9 months to complete the work that it believes is necessary to reach its goal of having all of its systems Year 2000 compliant by January 31, 1999.

In addition to converting systems, IRS is undertaking two major system replacement projects as part of its Year 2000 efforts. Both of these projects have encountered some schedule delays. In a briefing to this Subcommittee in January 1998, we identified two significant risk areas to IRS\u2019 Year 2000 efforts. The first was the lack of a master conversion and replacement schedule. The second was a limited approach to contingency planning. IRS is taking actions to address our concerns regarding the lack of a master conversion and replacement schedule.

The assessment guide states that the Year 2000 conversion efforts should be managed as a single, large information systems project. The assessment guide describes in detail the five phases of a Year 2000 conversion process (i.e., awareness, assessment, renovation, validation, and implementation). Each of these phases represents a major Year 2000 program activity or segment. To successfully address the Year 2000 problem, effective program and project management is required for all five phases.", "IRS\u2019 Chief Information Officer (CIO) established several parallel efforts to help ensure that IRS achieves Year 2000 compliance by January 31, 1999. These efforts include creating the Century Date Change Project Office, which is responsible for coordinating the conversion of most existing information systems that can be made Year 2000 compliant as well as ensuring that all systems are converted in accordance with a 14-step conversion process. That process incorporates the five phases included in our assessment guide. Some of the steps involved in converting existing systems include (1) correcting millions of lines of application code; (2) upgrading thousands of hardware and systems software products for IRS\u2019 three levels of computing operations\u2014mainframes, minicomputers/file servers, and personal computers, (3) upgrading telecommunications networks; and (4) ensuring that external data exchanges are Year 2000 compliant.", "The other parallel Year 2000 efforts are two major system replacement projects\u2014the replacement of the Distributed Input System (DIS) and the Remittance Processing System (RPS) with the Integrated Submission and Remittance Processing (ISRP) system and the consolidation of the mainframe computer processing operations at 10 service centers to 2 computing centers. IRS personnel use DIS to input taxpayer data and RPS to input remittance data. According to IRS, these two systems are old, and it is not cost-beneficial to make them Year 2000 compliant. Therefore, IRS decided to replace DIS and RPS with ISRP. ISRP will be piloted in two phases at the Austin Service Center. The first phase is underway and the second phase is scheduled to begin July 31, 1998. Nationwide implementation is scheduled for January 1999.", "As a part of its mainframe consolidation effort, IRS is to (1) replace and/or upgrade service center mainframe hardware, systems software, and the associated telecommunications infrastructure; (2) replace about 16,000 terminals that support frontline customer service and compliance operations; and (3) replace the Communication Replacement System (CRS) that provides security functions for on-line taxpayer account databases.

A master conversion and replacement schedule, according to our Year 2000 assessment guide, should be a part of an agency\u2019s Year 2000 Program Plan. This schedule could be used to track the progress of concurrent and interdependent projects that must be ready for integrated systems testing at the end of January 1999. This year, IRS has a host of activities that it must complete concurrently so that its systems will be able to function correctly in 2000.

Until these actions are complete, IRS cannot project whether resources will be available when needed for concurrent tasks. Thus, IRS faces the risk that resources may not be available when needed.", "IRS currently has a contractor working on the development of an integrated schedule of its Year 2000-related efforts, including making all of the necessary tax law changes for 1999.

In part, due to concerns that the same resources that are doing Year 2000 conversion work would be needed to do contingency planning, IRS officials decided to develop a contingency planning process that would minimize the number of contingency plans that would have to be developed.

For these projects, IRS is to initiate a business function impact analysis. Once that analysis is complete, technical and business owners evaluate available alternatives, including using any existing contingency procedures, such as manual procedures, or using an alternative technological solution, such as commercial off-the-shelf software.

For example, the ISRP project office has developed a contingency plan that identifies (1) various risks to the ISRP pilot and nationwide implementation, (2) the probability of those risks, and (3) contingency options for addressing those risks. Also, as part of a larger effort to enhance IRS\u2019 disaster recovery capabilities, IRS officials said they hope to finalize expanded disaster recovery requirements for service center data processing in May 1998 so that those requirements can be included in the mainframe consolidation project.", "Our exposure draft on business continuity and contingency planning states that agencies must start business continuity and contingency planning now to reduce the risk of Year 2000 business failures. Among other things, the exposure draft states that agencies need to do a business impact analysis to determine the effect of mission-critical system failures on the viability of agency operations. This analysis is to include examining business priorities; dependencies; service levels; and, most importantly, the business process dependency on mission-critical information systems. According to our exposure draft, the business impact analysis triggers the development of contingency plans for each core business process, including any information system components that support that process.

However, given the conversion status of some of its infrastructure areas, IRS runs the risk of not completing all of its work by the January 31, 1999, milestone. Moreover, even if all of IRS\u2019 work is completed according to schedule, the potential exists for failures in systems that were fully assessed, converted, tested and implemented according to schedule. We remain concerned about IRS\u2019 narrow approach to contingency planning which focuses on developing contingency plans only for business functions that are supported by information systems projects that have a known risk of not being completed according to schedule. Under this approach, IRS has no assurance that its core business processes will be able to continue to function, albeit, possibly at some reduced level of service, in the event that Year 2000-induced system failures occur in systems that were converted according to schedule.", "That concludes my prepared statement.
