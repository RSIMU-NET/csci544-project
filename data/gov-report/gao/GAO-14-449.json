First, NNSA does not track the actual date that dismantled weapons were retired and may be counting some dismantled weapons retired after fiscal year 2009 as equivalent to weapons retired prior to fiscal year 2009. Second, NNSA will not dismantle some weapons retired prior to fiscal year 2009 but will reinstate them to the stockpile to save on rebuilding other weapons and count the reinstated weapons as equivalent dismantlements. Having clear goals and measures is a key element of program management. Because the dismantlement performance goal does not make these practices clear, NNSA risks providing misleading information about progress related to its goal.", "NNSA has a schedule for future weapon dismantlements but has not scheduled for dismantlement any weapons to be removed from the stockpile resulting from implementation of the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). These weapons are not expected to be retired until the late 2020s or early 2030s. The deferred retirement of these weapons could result in a significant dismantlement workload gap during the mid-2020s. Such a gap could result in the loss of certified dismantlement personnel because dismantlement technicians at Pantex lose their certifications if they have not worked on a weapon type in the past year. By extending the fiscal year 2022 dismantlement performance goal, NNSA could allow the current dismantlement workload to be leveled and extended through the mid-2020s to sustain its dismantlement workforce.", "The physical capacity at the Pantex Plant in Texas should be sufficient to meet NNSA's planned dismantlement workload and other stockpile commitments through fiscal year 2022.

For instance, the Y-12 National Security Complex in Tennessee disassembles canned subassemblies (CSA)\u2014a major nuclear component that can contain highly enriched uranium (HEU), which is uranium enriched in the isotope uranium-235 to 20 percent or greater. NNSA is retaining many CSAs, leaving far fewer of them for disassembly, and creating challenges for Y-12's ability to plan its disassembly workload. However, NNSA bases its retention decisions on national security considerations and not Y-12 workload. Moreover, NNSA's ability to effectively manage a contingency inventory of millions of nonnuclear components at Pantex is complicated by decisions to retain many components for potential reuse in weapons, including old parts for weapons no longer in the stockpile, and by limitations in Pantex's previous component inventory management system. GAO is not making a recommendation on these matters because of efforts already under way at Pantex to address the need to retain older parts and to upgrade its component inventory management system."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NNSA (1) clarify the dismantlement performance goal and (2) consider extending the goal to avoid a dismantlement workload gap.

Instead, whenever Pantex  dismantles an individual retired weapon of a system type represented in  the pre-fiscal year 2009 inventory\u2014regardless of that weapon\u2019s actual  date of retirement\u2014NNSA counts that dismantlement as being equivalent  to a weapon retired prior to fiscal year 2009 and counts it toward the fiscal  year 2022 goal. Because of this approach, it is possible, according to an  NNSA official, that NNSA is counting weapons toward the achievement of  its performance goal that were retired after fiscal year 2009. This official  told us that while individual retired weapons in storage at military facilities  can be tracked by retirement date, weapons retired prior to fiscal year  2009 are not marked or designated for priority dismantlement. However,  this official stated that, in general, it is unlikely that a more recently retired  weapon would be selected for dismantlement if older retired weapons of  the same type are available.", "An NNSA official also commented that there may be technical reasons  why an individual weapon retired after fiscal year 2009 may be  transferred to NNSA for dismantlement before a weapon retired prior to  fiscal year 2009. For instance, an NNSA official told us that NNSA\u2019s  stockpile surveillance program might identify potential problems with a  specific component, such as a capacitor, that might apply only to  individual weapons retired after fiscal year 2009 and not to those retired  before, making dismantlement of the weapons retired after fiscal year  2009 a higher priority.", "Second, how NNSA measures progress toward its dismantlement  performance goal is also unclear and may be misleading because some  weapons retired prior to fiscal year 2009 are reinstated to the stockpile  rather than dismantled. Specifically, in our analysis of NNSA\u2019s  dismantlement schedule as of March 2013 for weapons retired prior to  fiscal year 2009, we found that approximately 9 percent of the weapons  retired prior to fiscal year 2009 are scheduled to be reinstated during  fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2022 or later.", "According to NNSA officials, NNSA plans to reinstate these weapons, in  part, to offset the costs of rebuilding weapons disassembled under the  stockpile surveillance program. Through this program, in a given year, a  random sample of weapons from each weapon system is selected and  withdrawn from the stockpile, disassembled, and inspected, and usually  one weapon in each weapon system sample is subjected to nonnuclear,  destructive testing of its nuclear components and cannot be rebuilt. The  destructively tested units are replaced by weapons kept in readiness  states in the inactive category of the stockpile, known as quality  assurance and reliability testing replacement weapons. The remaining  weapons from the sample set could be rebuilt following inspection and  returned to the stockpile. However, in lieu of rebuilding all of the  disassembled weapons, NNSA replaces some of them by reinstating  retired war reserve weapons to the stockpile. According to NNSA officials,  this is a cost-effective practice that avoids the costly rebuilding of  weapons evaluated under the surveillance program and also reduces the  number of weapons in the dismantlement queue.", "An NNSA official told us that it is technically correct that under this  practice some weapons retired prior to fiscal year 2009 are not expected  to be dismantled but reinstated to the stockpile instead. However, this  official noted that, under the reinstatement practice, NNSA is still  dismantling a weapon for each weapon that is reinstated to the  stockpile\u2014that is, the weapon in the stockpile that is disassembled and  inspected under the surveillance program. Thus, the reinstatement  practice represents an equivalent dismantlement that has a neutral  impact on the size of the stockpile.", "We have found in our prior work that having clear performance goals and  measures is a key element of effective program management.Performance goals or measures that are not clearly stated may be  confusing or misleading. Neither NNSA\u2019s dismantlement performance  goal as currently written, nor the way that progress toward the goal is  measured, makes it clear that NNSA is counting equivalent numbers of  weapons dismantled. Without such clarity, Congress and other users of  this performance information may not understand the age or types of  weapons that NNSA is counting toward achievement of the performance  goal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainties Related to Weapons in Managed Retirement Make It Unlikely That NNSA Will Achieve Its Dismantlement Goal", "paragraphs": ["The uncertainties surrounding when weapons in managed retirement\u2014 retired weapons that have not been approved by the Nuclear Weapons  Council for dismantlement\u2014may be released for dismantlement present  challenges for NNSA in scheduling future dismantlement workload and  make it unlikely that NNSA will achieve its goal of dismantling all weapons  retired prior to fiscal year 2009 by the end of fiscal year 2022.

However, the timing of the future Nuclear Weapons Council\u2019s decision,  whether it will select the W84-0 or W80-1 for the long-range standoff  missile, and when weapons will be released for dismantlement remains  uncertain, according to NNSA and DOD officials.", "According to an NNSA official, if the W80-1 is selected for reuse on the  future missile, NNSA could move the W84-0s back into its dismantlement  schedule in the future. Depending on the timing, such a decision could  present challenges to NNSA and Pantex in meeting the fiscal year 2022  dismantlement goal, as the W84-0 is considered a relatively difficult, or  time-consuming, weapon to dismantle based on our review of DQ and  DEQ data. However, this official told us that the W84-0 has many modern  features. For this reason, there is a possibility that, even if this weapon  system is not selected for reuse as the long-range standoff missile  warhead, NNSA and the national labs may seek to retain the W84-0s  indefinitely for other potential future warhead reuse options. Because of  these uncertainties, NNSA had not scheduled dismantlement of any W84- 0s\u2014including those in managed retirement\u2014in the dismantlement  schedule we reviewed, as of March 2013, and NNSA officials told us that  these weapons will be addressed in one way or another after fiscal year  2022. Given this time frame, and since all W84-0s in managed retirement  were retired in fiscal year 2006, NNSA is unlikely to achieve its goal of  dismantling all weapons retired prior to fiscal year 2009 by the end of  fiscal year 2022 unless these weapons are released from managed  retirement, and a decision is made to dismantle them.", "Alternatively, if the W84-0 is selected for reuse on the future missile, the  time frame for dismantlement of the W80-1s in managed retirement  remains uncertain. NNSA has tentatively scheduled the W80-1s for  dismantlement before fiscal year 2020. However, DOD officials told us  that, given the need to sustain the ALCM through the mid-2020s, it is  unlikely that the W80-1s in managed retirement would be released for  dismantlement before the first warhead is produced for the new missile  and before the missile achieves initial operating capability, projected for  later in the 2020s.", "Uncertainties also surround the W76-0s in managed retirement and when  they might be released for dismantlement, which could pose challenges  for NNSA in meeting its dismantlement performance goal. NNSA is  currently conducting a W76 life extension program under which W76-0  warheads in the stockpile are replaced with refurbished W76-1 warheads.  NNSA expects to complete this life extension program by fiscal year  2019. As a hedge against technical problems in the life extension  program process and in the refurbished warheads, however, the W76-0s  are to remain in managed retirement and be unavailable for  dismantlement until the life extension program processes and W76-1 unit  reliability are \u201csatisfactorily established,\u201d according to the fiscal year 2011  nuclear weapons Requirements and Planning Document. However, the  criteria for \u201csatisfactory establishment\u201d of the W76 life extension program  process and W76-1 unit reliability are unclear, creating uncertainty as to  whether the W76-0s in managed retirement will be released to NNSA in  time for dismantlement by the end of fiscal year 2022.", "This uncertainty is driven by concerns about the life extension program  that have been raised by DOE and DOD officials. For instance, in 2006  and 2012, the DOE Inspector General reported on delays in the W76-1  life extension program that put program startup and production goals at  risk. In March 2013, DOD officials expressed concerns to us about the  W76-1 life extension program, including that NNSA has been unable to  produce consistent quantities of W76-1 warheads, and they told us that  there are no formal criteria for the Nuclear Weapons Council\u2019s decision to  release the W76-0s in managed retirement. These officials stated that it  would be difficult to predict the completion of the W76-1 life extension  program given inconsistent production, and that it was impossible to say  whether the W76-0s in managed retirement could be released for  dismantlement prior to fiscal year 2019 without additional confidence in  NNSA\u2019s production capability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Deferred Retirement of Weapons under New START Will Pose Challenges to NNSA\u2019s Management of Future Dismantlement Workload and Workforce", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD officials we interviewed, the 2010 New START treaty  may eventually result in the retirement of additional weapons from the  U.S. stockpile.

This gap could affect NNSA\u2019s  ability to manage the dismantlement workforce, posing challenges for  NNSA in dismantling weapons retired as a result of the treaty. In  particular, an NNSA official expressed concern that this gap in  dismantlement workload in the mid-2020s could result in the loss of  certified dismantlement personnel because dismantlement technicians at  Pantex lose their certifications if they have not worked on a weapon type  within the past year.

However, NNSA\u2019s ability to effectively manage and evaluate the  retention of some parts in this inventory is complicated by decisions to  retain many components for potential reuse in weapons, including old  parts from weapons no longer in the stockpile, and by limitations in  Pantex\u2019s previous component inventory management system.", "The inventory of nonnuclear components at Pantex includes several  categories of components that are managed in different ways.  Nonnuclear components from weapons still active in the stockpile are  categorized within Pantex\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d component inventory, and nonnuclear  components from weapons no longer in the stockpile are considered  \u201clegacy\u201d components. \u201cMark quality\u201d components are those that have  been retained for reuse\u2014Pantex retains those in the active category but  is authorized to dispose of those in the legacy category.

Table 3 illustrates Pantex\u2019s  nonnuclear component inventory as of May 2013.", "In arranging for the disposition of nonnuclear components from  dismantled weapons, Pantex\u2019s first priority is disposing of components  from ongoing weapon dismantlement to avoid adding unnecessarily to  Pantex\u2019s preexisting inventory. However, because remanufacturing  certain nonnuclear components and parts could be time-consuming and  expensive\u2014or, in some cases, is impossible\u2014NNSA officials and the  national laboratories ask Pantex to store components for potential reuse  in current weapons, future modernized weapons, or for other weapons- related contingencies. These component retention instructions are  outlined in a weapon type\u2019s Program Control Document, which targets the  numbers of components to retain, and detailed in each weapon type\u2019s  Retirement Disposition Instruction, developed by the national laboratories  and weapon program managers, which specifies the method of  disposition for each component\u2014saved for reuse, disposed of, or sent to  KCP or NNSS. According to a 2011 Pantex chart, Pantex will add an  estimated 53,000 components to the mark quality inventory per year from  fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2015.

As of May 2013, Pantex was storing 3  million mark quality nonnuclear components as a contingency inventory  for potential reuse in maintaining active stockpile or refurbished weapons.  In January 2013, Pantex site contractors estimated that 1.4 million of  these components were commercially available hardware, such as  screws, nuts, and bolts. According to Pantex documentation, \u201ca large  number\u201d of the components retained in the mark quality inventory are  believed to be excess based on the current stockpile. Pantex site  contractors also told us that some retention requests from the laboratories  for nonnuclear components may be overly conservative. For instance,  Pantex site contractors told us that, in 2012, NNSA\u2014at the request of the  national laboratories\u2014directed Pantex to retain approximately 650 spin  rocket motors, but that after questioning from Pantex, they revised the  request to 50 motors. In addition, some mark quality components in  storage are very old. For example, our review found that 1.7 million  components\u2014or more than half of the mark quality inventory at Pantex,  as of August 2012\u2014were placed in storage in 1989 or before.our site visit to Pantex, we observed several components covered in dust   During  that appeared not to have been touched or moved in years, if not  decades.", "NNSA officials and Pantex site contractors, however, told us that they  believed that it made sense to retain more components in mark quality  inventory than may be necessary because of uncertain future stockpile  maintenance, repair, or refurbishment needs, and because it could be  costly to remanufacture or replace components that had been disposed  of. An NNSA official told us that, in the past, NNSA had disposed of  components that the agency later needed. For instance, an NNSA official  told us that NNSA had disposed of the center cases\u2014a section of the  case that contains the CSA\u2014from dismantled B61 bombs through burial  at NNSS but later found the agency would need them for the B61 life  extension program. NNSA officials told us that the components\u2019  importance was such that NNSA had decided to dig up the cases  because doing so cost less than remanufacturing them. In addition,  NNSA officials and Pantex site contractors told us that, since some parts  will always need to be retained to sustain the current stockpile, and since  the cost to sustain the warehouses varies little by the number of parts  stored, they believed that any marginal costs associated with storing  excess components were justified by the potential cost of any future  scenario requiring their remanufacture or reacquisition.", "However, we found that some active mark quality nonnuclear  components in the Pantex inventory are associated with weapon systems  no longer in the stockpile, raising questions about whether these  components will ever be reused. For example, as of August 2012, we  found that Pantex was storing in its mark quality inventory for reuse  493,305 components from weapons that were no longer in the active  stockpile, including approximately 6,135 components from the B43\u2014a  weapon produced in the early 1960s and retired from the stockpile in  1991\u2014and 5,092 components from the Mk-11\u2014a weapon produced in  the 1950s and retired in 1960. Both of these weapons were dismantled  before 1992, but some of their components remain in Pantex\u2019s  contingency inventory. In addition, Pantex continues to store 58,854  components from dismantled B57s, a weapon that was last dismantled in  1995. Pantex site contractors told us that NNSA retains some  components from weapons no longer in the stockpile because they can  be reused in active stockpile weapons, but Pantex site contractors said it  was unlikely that many of the components from some of these very old  weapons would be reused. An NNSA official told us that NNSA is working  with the national laboratories to reassess the need to retain these  components, but that efforts were hampered under current funding levels.", "In recognition of these inventory issues, in September 2012, NNSA  created a capability to track \u201cslow moving\u201d inventory and reevaluate the  continuing need to retain it. However, in January 2013, NNSA officials  told us that the capability was too new to judge its usefulness to weapons  program managers and the national laboratories. NNSA officials told us  that they would use this capability to evaluate the ongoing necessity to  retain some of these slow moving components during their next annual  review of retained weapons components to be held in the fall of 2013.", "Management of the large nonnuclear component inventory at Pantex has  been further complicated by limitations in the site\u2019s previous inventory  management system. For example, the inventory system, which dated to  1989, did not have the fields to collect financial and other information to  establish storage component costs, the value of the components in  storage, or forecast future storage capacity needs. In January 2013, we  requested data on the cost of storage for nonnuclear components at  Pantex. NNSA officials and Pantex site contractors said they did not have  an estimate of those costs. NNSA officials also did not have an estimate  of the value of the components in storage that could enable NNSA to  make economic decisions about retaining or disposing of certain  components, particularly those weapons no longer in the stockpile.", "In addition, according to an NNSA official and Pantex site contractors, the  system could not be used to forecast future component inflows or  outflows based on anticipated capacity and workload at Pantex. Pantex  site contractors estimated that Pantex\u2019s inventory was at 86 percent of  the site\u2019s storage capacity, which was a decrease from the 1990s, when  inventory was at nearly 95 percent capacity. In January 2013, the DOE  Inspector General found that the warehouses that Pantex uses to store  weapons components are nearing capacity levels. Pantex site  contractors were able to show us pictures demonstrating reductions in  stored components that had freed up space, but the inventory system  could not project if current storage capacity will be sufficient to contain the  estimated 53,000 components that will be added to the mark quality  inventory on average through fiscal year 2015. Pantex site contractors  told us that, if they ran out of storage space, they could store components  in special containers outside in Zone 12, or create additional storage by  opening up an unused warehouse on-site, but that doing so may add to  operating costs. Furthermore, when we requested basic information such  as how long components had been in storage and their associated  weapon system, Pantex site contractors told us they would have to write  special queries to extract this information from the system.", "In May 2013, Pantex site contractors informed us that they would be  addressing some of these limitations through a $38 million upgrade to the  site\u2019s computer systems in July 2013 that would include improvements to  the component inventory management system. However, this system was  still being implemented in August 2013, and we were not able to assess  the extent to which the upgrades may address the issues we identified.  According to NNSA officials and Pantex site contractors, the upgraded  system will include fields to collect cost information and the physical size  of a component.

However, 1,300 of these legacy  components had not been fully characterized, as of April 2013, and could  not be disposed of. Pantex site contractors told us that they could  characterize 730 of these components on-site but that information on the  remaining 570 had been sent to SNL for additional research.

NNSA  also stated that it is fully committed to dismantling all weapons retired  prior to fiscal year 2009 by fiscal year 2022.  NNSA\u2019s proposed action to  develop a long-term dismantlement strategy to balance workload is  responsive to our recommendation and our concerns about the impacts of  a potential gap in dismantlement workload from fiscal year 2022 to the  late 2020s or early 2030s.  However, as discussed in this report, NNSA is  likely to face challenges in achieving its goal of dismantling all weapons  retired prior to fiscal year 2009 by fiscal year 2022 due to the  uncertainties surrounding when weapons in managed retirement\u2014 including some weapons retired before fiscal year 2009\u2014may be  released for dismantlement.", "Regarding the second recommendation, in its written comments, NNSA  responded that the dismantlement performance goal of dismantling by  fiscal year 2022 all weapons retired before fiscal year 2009 should focus  on the equivalent numbers of weapons that are being dismantled.

These documents include Nuclear Weapons Stockpile  Plans, the nuclear weapons stockpile Requirements and Planning  Documents, and NNSA\u2019s Nuclear Weapons Production and Planning  Directives. We interviewed NNSA officials responsible for overseeing the  Weapons Dismantlement and Disposition (WDD) program and obtained  technical information and data from them on the stockpile, past and future  dismantlement workload, component management, and on other issues  pertaining to the program. To understand stockpile planning, weapons  retirement, and how the Department of Defense (DOD) and the military  services interact with NNSA on dismantlement issues, we obtained  information and interviewed officials from the Office of the Deputy  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters, U.S. Air Force, U.S.  Navy, and U.S. Strategic Command. We also visited the Pantex and Y-12  sites where we observed weapon dismantlement and canned  subassembly (CSA) disassembly operations for several weapon systems,  viewed component storage facilities, and interviewed representatives of  the site operating contractors at each location on issues relating to  dismantlement operations and component management processes. We  identified a nonprobability sample of seven weapons systems\u2014B53, B61,  W62, W70, W71, W76, and B83\u2014based on several factors, including the  branch of the military associated with the weapons, the weapon delivery  platform (i.e. bomber or missile), and whether the weapon is strategic or  nonstrategic. We used a list of standardized questions to conduct  interviews with nuclear weapon engineers at Pantex on the time,  requirements, challenges, and other issues associated with the  dismantlement of those systems. We also received presentations from  Y-12 weapon engineers on issues related to the disassembly of the CSAs  of these seven weapon systems.", "To assess the extent to which and the reasons why the annual  inventories of weapons awaiting dismantlement and NNSA\u2019s annual  dismantlement rates have changed over time, we obtained and analyzed  data from NNSA\u2019s Weapons Information System on the annual  inventories of retired weapons awaiting dismantlement and on annual  numbers of weapons dismantled for fiscal years 1992 through 2012. We  selected this time frame for several reasons, including that it allowed us to  assess weapon retirements and dismantlements since the dissolution of  the Soviet Union in December 1991 and resulting from stockpile  reductions through strategic arms control treaties and presidential  initiatives. The Weapons Information System does not include a specific  field or category of nuclear weapons that are awaiting dismantlement.  According to NNSA officials, the annual inventory of retired nuclear  weapons\u2014which is tracked\u2014approximates, but is not a precise figure for,  the number of weapons awaiting dismantlement. According to NNSA  officials, during the time frame of our review, each year some number of  retired weapons were reinstated, or held for future reinstatement, to the  stockpile and were not available for dismantlement.retired weapons were not immediately available for dismantlement  because they were in managed retirement status and had not been  released by the Nuclear Weapons Council. Because NNSA officials told   In addition, some  us that it would be difficult and time-consuming to locate older stockpile  records and reconcile the data to develop accurate figures on the actual  inventory of weapons that were awaiting dismantlement by year over the  past 20 years, we agreed with NNSA officials to use the annual retired  inventory of weapons as an approximate measure of the number of  weapons awaiting dismantlement from year to year, for fiscal year 1992  through fiscal year 2012. We also interviewed NNSA and DOD officials on  reasons why the inventories of retired weapons have changed over time,  and interviewed NNSA officials and Pantex site contractors on issues that  have affected dismantlement processes and rates. We obtained and  analyzed data that Pantex has developed to measure the difficulty, or  time requirements, in dismantling different weapon types, referred to as  dismantlement \u201cdifficulty quotients\u201d (DQ). NNSA has used the DQ data to  establish \u201cdismantlement equivalent units\u201d (DEQ) for each weapon type to  measure the relative dismantlement time requirements of different  weapon types. Pantex had DQ data available only for weapons  dismantled since fiscal year 1998. As a result, we were unable to analyze  dismantlement DQ and DEQ data for all weapon types dismantled since  fiscal year 1992 and determine whether weapon systems have become  more time-consuming to dismantle over the past 20 years based on this  data. However, we did interview weapon engineers at Pantex regarding  the challenges in dismantling weapons, including two recently dismantled  weapon systems that both had relatively large DEQs.", "To assess how NNSA measures progress toward achieving its  performance goal of dismantling all weapons retired prior to fiscal year  2009 by the end of fiscal year 2022, and any challenges it might face in  meeting the goal, we obtained and analyzed NNSA data on the inventory  of retired weapons potentially available for dismantlement over fiscal year  2013 through fiscal year 2022. Specifically, we analyzed a March 2013  draft schedule for the dismantlement or other disposition of all retired  weapons over this time, which included the schedule for dismantling the  subset of remaining weapons retired prior to fiscal year 2009. We  interviewed NNSA and DOD officials on issues related to or that could  affect the dismantlement schedule, including reinstatement of retired  weapons and release of retired weapons in managed retirement status for  dismantlement.", "To assess NNSA\u2019s schedule and the challenges, if any, in the  dismantlement of weapons to be retired as a result of the New START  treaty, we interviewed NNSA officials to determine whether those  weapons had been scheduled for dismantlement. We interviewed DOD  officials to understand how many and when those weapons are expected  to be retired and other conditions affecting the timing and release of those  weapons to NNSA for dismantlement. We interviewed NNSA officials and  Pantex site contractors on issues related to how this additional future  dismantlement workload will be managed.", "To assess the physical capacity available at Pantex to meet NNSA\u2019s  dismantlement goal and to potentially accelerate achievement of this  goal, we obtained and analyzed data from Pantex\u2019s Long Range  Production Planning Model and interviewed Pantex site contractors on  the physical capacity at Pantex available to meet the future  dismantlement schedule and all other future stockpile production  commitments such as weapon life extension and surveillance efforts. We  also analyzed data and interviewed NNSA officials and Pantex site  contractors on Pantex\u2019s ability to accelerate dismantlement work,  including data on the extent to which Pantex has exceeded annual  dismantlement goals in response to contract performance incentives and  information from NNSA on previously developed scenarios for  accelerating dismantlement workload to meet the fiscal year 2022  dismantlement goal by fiscal year 2018 or fiscal year 2020.", "To assess the challenges affecting disassembly and disposition of  components from dismantled weapons, we reviewed NNSA program and  planning documents and interviewed NNSA officials and Pantex and Y-12  site contractors on the full scope of the weapons dismantlement and  disposition process. We reviewed NNSA data and interviewed NNSA  officials and Pantex site contractors on the number and location of pits  from dismantled weapons and future plans for reuse or disposition, as  well as effects of storage on Pantex operations. We reviewed NNSA  documents, analyzed data, and interviewed NNSA officials and Y-12 site  contractors on current and future CSA inventories, draft CSA disassembly  schedules, and related policy issues affecting CSA management to  assess the effects of CSA disassembly and retention on Y-12\u2019s workload  and ability to supply highly enriched uranium to the U.S. Naval Reactors  Program and other programs. We reviewed data from Pantex\u2019s  nonnuclear weapons component inventory management system and  interviewed NNSA officials and Pantex site contractors on the size of the  overall inventory, age and weapon system associated with these  components, impact of requests from the national labs to retain some  components, and limitations of the inventory management system.", "We conducted reliability assessments of the data on: (1) the inventories  of retired weapons available for dismantlement and on annual numbers of  weapons dismantled for fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2012  (NNSA\u2019s Weapons Information System); (2) future capacity requirements  at Pantex (Pantex\u2019s Long Range Production Planning Model); and (3)  nonnuclear component inventories (Pantex\u2019s nonnuclear weapons  component inventory management system). We analyzed the data from  each system for accuracy by, among other things, manually testing the  data for errors and missing data, and interviewed knowledgeable officials  on the reliability of the data. We found discrepancies in the data provided  to us on the retired and dismantled weapon inventories and on the Pantex  capacity projections, but we were able to correct or reconcile the  differences through interviews with NNSA officials and Pantex site  contractors. We did not identify any material weaknesses in the three  data sources that would significantly alter our findings. We determined  that, overall, the data provided to us were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this review.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2012 to April 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the National Nuclear Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jonathan Gill (Assistant Director),  Julia Coulter, and William Hoehn made key contributions to this report.
