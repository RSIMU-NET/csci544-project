Since 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have taken actions such as establishing industry standards and federal guidelines, and completing EMP-related research reports. GAO found that their actions aligned with some of the EMP Commission recommendations related to the electric grid. For example, DHS developed EMP protection guidelines to help federal agencies and industry identify options for safeguarding critical communication equipment and control systems from an EMP attack. Further, agency actions and EMP Commission recommendations generally align with DHS and DOE critical infrastructure responsibilities, such as assessing risks and identifying key assets.", "Additional opportunities exist to enhance federal efforts to address electromagnetic risks to the electric grid. Specifically, DHS has not identified internal roles and responsibilities for addressing electromagnetic risks, which has led to limited awareness of related activities within the department and reduced opportunity for coordination with external partners. Doing so could provide additional awareness of related activities and help ensure more effective collaboration with other federal agencies and industry stakeholders. Moreover, although DHS components have independently conducted some efforts to assess electromagnetic risks, DHS has not fully leveraged opportunities to collect key risk inputs\u2014namely threat, vulnerability, and consequence information\u2014to inform comprehensive risk assessments of electromagnetic events. Within DHS, there is recognition that space weather and power grid failure are significant risk events, which DHS officials have determined pose great risk to the security of the nation. Better collection of risk inputs, including additional leveraging of information available from stakeholders, could help to further inform DHS assessment of these risks. DHS and DOE also did not report taking any actions to identify critical electrical infrastructure assets, as called for in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. Although FERC conducted a related effort in 2013, DHS and DOE were not involved and have unique knowledge and expertise that could be utilized to better ensure that key assets are adequately identified and all applicable elements of criticality are considered. Finally, DHS and DOE, in conjunction with industry, have not established a coordinated approach to identifying and implementing key risk management activities to address EMP risks. Such activities include identifying and prioritizing key research and development efforts, and evaluating potential mitigation options, including the cost-effectiveness of specific protective equipment. Enhanced coordination to determine key research priorities could help address some identified research gaps and may help alleviate concerns voiced by industry regarding the costs and potential adverse consequences on grid reliability that may be caused by implementation of such equipment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS identify internal roles to address electromagnetic risks, and collect additional risk inputs to further inform assessment efforts; that DHS and DOE collaborate to ensure critical electrical infrastructure assets are identified; and engage with industry stakeholders to identify and prioritize risk-management activities, such as research and development efforts, to address EMP risks to the grid.

EMP and solar weather events could potentially  lead to power outages over broad geographic areas, some of which could  last for an extended duration. Experts have also reported that long-term  power outages could result in significant economic disruption and adverse  impacts to public health and safety. Addressing these events necessitates  effective collaboration among multiple government agencies and industry  partners, and no single federal program or entity has sole responsibility  for addressing electromagnetic threats. However, the National  Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) outlines the roles and  responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and  applicable sector-specific agencies for each of the 16 critical  infrastructure sectors. DHS has the lead role in coordinating the overall  federal effort to promote the security and resilience of the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure, and the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014as the sector- specific agency for the energy sector, which includes critical electrical  infrastructure\u2014shares responsibility with DHS.", "In April 2008, the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States  from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack (EMP Commission) issued a report  that included over 90 recommendations addressing the preparation for,  and protection and recovery from, a possible EMP attack against U.S.  critical infrastructure. The majority of these recommendations were made  to DHS and to DOE. According to the 2008 EMP Commission report, the  nine commission members, nominated by the Secretary of Defense and  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator,  provided a wide range of experience\u2014including senior management  experience in both civilian and military agencies, National Laboratories,  and in the corporate sector. Their expertise included management and  operation of national infrastructures as well as technical expertise in the  design of nuclear weapons, among other areas.", "In July 2015, we testified before the Senate Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs Committee and reported preliminary findings  regarding DHS\u2019s efforts to address electromagnetic threats to the grid.  As 7 years have passed since the issuance of the 2008 commission  report, you asked us to review actions taken by key federal agencies,  such as DHS and DOE, to address electromagnetic risks. Our objectives  were to determine (1) the extent to which key federal agencies have  taken actions to address electromagnetic risks to the electric grid,  including how these actions align with selected recommendations from  the 2008 EMP Commission report and (2) the extent to which additional  opportunities, if any, exist to enhance federal efforts in addressing those  risks to the electric grid.", "To address our first objective, we reviewed DHS, DOE, and Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) program documents, research  reports, applicable risk assessments, and other supporting documentation  such as program briefings, strategy planning efforts, and after action  reports to identify actions these entities have taken to address  electromagnetic risks to the grid since the EMP Commission issued its  report in 2008. We also interviewed knowledgeable federal agency  officials to confirm our understanding of how their related actions address  electromagnetic risks to the electric grid. We focused our efforts on the  electric grid because of its foundational significance in providing electric  power to other key critical infrastructures, such as communications,  transportation, banking, and finance and its recognized vulnerability to  electromagnetic risks. To determine how DHS and DOE actions align with  the 2008 EMP Commission report recommendations, we reviewed EMP  Commission information and recommendations related to the electric grid,  as well as applicable laws, policies, and directives related to DHS\u2019s and  DOE\u2019s critical infrastructure protection responsibilities. We reviewed  descriptions of each of the actions that DHS and DOE identified to us and  made an initial determination of how their actions aligned with the  commission recommendations. Internally, we independently verified the  initial alignment decisions and general descriptions of DHS\u2019s and DOE\u2019s  actions and subsequently had them validated by DHS. To determine how  FERC\u2019s actions align with the 2008 EMP Commission report  recommendations, we interviewed FERC officials and reviewed  documentation regarding FERC\u2019s rulemaking on geomagnetic  disturbance (GMD) reliability standards.", "To address the second objective, we interviewed multiple officials from  DHS components and other principal federal agencies addressing  electromagnetic risks, as well as industry associations, subject-matter  experts from research organizations, product manufacturers, and electric  utility operators to confirm our understanding of their additional efforts.  Specifically, we met with DHS officials from the National Protection and  Programs Directorate (NPPD), the Science and Technology Directorate  (S&T), Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), DHS Office of Policy, and  the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as well as federal  officials from DOE, FERC, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). We also met  with industry association officials from the American Public Power  Association and Edison Electric Institute, subject-matter experts from the  Electric Power Research Institute and Metatech Corporation, and product  manufacturers and utility operators from ABB Group, EMPrimus,  Dominion Power, and PJM Interconnection. We identified the nonfederal  entities we interviewed\u2014through discussions with federal officials and our  background research\u2014as key stakeholders and subject-matter experts  within the electric power industry. While these interviews are not  generalizable to the entire industry, they provided valuable insights on  key issues and applicable coordination activities with the federal  government to address electromagnetic risks. In addition, we reviewed  program documentation and applicable reports, briefings, and other  materials related to DHS\u2019s risk assessment and mitigation efforts,  including department-wide risk assessments, such as the Strategic  National Risk Assessment and the Homeland Security National Risk  Characterization process to better understand the department\u2019s overall  efforts to address electromagnetic risks to the electric grid. We also  reviewed key strategy and planning documentation, including the NIPP,  the Energy Sector-Specific Plan, and the National Space Weather  Strategy and Action Plan. We compared the actions DHS and DOE took  against key risk-management criteria contained in the NIPP and Energy  Sector-Specific Plan, as well as applicable internal control standards.  Lastly, we reviewed relevant reports by federal agencies and industry  stakeholders to identify findings related to electromagnetic research and  development needs, and to assess the extent to which additional risk  management activities or collaboration could be beneficial. We assessed  the methodologies used in the relevant reports and determined them to  be sufficient for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2014 to March  2016, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

We believe  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to experts, a nuclear EMP is the burst of electromagnetic  radiation resulting from the detonation of a nuclear device, which can  disrupt or destroy electronic equipment. Nonnuclear EMP weapons can  also be designed to intentionally disrupt electronics, but these generally  have short range and are not a threat to multiple assets. The threat  focused on primarily by the EMP Commission, and specifically addressed  in this report, is the high-altitude EMP (HEMP). A HEMP event is caused  by the detonation of a nuclear device above the atmosphere, from about  40 to 400 kilometers (approximately 25 to 250 miles) above the earth\u2019s  surface. A HEMP attack is not intended to cause direct physical impacts  at the earth\u2019s surface, such as injury or damage directly from heat, blast,  or radiation, but instead creates an intense electromagnetic pulse that  can disrupt computers and damage electronics and insulators, and could  cause significant damage to critical electrical infrastructure, such as  transformers. The components of EMP\u2014commonly identified as E1, E2,  and E3\u2014can cause disruption and damage to electronic systems and  electrical infrastructure. For example, the E1 component, or fast pulse,  primarily disrupts or damages electronic-based control systems, sensors,  computers, and similar devices, but may also adversely affect long-line  electrical systems; the E2 component, similar to lightning, has the similar  ability to impair or destroy control features that are not protected from  lightning; and the E3 component is a subsequent, slower-rising, longer- duration pulse that creates disruptive currents in transmission lines, which  causes grid instability and increases heat in transformers. If the E3  pulse is high enough and long enough it can result in grid collapse and  potentially damage transformers.", "In addition to manmade EMPs, naturally occurring solar weather events  of sufficient intensity can also cause electromagnetic impacts similar to  the E3 pulse that can adversely affect components of the commercial  electric grid, as well as other infrastructure such as satellites and  undersea cables. The resulting impact of solar weather is commonly  referred to as a geomagnetic disturbance (GMD). In 1989, a GMD  caused wide-scale impacts on the Hydro-Quebec power system in  Canada which caused this regional electric grid to collapse within 92  seconds and left 6 million customers without power for up to 9 hours. See  appendix I for additional information on GMD events. See table 1 for an  overview of electromagnetic threats and their primary effects.", "As noted in Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21), the energy and  communications sectors are uniquely critical due to the enabling functions  they provide to other critical infrastructure sectors. The U.S. electric  power delivery system is a highly complex network of substations and  electric lines that transport electricity from generators to residential,  commercial, and industrial consumers. The U.S. electric grid has three  main components: generation (creation of electricity), transmission (long  haul transport of electricity), and distribution (shorter distances connecting  the electricity to the consumer/end user). In November 2015, FERC  reported that there are over 24,000 substations nationwide, connected by  over 430,000 miles of transmission lines.", "Given the interdependency among infrastructure sectors, an EMP or  major GMD event that disrupts the electric grid could also result in  potential cascading impacts on fuel distribution, transportation systems,  food and water supplies, and communications and equipment for  emergency services, as well as other communication systems that utilize  the civilian electrical infrastructure. PPD-21 also recognizes that DHS has  numerous responsibilities to protect critical infrastructure, including such  things as analyzing threats to, vulnerabilities of, and potential  consequences from all hazards on critical infrastructure.", "Within DHS, NPPD is responsible for working with public and industry  infrastructure partners, and leads the coordinated national effort to  mitigate risk to the nation\u2019s infrastructure through the development and  implementation of the infrastructure protection program. NPPD has two  principal offices with responsibilities to facilitate protection of critical  infrastructure that could be at risk from EMP and GMD events\u2014the Office  of Infrastructure Protection (IP) and the Office of Cybersecurity and  Communications (CS&C). In addition, FEMA and S&T have roles  related to addressing potential impacts to the electric grid, which could  include EMP and GMD threats. The offices of Cyber and Infrastructure  Analysis and I&A also help support related departmental activities.", "DOE also has a significant role as the sector-specific agency for the  energy sector, which includes critical infrastructure and key resources  related to electricity. For example, DOE is responsible for developing an  Energy Sector-Specific Plan\u2014in collaboration with other stakeholders,  including DHS and energy sector owners and operators\u2014that applies the  NIPP risk management model to critical infrastructure and key resources  within the sector. Within DOE, the Office of Electricity Delivery and  Energy Reliability leads national efforts to increase the security and  reliability of the energy infrastructure and facilitate recovery from  disruptions to the energy supply. Legislation enacted in December 2015  further authorizes the Secretary of Energy, upon submission by the  president of a written directive or determination identifying an electrical  grid emergency, to issue orders for emergency measures necessary to  protect or restore the reliability of critical electric infrastructure or of  defense critical infrastructure during such an emergency and establishes  the Secretary of Energy as the lead sector-specific agency for  cybersecurity for the energy sector. DOE national laboratories also  provide research support and technical expertise to federal and industry  stakeholders regarding EMP and GMD impacts.", "Other principal federal agencies working to address the threat of EMP  and GMD include DOD and FERC, as well as NOAA, the U.S. Geological  Survey (USGS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA).", "Electrical infrastructure is primarily operated by private industry, which  owns approximately 85 percent of the nation\u2019s critical electrical  infrastructure. Industry entities are represented, in part, through  membership in industry associations such as the American Public Power  Association, Edison Electric Institute, and National Rural Electric  Cooperative Association.

Federal agencies have also been involved in strategy development and  planning, as well as training and outreach efforts, as a means of  preparing federal officials and others to respond to both EMP and GMD  events, and enhancing knowledge about electromagnetic risks. For  example, DHS S&T led the design and development of a prototype  transformer that can be more easily transported to another location to  help restore electric power in a timelier manner. DHS has also  participated in various training and outreach events to enhance  understanding of an EMP and GMD event. DOE\u2019s primary efforts include  supporting research to enhance the understanding of the potential  impacts to the electric grid from electromagnetic events. Overall, DHS  and DOE have led most of the federal actions addressing protection and  mitigation efforts.

Although DHS and DOE did not report that any of their actions  were taken in response to the commission report, actions taken by both  agencies have aligned with some of the recommendations. Specifically,  the EMP Commission made seven recommendations related to the  electric grid, most of which were directed to DHS and DOE. Of these  seven recommendations, some of the actions that DHS and DOE took  aligned with four of them. The seven EMP Commission recommendations  related to the electric grid include the following:  1.  conducting research to better understand infrastructure systems and  2.  expanding activities to address the vulnerability of control systems,  3.  identifying clear authority and responsibility to respond to an EMP  4.  engaging federal and industry entities to determine liabilities and  5.  establishing monitoring efforts and defining testing standards and  6.  providing capabilities to help protect the electric grid from an EMP  attack and recover as rapidly and effectively as possible, and  7.  utilizing industry and governmental institutions to assure cost effective  outcomes.", "DHS and DOE efforts to protect the electrical grid aligned with the first  three recommendations noted above: conducting research to better  understand the interdependencies of critical infrastructures, addressing  the vulnerability of control systems to an EMP attack; and identifying  responsibilities for responding to an EMP attack. They also aligned with  the seventh recommendation, which includes 15 subparts, on utilizing  industry and other governmental institutions to assure the most cost- effective outcomes. For example, with respect to the recommendation  on conducting research to better understand interdependencies of critical  infrastructures, DHS\u2019s Sector Resilience Report: Electric Power Delivery  includes some assessment of how various critical infrastructures\u2014 including the energy, communications, and transportation sectors, among  others\u2014are interdependent in maintaining operations.", "With regard to the last multipart recommendation identified above, DHS  and DOE took some actions that aligned with 5 of the 15 subparts of this  recommendation. Some of the sub-parts include such efforts as  developing national and regional restoration plans and assuring the  availability of critical communication channels, among other efforts. For  example, DHS and DOE have actions underway to develop a Power  Outage Incident Annex plan, which, according to DHS officials, is  intended to provide incident-specific information regarding how the  federal government plans to respond to and recover from a loss of power  resulting from deliberate acts of terrorism or natural disasters, including  an EMP or GMD event. In addition, a DHS entity developed EMP  protection guidelines to help federal agencies and industry identify  options for safeguarding critical communication equipment and control  elements, such as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)  systems, from an EMP attack. For more detailed information regarding  how identified federal actions align with these seven EMP Commission  recommendations, see appendix III."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Opportunities Exist for Federal Agencies to Identify Responsibilities, Assess Risks, and Strengthen Collaboration with Partners to Address Electromagnetic Risks", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Has Not Identified Roles and Responsibilities for Addressing Electromagnetic Risks", "paragraphs": ["DHS has not clearly identified internal roles and responsibilities for  addressing electromagnetic risks to the electric grid or communicated  these to external federal and industry partners. While multiple DHS  components and offices, including NPPD, FEMA, and S&T, have each  conducted independent activities addressing electromagnetic risks to the  electric grid, none have been tasked with lead responsibility for  coordinating related activities within the department or with federal and  industry stakeholders. As a result, we experienced ongoing challenges in  identifying applicable DHS personnel and related departmental actions.  For example, NPPD officials had difficulty identifying their specific roles  and activities addressing electromagnetic risks to the electric grid,  including efforts to collect or synthesize available risk information to  provide input into department-wide risk assessments, such as the  Homeland Security National Risk Characterization (HSNRC). An official  within NPPD/CS&C subsequently provided information to us regarding  applicable activities conducted as part of his role leading efforts to help  safeguard communications and information/control system capabilities in  the event of EMP-related attacks or disasters. However, this official was  initially identified to us by a non-DHS stakeholder and several other DHS  entities that we interviewed regarding related efforts to address  electromagnetic events lacked awareness of these activities. Further,  DHS officials did not identify any DHS representatives or offices as  having broader designated responsibility for performing key oversight or  coordination roles regarding electromagnetic risks within DHS\u2019s overall  infrastructure protection efforts, including activities intended to help  address risks to the electrical grid.", "Furthermore, industry representatives and other federal officials told us it  is not clear who within DHS is responsible for addressing electromagnetic  risks. One major industry association reported that although senior DHS  officials participated in some collaborative bodies, such as the Electricity  Subsector Coordinating Council, association representatives were unable  to identify applicable DHS representatives at a working level because  there was generally limited engagement with industry on these issues. In  contrast, industry representatives stated that other key agencies,  including DOE and FERC, have recognized offices and points of contact  that were knowledgeable about electromagnetic issues of concern to the  industry. Some industry officials also commented that having clarity about  the DHS contacts was critical because DHS may be best positioned to  serve as a liaison between them and DOD, which generally does not  interact directly with industry on these issues. DOE officials also indicated  that they did not know whom at DHS they should contact with regard to  requesting related information, such as specific DHS research reports  related to electromagnetic risks.", "The Energy Sector-Specific Plan, which is guided by the NIPP, highlights  the importance of identifying clear roles and responsibilities in achieving  goals and objectives in security programs and emergency response  planning. According to the Energy Sector-Specific Plan, stakeholders  should clearly understand their respective roles and responsibilities, and  plan to integrate their independently executed roles to achieve a common  set of infrastructure protection outcomes. The 2008 EMP Commission  report also recommended that DHS make clear its authority and  responsibilities, as well as delineate the functioning interfaces with other  governmental institutions, regarding EMP response efforts. Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government also cite this principle, stating  the importance of ensuring that authority and responsibility are clearly  assigned throughout the organization.", "According to officials within the DHS Office of Policy, addressing EMP  risks has generally been a lower priority compared to other risks due to a  combination of differing opinions on the likelihood of these events and  their expectation that other federal agencies will be involved in  responding to an electromagnetic event. For example, DHS officials noted  that the nature of an EMP attack would constitute an \u201cact of war\u201d that  would generally be included within DOD\u2019s mission. According to a senior  DHS official, in the case of an EMP attack, it is likely that DOD would  serve in the principal role of identifying our adversaries and taking  applicable defensive or retaliatory actions; however, DHS and DOE are  designated in the NIPP as the key federal entities responsible for efforts  to protect the electric grid and recover from such an attack. DHS  acknowledged this responsibility through its inclusion of EMP as a risk  event in the 2015 update of the Strategic National Risk Assessment  (SNRA), noting that damage from a deliberate attack on the grid could  cause cascading impacts through other infrastructure systems, leading to  economic disruption and the potential loss of life.", "The growing recognition of GMD as a significant risk event requiring the  collaborative efforts of multiple federal agencies and industry  stakeholders, to both prepare for and respond to, underscores the  concerns that industry and other officials have raised about DHS\u2019s roles  and responsibilities being clearly designated. In recent years, there has  been a growing consensus among federal agencies, industry  representatives, and independent researchers that a major GMD event  could have significant impacts on the nation\u2019s electric grid and is probable  enough to warrant federal action. For example, the recent National Space  Weather Strategy and Action Plan, issued by the White House in October  2015, and ongoing development of the FERC GMD reliability standard  further exemplify the growing recognition of GMD as a significant risk  event that requires the collective expertise of multiple federal agencies,  as well as applicable industry partners. Designating internal roles and  responsibilities within DHS regarding electromagnetic risks and  communicating these to federal and industry partners could provide  additional awareness of related activities and help ensure more effective  and coordinated engagement with other federal agencies and industry  stakeholders. The lack of clarity regarding DHS activities to address  electromagnetic risks also increases the risk of potential duplication,  overlap, or fragmentation within the department or across federal  agencies. Officials from the DHS Office of Policy agreed that enhanced  internal coordination among DHS entities could be beneficial and noted  that there are actions currently underway to establish a Cyber,  Infrastructure, and Resiliency group within the Office of Policy that could  potentially facilitate further coordination efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS and DOE Have Not Fully Addressed NIPP Requirement to Identify Key Electrical Infrastructure Assets", "paragraphs": ["DHS and DOE have not taken actions to identify key electrical  infrastructure assets as required given their respective critical  infrastructure responsibilities under the NIPP. Specifically, as the two  primary federal entities responsible for addressing key risk management  objectives outlined in the NIPP related to the energy sector, DHS and  DOE have important roles in determining the extent to which critical  infrastructure assets are adequately identified and all applicable  information is included in related analyses. For example, the NIPP  explicitly states that to manage critical infrastructure risk effectively,  partners must identify the assets, systems, and networks that are  essential to their continued operation, considering associated  dependencies and interdependencies of other infrastructure sectors.  Further underscoring the importance of identifying critical electrical  infrastructure assets, a DOE-sponsored November 2015 report  developed by the Idaho National Laboratory also emphasizes the need to  identify the grid facilities most critical to restoration and recovery to  prioritize those assets which should be protected from EMP effects, citing  that it is not feasible or cost-effective to protect all infrastructure assets  across the electricity sector. The 2008 EMP Commission report also  specifically recommended that DHS and DOE prioritize nodes that are  critical for the rapid recovery of other key sectors that rely upon electricity  to function, including those assets that must remain in service or be  restored within hours of an EMP attack.", "Notwithstanding these responsibilities, DHS and DOE did not report any  actions taken to identify critical electrical infrastructure as part of risk  management efforts for the energy sector. In response to our July 2015  testimony citing limited DHS activities to identify applicable electrical  infrastructure assets, DHS stated that it was aware of a study that FERC  had conducted that identified critical electrical substations and cited  potential duplication as the reason for why DHS did not conduct any  additional related efforts. The study, which FERC staff conducted in 2013,  utilized network modeling to identify critical substations that FERC  deemed significant enough to produce wide area outages across the U.S.  power grid. According to FERC, the analysis was conducted, in part, to  engage with owners and operators of those facilities to encourage the use  of cyber and physical security best practices. While the FERC study  provided data that could help inform further analysis of critical electrical  infrastructure assets, FERC officials did not indicate their analysis was  intended to address specific critical infrastructure responsibilities laid out  in the NIPP.", "Moreover, while FERC\u2019s study remains a positive step toward identifying  select critical electrical infrastructure assets and addressing the EMP  Commission\u2019s recommendations, it did not solicit participation from other  federal agencies, including DHS and DOE. Given the significant critical  infrastructure responsibilities and expertise of these agencies, this lack of  participation may have diminished the potential robustness of the study.  For example, DOE officials stated that the FERC study did not include an  analysis of \u201cblackstart\u201d capability, which DOE officials believe may be  another important element that should be considered when analyzing the  criticality of electrical generation facilities. Blackstart capability indicates  that a facility can resume operations without reliance on external power  sources\u2014a capability that is important in the aftermath of an electrical  grid shutdown. As the designated sector-specific agency, DOE has  valuable expertise that could be useful based on their broad  understanding of the bulk-power system, load factors, and specific asset  characteristics that may be important to consider when determining the  key elements of criticality that should be evaluated. In addition, DHS has  specific expertise related to infrastructure dependencies that may be  helpful to identify potential cascading impacts to other assets or systems  resulting from electrical power outages that should be considered. Both  DHS and DOE acknowledged that further collaborative efforts to assess  critical electrical infrastructure could be beneficial; however, as of  November 2015, neither DHS nor DOE have reported on any efforts to  review the 2013 FERC study or collaborate further to jointly determine the  key elements of criticality that they believe should be considered when  evaluating the vast array of infrastructure assets constituting the U.S  electric grid.", "The extensive size and scope of the electric power system necessitates  collaboration among partners to ensure all individual expertise is  effectively leveraged. For example, a senior FERC official testified in July  2015 that determining which of the substations nationwide are the most  critical depends on the outcome one is pursuing. The official noted that  if grid stability and continuity is the desired outcome, then a relatively  small set of substations (in the hundreds) could be considered critical;  however, if preserving power supply to specific DOD or nuclear power  station is the desired outcome, then an additional collection of substations  would need to be included. The NIPP also notes that critical infrastructure  partners may view criticality differently, based on their unique situations,  operating models, and associated risks. Leveraging additional DHS and  DOE expertise could help to ensure that all key elements of criticality are  reflected in the results of FERC\u2019s study. Our work on federal agency  collaboration supports this approach as well, noting that it is important to  ensure that all of the relevant participants have been included in the  collaborative effort. Reviewing FERC\u2019s analysis and collaboratively  determining the extent to which further assessment of critical electrical  infrastructure may be needed would provide DHS and DOE an  opportunity to contribute their unique knowledge and expertise, as well as  better ensure that NIPP responsibilities are adequately addressed and all  applicable elements of criticality are being considered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Fully Leveraged Existing Opportunities to Collect and Analyze Information on Electromagnetic Risks", "paragraphs": ["Although DHS components have independently conducted some efforts  to assess electromagnetic risks as identified above, the department has  not fully leveraged available risk information or conducted a  comprehensive analysis of these risks.

The potential threat was recently illustrated in July  2012, when a Carrington class solar storm missed the earth by  approximately 1 week, as the storm occurred on the far side of the sun  facing away from the earth. In contrast, assessing the threat of an EMP  attack remains more difficult given that analysts have to also account for  human factors that can increase the level of uncertainty. Specifically,  within the 2011 SNRA, DHS notes that incomplete knowledge of  adversary capabilities and intent are sources of uncertainty regarding the  frequency of some risks.", "Although DHS components identified multiple efforts to support the  collection of information regarding the threat of GMD, DHS identified a  more limited range of efforts to collect threat information regarding  potential EMP attacks. I&A officials indicated that while there is no  dedicated Center of Excellence within the Intelligence Community on  EMP, there is subject-matter expertise available from analysts in related  mission areas, such as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear  issues. CS&C representatives further noted that a group of analysts in  that office routinely monitor classified intelligence sources for EMP- related threat information, such as those available through the Joint  Worldwide Intelligence Communications System.

Examples include the following:  Infrastructure Survey Tool (IST). Through this program, IP  administers survey questions to asset owners across all critical  infrastructure sectors about key dependencies on utilities, including  the supply of electric power.

For example, further  collection of information on sector interdependencies could help DHS to  assess the potential economic consequences associated with long-term  power outages. Assessment of direct and indirect economic  consequences is currently limited but could be useful to help determine  relative risk rankings and provide information to help assess the cost- effectiveness of various mitigation strategies.", "Further, a more comprehensive assessment of vulnerability and  consequences may help inform broader DHS risk assessment efforts,  including the HSNRC. These vulnerability and consequence inputs are  key components to help ensure that the HSNRC can be effectively  utilized to identify the relative rankings of various risk events, including  other threats to the electrical grid, such as physical or cyberattack.  According to officials within the DHS Office of Policy, the original HSNRC  process conducted in 2012-2013 included estimates of broad  consequences for 40 individual risk events. However, officials noted that  certain categories, such as loss of life, were primary factors in designating  selected risk events as priorities for further analysis. These officials also  reported that given limited information about the specific consequences  likely to result from an EMP event, DHS instead utilized proxy  consequence information from an analytical study of a major regional  earthquake that would be expected to cause damage to a wide range of  critical infrastructure including electrical power operations. However, this  postulated event\u2014which included an estimate of approximately 86,000  injuries and fatalities across the 8-state study region\u2014is unlikely to be on  par with an EMP attack that, according to experts, could include the  extended disruption of electric power and cascading impacts to other  critical infrastructure across much of the United States.", "According to the NIPP, to assess risk effectively, critical infrastructure  partners\u2014including owners and operators, sector councils, and  government agencies\u2014need timely, reliable, and actionable information  regarding threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences.

In  addition, the Quadrennial Energy Review specifically notes the  importance of applicable threat information, stating that incomplete or  ambiguous threat information may lead to inconsistency in physical  security among grid owners, inefficient spending of limited resources at  facilities, or deployment of security measures against the wrong threat.  The Quadrennial Energy Review also states that, in regard to critical high- voltage transformers, current programs to address vulnerability may not  be adequate to address the security and reliability concerns associated  with simultaneous failures of multiple high-voltage transformers.", "Moreover, according to subject-matter experts, the impact to the electric  grid from electromagnetic threats may vary substantially by location,  network and operating characteristics, and other factors. For example,  key reports on GMD indicate that high-voltage transformers located at  higher latitudes in the United States are likely subject to increased  potential for adverse impacts from GMD events than those at lower  latitudes. However, this is not the case with EMP, which may have  impacts equal to or greater than GMD in any latitude of the United States.  Additionally, an EMP would subject infrastructure assets to a combination  of E1, E2, and E3 effects compared to GMD which only produces impacts  similar to the E3 effect. Federal and industry researchers have also noted  that given these distinct effects and the different types of mitigation efforts  necessary to protect against them, more comprehensive risk information  may be necessary to evaluate their unique impacts to the electric grid.  The electric grid remains vulnerable to other potential threats, such as  physical and cyberattacks, which each present unique vulnerabilities to  assess.

For  example, as one EMP expert noted in recent congressional testimony, if  designing protective equipment to withstand specified levels of E3 effects  from an EMP attack, there may be collateral benefits for providing  protection against GMD effects; however, the reverse may not be true.
