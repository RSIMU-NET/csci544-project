VA\u2019s recovery authority was expanded in 1990 to include recoveries for care provided to veterans with service-connected disabilities, as long as that care was for treatment of conditions unrelated to the veterans\u2019 service-connected disabilities.", "In fiscal year 1996, VA sought recovery of about $1.6 billion of its costs but only recovered 31 percent of the billed amount, or $495 million, a 5-percent decline from fiscal year 1995 recoveries. In its fiscal year 1998 budget submission, however, VA estimated that it will be able to increase its recoveries from private health insurance, reaching $826 million in fiscal year 2002. This is important because VA sought and was recently given authority to retain the funds it recovers and to use them to supplement future appropriations.", "This report responds to your request that we identify those factors that limit VA\u2019s ability to recover more of its billed charges, evaluate VA\u2019s ability to achieve its revenue targets by (1) identifying factors that could decrease future recoveries and (2) assessing the potential for VA initiatives to increase medical care cost recoveries, and evaluate the way VA applies insurance payments to veterans\u2019 copayment liability for veterans in the discretionary care category."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To identify whether factors limit VA\u2019s ability to recover more of its billed charges, we studied the recovery programs at VA\u2019s Martinsburg, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C., medical centers. We selected the two medical centers in consultation with officials working in VA\u2019s Medical Care Cost Recovery (MCCR) program. The Martinsburg medical center was selected because it was (1) viewed by VA officials as operating an efficient recovery program and (2) 1 of 10 medical centers participating in MCCR\u2019s reengineering pilot project. The recovery program at the Washington DC\u2019s medical center was chosen for contrast. Although Martinsburg\u2019s medical center is much smaller than Washington\u2019s, it was recovering roughly the same amount from private health insurance.", "At the two medical centers, we examined a random sample of the bills VA had submitted to insurers during May 1994. We focused our statistical analyses on bills for which VA had completed recovery actions (closed bills). For each bill, we examined the insurers\u2019 explanation of benefits, VA\u2019s patient insurance information, and VA\u2019s financial tracking reports to determine (1) why insurers denied or partially paid VA bills and (2) what actions VA had taken to determine whether additional funds could be recovered. We discussed bills denied or partially paid for administrative or other nonclinical reasons with VA staff at the medical centers to find out which factors had affected recoveries. To the extent possible, we reviewed, with the assistance of a registered nurse, the discharge summaries for those inpatient claims denied for clinical reasons to determine whether insurers\u2019 denials were appropriate. We used appropriateness-of-care criteria developed by InterQual, a utilization review firm, in our assessments. We confirmed the prevalence of these findings with MCCR staff at other facilities and in VA\u2019s headquarters.", "To evaluate VA\u2019s ability to achieve its revenue targets, we reviewed (1) VA\u2019s fiscal year 1998 budget submission, the MCCR program\u2019s 1996 business plan, and other documents detailing VA\u2019s health care restructuring plans, such as VA\u2019s Prescription for Change, new budget allocation system, and its use of performance measures; (2) interviewed MCCR and health care staff from VA facilities and VA\u2019s headquarters; and (3) interviewed staff and reviewed documents from VA\u2019s General Counsel and Regional Counsels.", "To assess the application of discretionary veterans\u2019 copayments to their third-party liability, we reviewed VA\u2019s General Counsel decisions and discussed the implementation of these decisions with VA\u2019s General Counsel as well as MCCR staff from central office and VA facilities.", "We did our work between May 1995 and July 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["VA collects money from third-party insurers and directly from some veterans to offset the cost of providing health care services for veterans\u2019 nonservice-connected conditions.

In fiscal year 1996, the MCCR program retained almost $119 million to offset the costs of operating the recovery program and deposited $455 million in the Treasury. With passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33), VA will retain amounts collected after June 30, 1997, to supplement its annual appropriations and finance the cost of serving additional veterans.", "While the law prevents insurers from arbitrarily denying payment to VA for services that would be covered in private sector facilities, VA, like other health care providers, must generally comply with the terms and conditions set out in veterans\u2019 health insurance policies. Insurance policies typically contain a number of provisions that limit the amount of billed charges that the insurer is responsible for paying. In addition to requiring that care be medically necessary and provided in an appropriate setting, policies may require the policyholder to pay a specified amount (such as $500), referred to as a deductible or out-of-pocket payment, for covered health care services before the insurance begins paying; require policyholders to pay a certain percentage of covered charges, known as a copayment or coinsurance; specify what services are covered and any limits on the days of coverage or frequency of services; require, as a condition for payment, that providers or policyholders obtain prior approval from the insurer before admission to a hospital; preclude or reduce payment (other than for emergency care) to providers that are not members of HMOs, preferred provider organizations (PPO), or point-of-service (POS) plans; and \u201cwrap around\u201d other insurance coverage and pay only that portion of approved charges not paid by the primary insurance, such as Medicare.", "Unlike most providers, however, VA does not bill health plans for the individual tests and procedures it provides to its policyholders. Instead, VA prepares bills based on its average costs for providing a day of hospital care and an outpatient visit. In fiscal year 1997, VA billed insurers $1,046 per day for inpatient care provided in medical bed sections, $1,923 per day for care provided in surgical bed sections, $194 for each outpatient visit, and $20 for each prescription refill. In other words, the amount VA bills insurers for a 5-day surgical stay is the same regardless of the type of surgery performed. Similarly, it bills the same amount for an outpatient visit regardless of the types or number of services provided during that visit.", "In fiscal year 1995, VA recovered $522.8 million from third parties, including private health insurers, workers\u2019 compensation programs, and no-fault insurance. Recoveries declined to $495.2 million in fiscal year 1996 and to $213.4 million during the first two quarters of fiscal year 1997.", "VA\u2019s 1998 budget proposal requested medical care funding of $17.6 billion, consisting of an appropriation of almost $17 billion and a legislative proposal to retain insurance payments, veterans\u2019 copayments, and other third-party reimbursements estimated to total about $600 million in fiscal year 1998. VA proposed to freeze its appropriation at about $17 billion over the next 5 years and rely instead on increased efficiency and increases in third-party reimbursements to offset the effects of inflation. VA estimated that the third-party recovery authority would enable it to generate $1.7 billion in additional revenues in 2002, including $826 million from private health insurance. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 authorized VA to retain recoveries and collections after June 30, 1997.

Medically inappropriate care includes care deemed to be medically unnecessary, excessive lengths of stay, and care that should have been provided on an outpatient basis. For example, insurers denied or reduced claims at the Martinsburg medical center for cataract surgeries that were unnecessarily performed on an inpatient basis. Similarly, insurers denied or reduced claims when the medical center allowed veterans who traveled considerable distances for care to be admitted early, to be discharged later, or to receive inpatient treatment instead of outpatient services.", "When such claims were reduced or denied, the Martinsburg medical center often negotiated payment for ancillary and professional services associated with inpatient care that should have been provided on an outpatient basis. In addition, the medical center was sometimes able to obtain payment for clinic visits and ancillary services provided to veterans in the medical center\u2019s nursing home and domiciliary beds. Such payments, however, accounted for significantly less than half of billed charges.", "Unlike Martinsburg, the Washington, D.C., medical center generally did not vigorously pursue claims denied as medically inappropriate and seldom pursued payment of ancillary or professional services. Since the period covered by our claims review, however, the Washington medical center has brought in a new manager for the recovery program and has reorganized its functions to strengthen the billing, collection, and appeals processes. Billing and collections staff are no longer in separate units but are paired together in teams to expedite recovery actions. An August 1996 review of the Washington, D.C., program by MCCR staff from headquarters and other VA facilities, however, identified the need for further improvements. For example, the reviewers suggested that the facility (1) develop a mechanism to consistently track patients\u2019 inpatient and outpatient treatments, (2) identify a physician adviser and establish a multidisciplinary utilization review committee to assist with appeals, and (3) develop procedures to identify and bill for professional fees where appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Supplemental Insurers Limit Payment as Secondary Insurance", "paragraphs": ["VA bills Medicare supplemental insurers for the full cost of VA services, even though such policies provide coverage that is secondary to Medicare.

For inpatient care, these insurers typically pay the Medicare inpatient deductible ($760 in 1997) or the inpatient deductible plus 20 percent of the professional services component of the VA per diem rate. As a result, VA recovers only a small percentage of its billed charges. For example, VA can expect to recover only $760 to $835 for a 3-day VA hospital stay for which it billed $3,138. Similarly, for an outpatient visit, Medicare supplemental insurers typically pay no more than 20 percent of the billed charges.", "The largest Medigap insurer, the American Association of Retired People (AARP), however, no longer pays VA 20 percent of billed charges for most of its veteran policyholders. In September 1995, AARP began paying VA 20 percent of what it estimates Medicare would have paid for the service in a physician\u2019s office for veterans in the mandatory care category (primarily those with service-connected disabilities or low incomes). AARP continues to pay 20 percent of VA\u2019s billed charges for veterans in the discretionary care category (those with no service-connected disabilities and incomes above the \u201cmeans-test\u201d level, which is about $21,000 for a single veteran) who are subject to copayments to cover their out-of-pocket costs.", "The effect of this change on VA recoveries is unclear. For veterans in the mandatory care category who are not subject to VA\u2019s copayments, recoveries are likely to decrease for outpatient bills involving routine office visits. For example, because Medicare pays about $54 for a routine office visit, AARP would pay VA less than $11 for such care under the new policy rather than almost $39 (20 percent of VA\u2019s $194 outpatient rate) it would have paid under the old policy. On the other hand, to the extent that VA provides these veterans high-cost services or procedures, such as cataract surgery, as outpatient services, AARP\u2019s payments to VA should increase under the new policy. (See fig. 1.)", "VA\u2019s right to collect from Medigap insurers was upheld in earlier court decisions. However, some insurers still contend that they are not liable for the amounts sought by VA until they receive an adjudicated claim indicating what portion of VA\u2019s bill is covered by Medicare. The insurers claim that calculating the amount owed to VA is unduly burdensome because VA does not give them a Medicare remittance advice or explanation of benefits explaining Medicare-approved charges. When the matter is resolved, VA expects to recover on the backlog of claims submitted to insurers involved in the case. Like other Medicare supplemental policies, however, these plans would pay secondary rather than primary benefits, and therefore most of VA\u2019s billed charges would not be collectable.", "Because the Martinsburg medical center was billing Medicare supplemental insurance more often than the Washington medical center, a larger percentage of unpaid charges resulted from denials and reduced payments by such insurers. About a third of Martinsburg\u2019s unpaid charges for inpatient care are attributable to billing Medicare supplemental insurers. By contrast, only about 13 percent of the Washington, D.C., medical center\u2019s unpaid inpatient charges are attributable to billing Medicare supplemental insurance. Similarly, about 40 percent of the unpaid outpatient charges for the Martinsburg medical center resulted from billing Medicare supplemental insurance for the full cost of outpatient care.

About 19 percent of the claims denied by insurers for inpatient care provided by the Washington, D.C., medical center, representing over 20 percent of the center\u2019s unpaid inpatient charges, were billed to HMOs and other managed care plans that limit payments for nonemergency care to participating providers. About 19 percent of the bills insurers denied for outpatient care provided by the Washington, D.C., medical center, representing about 35 percent of unpaid charges, were billed to HMOs and other managed care plans that limit payments for nonemergency care to participating providers. Because VA could not provide support that the care was for a medical emergency, the medical center had no basis for pursuing collection.", "Denials by HMOs and certain other managed care plans did not account for as much of the unpaid care at the Martinsburg medical center because that facility generally did not bill managed care plans unless it was fairly certain that the plan would pay for VA care.

Such deductibles can either be a yearly amount or apply to a specific episode of care such as a hospital stay. In addition, policies frequently require policyholders to pay a certain percentage of charges (a copayment or coinsurance).

By contrast, reductions on the basis of cost-sharing requirements accounted for less than 10 percent of unpaid inpatient charges at each facility.", "Since our study period, the percentage of outpatient charges that are unpaid because of cost-sharing requirements has probably increased because of the trend in fee-for-service health plans toward higher copayments. For example, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield standard option plan under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) increased the copayment on a $194 outpatient bill from approximately $49 to $100 between 1994 and 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Knowledge of Plan Provisions Hinders Recovery", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s efforts to pursue recoveries from private health insurers are hindered by VA\u2019s limited access to the terms and conditions of veterans\u2019 insurance policies.

Depending on the information contained in the insurers\u2019 remittance advice, MCCR staff made follow-up telephone calls to see why payments were denied or reduced. For example, after repeated telephone conversations with an employer-sponsored health benefit plan, MCCR staff at the Martinsburg medical center discovered that outpatient bills that had been denied for apparent coverage limitations were in fact payable if billed on a different form. On the basis of that information, the facility was able to obtain additional recoveries by resubmitting previously denied outpatient claims for other veterans.", "VA\u2019s other potential source of policy information\u2014the veteran policyholder\u2014has little incentive to give VA detailed information about insurance coverage.

MCCR is particularly interested in identifying Medicare-eligible veterans whose private health insurance is primary. MCCR estimated that 5.9 percent of the over-65 population treated by VA could be expected to have primary health insurance other than Medicare. The MCCR program further estimated that if its assumption is correct, potential recoveries from such veterans may total about $97 million.", "VA appears to overestimate the potential for additional recoveries under this initiative. There are two basic groups of Medicare beneficiaries for whom private health insurance is primary. The first group is beneficiaries who are over 65 and still working or have a spouse who is still working. Those Medicare beneficiaries still working are likely to be healthier and thus likely to use fewer health care services, including services from VA. The second large group of Medicare beneficiaries likely to have other primary health insurance consists of individuals who retired from state and local governments before April 1, 1986, or from the federal government before January 1983.", "In addition, VA does not know how many such veterans have already been identified. As discussed earlier, 60 percent of the veterans VA currently identifies as having private health insurance are over age 65. Accordingly, even if the estimate of the percentage of Medicare-eligible veterans with private health insurance that is primary is correct, the estimate of potential recoveries is overstated because it does not back out current recoveries.", "On the other hand, VA may understate the potential for additional recoveries resulting from matching VA and Medicare records because such a match could also be used to identify Medicare beneficiaries under 65 years of age who have private health insurance that is primary. VA\u2019s 1992 National Survey of Veterans estimates that 23 percent of VA users under the age of 65 are covered by Medicare, and about a third of these veterans have private health insurance. MCCR, however, does not currently plan to use these data to identify private health insurance coverage for such veterans under the age of 65.", "The second approach MCCR tested for improving identification of insurance coverage was the use of a contractor to identify insurance coverage. In August 1995, VA provided Health Management Systems, Inc., the names and identifiers of 38,748 patients for whom VA facilities had no insurance information. The contractor, however, was able to identify only 649 matches with its insurance records. VA further determined that only 236, or 0.6 percent, of the records reviewed had billable insurance coverage.

On the basis of results of the pilot test, VA estimated that nationwide implementation of a preregistration process could result in an additional $100 million in recoveries annually from newly identified insured patients.", "It is not clear, however, whether the billable cases identified through the preregistration process would not otherwise have been identified. In other words, was preregistration a substitute for data-gathering efforts that would have taken place at the time of the visit?

After September 30, 1998, veterans, other than those with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or higher or seeking treatment for a service-connected disability, will not be able to obtain care from the VA health care system unless they have enrolled. Capturing insurance information during the enrollment process and including such data in the enrollment database could facilitate billing efforts. Information obtained at the time of enrollment and subsequent reenrollment could include the policy number and, upon request, a copy of the policy. By including other information, such as income and detailed information on adjudicated service-connected disabilities, MCCR staff could more readily identify billable insurance and prepare and process bills.", "The effectiveness of such a process would, however, continue to be dependent on (1) the willingness of veterans to give VA complete and accurate information on their insurance coverage, employers, and incomes and (2) the thoroughness of VA efforts to obtain and verify the information provided. VA data show that much of the information VA currently gathers is inaccurate\u2014veterans fail to reveal their insurance coverage or underestimate their incomes in applying for VA health care.

This distinction is particularly important to VA because being a participating provider essentially lowers VA recoveries. For example, the Washington, D.C., VA medical center has an agreement with Blue Cross of the National Capital Area as a participating, rather than preferred, provider. This means that veteran policyholders who use the Washington, D.C., medical center rather than a preferred provider are subject to higher copayments. These higher copayments essentially mean that the insurer pays less of the billed charges; thus VA recoveries are lower than they would be if VA was a preferred provider.", "Although the Washington, D.C., medical center is trying to become a preferred provider, Blue Cross of the National Capital Area has little incentive to allow VA to join its preferred provider network. For one thing, the VA medical center is surrounded by preferred providers in the Blue Cross network; as the following map indicates, 4 of the 12 hospitals that are preferred providers in Washington, D.C., are within a mile of the VA hospital. Moreover, because the Washington, D.C., medical center\u2019s billing process differs from those of other hospitals, VA bills are perceived as more difficult and costly for the insurer to process.", "A number of other factors also affect VA\u2019s ability to negotiate preferred provider status. First, to become a preferred provider under some plans, VA would be required to accept discounted payments. Historically, VA has not been allowed to negotiate discounted payments. Second, VA may be unwilling or unable to comply with the utilization management policies and standards insurers often impose as requirements for preferred provider status.", "The 1996 business plan for the MCCR program identified plans to address VA\u2019s inability to recover from HMOs by seeking legislation requiring HMOs to include VA as a preferred provider. VA has taken no official position on the proposal contained in the MCCR business plan and has not estimated potential revenues from this initiative, but revenues could be substantial given the rapid increase in HMO enrollments. Such legislation, however, would essentially require HMOs to treat VA providers differently than they would other providers, raising questions of equity and fairness.", "A number of alternative approaches could be taken to ensure that government funds are not used to subsidize health plans unless the plan includes VA as a participating provider. For example, legislation could be enacted authorizing VA to (1) deny enrollment in the VA health care system to any veteran enrolled in a managed care plan unless that plan includes VA as a provider and (2) refuse to provide drugs to any veteran covered by PBMs unless the sponsoring health plan reimburses VA, or the plan\u2019s PBM includes VA as a participating provider in the PBM\u2019s pharmacy network.", "Similarly, in instances in which health plans send their payments to veterans rather than to VA and the veterans refuse to return the payments, VA could be authorized to deny veterans enrollment in the VA health care system or to recover the funds through an offset against other government benefits.

In addition, daily reports on all nonacute admissions are given to the bed service chiefs, and a weekly utilization review activity report is provided to bed service chiefs and the chief of staff.", "These initiatives enabled Martinsburg medical center to decrease nonacute admissions to medical wards from 72 to 59 percent and nonacute admissions for surgical wards from 78 to 70 percent. The data from continuing stay reviews showed that nonacute days of care provided in medical wards decreased from 92 to 79 percent, and nonacute days of care provided in surgical wards decreased from 82 to 69 percent. Although these are important improvements, with well over half of admissions and days of care continuing to be nonacute, further actions appear warranted.

The contractor estimated that using the positions to strengthen identification and follow-up would enable VA to generate about $100 million a year in additional outpatient recoveries. In its fiscal year 1998 budget submission, VA indicates that the automated capture of encounter data will also result in additional recoveries of $23 million in fiscal year 1997, increasing to $116 million in fiscal year 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attract New Users", "paragraphs": ["Another of VA\u2019s goals is to increase the number of VA users by 20 percent over the next 5 years. One way to meet its recovery projections would be to focus its marketing efforts on attracting veterans with fee-for-service private health insurance.", "VA officials told us that they do not know how many veterans in their 2.9 million patient base have insurance or how many insured veterans receive billable care. This lack of information on key elements affecting its projections creates considerable uncertainty about the number of new insured users it would need to attract or identify in order to generate its target revenues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Use of Insurance Payments to Pay Veterans\u2019 Copayments Reduces Overall Recoveries", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s General Counsel has determined that a portion of any payments received from a veteran\u2019s private health insurance should be applied toward any copayments owed by the veteran, including both means test, per diem, and pharmacy copayments. While VA\u2019s interpretation is understandable as it applies to Medicare supplemental insurance policies, it is more questionable to apply recoveries from primary insurance toward veterans\u2019 copayments. In addition, as interpreted by VA\u2019s General Counsel, the application of insurance recoveries to offset veteran copayments creates a significant administrative burden for MCCR staff and reduces overall third-party recoveries.", "Under Public Law 99-272, certain veterans, in order to become eligible for VA medical care, must agree to pay the lesser of the cost of that care or the so-called \u201cmeans test\u201d copayment. The copayment for inpatient hospital and nursing home care is based on the Medicare deductible, while the copayment for outpatient care is equal to 20 percent of the average cost of an outpatient visit. The means test copayments apply to veterans with no service-connected disabilities who have incomes above the means test threshold\u2014$21,611 for a veteran with no dependents in 1997.", "Public Law 101-508, effective November 5, 1990, added additional cost-sharing requirements. First, it added per diem payments\u2014$5 a day for nursing home care and $10 a day for hospital care\u2014to the means test copayment. In addition, it created a new cost-sharing requirement for prescription drugs. All veterans\u2014other than those receiving treatment for a service-connected condition, those with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or higher, and those with incomes below the maximum VA pension level\u2014are required to pay $2 for each 30-day supply of an outpatient prescription.", "The VA law is silent about the relationship between insurance recoveries and veteran copayments, and VA\u2019s General Counsel provided guidance in 1990 on how the two recovery programs should interact. Specifically, the General Counsel opinion, as expanded through a 1996 reevaluation, provides that recoveries from Medicare supplemental insurance policies should be used first to satisfy veterans\u2019 means test payments, per diem payments, and prescription copayments; and for non-Medicare supplemental insurance, recoveries are to be divided in equal proportions between VA and the veteran; in other words, if the insurer pays 80 percent of allowable charges, then insurance proceeds will be used to pay 80 percent of the veteran\u2019s copayment after the veteran has satisfied any deductible imposed by the insurer.", "VA\u2019s interpretation of recovery provisions as they apply to supplemental insurance follows from an assessment that Medicare supplemental insurance is specifically intended to pay policyholders\u2019 deductibles and copayments and is purchased or provided expressly for that purpose. However, using funds insurers provide to VA to pay for veterans\u2019 financial obligation when these insurance policies have established deductibles and copayments to discourage unnecessary use of health services is harder to defend. One of the primary arguments insurers made against the enactment of the law authorizing VA recovery from private health insurance was the lack of VA cost-sharing provisions to discourage inappropriate use of health care services.", "VA argues that it should be treated by insurance companies the same way any private sector hospital is treated. But private sector hospitals do not give a portion of the payment they receive from a patient\u2019s health insurance to the patient. Although VA may not collect more than the cost of its services, insurers typically pay VA less than VA\u2019s billed charges because the insurers reduce the payment in accordance with their cost-sharing provisions. Only in instances in which the combined insurance recoveries and copayments would exceed the cost of VA services would VA be compelled to apply insurance recoveries toward veterans\u2019 copayments.", "The administrative burden of applying insurance recoveries toward veteran copayments, particularly for $2 prescription copayments, may be an issue as well. In 1994, VA estimated that it cost it $.38 for each $1 it collected under the pharmacy copayment program. With the added burden of offsetting insurance recoveries against prescription copayments, the administrative costs are likely to exceed recoveries for veterans with health insurance. This is because VA would typically be able to bill only $.40 of a $2 copayment after the offset."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although VA currently recovers less than a third of the amounts it bills to private health insurers, opportunities to recover more of its billed charges appear to be limited. The amounts that insurers deduct from their payments to VA generally reflect application of insurance policy provisions restricting payments for medically inappropriate care and setting policyholder cost-sharing requirements. In addition, some Medicare supplemental insurers contend that they have overpaid VA claims for years. They are reducing payments and seeking refunds for past overpayments.", "VA has set goals for its medical care cost recovery program that would require it to almost double recoveries from private health insurance over the next 5 years when VA\u2019s estimates of past overpayments are considered. Because there is little potential to increase recoveries through current billings, the success of VA\u2019s efforts depends largely on its ability to attract new users with private health insurance or improve its efforts to identify current users\u2019 insurance coverage.", "VA\u2019s ability to achieve its goals is uncertain considering the many factors likely to decrease future recoveries. Although VA has a number of initiatives planned and under way to address some of these factors and increase recoveries, it is not addressing other problems. For example, VA has not contacted state insurance commissions to obtain their help in removing exclusionary clauses in insurance policies that appear to preclude payment to VA; developed procedures to ensure that the time-consuming tasks associated with identifying, confirming, and returning overpayments are not performed at the expense of current billing activities; established mechanisms to provide its physicians with incentives to make appropriate use of VA hospitals; or developed adequate mechanisms for gathering complete and accurate information on veterans\u2019 health insurance policies.", "Now that the Congress has authorized VA to retain health insurance recoveries, VA needs to develop procedures to ensure that such authority does not detract from services available to low-income veterans and veterans with service-connected conditions who have no health insurance. Allowing VA to retain insurance recoveries creates strong financial incentives for VA facilities to place a higher priority on serving insured rather than uninsured veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Consideration by the Congress", "paragraphs": ["The statutes governing VA recoveries from private health insurance and veteran copayments do not clearly specify the relationship between the two provisions. In the absence of definitive guidance in the law, VA\u2019s General Counsel has determined that insurance recoveries should be used to offset veterans\u2019 copayment responsibilities. The effect of its interpretation is a reduction in overall cost recoveries, increased administrative expense, and reduced incentive for veterans to manage their use of health care services.", "The Congress may wish to consider clarifying the cost recovery provisions of title 38 of the U.S. Code to direct VA to collect means test copayments, per diem charges, and pharmacy copayments from patients regardless of any amounts recovered from private health insurance except in instances where the insurer pays the full cost of VA care.", "The identification of billable care provided to veterans with service-connected conditions is administratively cumbersome. Moreover, HIPAA prevents private health insurance from excluding payment for preexisting conditions for more than 12 months after the enrollment. The Congress may wish to take advantage of the provisions of HIPAA to authorize VA to recover the costs of service-connected treatments from private health insurance after the specified exclusionary period.", "A change in the statutory language in title 38 of the U.S. Code to authorize VA to recover from private health insurance its costs for providing treatment for service-connected conditions, consistent with the provisions of HIPAA, could, however, be viewed as shifting to the private sector the government\u2019s obligation to care for veterans disabled during or as a result of their military service. On the other hand, now that VA retains recoveries from third-party insurers, this change could generate significant additional revenues for improving health care services for veterans. Moreover, it could offset the incentives created by the Balanced Budget Act for VA facilities to target their services toward privately insured veterans with no service-connected conditions.", "Finally, VA\u2019s ability to increase recoveries is often hindered by incomplete and inaccurate information on veterans\u2019 employers, incomes, and insurance coverage. Veterans, however, have little direct or indirect incentive to cooperate with VA recovery efforts. The Congress may wish to consider giving VA the authority to disenroll veterans from the VA health care system who knowingly provide VA incomplete or inaccurate data about their incomes, employers, or insurance coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs do the following:", "Establish procedures to work with state insurance commissions to ensure that exclusionary clauses inconsistent with VA\u2019s recovery authority are removed from private health insurance policies.", "Work with the Director, OPM, to identify options for including VA facilities as preferred or participating providers under FEHBP plans, including HMOs and preferred provider plans.", "Design physician incentives to encourage appropriate use of hospital care.", "Such incentives should not, however, be so strong that they would result in denial of needed hospital care.

She said that VA believes adequate incentives have already been established through the new Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system and performance measures.", "Although the new allocation procedure and performance measures will give veterans integrated service networks and VA facilities greater incentives to provide appropriate care, we do not think that these initiatives will provide sufficient inducement for individual physicians to modify their practice patterns significantly. Existing efforts to reduce inappropriate inpatient care, such as VA\u2019s recently implemented utilization review program, constitute a solid first step to addressing VA\u2019s traditional reliance on institutional care. However, as indicated by the extent of the nonacute care that continues to be provided at the Martinsburg and Washington, D.C., facilities since the program\u2019s inception, this effort may not be sufficient to address physicians\u2019 lack of accountability for their treatment decisions. In our view, VA needs to develop incentives such as physician profiling or financial risk-sharing to encourage appropriate use of hospital care.", "The Acting Director emphasized that limited opportunities exist for VA to collect more of its billed charges and that the key to increased recoveries is improved identification of insurance coverage. He said that VA is pursuing a match with Medicare records that should help to identify private health insurance coverage of Medicare-eligible veterans.", "In a draft of the report, we recommended that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs work with the Director, OPM, to (1) determine the extent to which FEHBP plans overpaid VA for care provided to veterans who were covered by Medicare and the extent that overpayments should be refunded and (2) develop mutually beneficial changes in how FEHBP plans will reimburse VA for services provided to veterans covered by Medicare. In commenting on the report, VA officials indicated that they had relied on the Department of Justice to handle negotiations with OPM to discuss mutually beneficial changes. After follow-up discussions with OPM, we revised the report to indicate that FEHBP plans will pay VA facilities as secondary to Medicare for those veterans who are covered by Medicare, that this benefit change will occur prospectively, and that past payments will not be refunded.
