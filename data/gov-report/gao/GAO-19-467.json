We reported in 2014 that TTB\u2019s efforts to monitor and  enforce tax payments on large cigars became more complex after  CHIPRA as more manufacturers and importers determined their tax  liability based on the sale price per stick rather than simply paying the set  maximum tax. In addition, we reported that according to TTB officials  some large cigar manufacturers and importers began to restructure their  market transactions to lower the sale price for large cigars and obtain tax  savings based on a lower ad valorem rate. According to TTB officials,  some manufacturers and importers, for example, were \u201clayering\u201d sales  transactions by including an additional transaction at a low price before  the sale to the wholesaler or distributor and using this low initial price to  calculate the tax. According to TTB officials, such transactions are  conducted with an intermediary that may have a special contract  arrangement with the manufacturer or importer. The intermediary may  then add a large markup to the subsequent sale price to the wholesaler or  distributor. This added transaction effectively lowers the manufacturer\u2019s or  importer\u2019s sale price and thus reduces the taxes collected. TTB officials  stated that these types of transactions have continued since 2014, and  that taking enforcement actions to counter them is challenging and  resource intensive due to their complexity.

Nevertheless, combined annual sales of pipe tobacco and roll-your-own  tobacco generally have not decreased since the 2012 law was passed.", "Besides its lower federal excise tax, which creates financial incentives,  pipe tobacco has other advantages over roll-your-own tobacco that may  also contribute to its sustaining an overwhelming share of the combined  roll-your-own and pipe tobacco market. For example, according to the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA), pipe tobacco is not covered by the  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act restriction, such as the ban on  flavor additives, imposed on roll-your-own tobacco and cigarettes. Also,  according to FDA, pipe tobacco does not currently have the warning label  requirements that are imposed on roll-your-own tobacco and cigarettes.

In addition, we analyzed what is known about the effects on  federal revenue if Congress were to eliminate current tax disparities  between smoking tobacco products. We assumed that the pipe tobacco  federal excise tax was increased and equalized to the level of the roll- your-own tobacco tax as of October 1, 2018, and we calculated the  cumulative revenue differential for five fiscal years through September  2023. We assessed the reliability of the data for these objectives by  performing data checks for inconsistency errors and completeness and by  interviewing relevant officials. We determined that the data used in this  report were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "Our estimate of federal revenue losses resulting from differences in  federal excise tax rates among smoking tobacco products includes  combined tax revenue losses for the roll-your-own and pipe tobacco  markets as well as the small and large cigar markets. Our analysis takes  into account the expected fall in quantity demanded due to the price  increases resulting from the higher federal excise tax rates that CHIPRA  imposed on these smoking tobacco products, holding other variables  constant. To calculate the range of federal revenue losses, we included  high and low estimates based on assumptions about the effect of a price  increase on projected sales. Economic theory shows that when the price  of a product increases, the demand for the product will adjust downward,  decreasing at an estimated rate based on demand for the product, i.e.,  price elasticity. On the basis of our prior work estimating revenue losses  from tobacco taxes and a literature review, we determined that the price  elasticity for the smoking tobacco products ranges from -0.6 to -0.3,  respectively, for the low and high revenue estimates. Our projections also  take into account the historic sales trends for these products, the sales  trend of cigarettes after CHIPRA and the tax component of the price.", "We developed our revenue loss estimate by comparing the actual  tobacco tax revenues collected by TTB with a counterfactual scenario.  The counterfactual model draws from a model used by Dr. Frank  Chaloupka, an economist and a leading scholar who has investigated the  effect of prices and taxes on tobacco consumption in numerous  publications. In particular, we based our methodology on Dr. Chaloupka\u2019s  model calculating the effect of raising cigarette taxes in the State of  Illinois. This methodology projects the effect of a future tax increase based on the historic sales trend, the amount of the tax, and the price  elasticity of demand. Under this model, when a tax increase is enacted,  demand for the product is expected to decline based on the price  elasticity and the effect on prices. Following this initial decline, demand  for the product is expected to continue at the rate of its historic sales  trend. We updated this model by assuming that tobacco products that  incur a tax increase to match the tax rate on cigarettes will follow the  cigarette sales trend after CHIPRA rather than the product\u2019s historic  trend. For example, the roll-your-own tax rate increased under CHIPRA to  match the rate on cigarettes because it was viewed as a substitute for  cigarettes. Projecting the pre-CHIPRA sales trend forward based on  historical data could provide a misleading result as it includes the  additional consumption from substitution. Under our assumption, the pre- CHIPRA sales trend is adjusted downward based on the actual sales  trend for cigarettes, which has generally declined in recent years.", "The BLS price data used in our analysis are a subset of the data used for  calculating the Consumer Price Index for tobacco products. The BLS data  contain retail price information collected each month throughout the  United States. These price data only include excise taxes from federal,  state and local governments and exclude shipping, handling, sales tax,  and fuel surcharges. Because the BLS data are at the retail level, there is  an expected markup in addition to the charges mentioned above. To  simplify the model, we assumed that the markup remains constant after  CHIPRA was passed. We calculated an average price for the year before  CHIPRA was enacted, and we calculated the post-CHIPRA price by  adding the new tax to the pre-CHIPRA price. Therefore, we estimated  only the effect of CHIPRA on taxes.", "We calculated large cigar revenues and developed a revenue loss  estimate for large cigars using assumptions based on available data. As  discussed earlier in the report, small cigars are currently taxed at $50.33  per thousand sticks, while, large cigars are taxed at 52.75 percent of the  manufacturer\u2019s sale price, up to a cap of $402.60 per thousand sticks.  TTB collects revenue data for all cigars, but does not collect separate  revenue data for small and large cigars. We calculated large cigar revenues by subtracting small cigar revenue from total cigar revenue. We  calculated small cigar revenues by multiplying the number of sticks  reported to TTB in each month by the tax rate. After calculating large  cigar revenue, we estimated the average tax paid per cigar by dividing the  large cigar revenue by the number of sticks for each month and  calculating the average price. From March 2007 through March 2009, the  average large cigar tax collected was 4.2 cents per stick. CHIPRA raised  this cap from 4.9 cents to approximately 40 cents per stick. We calculated  that the average taxable price for large cigars before CHIPRA was 20.12  cents. Since the tax is based on the price rate, the percentage change in  price due to taxation is based on the percentage change of the price, plus  tax, before and after CHIPRA.", "To calculate the potential effect on federal tax revenue from raising the  tax rate for pipe tobacco to match the roll-your-own tax rate, we followed  the model discussed above, but we adjusted the pipe tobacco tax to the  roll-your-own rate of $24.78 per pound. The model assumes that taxes  would have been equalized as of October 1, 2018, and calculates the  cumulative revenue differential for 5 fiscal years through September  2023. The model takes into account the additional reduction in  consumption due to the tax increase and estimates potential revenue  differentials. A price elasticity of -0.8 is assumed to provide a  conservative scenario. Our model assumes that there are no other  smoking tobacco products that are close substitutes, an assumption we  also made in our previous models; the higher elasticity of -0.8 accounts  for a drop in consumption altogether. The magnitude is based on a  literature review and interviews with the Joint Committee on Taxation.  After the drop in demand due to the tax increase, demand is projected  linearly using the most recent 5-year historic trend. The projection of  actual sales is calculated by applying the same historic trend to the actual  sales of roll-your-own and pipe tobacco. Actual revenue is calculated by  multiplying the tax rate to the projected sales.", "An analysis projecting the impact of equal tax rates for small and large  cigars requires a different set of assumptions. The reliability of any such  model would be questionable, particularly for large cigars because the tax  rate on them is calculated as a percentage of the price. Compared with  determining the tax on all other tobacco products, according to TTB,  determining the tax on large cigars is extremely complex. We concluded  that modeling hypothetical consumption trends for smoking tobacco  products after equalizing tax rates on small and large cigars would require  a complex set of assumptions not sufficiently grounded in reliable data.  These assumptions include the price distribution of large cigars since  CHIPRA was enacted and assumptions about the proportion of the large  cigar market captured by imported large cigars if large cigars were taxed  similarly to small cigars.", "Rather than calculating a tax revenue estimate using assumptions not  grounded in reliable data, we present actual cigar revenue and show how  the large cigar market has changed from domestic cigars to cheaper  imported cigars over time. While it is possible to develop a tax  equalization model based only on applying a minimum tax rate per large  cigar of 5.03 cents per stick\u2014to ensure large cigars are not taxed below  the small cigar tax rate of 5.03 cents per stick\u2014this approach would not  produce a reliable estimate of the full revenue effect of legislative  proposals to equalize small and large cigar taxes. Applying only a  minimum tax would have the effect of underestimating the federal excise  tax collected from more expensive cigars because this would reduce the  revenue estimates on large cigars that are currently taxed at between  5.03 cents per stick and the maximum rate of 40 cents per stick. In  addition, the distribution of domestic large cigar sales that are taxed  below the small cigar tax rate is unknown because TTB data on domestic  large cigar sales are collected by manufacturers and reported monthly as  a quantity aggregate. Without incorporating this information on the  distribution of large cigars paying above and below the small cigar tax  rate of 5.03 cents per cigar, an estimate of the revenue effects of  equalizing small and large cigars would understate the potential revenue  that could have been collected from large cigars.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2018 to June 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
