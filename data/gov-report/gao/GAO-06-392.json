Specific benefits included independent testing and evaluation of products and accreditation of the performing laboratories, the discovery and correction of product flaws, and improvements to vendor development processes. However, process participants also face several challenges, including difficulty in matching agencies' needs with the availability of NIAP-evaluated products, vendors' lack of awareness regarding the evaluation process, and a lack of performance measures and difficulty in documenting the effectiveness of the NIAP evaluation process. Collectively, these challenges hinder the effective use of the NIAP evaluation process by vendors and agencies. Expanding the requirement of the NIAP evaluation process to non-national security systems is likely to yield similar benefits and challenges as those experienced by current process participants. For example, a current benefit--independent testing and evaluation of IT products--gives agencies confidence that validated features of a product will perform as claimed by the vendor. However, federal policy already allows agencies with non-national security systems to consider acquiring NIAP-evaluated products for those systems, and requiring that they do so may further exacerbate current resource constraints related to the evaluation and validation of products. In the absence of such a requirement, agencies seeking information assurance (measures that defend and protect information and information systems by ensuring their confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, availability, and utility) for their non-national security systems have other federal guidance and standards available to them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The sophistication and effectiveness of cybersecurity attacks have  advanced steadily over the past few years and have drastically changed the  way we think about protecting our information and information systems,  including national security systems.

The  program evaluates, through various evaluation assurance levels (see app.  II), commercial-off-the-shelf information assurance and information  assurance-enabled products for the federal government. These products  can be items of hardware, software, or firmware. As part of the evaluation,  agencies can specify a degree of confidence desired in a product through  protection profiles.

It also reviews  the results of the security evaluations performed by the laboratories and  issues a validation report, which summarizes and provides independent  validation of the results. A product is considered NIAP-certified only after  it is both evaluated by an accredited laboratory and validated by the  validation body. Upon successful completion of these requirements, the  validation body issues a Common Criteria certificate for the evaluated  product. All evaluated products that receive a NIAP Common Criteria  certificate appear on a validated products list available on NIAP\u2019s Web site.

Accreditation is granted to  laboratories following their successful completion of a process that  includes an application submission and fee payment by the laboratory, an  on-site assessment, participation in proficiency testing, resolution of any  deficiencies identified during the process, and a technical evaluation. The  issuance of a certificate formally signifies that a laboratory has  demonstrated that it meets all NVLAP requirements and operates in  accordance with management and the technical requirements of the  relevant standards.

While the Deputy Assistant Secretary agreed with our recommendation to  develop awareness training workshops for NIAP program participants, she  stated that the NIAP must also live with the realities of the challenges that  we identified in our report. The Deputy Assistant Secretary noted that, as  our report highlights, the NIAP program is facing considerable challenges  with resources and funding to sustain the current day-to-day running of the  program and that it is not feasible for the NIAP office to increase its current  efforts in developing and hosting the recommended training and education.  Nonetheless, she also noted that the Secretary of Defense should direct the  Director of the National Security Agency, in coordination with the NIST  under the provisions of the NIAP, to coordinate with the vendors,  laboratories, and various industry associations that have knowledge of the  evaluation process to develop awareness training workshops for program  participants within the current constraints and to work with the  commercial laboratories, vendors, and others to identify ways that  organizations outside of NIAP can further this initiative. We agree that  NIAP should continue its efforts in awareness and education training, and  endorse increasing such efforts as resources permit.", "The Deputy Assistant Secretary agreed with our recommendation to  collect, analyze, and report metrics on the effectiveness of NIAP tests and  evaluations, and stated that the NIAP has already started researching ways  to institute metrics to help determine the effectiveness of the evaluation  program. She noted that the goal of collecting metrics is to demonstrate to  the NIAP constituency that NIAP evaluations do provide value by  improving the security of the evaluated products and by providing the end  customer with assurance that these products perform their security  functions as intended even when faced with adverse conditions.", "The Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security also  provided technical comments, which we considered and addressed in our  report, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Departments of Commerce  (National Institute of Standards and Technology), Defense, and Homeland  Security; the Office of Management and Budget; the General Services  Administration, and to other interested parties.

We also reviewed relevant federal policies  relating to information security issues. To gain insight into the NIAP  evaluation process, we met with software vendors and certification  laboratories to discuss their experiences with NIAP, their applicable  processes, and reviewed their relevant documentation. We selected  vendors based on broad or distinguishing product capabilities  demonstrating a range of features, brand recognition based on high ratings  received in reviews conducted by information security magazines, and  vendors mentioned more frequently in various discussions with industry  experts and in information security literature. Vendors selected  represented different information technology (IT) market sectors, are  considered leaders in their field, and varied in size.", "To determine the industrywide perspective on NIAP, we met with two IT  industry groups: The Information Technology Association of America and  Cyber Security Industry Alliance. We selected these industry groups  because they represent a cross-section of the IT industry as a whole. To  gain insight into the program\u2019s functions and usefulness to agencies, we  spoke with government officials from the Department of Commerce  (specifically the National Institute of Standards and Technology),  Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, General  Services Administration, and the Office of Management and Budget. We  also surveyed officials from the 24 federal agencies designated under the  Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 to determine their current use of NIAP- evaluated products, the perceived usefulness of the program, and the  benefits and challenges associated with acquiring and using NIAP- evaluated products.", "For each agency survey, we identified the office of the chief information  officer, notified them of our work, and distributed the survey instrument to  each via an e-mail attachment. In addition, we discussed the purpose and  content of the survey instrument with agency officials when requested. All  24 agencies responded to our survey. We did not verify the accuracy of the  agencies\u2019 responses; however, we reviewed supporting documentation that  agencies provided to validate their responses. We contacted agency  officials when necessary for follow-up information. We then analyzed the  agencies\u2019 responses.", "Although this was not a sample survey, and, therefore, there were no  sampling errors, conducting any survey may introduce other kinds of  errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted,  in the sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how  the data are entered into a database (or were analyzed) can introduce  unwanted variability into the survey results.", "We took steps in the development of the survey instrument, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize these survey-related errors.  For example, we developed the questionnaire in two stages. First, we had a  survey specialist design the survey instrument in collaboration with  subject-matter experts. Then, we pretested the instrument at two federal  departments and internally at GAO to ensure that questions were relevant,  clearly stated, and easy to answer.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., from May 2005 through  February 2006, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Jenniffer Wilson (Assistant  Director), Neil Doherty, Jennifer Franks, Joel Grossman, Matthew Grote,  Min Hyun, Anjalique Lawrence, J.
