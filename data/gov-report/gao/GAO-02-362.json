Nasdaq--the market run by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD)--has been in competition with NASD members that run electronic communications networks. For years, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has faced competition from members that trade NYSE-listed securities off of the exchange. Greater competition has generated concern that an SRO might abuse its regulatory authority--for example, by imposing rules or disciplinary actions that are unfair to the competitors it regulates. Some broker-dealers subject to the jurisdiction of multiple SROs also are concerned that differences among SRO rules and rule interpretations have caused inefficiencies in the use of broker-dealers' compliance resources. No formal process exists, however, for addressing rule differences that might cause material inefficiencies in the regulatory process. The law does not require SRO rules to be the same, and many differences exist for legitimate business reasons according to regulators. Broker-dealers with multiple SRO memberships said that examinations by multiple SROs were unnecessarily burdensome. Securities market participants have discussed alternatives that would address concerns about conflicts of interest and inefficiencies in the current self-regulatory structure.

Additionally, broker-dealers that are members of the two largest SROs, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), have continued to raise questions about the efficiency of SROs\u2019 rules and examinations.", "Focusing on the issues market participants have identified, this report describes how the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), NASD, and NYSE have been addressing concerns about (1) the impact of increased competition, including demutualization, on the ability of SROs to effectively regulate members with which they compete and (2) possible regulatory inefficiencies associated with broker-dealer membership in multiple SROs. In addition, the report describes alternative approaches that some securities market participants have discussed as a means of addressing concerns about the current self-regulatory structure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal regulatory structure of the U.S. securities markets was established by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Congress also created SEC as an independent agency to oversee the securities markets and their participants. Under the Exchange Act, the U.S. securities markets are subject to a combination of industry self- regulation (with SEC oversight) and direct SEC regulation. This regulatory scheme was intended to give SROs responsibility for administering their ordinary affairs, including most of the daily oversight of the securities markets and broker-dealers.", "The Exchange Act provides for different types of SROs, including national securities exchanges and national securities associations. Entities operating as national securities exchanges or associations are required to register as such with SEC. As of March 31, 2002, nine securities exchanges were registered with SEC as national securities exchanges. As of the same date, NASD was the only registered national securities association; NASD Regulation (NASDR) is its regulatory arm. Although it is the SRO, NASD delegates to NASDR, its wholly owned subsidiary, SRO responsibilities for surveilling trading on Nasdaq and the over-the-counter market and for enforcing compliance by its members (and persons associated with its members) with applicable laws and rules. Nasdaq also surveils trading on its market and refers potential violations to NASDR and SEC for investigation. While NASD is currently the parent company of Nasdaq, NASD is in the process of selling Nasdaq.", "Recognizing the inherent conflicts of interest that exist when SROs are both market operators and regulators, the Exchange Act states that to be registered as a national securities exchange or association, SEC must determine that the exchange\u2019s or association\u2019s rules do not impose any burden on competition and do not permit any unfair discrimination. SROs are also responsible for enforcing members\u2019 compliance with their rules and with federal securities laws by conducting surveillance of trading in their markets and examining the operations of member broker-dealers.", "The Exchange Act also mandates that securities SROs operate under direct SEC oversight and authorizes SEC to ensure that SROs do not abuse their regulatory powers. SEC inspects SROs to ensure that they are fulfilling their SRO duties, focusing on, among other things, the quality of SRO financial operations examination programs; market surveillance, investigations, and disciplinary programs; and customer complaint review programs. SEC also reviews rule changes proposed by SROs for consistency with the Exchange Act and SEC rules. Finally, SEC provides direct regulation of the markets and their participants in a number of ways, including direct examinations of broker-dealers, investigations into markets and their participants, disciplinary actions for violations of the Exchange Act, and promulgation of rules and regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Competition Has Heightened Some Market Participants\u2019 Concerns about Conflicts of Interest", "paragraphs": ["Nasdaq increasingly has been in competition with NASD members that operate as ECNs, while NYSE has competed for many years with members that trade its listed securities off of the exchange. This competition has heightened some SRO members\u2019 concerns that an SRO could abuse its regulatory authority through rule-making processes, disciplinary actions, or use of proprietary information. Market participants expect that demutualization will increase the ability of exchanges and other markets to compete both domestically and internationally, however, their views differ on how it might affect potential abuses of regulatory authority related to conflicts of interest. SEC generally concluded that it is too soon to predict the effects of demutualization.

SEC regulations require ECNs, as registered broker-dealers, to be members of at least one SRO. According to an ECN official, the ECNs chose NASD as their primary SRO because the unique trading rules as well as other features of the Nasdaq market were conducive to the growth of the ECNs\u2019 business.", "ECNs are an alternative to the Nasdaq market for trading in Nasdaq stocks. They differ from Nasdaq and registered exchanges principally in that they do not require an intermediary to execute orders. ECNs match orders electronically and anonymously, while Nasdaq broker-dealers, in their roles as market makers, act as intermediaries for all customer orders. In deciding whether to use an ECN or a Nasdaq market maker, customers consider such factors as execution quality, transaction costs, and anonymity.", "The number of ECNs and their share of total Nasdaq volume have grown significantly since 1993. According to SEC, in 1993 all alternative trading systems (including one ECN) accounted for about 13 percent of the total volume in Nasdaq securities. By October 2001, ECNs alone accounted for over 30 percent of the total volume in Nasdaq securities.", "SEC and certain ECNs have attributed a significant part of the growth in the volume of Nasdaq securities traded on ECNs to the SEC order- handling rules that SEC promulgated to enhance competition and pricing efficiency in the securities markets. Before the rules became effective in 1997, only ECN subscribers had access to the orders and, thus, to the prices that ECNs displayed for Nasdaq securities. Implementation of the rules resulted in ECNs\u2019 orders for Nasdaq securities being displayed and accessible to the public on Nasdaq, thereby providing the public an opportunity to obtain any better prices that might be available on ECNs.According to one ECN, both Nasdaq\u2019s access to ECNs and the efficiencies that ECNs brought to the Nasdaq market through the electronic matching of orders have contributed to the overall growth of trading in Nasdaq securities.", "NYSE, as an SRO that operates a market, has also confronted conflicts of interest between its economic interests and its regulatory responsibilities. Specifically, for many years the exchange has regulated competing member broker-dealers that trade its listed stocks off of the exchange.", "Customer orders for NYSE stocks that are not sent to the floor of the exchange to be executed are executed internally by a broker-dealer or in an alternative market. A broker-dealer internalizes an order when it executes a customer order for a security in house or directs the order to an affiliated dealer, instead of sending the order to an exchange or another market. Numerous large broker-dealers that are NYSE members have also established relationships with regional exchange specialists and sometimes route their orders to them instead of to NYSE. In addition, member broker-dealers direct orders to alternative markets, such as ECNs or third-market broker-dealers. Competition with member broker-dealers may increase with the May 2000 rescission of NYSE Rule 390, which had restricted off-exchange trading by NYSE members in NYSE-listed securities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competition and Demutualizaton Raise Concerns Among Some Market Participants about Regulatory Abuses", "paragraphs": ["Some SRO members expressed concern that increased competition between SROs and their members had given SROs a greater incentive to abuse their regulatory authority. These members were concerned that SROs could adopt rules that unfairly impede the ability of members to compete against the SROs\u2014for example, by adopting rules that give preference to noncompetitors\u2019 orders. An official from one broker-dealer also noted that an SRO might sanction a competing member more severely than other members by, for instance, inappropriately concluding that the member had failed to satisfy its best-execution obligation when it routed an order to a competing market for execution rather than to the SRO. ECNs have also expressed concern that an SRO, in its regulatory capacity, could obtain proprietary information from a member and, in its capacity as a market operator, inappropriately use the information. For example, an SRO might obtain proprietary information about its members\u2019 customers and then use that information to market its services to the customers.", "Some institutional market users that were not SRO members were more broadly concerned about how conflicts of interest in the self-regulatory structure affected the fairness and efficiency of the securities markets.", "These market users asserted that the self-regulatory structure was inherently biased in favor of broker-dealers that were SRO members and owners and that SROs interpreted their rules to favor these broker-dealers. These market users, as well as some broker-dealers, told us that they did not believe that their concerns were addressed when these concerns diverged from the interests of the most powerful broker-dealers at the exchange. Market users also said that the current self-regulatory structure ultimately impeded market-driven innovations that could improve competition and benefit the investing public. One investment company official cited NYSE Rule 390, which had been in place for 20 years, as a classic example of the difficulty of repealing an anticompetitive SRO rule.", "Demutualization has heightened the concerns of some SRO members about the potential for abuses of regulatory authority. They expressed concern that a demutualized, for-profit market operator might be more likely to misuse its regulatory authority or be less diligent in fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities in a desire to increase profits. For example, demutualized SROs might have a greater incentive to propose rules that unfairly disadvantage members or other markets or inappropriately sanction or otherwise discipline members against which the SROs compete. Other SRO members expressed concern that demutualized market operators might have a greater incentive to either insufficiently fund or otherwise inadequately fulfill their self-regulatory responsibilities.", "However, other market participants believed demutualization could reduce at least some conflicts and lead to needed changes in market structure. Market users such as mutual funds asserted that by diversifying market ownership through the sale of stock, and thus reducing the influence of broker-dealers, demutualization could reduce the conflicts of interest inherent in a self-regulatory structure based on member-owned markets that regulate themselves. According to these market users, diversifying the exchange ownership base could shift management\u2019s focus from the narrow interests of intermediaries to the broader interests of all market participants, potentially benefiting the investing public.", "According to NYSE officials, demutualization and for-profit status raise no new issues for the exchange. NYSE could demutualize or its members could become its shareholders without any change in the incentives that currently motivate exchange actions. That is, demutualization does not introduce any new conflicts of interest issues. NYSE\u2019s chairman noted that the exchange would continue to have a strong economic incentive to preserve its reputation as a well-regulated entity, regardless of its organizational structure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demutualization Is Expected to Enhance Competitiveness, but Its Effects on Conflicts of Interest Are Not Yet Known", "paragraphs": ["Demutualization is expected to enhance the ability of markets to compete by enabling them to raise capital in the securities markets to fund business efforts and by better aligning the economic interests of markets and their owners. Under current member-owned structures, actions markets might otherwise take to enhance their competitiveness might be rejected or adopted very slowly by member-owners that do not perceive a direct benefit from them. For example, member-owners (that is, broker-dealers) that derive income from acting as intermediaries in the trade execution process might be reluctant to support the introduction of technology if it reduces their income from acting as intermediaries. In contrast, shareholders of a demutualized exchange would be expected to support cost-effective technology that improves customer service and thus the competitiveness of the market, because they would expect it to increase the value of their investments by attracting more business to the exchange. To improve their competitiveness, Nasdaq and the Pacific Exchange, as well as several U.S. futures and foreign exchanges, have demutualized or are in the process of doing so. In 1999, NYSE also announced plans to demutualize but subsequently postponed its plans indefinitely.", "An SEC economist said that the effects of demutualization could not be predicted, as they depended on a balance between the competing incentives of maximizing profits and providing effective regulation. The balance between these incentives would differ depending on who owned and controlled the market. Also, as under the current ownership structure, the incentive to reduce regulatory costs would be balanced against the risk that any resulting reduction in regulation might harm the public\u2019s confidence in the integrity of the market. A loss of public confidence could ultimately reduce profitability if, for example, investors moved their transactions to other markets.", "SEC officials further explained that both for-profit and not-for-profit SROs face inherent conflicts of interest, but noted that demutualization has the potential to heighten or create variations of existing conflicts of interest. SEC officials stated, for example, that while all SROs face pressure to minimize the costs of fulfilling their regulatory obligations, for-profit entities could be more aggressive in promoting their commercial interests, such as by using regulatory fees to finance nonregulatory functions. SEC officials emphasized, however, that because conflicts of interest already exist within the not-for-profit structure, demutualization does not necessarily require a wholesale change in regulatory approach. They noted that the Exchange Act has significant safeguards to address conflicts of interest and abuses of regulatory power. Finally, in commenting on the growing trend among SROs to contract out certain regulatory services, SEC officials stressed that SROs are still legally responsible for fulfilling self-regulatory obligations that are contracted out."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Measures Exist to Address Conflicts of Interest", "paragraphs": ["NASD has attempted to address concerns about conflicts of interest by reorganizing its regulatory operations and is in the process of selling its market operations.

Beginning in March 2000, NASD began implementing plans to sell Nasdaq to NASD members and other investors in order to limit the common ownership of Nasdaq and NASDR. In November 2000, Nasdaq filed an application with SEC to register as a national securities exchange. The planned restructuring will separate NASD and NASDR from Nasdaq and, in NASD\u2019s view, minimize any issues related to conflicts of interest, including those related to demutualization.Under the restructuring, ECNs and other broker-dealers doing business with the public (holding customer accounts) will remain NASD members. They will continue to be regulated by NASD but will no longer be competing against an NASD-operated market. According to NASD, the restructuring will be substantially complete with the sale of NASD\u2019s remaining Nasdaq common stock, which is expected to occur by June 2002. However, NASD will retain an interest in Nasdaq after this date.", "According to one ECN, the planned spin-off of Nasdaq will not fully solve the conflict of interest problem because, not only will NASD retain an interest in Nasdaq, but Nasdaq will still be NASDR\u2019s biggest customer for its regulatory services. As such, NASDR could face a conflict between its ethical responsibility as a regulatory services provider and the economic incentive to, among other things, retain its largest revenue source. Accordingly, competitors might be concerned that NASDR will perform its regulatory services in a way that gives Nasdaq a competitive advantage.Also, because Nasdaq has applied to become an SRO as part of NASD\u2019s plan to demutualize Nasdaq, the restructuring will not address conflicts of interest related to market-specific regulation by the new SRO. That is, as an SRO, Nasdaq will have regulatory authority over members that operate or use competing markets.", "In addition to adopting a structure designed to minimize conflicts between regulation and competition, NASD\u2019s self-regulatory functions are subject to its internal controls and the oversight of SEC and the NASD and NASDR boards of directors. The boards of directors, which include public members, are intended to provide additional assurance against abuses of regulatory authority. The NASD board, to which the Nasdaq board will continue reporting until the spin-off is complete, and the NASDR board both have a majority of public members, while the Nasdaq board has an equal number of public and industry members. The boards also receive advice from various standing advisory committees. In addition, all NASD employees are required to sign a statement attesting that they will not share confidential information with any unauthorized person, inside or outside of the organization.", "NASD officials described other internal procedures that should minimize abuses of regulatory authority. According to NASD officials, NASD generally solicits comments from its membership and the public on regulatory rule proposals, and its board takes those comments into account before NASD files these proposals with SEC. In its disciplinary process, case initiation is governed by internal procedures that require approval from a staff body independent of NASDR enforcement and market regulation staff.

Section 19(b)(1) of the Exchange Act requires SROs to file copies of proposals for new rules and amendments to existing rules with SEC. Once a proposal is filed, SEC is required to publish notice of the proposal and provide an opportunity for public comment. SEC is also required, among other things, to consider the competitive effects of the rule. According to SEC, its rule reviews address the concerns of some SRO members that an SRO could abuse its authority by adopting rules that unfairly impede the ability of members to compete against the SRO. SEC officials noted, for example, that while an SRO could propose an anticompetitive or discriminatory rule, SEC would not approve it.", "According to officials of one ECN, SEC\u2019s review of SRO rules, including the public comment process, has been one of the most effective ways for ECNs to have their concerns addressed. In particular, they said that SEC has addressed comments ECNs have submitted in response to SRO rule proposals. For example, ECNs expressed concerns about the anticompetitiveness of NASD\u2019s SuperMontage proposal, and NASD, at SEC\u2019s direction, modified the rule numerous times in an attempt to address ECN concerns. More recently, another ECN expressed concern to SEC about the competitive effects of a proposed rule that would allow Nasdaq to charge higher transaction fees to members that report less than 95 percent of their trades through Nasdaq but use Nasdaq\u2019s quotation system or make limited use of its execution systems. The ECN was concerned, among other things, that the rule was filed under section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act, under which such rules are effective on filing. Following discussions with SEC, NASD refiled the rule proposal under section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act pursuant to which it would be subject to the public comment process and SEC approval before becoming effective. According to SEC officials, SROs have withdrawn rule proposals after SEC expressed concern that the proposals might be anticompetitive.", "Some market participants, although agreeing that SEC\u2019s public comment process provides a mechanism for addressing concerns about potentially anticompetitive activity by an SRO, also said that SEC lacks the resources, tools, and expertise to identify and adequately respond to all instances of anticompetitive activity by an SRO toward member competitors. According to one ECN, an SRO committed to a course of anticompetitive activity through a variety of rulemaking and rule enforcement activities may be able to achieve success, particularly in the short term, using section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act. This ECN was concerned about the ability of an SRO to potentially obtain a significant long-term competitive advantage over its member competitors through such activities, given the quickly evolving and highly competitive nature of the securities industry.", "To ensure that SROs actions are not discriminatory or otherwise anticompetitive, SEC also reviews SROs\u2019 disciplinary actions during inspections. According to SEC, these reviews address the concerns of some SRO members that an SRO could abuse its regulatory authority by sanctioning a competing member inappropriately or more severely than a noncompeting member. The Exchange Act requires SROs, in administering their affairs, to provide fair representation for members. According to SEC, the fair application of SROs\u2019 authority to adjudicate disciplinary actions, including meting out fines and suspensions, may be particularly important, because these actions can have significant ramifications for broker-dealers. The Exchange Act provides SEC with a check on SRO disciplinary actions that are discriminatory or otherwise anticompetitive, requiring SROs that impose final disciplinary sanctions on members to also file notice with SEC. Such actions are subject to SEC\u2019s review after appropriate notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Upon appeal, SEC must determine whether the action is consistent with the Exchange Act, SEC rules, and SRO rules and then either affirm, modify, set aside, or remand the action to the SRO for further proceedings.", "SEC uses additional approaches to addressing industry concerns, such as concept releases, special committees, and public hearings. For example, SEC published a concept release in December 1999 to obtain views on the fairness and reasonableness of fees charged for market information and on the role of revenues derived from such fees in funding SROs. In commenting on the release, some SRO members questioned the fairness of funding SROs, which are competitors for customer order flow, with revenues from the sale of market information. Because of the diversity of comments received and concerns raised by the concept release, SEC created an advisory committee on market information in August 2000 to provide the agency further guidance.

They said that SROs are entitled to set whatever rules they determine are appropriate for their markets as long as the rules comply with the Exchange Act. SEC officials stressed that the agency would not impede one SRO from establishing higher standards than another, noting that many of the differing rules exist for legitimate business reasons and reflect differences in business models among markets.

SROs may also conduct cause or special purpose examinations as necessary to address specific problems or industry concerns.", "In 1976, SEC adopted rule 17d-1, under which it designates a single SRO as the DEA responsible for financial compliance examinations of individual broker-dealers that are members of multiple SROs. This rule was adopted pursuant to the Securities Act Amendments of 1975, which authorizes SEC to adopt rules to relieve SROs of the duplicative responsibility of examining their members for compliance with the Exchange Act, its rules, and SRO rules when the broker-dealer is a member of more than one SRO. However, because Rule 17d-1 relates only to financial compliance examinations, the common members of NASD and NYSE remained subject to sales practice examinations by both NASDR and NYSE.", "According to SEC officials, the agency selects the DEA for common members based on the market the broker-dealer uses to execute a preponderance of its customer orders or the market in which the broker- dealer has the most memberships. As of March 31, 2002, according to NYSE officials, NYSE was the DEA for about 250 broker-dealers that were also members of and subject to examination by NASD. According to NYSE, these firms represented approximately 90 percent of customer assets in the securities industry.", "Also in 1976, SEC adopted Rule 17d-2, which permitted SROs to establish joint plans for allocating certain regulatory responsibilities that involved their common members. Under the rule, which was also adopted as a result of the Securities Act Amendments of 1975, all plans must be filed with SEC for approval. SEC was to approve plans that, among other things, fostered cooperation and coordination among SROs. For example, SEC approved a plan in 1983 under which the American Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, NASD, NYSE, the Pacific Exchange, and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange periodically rotate among themselves responsibility for options-related sales practice examinations for their common members. SEC approved other plans in the 1970s and 1980s, under which the American Stock Exchange and the regional exchanges deferred certain regulatory responsibilities of their common members to the DEA (either to NASD or NYSE).", "Concurrent with proposed legislation and related hearings, SEC, four SROs, and the state securities regulators entered an MOU in November 1995 to coordinate broker-dealer examinations. The MOU provided for the SROs and states (through the North American Securities Administrators Association) to meet requests from broker-dealers to coordinate specified on-site regulatory examinations. In responding to these requests, SROs were to share information and devise ways to avoid duplication. To the extent practicable, sales practice examinations conducted by the DEA and any other SROs were to be conducted simultaneously with the DEA\u2019s financial and operational examination. Cause examinations that resulted from customer complaints or other matters were not subject to the MOU, nor were the examinations that SEC conducted to evaluate the quality of SRO oversight. However, the MOU encouraged coordination and cooperation for all examinations to the extent possible.", "An SEC official told us that the agency closely monitors and assesses SRO examination coordination. According to SEC and SRO officials, representatives of SEC, all SROs, and the states attend annual summits to discuss examination coordination, review examination results from the prior year, and develop plans for coordinating examinations for the coming year. In addition, regional SEC staff and SRO compliance staff are to meet quarterly to discuss and plan examination coordination, and SRO examiners are to meet monthly to plan specific examinations of common members. At these latter meetings, examiners are expected to, among other things, collaborate on fieldwork dates, document requests, and broker-dealer entrance and closeout meetings. SROs also are to share their prior examination reports before beginning fieldwork.", "Under the 1995 MOU, SEC agreed to maintain a computerized database to monitor examination coordination. SEC developed the criteria for coordinated examinations under the MOU as well as a database to track the number of broker-dealers that requested and received coordinated examinations. Under SEC criteria, examinations are coordinated when the SROs have at least 1 day of concurrent fieldwork at the targeted broker- dealer. An SEC official told us, however, that concurrent fieldwork was only one measure of coordination and did not completely reflect the quality of coordination. However, using this measure, SEC calculated that from 1997 through 2000 an average of 90 percent of those requesting coordinated examinations received them and that in 2000 96 percent of requestors received coordinated examinations. According to SEC officials, requests for coordinated examinations could not be honored because other scheduled examinations took longer than expected or because examiners had been reassigned to previously unscheduled cause examinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Broker-Dealers Have Remained Concerned about Multiple Examinations", "paragraphs": ["SEC\u2019s most recent efforts to address concerns about multiple examinations have focused on improving examination coordination. In a June 1998 report, SIA concluded that, although SEC and the SROs had made considerable progress toward improving examination coordination for broker-dealers with multiple SRO memberships, more work remained to be done to reduce duplication of efforts. In discussions with us, some broker-dealers expressed continued dissatisfaction with inefficiencies associated with multiple examinations. For example, although examinations could take a few weeks, according to some broker-dealers, when all examination steps (including both pre- and post-examination) were taken into account, firms could be subject to some part of the examination process continuously throughout the year, even with coordination. Because of the anecdotal nature of the information provided, we could not determine the extent to which multiple examinations caused inefficiencies or the extent to which efforts to address inefficiencies through improved coordination were successful.", "SRO data show that broker-dealers\u2019 participation in the coordinated examination program has been declining. For example, the total number of NYSE and NASD member firms participating in the program declined from about 63 percent in 1998 to about 54 percent in 2000. According to SEC officials, these numbers do not necessarily indicate problems with the coordinated examination program, since broker-dealers opt in or out of the program for many reasons. SEC officials told us that some broker- dealers that have tried the coordinated examination program have concluded that it is more efficient for them to have two separate examinations. They said that an average of five broker-dealers participating in the coordinated examination program leave the program each year, typically because they lacked the space to accommodate the larger teams that accompany concurrent examinations or otherwise found the examinations to be disruptive to their operations. For example, some broker-dealers have concluded that it is not efficient for them to have staff with expertise in different areas of the firm\u2019s operations (such as sales practices and finance) available to interact with examiners at the same time.", "SEC officials told us that they were aware of broker-dealers\u2019 concerns about examination coordination and that these concerns had been addressed on a case-by-case basis. SEC officials stated that they often sought informal feedback from individual broker-dealers and industry trade groups and would continue to urge broker-dealers to discuss examinations and the examination process with SEC and SRO staff. SEC officials also said that in mid-2001, the agency began a pilot program to coordinate the examinations of one large broker-dealer. The pilot includes SEC, NYSE, NASDR, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and a number of state regulators. SEC expects the program to help determine whether the agency can enhance information sharing among regulators and alleviate any burdens associated with broker-dealers being examined by multiple regulators."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Market Participants Have Discussed Alternative Approaches to Self- Regulation", "paragraphs": ["Securities market participants have discussed alternative approaches to self-regulation that would address, at least in part, concerns about the current self-regulatory structure.

One alternative would expand the DEA program beyond financial compliance to cover sales practices. An alternative some ECNs have discussed for addressing their concerns involves registering as exchanges and becoming SROs. Also, the broader securities industry has discussed alternatives that would more dramatically change or replace the current self-regulatory structure. These alternatives were detailed in an SIA report published in January 2000 and included consolidating responsibility for broker-dealer self-regulation and cross-market issues in a single entity not affiliated with any market (hybrid SRO model), consolidating all self-regulation\u2014market-specific and broker-dealer\u2014in a single entity (single SRO model), or having SEC assume all the regulatory functions currently performed by SROs (SEC-only model).

SEC noted that members could initiate improvements through their SROs, express opposition to a proposed course of action directly to the SRO, or voice their concerns to SEC.

In related congressional hearings, the then SEC chairman testified that, while SROs currently monitor trading activities in their own markets, the provision would seem to require that DEAs also monitor trading in other SROs\u2019 markets, which could be costly and significantly less effective than the current system. The chairman also pointed out that while an SRO has considerable incentive to enforce its own rules, its incentive to enforce the rules of other SROs might not be as strong. He stated that requiring an SRO to enforce the rules of another SRO would be inconsistent with section 19(g) of the Exchange Act, under which each SRO is to enforce compliance with its own rules.", "Some market participants have also discussed a proposal that would allow broker-dealers, rather than SEC, to select their DEAs. NASD officials were concerned that this proposal could threaten NASD\u2019s ability to provide affordable regulatory services to small firms. NASD officials said that, under this proposal, the large broker-dealers might select NYSE as their DEA, while the small ones might select NASD. NASD would then lose the revenue from large broker-dealers that currently subsidizes the cost of regulatory services for smaller broker-dealers. For example, according to NASD officials, the smallest NASD member pays $600 in annual fees, but the average examination for such a broker-dealer costs from $7,000 to $10,000.

According to SIA, potential conflicts of interest would be reduced because the new SRO would not be affiliated with a competing market. Eliminating duplicative SRO examinations would reduce inefficiencies in areas such as rulemaking, examinations, and staffing. SEC officials agreed that consolidating member regulation into one SRO was an advantage of the hybrid SRO model. They noted that the industry was moving toward a hybrid model as Nasdaq separated from NASD and NASD contracted to provide regulatory services to more SROs. Although NASD officials told us that they did not have an official position on the hybrid SRO model, NASD has supported the concept of separating market-specific and member regulation in the past.

He noted that funding a separate regulatory body independent of the exchange would eliminate economic efficiencies and synergies that result from the integration of regulation into the NYSE market as a whole. NYSE officials told us that because the hybrid model separates member from market-specific regulation, the hybrid regulator\u2019s examinations would not review the operations of the entire broker-dealer and thus would be less effective than examinations conducted under the current regulatory approach. NYSE officials also said that the exchange had postponed its plan to demutualize for several reasons, including concern that such action might have had the negative consequence of forcing NYSE to separate its regulatory and market functions.

According to SIA, the single SRO model could eliminate the conflicts of interest and regulatory inefficiencies associated with multiple SROs, including those that would remain under the hybrid SRO model.

That is, Nasdaq, NYSE, and other markets have different rules that reflect their different ways of executing trades.

For example, differences in rules and their interpretations have been used to justify the need for multiple examinations. As a result, the success of efforts to address concerns about multiple examinations could be related to how concerns about differences in rules are addressed. To improve its understanding of broker-dealers\u2019 concerns, SEC could work with NASD, NYSE, and other market participants to identify and address differences in rules that might cause material inefficiencies in the regulatory process. SEC could also work with these market participants and through its ongoing pilot program to better assess whether further improvements in examination coordination could address the most significant problems associated with multiple examinations of broker-dealers. As part of these efforts, SEC could instruct the SROs to provide the agency with formal assessments of broker-dealers\u2019 satisfaction with the coordinated examination program, including determining why some broker-dealers choose not to participate and why others terminate their participation, and of market participants\u2019 specific concerns about rules.
