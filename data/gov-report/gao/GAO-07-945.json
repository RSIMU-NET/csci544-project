For 2001 through 2005, the submissions were called Adjusted Community Rate (ACR) Proposals. The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 requires CMS to annually audit the financial records supporting the submissions of at least one-third of participating organizations. BBA also requires that GAO monitor the audits. In this report, GAO examined (1) whether CMS met the one-third requirement for 2001 through 2006, (2) what information the ACR audits provided and how CMS used it, and (3) what information the bid audits provided and how CMS used it."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS did not document its process to determine whether it met the requirement for auditing ACRs for one-third of the participating Medicare Advantage organizations for contract years 2001-2005. CMS is planning to conduct other financial reviews of organizations to meet the audit requirement for contract year 2006, but by the end of our fieldwork in June 2007, CMS had not finalized its plans. Further, CMS does not plan to complete the financial reviews until almost 3 years after the bid submission date each contract year. This will affect its ability to address deficiencies in a timely manner. CMS did not consistently ensure that the audit process for contract years 2001-2005 provided information to assess the impact on beneficiaries. After contract year 2003 audits were completed, CMS took steps to determine such impact and identified about $34 million from those audits that beneficiaries could have received in additional benefits. However, in late May 2007, CMS officials told us they were planning to close out the audits without pursuing financial recoveries because the agency does not have the legal authority to do so. According to our assessment of the statutes, CMS had the authority to pursue financial recoveries, but its rights under contracts for 2001-2005 are limited because its implementing regulations did not require that each contract include provisions to inform organizations about the audits and about the steps that CMS would take to address identified deficiencies, including pursuit of financial recoveries. CMS audited contract year 2006 bids for 80 organizations, and 18 had a material finding that affected amounts in approved bids. CMS officials said that they will use the audit results to help improve bids in subsequent years but took limited action to follow-up on contract year 2006 findings. CMS will not pursue financial recoveries based on audit results because it maintains that it does not have the legal authority to do so. However, according to our assessment of the statutes, CMS has the authority to include terms in bid contracts that would allow it to pursue financial recoveries. CMS also has the authority to sanction organizations but has not identified instances where sanctions are warranted. We also noted that CMS did not document steps taken to mitigate conflicts of interest for the firms performing audits."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2006, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  estimated it spent over $51 billion on the Medicare Advantage program,  which serves as an alternative to Medicare\u2019s traditional fee-for-service  (FFS) program. Under the Medicare Advantage program, CMS approves  private companies to offer health plan options to Medicare enrollees that  include all Medicare-covered services. In addition, many plans under the  program provide supplemental benefits, such as a reduction in required  cost sharing (e.g., beneficiaries\u2019 Part B premiums) or coverage for items  and services not included under the traditional FFS program, like dental  care. According to CMS, in fiscal year 2006, over 16 percent, or about 7  million of the approximately 43 million Medicare members, were enrolled  in a Medicare Advantage plan.", "Before 2006, companies choosing to participate in the Medicare Advantage  program were required to annually submit an Adjusted Community Rate  Proposal (ACRP) to CMS for review and approval for each plan it intended  to offer. The ACRP consisted of two parts\u2014a plan benefit package and  the Adjusted Community Rate (ACR). The plan benefit package contained  a detailed description of the benefits offered by the plan, and the ACR  contained a detailed description of the costs that the plan estimated it  would incur in providing a package of benefits to an enrolled Medicare  beneficiary. These costs were to be calculated based on how much a plan  would charge a commercial customer to provide the same benefit package  if its members had the same expected use of services as Medicare  beneficiaries. For each plan offered, the ACR was to provide an estimate  of expected per person payments from Medicare, based on published  Medicare+Choice payment rates and the characteristics of the plan\u2019s  expected enrollees. If the estimated ACR costs were greater than the  estimated payment rate, and if the organization still chose to participate, it  agreed to accept the CMS payment rate in accordance with its ACRP.  However, if the estimated ACR costs were less than the estimated payment  rate, the organization had to (1) provide additional services, (2) reduce  beneficiary premiums or copayments, (3) distribute the excess to a benefit  stabilization fund, or (4) use a combination of these methods. CMS made  payments to the companies monthly in advance of rendering services.", "In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement  and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). Among other things, MMA  established a bid submission process to replace the ACRP submission  process and authorized a new prescription drug benefit, both effective for  2006. Under the bid process, private companies\u2014called Medicare  Advantage (MA) organizations\u2014choosing to participate in the program are  required to annually submit bids for review and approval for each plan  they intend to offer. The bid submission includes a bid form that provides  each MA organization\u2019s estimate of the cost of delivering services to an  enrolled Medicare beneficiary and a plan benefit package that provides a  detailed description of the benefits offered in each plan. Additionally, each  MA organization and prescription drug plan that offers prescription drug  benefits under Part D is required to submit a separate prescription drug  bid form, a formulary, and a plan benefit package to CMS for its review  and approval. Within the bid forms, MA organizations include an estimate  of the per person cost of providing Medicare-covered services. Unlike the  cost estimates under the ACRP process, organizations develop CMS bid  cost estimates by relying on reasonable projection methods that may  include reliance on incurred costs for a base year, adjustments for  estimated utilization, and other factors to project costs to the bid contract  period. CMS compares the bid amounts to geographic-specific  benchmarks to determine the total payment to the MA organization. If a  bid amount is above the benchmark, the MA organization must require  enrollees to pay the difference in the form of a premium. If the bid amount  is below its benchmark, 75 percent of the difference (or savings), termed a  rebate, must be provided to enrollees as extra benefits in the form of cost  sharing reductions, premium reductions, or additional covered services.  The remaining 25 percent of the savings is retained by the Federal  Treasury. After bids are approved and payments are established, CMS  makes payments to the companies monthly in advance of rendering  services.", "Until the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), which  required CMS to annually audit the supporting financial records (including  data relating to Medicare utilization, costs, and computation of the ACR)  of at least one-third of the participating organizations, there was limited  oversight by CMS of the ACR process. BBA also required that GAO  monitor the audit activities mandated by the act. In fulfilling our  responsibility, we first reviewed CMS\u2019s process for auditing ACRs  approved for contract year 2000. This was CMS\u2019s first effort to meet the  audit requirement. We reported that the audits were of limited usefulness  because CMS did not follow up on the audit results. In continuing to fulfill  our audit monitoring responsibility, this report addresses the following  questions:  1.  Has CMS met the requirement for auditing the financial records of at least  one-third of the participating MA organizations for contract years 2001- 2005 as required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and bid submissions  for contract year 2006?  2.  Did the ACRP audit process provide CMS sufficient information to assess  potential impacts on beneficiaries and identify actions to address those  impacts?  3.  How did CMS conduct audits of bids for 2006, what information did the  bid audit process provide CMS, and how did CMS use that information?", "To determine whether CMS met requirements for auditing the financial  records of at least one-third of the MA organizations for contract years  2001-2005 and the bid submissions for contract year 2006, we obtained  from CMS a listing of the organizations that had their ACRPs or bids  audited each year and compared it with the total number of approved  ACRP and bid submissions for each year obtained from CMS\u2019s ACRP and  bid management database, the Health Plan Management System (HPMS).  We also interviewed CMS staff and officials.", "To determine whether information provided by the ACRP audit process  was sufficient for CMS to assess potential impacts on beneficiaries and  address those impacts, we obtained and reviewed audit reports for  contract years 2001-2004 and reports prepared by a contractor that  reviewed and analyzed the audits for contract year 2003. We interviewed  CMS staff and officials about what they did with the audit results, and we  discussed CMS\u2019s review of an analysis of contract year 2003 ACR audits  performed by the contractor.", "To determine how CMS conducted bid audits for contract year 2006, what  information the bid audit process provided CMS, and how CMS used that  information, we obtained and reviewed CMS\u2019s instructions and guidance  for bid auditors, bid audit reports for contract year 2006, planned audit  procedures, and bid certifications records. We interviewed the bid audit  firms and CMS staff and officials about the bid audit process and  discussed with CMS how it used the results of the contract year 2006  audits and its plans for future use.", "See appendix I for details about our scope and methodology.

For oversight of the program, the act  also required that CMS annually audit the financial records of at least one- third of the organizations participating in the Medicare+Choice program,  including the organizations\u2019 data relating to Medicare utilization, costs,  and computation of the ACR.", "In 2003, Congress enacted the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,  and Modernization Act of 2003 to expand the role of private entities in  providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. Among its changes, the law  renamed the Medicare+Choice program the Medicare Advantage program.  Medicare+Choice organizations were renamed MA organizations. MMA  also authorized new prescription drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries  beginning in 2006 and created new types of private health plans such as  \u201cregional\u201d MA plans, special needs plans, and prescription drug plans that  could be offered in addition to the plan types already being offered such as  health maintenance organizations (HMO), preferred provider  organizations (PPO), provider-sponsored organizations (PSO), medical  savings accounts, and private FFS plans.", "MMA established a bid submission process to replace the ACRP  submission process used under the Medicare+Choice program to annually  approve the benefit packages and costs that organizations estimated they  would incur in providing benefits to enrolled Medicare beneficiaries. MMA  specified that organizations wishing to offer health benefits as part of the  MA program and drug benefits must annually submit bids. The bid  submission includes a MA bid form indicating each MA organization\u2019s  estimate of the cost of delivering services to Medicare beneficiaries and a  plan benefit package for each plan. Additionally, each organization that  offers prescription drug benefits under Part D is required to submit a  separate prescription drug bid form, a formulary, and a plan benefit  package to CMS for its review and approval.", "MMA made changes to the methodology that MA organizations use in  estimating the costs of benefits. Under the ACRP process, MA  organizations were required to include an estimate of their per person cost  of providing benefits based on how much they would charge a commercial  customer to provide the same benefit package if their members had the  same expected use of services as Medicare beneficiaries. The chief  executive officer, chief financial officer, and the head marketing official of  the MA organization were required to certify that the ACRP contained  accurate information.", "Under the bid process, cost estimates are not based on commercial  experience. Under CMS\u2019s bid submission instructions, organizations are  required to include an estimate of the per person cost of providing  Medicare-covered services by relying on reasonable projection methods  that may include reliance on incurred costs for a base year, adjustments  for estimated utilization, and other factors to project costs to the bid  contract period. The allowed costs and additional cost sharing information  are to be used to determine net medical costs. To this, nonmedical  expenses, such as indirect administration and gain/loss margins, are to be  added to establish the required revenue for the contract year for each plan  offered. The assumptions, data, and models used in developing cost  estimates are prepared by the organizations\u2019 actuaries. CMS requires that  the actuary who prepared the bid must submit a certification stating that  the bid complies with laws, regulations, and the bid instructions and that  the actuary has followed the appropriate actuarial standards in completing  the bid.", "To determine the payments under the bid process, CMS compares the bid  amounts to geographic-specific benchmarks. If a bid is above the  benchmark, the enrollee must pay the difference in the form of a premium,  referred to as the basic beneficiary premium.

For contract year  2006, organizations had to submit bids to CMS by June 6, 2005. The bids  are submitted through HPMS. CMS subjects the bid forms to a desk review  prior to approval. In contract year 2006, CMS contracted with six actuarial  consulting firms to assist in reviewing the bid forms. The objective of the  bid review was to determine whether the bid was reasonable and fair to  the organization, the beneficiary, and CMS. In contract year 2006, the  review of the bid forms consisted of a series of structured subreviews that  examined the individual cost elements that collectively comprised each  bid. CMS\u2019s OACT developed metrics for each bid and identified statistical  outliers based on \u201cacceptable thresholds\u201d it defined. The contract  reviewers investigated the outliers, requesting additional documentation  from the organization as necessary, to assess the assumptions and  methods supporting the bid elements and their reasonableness to support  the overall bid. From early June 2005 through mid-September 2005, CMS  contractors reviewed the bids, and CMS approved them. CMS awarded  contracts for approved bids by mid-September 2005.", "After approval of the bids, CMS selects bids for audit. For audits of the  contract year 2006 bid forms, OACT contracted with six firms in  September 2005. CMS specified audit guidance for the auditors. This  included procedures for reviewing the accuracy of organizations\u2019 financial  data supporting the bid submissions and the reasonableness of  assumptions used in the contract year financial projections. Auditors were  also instructed to consider whether the bids were developed consistent  with the Actuarial Standards of Practice (ASOP) designated by CMS and  CMS\u2019s bid preparation instructions. (See appendix II for a description of  the ASOPs.) Auditors generally reported preliminary findings by April 2006  and issued final reports by August 2006.", "In contract year 2006, OACT required MA organizations to report incurred  revenue and expense information for contract year 2004. CMS calls this a  2-year look back. As of June 2007, OACT had made limited use of this 2- year look back information, but intends to use such information to assess  the credibility of projected revenue and expenses reported by MA  organizations.

We performed an analysis to determine if CMS had  met the requirement because CMS could not provide documentation to  support the method it used to select the ACRs and bids for audit and to  demonstrate that it had met the audit requirement for those years. With  respect to contract year 2006, CMS officials acknowledged the one-third  requirement, but they stated that they did not intend for the audits of  contract year 2006 bid submissions to meet the one-third audit  requirement.

When CMS selects an organization  for audit, some, but not all, of the plans offered under the organization\u2019s  contract are audited.", "CMS did not document its approach for selecting ACRs for audit or how its  approach was to meet the one-third annual audit requirement.  Consequently, we performed an analysis comparing the organizations and  plans audited as a percentage of organizations and plans that CMS  approved under the Medicare+Choice, Medicare Advantage, and Part D  programs from contract year 2001 through contract year 2006. We  obtained data on the total number of organizations and plans from CMS\u2019s  HPMS and data on the audited organizations from the audit reports. We  determined that between 18.6 and 23.6 percent, or fewer than one-third, of  the MA organizations offering plans for contract years 2001-2005 were  audited. Similarly, we determined that only 13.9 percent of the MA  organizations and prescription drug plans with approved bids for contract  year 2006 were audited. Table 1 summarizes our results.", "Although CMS selects organizations to meet the one-third audit  requirement based on the number of organizations and not the total  number of plans offered by organizations, we also analyzed the percentage  of plans audited of the total number of plans offered by each audited  organization. Our analysis shows that with the exception of contract year  2002, the level of audit coverage achieved by CMS audits has progressively  decreased in terms of the percentage of plans audited for those  organizations that were audited. Audit coverage has also decreased in  terms of the percentage of plans audited of all plans offered by  participating organizations each contract year. In contract year 2006, a  large increase in the number of bid submissions meant that the 159 plans  audited reflected only about 3 percent of all the plans offered. Table 2  summarizes our analysis.", "Regarding how CMS selected the organizations that were audited for  contract years 2001-2004, CMS officials told us they did not know how the  MA organizations were selected, and the documentation supporting the  selections was either not created or not retained. For contract year 2005  audits, CMS officials told us that the selection criteria included several  factors other than simply selecting one-third of the participating MA  organizations that were awarded contracts. They said that the criteria  considered whether the MA organization had a negative balance in the  benefit stabilization fund and the MA organization had been audited  previously and had significant issues. Late in June, CMS\u2019s OFM staff  provided us a summary of the criteria used to select the 59 organizations  participating in the MA program that it selected for contract year 2005  ACR audits.

For this reason,  we did not rely on the new information.", "For the audits of the contract year 2006 bids, CMS officials explained that  they did not intend for the audits of contract year 2006 bid submissions to  meet the one-third audit requirement and that they plan to conduct other  reviews of the financial records of organizations to meet the requirement  for contract year 2006. However, CMS has not clearly laid out how these  reviews will be conducted to meet the one-third requirement. OACT  officials explained that in selecting the bids for audit they (1) considered  whether the organization had been audited within the last 12 months and  excluded those because CMS did not want to burden the organization with  another audit, (2) selected 25 percent of the organizations based on  information collected through the initial bid review process, and (3)  randomly selected organizations from the remaining 75 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Not Yet Met the Audit Requirement for Contract Year 2006 and Has Not Determined How It Will Do So", "paragraphs": ["As we just discussed, CMS has not yet met the one-third audit requirement  for the contract year 2006 bid submissions.

Officials from CBC, OACT, and OFM initially told us in  January and February 2007 that their plans for meeting the one-third  requirement will likely include the bid audits currently directed by OACT  and other reviews by OFM of financial records of organizations. In June  2007, however, OFM officials said the requirement will be met solely  through their efforts. OFM is currently working with a contractor to  develop the agency\u2019s overall approach to conducting reviews to meet the  one-third audit requirement. But as of June 2007, CMS had not specified  how these reviews will meet the one-third audit requirement. Draft audit  procedures prepared by the contractor indicate that OFM plans to review  solvency, risk scores, related parties, direct medical and administrative  costs, and, where relevant, regional PPO cost reconciliation reports for  MA bids. For Part D bids, OFM also plans to review other areas, including  beneficiaries\u2019 true out-of-pocket costs.

The auditors reported findings ranging from lack of  supporting documentation to overstating or understating certain costs, but  did not identify how the errors affected beneficiary benefits, copayments,  or premiums. In 2001, we reported that CMS planned to require auditors,  where applicable, to quantify in their audit reports the overall impact of  errors. Further, during our prior work, CMS officials stated that they  were in the process of determining the impact on beneficiaries and  crafting a strategy for audit follow-up and resolving the audit results. CMS  did not initiate any actions to attempt to determine such impact until after  the audits for contract year 2003 were completed, when CMS contracted  with a firm to review all of the 2003 ACR audits to identify any errors from  the audits that would affect beneficiaries.

In our October 2001  report, we reported that for contract year 2001, CMS had planned to  require auditors, where applicable, to do so. We recommended that CMS  fully implement its plans to calculate the net effect of ACR audit findings  and adjustments. Computing the net effect of the errors identified by the  ACR audits is key to assessing the magnitude of the impact on  beneficiaries and could aid in developing an appropriate follow-up  protocol. In September 2001, CMS stated that it was already addressing  this recommendation.", "Although CMS indicated it was planning to obtain a calculation of the net  effect (i.e., impact on beneficiaries) of errors identified by auditors, the  audit guidance and instructions provided by CMS for contract years 2001  and 2002 did not specify that the auditors should quantify the impact of the  errors on beneficiary benefits, copayments, or premiums. Consequently,  the audit reports did not quantify the impact on the beneficiaries.", "The audit guidance and instructions for contract years 2003 and 2004 also  did not contain a directive to quantify the impact on beneficiaries of the  auditors\u2019 findings, and the audit reports did not contain this information.

The  auditors categorized their results as findings and observations, with  findings being more significant, depending on their materiality to the  average payment rate reported in the ACR. The distinction between  findings and observations, however, was based on judgment, and therefore  varied among the different auditors. CMS asked the contractor to analyze  the audit reports, including both findings and observations, and supporting  documentation. After reviewing the ACR reports for the 49 organizations  audited and related documentation, the contractor reported in December  2005 that it had identified errors for 41 of the 49 organizations that would  have resulted in approximately $59 million that beneficiaries could have  received in additional benefits, lower copayments, or lower premiums.", "OFM staff reviewed the contract year 2003 audit reports along with the  contractor\u2019s analysis of the 2003 ACR audits to evaluate the amount  reported by the contractor that would affect beneficiaries.

OFM staff told us they had identified what they considered errors in some  of the contractor\u2019s work, such as misapplication of the instructions, and  revised the amount of the beneficiary impact that the contractor had  identified. OFM staff concluded that they would make recommendations  to CBC on whether corrective action plans or sanctions against MA  organizations were warranted. In September 2006, CMS also contracted  with a firm to quantify the overall net effect resulting from the contract  year 2004 ACR audits.

We  recommended that CMS develop and implement a follow-up mechanism to  address the audit findings in a timely manner and that CMS communicate  to each MA organization specific corrective actions. In September 2001,  CMS responded that such a process was under development. CMS told us  it provided copies of the final audit reports to the MA organizations and  instructed them to institute remedial actions in their subsequent ACR  submissions and that CMS\u2019s intent was to follow up on the audit findings  during subsequent audits. For this report, we reviewed audit reports for  contract years 2001-2004 and discussed CMS\u2019s audit follow-up process  with CMS officials and staff. The audit reports did not refer to past audit  findings, so it is unclear whether the auditors had followed up on the past  findings. The only action that CMS has taken was to provide copies of the  audit reports to the MA organizations and instruct the organizations to  take action in subsequent ACR filings.", "In late May 2007, CBC officials explained that they were responsible for  resolving the issues resulting from the ACR audit reports and stated that  they were working with OFM to develop an approach to address the  results from the audit reports for contract years 2003 through 2005, but  had not yet decided on a plan of action. They also informed us that their  legal counsel had determined that the agency does not have the legal  authority to recover funds from MA organizations based on results of ACR  audits. Subsequently, HHS legal counsel explained to us the department\u2019s  position that CMS lacks the legal authority or the contractual right to  pursue financial recoveries when audits determine that approved ACRs  reflect errors, incorrect or unreasonable assumptions, or other  misstatements. We were told that, based on a determination of the  Secretary, general federal contract laws do not apply to the payments  made under MA contracts. Instead, according to HHS, the contractual  rights of CMS and the contracting MA organizations are limited to those  set out in statute and the CMS implementing regulations. Those statutes  and regulations do not expressly provide for corrective action based on  CMS\u2019s ACR audits, such as returning funds to CMS or beneficiaries based  on errors found during ACR audits when the audits indicate that each  beneficiary in a plan should have received a certain amount of additional  benefits. On the basis of our assessment of the statutes, CMS had the  authority to include terms in its contracts with MA organizations that  would allow it to pursue financial recoveries based on the ACR audit  results. However, CMS\u2019s rights under the contracts for contract years  2001\u20132005 are limited because its implementing regulations for the  Medicare+Choice Program did not require that each contract include  provisions to inform organizations and plans about the audits and about  the steps that CMS would take to address identified deficiencies, including  pursuit of financial recoveries.", "CMS officials acknowledged that they can impose sanctions in cases  where an organization misrepresents information that is furnished under  the program and for other reasons. Intermediate sanction provisions  allow for suspension of enrollment of individuals in MA plans, suspension  of payments to MA organizations, and civil penalties in the amount of up  to $100,000 for misrepresenting or falsifying information to CMS.  However, CMS has never sanctioned an MA organization based on findings  from the ACR audits and did not say why it has not. CMS officials told us  that they plan to close out the audits without pursuing financial  recoveries. They said that they are considering options, such as  determining whether findings are applicable to the current bid process,  that could be a basis for current action. CMS officials also stated that they  are compiling a list of MA organizations whose contract year 2003 ACR  audits resulted in significant findings and will refer the MA organizations  to the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) for appropriate action,  including assessing civil monetary penalties. However, CMS officials  acknowledged that the opportunity to take corrective action may have  passed, given the amount of time since the audits were completed.", "In the past, the OIG has audited ACRs and recommended in some cases  that MA organizations return unsupported or unallowable payments to  CMS. For example, the OIG conducted 53 of the 80 ACR audits for  contract year 2000, the first year of such audits that we reported on in our  previous report. The OIG reported findings that quantified the impact of  ACR errors on beneficiaries in 7 of the 53 reports. However, CMS did not  take action on the findings. CMS also did not take action on findings from  other audits of ACRs that the OIG did under its authority. For example, the  OIG audited the modifications to the contract year 2001 ACRPs for six MA  organizations to determine whether additional funding provided by the  Benefits Improvement Protection Act (BIPA) of 2000 was used in a  manner consistent with BIPA requirements and whether the modifications  were adequately supported. The OIG also audited modifications to the  contract year 2004 ACRPs for six MA organizations to determine whether  the use of payment increases provided under MMA were adequately  supported and allowable under MMA. In five of the BIPA audits and one of  the MMA audits, the OIG found that the MA organizations did not support  how they used the additional funds, or they determined that MA  organizations did not use the funds in a manner consistent with the  applicable law. In its reports dated June 2004 through January 2006, the  OIG recommended that the six MA organizations return to CMS a total of  almost $29 million or deposit the funds in a benefit stabilization fund for  use in future years.", "In CMS\u2019s December 2006 management response to the OIG\u2019s  recommendations, CMS\u2019s CBC stated that CMS did not concur with the  OIG\u2019s recommendations to collect the funds and make them available for  benefits because (1) the benefit stabilization fund was abolished with  implementation of MMA, (2) a significant time has elapsed since the  benefit year in question (2001), (3) the Medicare+Choice program no  longer exists, and (4) the basis for payment has changed from reviews of  ACRPs to bids."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Bid Audits Report Findings That Would Affect Premiums and Payments for Contract Year 2006, But CMS Does Not Address the Findings", "paragraphs": ["CMS contracted with six firms to audit a selected number of contract year  2006 bids and plans to do so for subsequent years.

However,  the officials acknowledged that the bid process relies heavily on certifying  actuaries and that there is a low probability of the bid audits identifying  intentional misrepresentations.", "Given the current audit coverage, CMS is unlikely to achieve significant  deterrent effect, as only 14 percent of participating organizations for  contract 2006 have been audited. Further, for those organizations that  were audited, CMS\u2019s follow-up on the audit findings may not deter those  organizations from making similar errors in future bids. For example,  preliminary findings for most of the 2006 audits came out by April 2006,  and according to OACT, organizations started preparing their bids for  contract year 2007 by April 2006, which would have allowed them time to  take corrective actions to address the audit findings. OACT officials noted  that they updated the contract year 2007 instructions for bid preparation  as a result of audit results and other factors.

Information about  organizations that the firms had prepared bids for, had other relationships  with, or had reviewed their bids came from several sources, including the  bid certifications, which identify the actuary that certified each bid  submission. OACT officials also said that they asked the firms to self- report conflicts of interest at two phases in their process: (1) as part of the  request for proposal, when firms were bidding for the audit contracts, and  (2) after contracts were awarded, when firms were asked to respond to a  list of organizations that that they were assigned to audit. CMS required  that as part of the request for proposal, the firms include a listing of  organizations for which the firms had a conflict of interest, including  organizations for which the firm had prepared bids or had another non- Medicare relationship within the prior 12 months.

This standard was intended to provide guidance on several  important areas requiring special consideration for HMOs and other  MCHPs. According to the Actuarial Standards Board, this standard was  repealed for work performed on or after April 26, 2007, because much of  the information in the standard was dated, and in general, it is believed  that the guidance provided in the standard is covered, either explicitly or  implicitly, in other ASOPs.", "ASOP No. 23, Data Quality  (Particular focus is placed on the sections dealing with Analysis of Issues  and Recommended Practices and Communications and Disclosures.)", "This ASOP gives guidance to the actuary in the areas of (1) selecting data  that underlie the actuarial work product, (2) relying on data supplied by  others, (3) reviewing data, (4) using data, and (5) making appropriate  disclosures with regard to data quality.", "ASOP No. 25, Credibility Procedures Applicable to Accident and  Health, Group Term Life, and Property/Casualty Coverage    The purpose of this ASOP is to provide guidance to actuaries in the  selection of a credibility procedure and the assignment of credibility  values to sets of data including subject experience and related experience.
