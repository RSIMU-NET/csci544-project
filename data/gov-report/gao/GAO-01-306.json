However, without proper safeguards,  these developments pose enormous risks that make it easier for individuals  and groups with malicious intent to intrude into inadequately protected  systems and use such access to obtain sensitive information, commit fraud,  disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer networks and  systems. Further, the number of individuals with computer skills is  increasing, and intrusion, or hacking, techniques are readily available and  relatively easy to use. The rash of cyber attacks launched in February 2000  against major U.S. firms illustrates the risks associated with this new  electronic age.", "Computer-supported federal operations are also at risk. Our previous  reports, and those of agency inspectors general, describe persistent  computer security weaknesses that place a variety of critical federal  operations, including those at IRS, at risk of disruption, fraud, and  inappropriate disclosure.

These  data typically include the taxpayer\u2019s name, address, social security number,  dependents, income, source of certain types of income, and certain  deductions and expenses.

We identified serious  weaknesses in IRS\u2019 controls over the confidentiality and complexity of  its passwords and in the administration of its user accounts. For  example, we were able to guess many passwords based on our  knowledge of commonly used passwords. We also found user-IDs and  passwords that were posted in clear view on a monitor in an unsecured  area at one IRS data processing facility.

According to IRS, the average refund issued for the 1999 tax  filing season for on-line filers was $2,041, and for practitioner-prepared  electronic returns, $1,910. Based on these statistics, IRS paid refunds of  about $2.1 billion on electronic tax returns that were not authenticated by  taxpayers as of August 24, 2000.

Thus, taxpayers who prepared their  electronic tax returns and sent the returns in an encrypted form to a  transmitter for transmission to IRS may not have known that the  transmitter could have viewed, modified, or copied their tax returns, or  that their returns were transmitted to IRS in clear text.

We have previously reported that although IRS has made significant  strides in improving computer security at certain facilities, an effective  computer security management program had not yet been fully  implemented across the service.  2. We agree that the report does not focus on the likelihood of the threats  occurring and focuses on the risks associated with the threats.  However, we do not believe the report\u2019s message unreasonably  promotes undue concern about the risks associated with electronic  filing. In our view, we are presenting the facts about certain risks that  accompany electronic filing\u2212risks that may or may not be present in  paper filing, and risks that the public is entitled to know. Because of its  role as the nation\u2019s tax collector, IRS\u2019 computer systems may be a target  for certain individuals or groups. Our tests, which successfully  identified and exploited weaknesses in IRS\u2019 e-file computers, were not  sophisticated. It is important to note that IRS immediately recognized  the seriousness of the weaknesses we identified and said it has taken  prompt action to correct all of the critical vulnerabilities.  3. We neither state nor imply that sending data unencrypted over public  switched networks is an unacceptable risk. However, we continue to  believe that the risk of unauthorized disclosure is greater when  electronic tax returns are transmitted in clear text than in encrypted  text. It is important to note that IRS regulations require encryption and  secure dial-in for remote access from the public switched telephone  network to any IRS system that contains sensitive data.  4. As noted in the report, although IRS did not have evidence that  intruders accessed or modified taxpayer data on its e-file systems, its  capabilities for detecting intrusions and misuse resulting from the  exploitation of vulnerabilities on e-file systems during the 2000 tax  filing season were not adequate. 5. The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported in  September 1999 that although IRS improved the 1998 suitability  screening process, the overall process was not completely successful in  preventing inappropriate e-file trading partners from participating in  the e-file program.  6. We recognize in the report that IRS performs annual suitability checks  and monitors its trading partners. However, we continue to believe that  taxpayers have a right to know that IRS does not subject most of its  trading partners to criminal background or fingerprint checks and does  not assess computer security over transmitters\u2019 computer systems as  part of its monitoring efforts. 7. We do not believe that \u201ctotal assurance\u201d is necessary, only full  disclosure. At the time IRS asserted on its Web page that taxpayers\u2019  \u201cprivacy and security are assured,\u201d we identified serious access control  weaknesses over IRS electronic filing systems that could have allowed  unauthorized individuals to view and modify taxpayer data. Further,  IRS had no assurance about the effectiveness of computer controls  within the transmitters\u2019 operating environments\u2014environments that  affect the privacy and security of electronically filed tax return data. We  believe that IRS should inform taxpayers of the risks as well as the  benefits of filing electronic tax returns so they can make informed  decisions on the tax filing method that is appropriate for them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ordering Information", "paragraphs": ["The first copy of each GAO report is free.
