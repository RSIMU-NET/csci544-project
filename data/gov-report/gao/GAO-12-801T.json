Fraud involves an intentional act or representation to deceive with the knowledge that the action or representation could result in gain. The deceptive nature of fraud makes its extent in the Medicare program difficult to measure in a reliable way, but it is clear that fraud contributes to Medicare\u0092s fiscal problems.

However, CMS has not completed other actions, including implementation of some relevant provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA). Specifically, CMS has not (1) determined which providers will be required to post surety bonds to help ensure that payments made for fraudulent billing can be recovered, (2) contracted for fingerprint-based criminal background checks, (3) issued a final regulation to require additional provider disclosures of information, and (4) established core elements for provider compliance programs.", "Pre- and Post-payment Claims Review : GAO had previously found that increased efforts to review claims on a prepayment basis can prevent payments from being made for potentially fraudulent claims, while improving systems used by CMS and its contractors to review claims on a post-payment basis could better identify patterns of potentially fraudulent billing for further investigation. CMS has controls in Medicare\u0092s claims-processing systems to determine if claims should be paid, denied, or reviewed further. These controls require timely and accurate information about providers that GAO has previously recommended that CMS strengthen. GAO is currently examining CMS\u0092s new Fraud Prevention System, which uses analytic methods to examine claims before payment to develop investigative leads for Zone Program Integrity Contractors (ZPIC), the contractors responsible for detecting and investigating potential fraud.

Although there have been convictions  for multi-million dollar schemes that defrauded the Medicare program, the  extent of the problem is unknown. There are no reliable estimates of the  extent of fraud in the Medicare program or for the health care industry as  a whole. By its very nature, fraud is difficult to detect, as those involved  are engaged in intentional deception. For example, fraud may involve  providers submitting a claim with false documentation for services not  provided, while the claim on its face may appear valid. Fraud also can  involve efforts to hide ownership of companies or kickbacks to obtain  beneficiary information. Although the full extent of the problem is  unknown, it is clear that the Medicare program is vulnerable to fraud,  which contributes to Medicare\u2019s fiscal problems.

As one example, the  fee-for-service (FFS) portion of the Medicare program processes over a  billion claims a year from about 1.5-million providers and suppliers;  working to ensure that those payments are accurate is a complex,  ongoing task. Medicare has many individual vulnerabilities, which are  service- or system-specific weaknesses that can lead to payment errors,  including those due to fraud. If the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) that administers the program, suspects that providers or  suppliers are billing fraudulently, it can take action, including suspending  claims payment, revoking billing privileges, or referring cases to law  enforcement for investigation. Further, it can impose a moratorium on  new enrollment of providers or suppliers. Since 1997, Congress has  provided funds specifically for activities to address fraud, as well as waste  and abuse, in Medicare and other federal health care programs. In  addition, Congress created the Medicare Integrity Program to conduct  activities to reduce fraud, waste, abuse, and improper payments. In  2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA), which provided additional funding for such efforts and set a  number of new requirements specific to Medicare.

CMS  designated three levels of risk\u2014high, moderate, and limited\u2014with  different screening procedures for categories of Medicare providers at  each level. Providers in the high-risk level are subject to the most rigorous  screening. To determine which providers to place in these risk levels,  CMS considered issues such as past occurrences of improper payments  and fraud among different categories of providers. Based in part on our  work and that of the OIG, CMS designated newly enrolling HHAs and  DMEPOS suppliers as high risk and designated other providers at lower  levels. (See table 1.) Providers at all risk levels are screened to verify that  they meet specific requirements established by Medicare such as having  current licenses or accreditation and valid Social Security numbers.  High- and moderate-risk providers are additionally subject to  unannounced site visits. Further, depending on the risks presented,  PPACA authorizes CMS to require fingerprint-based criminal history  checks, and the posting of surety bonds for certain providers. CMS may  also provide enhanced oversight for specific periods for new providers  and for initial claims of DMEPOS suppliers.", "CMS indicated that the agency will continue to review the criteria for its  screening levels on an ongoing basis and would publish changes if the  agency decided to update the assignment of screening levels for  categories of Medicare providers. This may become necessary because  fraud is not confined to HHAs and DMEPOS suppliers. We are currently  examining the types of providers involved in fraud cases investigated by  the OIG and the Department of Justice (DOJ), which may help illuminate  risk to the Medicare program from different types of providers. Further, in  their 2011 annual report on the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control  Program, DOJ and HHS reported convictions or other legal actions, such  as exclusions or civil monetary penalties, against several types of  Medicare providers other than DMEPOS suppliers and HHAs, including  pharmacists, orthopedic surgeons, infusion and other types of medical  clinics, and physical therapy services. CMS also has established  triggers for adjustments to an individual provider\u2019s risk level. For example,  CMS regulations state that an individual provider or supplier at the  limited- or moderate-risk level that has had its billing privileges revoked by  a Medicare contractor within the last 10 years and is attempting to re- enroll, would move to the high-risk level for screening.", "New National Enrollment Screening and Site Visit Contractors: In a  further effort to strengthen its enrollment processes, CMS contracted with  two new entities at the end of 2011 to assume centralized responsibility  for automated screening of provider and supplier enrollment and for  conducting site visits of providers.", "Automated-screening contractor.

Prior to the  implementation of this new automated screening, such screening was  done manually for the 30,000 enrollees each month by CMS\u2019s  Medicare Administrative Contractors (MAC), which enroll Medicare  providers, and the National Supplier Clearinghouse (NSC), which  enrolls DMEPOS suppliers. According to CMS, the old screening  process was neither efficient nor timely. CMS officials said that in  2012, the automated-screening contractor began automated  screening of the licensure status of all currently enrolled Medicare  providers and suppliers. The agency said it expects the automated- screening contractor to begin screening newly enrolling providers and  suppliers later this year. CMS expects that the new, national  contractor will enable better monitoring of providers and suppliers on  a continuous basis to help ensure they continue to meet Medicare  enrollment requirements. The new screening contractor will also help  the MACs and the NSC maintain enrollment information in CMS\u2019s  Provider Enrollment Chain and Ownership System (PECOS)\u2014a  database that contains details on enrolled providers and suppliers. In  addition, CMS officials said the automated-screening contractor is  developing an individual risk score for each provider or supplier,  similar to a credit risk score.
