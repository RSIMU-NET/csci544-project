Some of these patients performed dialysis at home, and such patients may have increased autonomy and health-related quality of life.", "GAO was asked to study Medicare patients' use of home dialysis and key factors affecting its use. This report examines (1) trends in home dialysis use and estimates of the potential for wider use, (2) incentives for home dialysis associated with Medicare payments to dialysis facilities, and (3) incentives for home dialysis associated with Medicare payments to physicians. GAO reviewed CMS policies and relevant laws and regulations, and GAO analyzed data from CMS (2010-2015), the United States Renal Data System (1988-2012), and Medicare cost reports (2012), the most recent years with complete data available. GAO also interviewed CMS officials, selected dialysis facility chains, physician and patient associations, and experts on home dialysis."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The percentage of dialysis patients who received home dialysis generally declined between 1988 and 2008 and then slightly increased thereafter through 2012, and stakeholder estimates suggest that future increases in the use of home dialysis are possible. Dialysis patients can receive treatments at home or in a facility. In 1988, 16 percent of 104,200 dialysis patients received home dialysis. Home dialysis use generally decreased over the next 20 years, reaching 9 percent in 2008, and then slightly increased to 11 percent of 450,600 dialysis patients in 2012\u2014the most recent year of data for Medicare and non-Medicare patients. Physicians and other stakeholders estimated that 15 to 25 percent of patients could realistically be on home dialysis, suggesting that future increases in use are possible. In the short term, however, an ongoing shortage of supplies required for peritoneal dialysis\u2014the most common type of home dialysis\u2014reduced home dialysis use among Medicare patients from August 2014 to March 2015. Some stakeholders were also concerned the shortage could have a long-term impact.", "Medicare's payment policy likely gives facilities financial incentives to provide home dialysis, but these incentives may have a limited impact in the short term. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), setting the facility payment for dialysis treatment at the same rate regardless of the type of dialysis gives facilities a powerful financial incentive to encourage the use of peritoneal dialysis when appropriate because it is generally less costly than other dialysis types. However, GAO found that facilities also have financial incentives in the short term to increase provision of hemodialysis in facilities, rather than increasing home dialysis. This is consistent with information from CMS and stakeholders GAO interviewed. For example, facilities may be able to add an in-center patient without paying for an additional dialysis machine, because each machine can be used by six to eight in-center patients. In contrast, for each new home patient, facilities may need to pay for an additional machine. The adequacy of Medicare payments for home dialysis training also affects facilities' financial incentives for home dialysis. Although CMS recently increased its payment for home dialysis training, it lacks reliable cost report data needed for effective fiscal management, which involves assessing payment adequacy. In particular, if training payments are inadequate, facilities may be less willing to provide home dialysis.", "Medicare payment policies may constrain physicians' prescribing of home dialysis. Specifically, Medicare's monthly payments to physicians for managing the care of home patients are often lower than for managing in-center patients even though physician stakeholders generally said that the time required may be similar. Medicare also pays for predialysis education\u2014the Kidney Disease Education (KDE) benefit\u2014which could help patients learn about home dialysis. However, less than 2 percent of eligible Medicare patients received the benefit in 2010 and 2011, and use has declined since then. According to stakeholders, the low usage was due to statutory limitations in the categories of providers and patients eligible for the benefit. CMS has established a goal of encouraging home dialysis use among patients for whom it is appropriate, but the differing monthly payments and low usage of the KDE benefit could undermine this goal."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) take steps to improve the reliability of the cost report data, (2) examine and, if necessary, revise policies for paying physicians to manage the care of dialysis patients, and (3) examine and, if appropriate, seek legislation to revise the KDE benefit.

These patients may receive dialysis treatments  in a dialysis facility or may perform dialysis treatments at home, for which  they receive training and support from a facility. Most individuals with  ESRD are eligible for Medicare regardless of their age.

To  gain insight into the factors that contributed to these trends and to identify  estimates of the potential for wider use of home dialysis, we conducted a  literature review and interviewed stakeholders, including two large dialysis  facility chains, an association representing small dialysis facility chains  and independent facilities, patient and physician associations, and  experts on home dialysis identified through a review of published  literature. Information from these interviews cannot be generalized to all  stakeholders.", "To examine incentives associated with Medicare payments to dialysis  facilities, we reviewed Medicare policies and relevant federal laws,  regulations, and guidance, and we analyzed facilities\u2019 profit margins  associated with their Medicare-covered dialysis treatments. Specifically,  using Medicare cost reports for freestanding dialysis facilities in the 50  states and the District of Columbia in 2012, we calculated each facility\u2019s  Medicare margin as payments minus costs divided by payments for  Medicare-covered dialysis treatments. We examined each facility\u2019s total  costs, total Medicare payments, and the number of dialysis treatments  provided, and we excluded facilities with (1) internal inconsistencies  among these variables; (2) unusually high or low average costs or  average Medicare payments per treatment, which may be indicative of  data entry errors; or (3) inconsistencies between the numbers of  Medicare-covered treatments reported on the cost reports and the  number reported in Medicare claims. Beyond these exclusions, we did not  independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the cost report data  that dialysis facilities submitted to CMS. We then used regression  analysis to measure the incentive that facilities may have to provide home  dialysis in the short term. Specifically, the regression estimated the extent  to which expanding the provision of home dialysis or dialysis conducted in  facilities was associated with an increase or decrease in facilities\u2019  Medicare margins.

In-center hemodialysis is the most  common type of dialysis and was used by about 89 percent of dialysis  patients in 2012; the remaining patients received either peritoneal dialysis  (9 percent) or home hemodialysis (2 percent). Similarly, almost all\u2014 approximately 96 percent of\u2014dialysis facilities had in-center hemodialysis  patients in 2012; just over two-fifths of facilities had peritoneal dialysis  patients and nearly one-fifth had home hemodialysis patients.", "The processes for hemodialysis\u2014performed either in a facility or at  home\u2014and peritoneal dialysis differ. (See fig. 1.) For in-center  hemodialysis treatments, blood flows from the patient\u2019s body through a  surgically created vein or a catheter, known as a vascular access site,  and through tubing to the dialysis machine. The machine pumps the  blood through an artificial kidney, called a dialyzer, to cleanse the excess  fluids and toxins from the bloodstream and then returns the cleansed  blood to the body. Patients typically receive in-center hemodialysis for 3  to 4 hours three times per week. For home hemodialysis treatments, the  process is the same, but the patient performs the treatments and may  perform treatments more frequently and at night. For peritoneal dialysis  treatments, a catheter is used to fill the patient\u2019s abdomen with a dialysis  solution that collects excess fluids and toxins over several hours; those  excess fluids and toxins are removed from the body when the patient  drains the dialysis solution from the abdomen. To conduct the  exchanges\u2014draining and then refilling the abdomen with the dialysis  solution\u2014most peritoneal dialysis patients use a machine that performs  several exchanges during the night while they are asleep, and other  patients do manual exchanges during the day.", "The three types of dialysis are also associated with various clinical  advantages and disadvantages. For example, some studies have  suggested that more frequent use of home hemodialysis can achieve  better health outcomes for certain patients such as those with  hypertension. In another example, some studies have suggested that  peritoneal dialysis may have a lower risk for death in the first few years of  dialysis therapy, and peritoneal dialysis can also help patients retain  residual kidney function. However, the causes of some differences in  clinical outcomes between the types of dialysis can be challenging to  determine because of differences in patient characteristics; younger  patients, for example, were more likely to receive peritoneal dialysis than  other types, according to USRDS data. In addition, there may also be  clinical disadvantages. For example, home hemodialysis patients\u2019 more  frequent use of the vascular access site may result in a higher risk for  complications such as damage to the site that requires repair.  Additionally, peritoneal dialysis patients may develop peritonitis, an  infection of the peritoneal membrane, and the peritoneal membrane may  become less effective over time, meaning a patient may eventually have  to switch to either home or in-center hemodialysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting Type of Dialysis", "paragraphs": ["Patients\u2019 preferences may influence whether patients receive home  dialysis (either peritoneal dialysis or home hemodialysis) or in-center  hemodialysis. For example, some patients may prefer home dialysis  because they do not need to travel to the facility three times per week,  giving them greater flexibility to work during the day and undergo dialysis  at night in their home. Some patients also may prefer home dialysis  because there may be fewer diet and fluid restrictions and less recovery  time following each dialysis treatment. On the other hand, successfully  performing home dialysis requires patients to undergo training and  assume other responsibilities that they would not otherwise have if they  dialyzed in a facility. As a result, patients who feel unprepared to accept  such responsibilities or who lack a spouse or caregiver to help them may  be less likely to choose home dialysis. For similar reasons, some experts  and stakeholders have indicated that switching from in-center to home  dialysis can be challenging once patients become accustomed to in- center hemodialysis. Furthermore, the greater complexity of home  hemodialysis training\u2014including learning to place needles in the vascular  access site and how to respond to alarms from the dialysis machine\u2014 relative to peritoneal dialysis training could lead some patients to prefer  one type of home dialysis over the other.", "In addition to patients\u2019 preferences, clinical factors may affect whether  patients receive home dialysis or in-center hemodialysis. One factor is  whether a patient has received care from a nephrologist prior to beginning  dialysis. Patients who did not receive such care and who have an urgent  need to start dialysis often do so with in-center hemodialysis because  training is not required and because a venous catheter can be placed and  used immediately. More lead time can be required for peritoneal dialysis  to allow the site where the peritoneal dialysis catheter was placed to  heal. As another example, a patient with poor vision or dexterity may  have difficulty performing the tasks associated with home dialysis. In  addition, a patient who has received multiple abdominal surgeries may  not be an appropriate candidate for peritoneal dialysis. Finally, patients  with multiple comorbidities (i.e., multiple chronic diseases or disorders)  may choose in-center hemodialysis because it can allow the nephrologist  to more closely manage those other conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Payment for Dialysis Care", "paragraphs": ["Medicare uses different methods to pay (1) dialysis facilities for providing  dialysis treatments to patients and for training them to perform home  dialysis and (2) physicians for managing patients\u2019 dialysis care and  educating them about their condition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Payments to Facilities", "paragraphs": ["For dialysis treatments\u2014including any training that occurs in the first   4 months of treatment\u2014Medicare has paid facilities a single bundled  payment per treatment since 2011.

In 2015, Medicare paid a base rate of $239.43 per  treatment for up to three hemodialysis treatments per week, and  Medicare sets the daily rate for peritoneal dialysis such that payments for  7 days of peritoneal dialysis would equal the sum of payments for three  hemodialysis treatments. Medicare adjusts the base rate to account for  certain factors that affect the cost of a treatment, including costs to  stabilize patients and to provide training during the first 4 months of  dialysis treatments, as well as certain other patient and facility factors.

During the time period from 1988 through 2012, most home  dialysis patients received peritoneal dialysis as opposed to home  hemodialysis.

The growth  in facilities\u2019 capacity to provide in-center hemodialysis from 1988 to  2008 outpaced the growth in the dialysis patient population over the  same time period. Specifically, the number of dialysis stations, which  include the treatment areas and dialysis machines used to provide   in-center hemodialysis, increased at an average annual rate of   7.3 percent during this time period, while the number of patients  increased at an average annual rate of 6.8 percent. As a result,  dialysis facilities may have had a greater financial incentive to treat  patients in facilities in an effort to use this expanded capacity,  according to literature we reviewed.", "Changes in the dialysis population. The increased age and  prevalence of comorbidities in the dialysis population may have  reduced the portion considered clinically appropriate for home  dialysis. Dialysis patients who are older and those with comorbid  conditions may be less physically able to dialyze at home. From 1988  to 2008, the mean age of a dialysis patient rose from 52.2 years to  58.6 years. Similarly, the proportion of the dialysis population affected  by various comorbid conditions increased during this time period. For  example, the percentage of dialysis patients with diabetes as the  primary cause of ESRD increased from 24.6 percent in 1988 to   43.1 percent in 2008.", "Medicare payment methods and concerns about the effectiveness of  peritoneal dialysis may have played a role in the decline in home dialysis  use between 1988 and 2008, but changes in both factors may have also  contributed to recent increases in use.", "Medicare payment methods for injectable drugs. Medicare  payment methods prior to 2011 may have given facilities a financial  incentive to provide in-center rather than home dialysis. Before 2011,  Medicare paid separately for injectable drugs rather than including  them in the bundled payment. As a result, Medicare payments to  facilities for dialysis care\u2014including the payments for injectable  drugs\u2014could have been lower for home patients because of their  lower use, on average, of injectable drugs. However, the payment  changes in 2011 reduced the incentive to provide in-center  hemodialysis relative to home dialysis because the Medicare payment  for dialysis treatments and related services, such as injectable drugs,  no longer differed based on the type of dialysis received by the  patient.", "Concerns about effectiveness of peritoneal dialysis. Several  studies published in the mid-1990s indicated poorer outcomes for  peritoneal dialysis compared to hemodialysis, and these studies may  have made some physicians reluctant to prescribe peritoneal dialysis,  according to stakeholders and literature we reviewed. However,  stakeholders identified more recent studies indicating that outcomes  for peritoneal dialysis are comparable to hemodialysis. These newer  studies may have contributed to the recent increases in home dialysis  use by mitigating concerns about the effectiveness of peritoneal  dialysis and by making physicians more comfortable with prescribing  it.", "Estimates from dialysis experts and other stakeholders suggest that  further increases in the use of home dialysis are possible over the long  term. The home dialysis experts and stakeholders we interviewed  indicated that home dialysis could be clinically appropriate for at least half  of patients. However, the percentage of patients who could realistically be  expected to dialyze at home is lower because of other factors such as  patient preferences. For example, at a meeting in 2013, the chief medical  officers of 14 dialysis facility chains jointly estimated that a realistic target  for home dialysis would be 25 percent of dialysis patients. To achieve this  target, they said that changes, such as increased patient education and  changes to payment policies, would need to occur. As another example,  physician stakeholders we interviewed estimated that 15 to 25 percent of  dialysis patients could realistically be on home dialysis.", "In the short term, however, an ongoing shortage of peritoneal dialysis  solution has reduced the use of home dialysis, and this shortage could  have a long-term impact as well. Medicare claims data analyzed by  CMS show that the percentage of Medicare dialysis patients on home  dialysis had reached 10.7 percent in August 2014, when the shortage  was first announced, but has since declined to 10.3 percent, as of March  2015. CMS officials attributed this decline to the shortage in the supply of  peritoneal dialysis solution because the decline did not occur among  facilities owned by one large dialysis facility chain that manufactures its  own peritoneal dialysis solution and has not experienced a shortage.  Some dialysis facility chains told us that, because of this shortage, they  limited the number of new patients on peritoneal dialysis. In addition, one  physician association stated that the shortage could have long-term  implications. They said that some physicians are reluctant to prescribe  this type of dialysis, even when a facility has the capacity to start a patient  on peritoneal dialysis, because of uncertainties about peritoneal dialysis  supplies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incentives for Facilities to Provide Home Dialysis May Have Limited Impact in Short Term", "paragraphs": ["Medicare payments to dialysis facilities, including those that provided  home dialysis, gave them an overall financial incentive to provide dialysis,  as shown by their generally positive Medicare margins. The average  Medicare margin for all 3,891 freestanding facilities in our analysis was  4.0 percent in 2012\u2014that is, Medicare payments exceeded Medicare  allowable costs for dialysis treatments by 4.0 percent. Similarly, the  average Medicare margin for the 1,569 freestanding facilities that  provided one or both types of home dialysis was 4.20 percent in 2012.  (See table 1.) Focusing on those facilities that provided home dialysis,  nearly all (94 percent) provided both in-center and one or both types of  home dialysis. In addition, although margins were positive, on average,  for these facilities, we found that the Medicare margin for large facilities  (7.21 percent) was considerably higher, on average, than for small  facilities (-3.49 percent). We also found that most of the patient years   (81 percent) were devoted to in-center hemodialysis, followed by  peritoneal dialysis (15 percent) and home hemodialysis (4 percent).  Small and large facilities followed the same pattern.", "In addition to giving an incentive to provide dialysis in general, Medicare  payments to facilities likely encourage the use of peritoneal dialysis\u2014the  predominant type of home dialysis\u2014over the long term. The payment rate  for peritoneal dialysis is the same as the rate for hemodialysis provided in  facilities or at home, but the cost of providing peritoneal dialysis is  generally lower, according to CMS and stakeholders we interviewed.  When CMS established the current payment system, it stated that its  decision to have a single payment rate regardless of the type of dialysis  would give facilities a powerful financial incentive to encourage the use of  home dialysis, when appropriate. Another financial incentive that exists  for both peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis is that facilities can  receive additional months of payments for patients under 65 who undergo  home dialysis training. Specifically, for patients under age 65, Medicare  coverage typically begins in the fourth month after the patient begins  dialysis, but coverage begins earlier if the patient undergoes home  dialysis training. This incentive is augmented because payments to  facilities are significantly higher during the first 4 months of dialysis.  These incentives to provide home dialysis, compared to in-center  hemodialysis, are consistent with CMS\u2019s goal of fostering patient  independence through greater use of home dialysis among patients for  whom it is appropriate.", "Although over the long term facilities may have a financial incentive to  encourage the use of one or both types of home dialysis, the impact of  this incentive could be limited in the short term. This is because, in the  short term, we found that expanding the provision of in-center  hemodialysis at a facility generally tends to increase that facility\u2019s  Medicare margin and that the estimated increase is more than would  result if the facility instead expanded the provision of either type of home  dialysis. In particular, we found that, on average, facilities that provided  home dialysis could improve their financial position in the short term by  increasing their provision of in-center hemodialysis. An additional patient  year of in-center hemodialysis improved the margin by an estimated   0.15 percentage points\u2014for example, from 4.20 to 4.35 percent. (See   fig. 3.) In contrast, increasing home dialysis resulted in a smaller benefit.  Adding a patient year of peritoneal dialysis improved the margin by an  estimated 0.08 percentage points and adding a patient year of home  hemodialysis had no statistically significant effect on the margin; the  estimated 0.04 percentage point reduction on average in the margin was  not statistically different from zero. The pattern of the results in figure 3 for  the three types of dialysis was similar for small and large facilities. (See  results in app. I.)", "Our findings on the relative impact of the incentives in the short term are  generally consistent with information on the cost of each type of dialysis  provided to us by CMS and stakeholders we interviewed. First, consistent  with our finding that facilities have a greater short-term incentive for in- center hemodialysis, stakeholders we interviewed said that facilities\u2019 costs  for increasing their provision of in-center hemodialysis may be lower than  for either type of home dialysis. For example, although the average cost  of an in-center hemodialysis treatment is typically higher than the average  cost of a peritoneal dialysis treatment, facilities may be able to add an in- center patient without incurring the cost of an additional dialysis machine  because each machine can be used by six to eight patients. In contrast,  when adding a home patient, facilities generally incur costs for additional  equipment, which is dedicated to a single patient. Second, some  stakeholders said that the cost of providing home hemodialysis, in  particular, can be higher than other types of dialysis in part because  home hemodialysis patients often receive more than three treatments per  week and Medicare\u2019s policy is not to pay for these additional treatments  unless medically justified. Finally, when comparing the two types of  home dialysis, CMS and the stakeholders generally reported that the cost  of home hemodialysis, including training, was higher than for peritoneal  dialysis. They said that home hemodialysis training is more costly  because of the greater complexity such as learning to place needles in  the vascular access site and to respond to alarms. Stakeholders also told  us that Medicare payments cover only a portion of the upfront costs for  training a patient, particularly one on home hemodialysis.", "CMS increased the training add-on payment beginning in 2014 in  response to public comments it received on the cost of home  hemodialysis training, but the agency lacks reliable data for determining  whether the revised payment is adequate. Specifically, CMS lacks  reliable data on the cost of home dialysis treatment and training and on  the staff time needed to provide training.", "We found that the cost report data on facilities\u2019 costs for each type of  dialysis, including costs for home dialysis training, were not sufficiently  reliable. Although we determined that data on facilities\u2019 total costs  across all types of dialysis were sufficiently reliable for purposes of  our analysis, stakeholders reported that these total costs were not  accurately allocated to each type of dialysis and to training. One  reason for this inaccuracy may be that some facilities allocated certain  types of costs, such as dialysis-related drugs and supplies, based on  the number of treatments for each type of dialysis. Representatives of  these facilities reported that CMS\u2019s Medicare Administrative  Contractors had approved this allocation method. However, the  number of treatments by type of dialysis may not be a reliable basis  for allocating such costs.

CMS, when it established the current method of paying  physicians a monthly payment to manage patients\u2019 dialysis, stated that  this method would encourage the use of home dialysis by giving  physicians an incentive to manage home patients. According to CMS,  this incentive would exist because the monthly payment rate for  managing the dialysis care of home patients, which requires a single in- person visit, was approximately equal to the rate for managing and  providing two to three visits to in-center patients. However, we found that,  in 2013, the rate of $237 for managing home patients was lower than the  average payment of $266 and maximum payment of $282 for managing  in-center patients. (See table 2.) This difference in payment rates may  discourage physicians from prescribing home dialysis.", "Physician associations and other physicians we interviewed told us that  Medicare payments may give physicians a disincentive for prescribing  home dialysis. They stated that, even though the payment levels for  managing home patients are typically lower, the visits with home patients  are often longer and more comprehensive; this is in part because  physicians may conduct visits with individual home patients in a private  setting, but they may be able to more easily visit multiple in-center  patients on a single day as they receive dialysis. The physician  associations we interviewed also said that they may spend a similar  amount of time outside of visits to manage the care of home patients and  that they are required to provide at least one visit per month to perform a  complete assessment of the patient. In addition, while physicians can  receive a higher payment for providing more than one visit to in-center  patients, these additional visits may be provided by nurse practitioners  and certain other nonphysician practitioners, who may be less costly.  CMS has not revised the overall structure for paying for physicians to  manage dialysis patients\u2019 care since 2004, although it has addressed  some stakeholder concerns such as how it paid physicians when home  patients were in the hospital.", "In contrast to the monthly payments, Medicare physician payments  related to patients\u2019 training may provide physicians with financial  incentives for prescribing home dialysis.

Dialysis facilities are also not eligible to receive payment for  the KDE benefit. Although facility representatives said that they were  equipped to provide education to these patients, including education on  the choice of type of dialysis, CMS and some other stakeholders said  that one reason facilities are not eligible to provide the KDE benefit is  their financial interest in treatment decisions.

A  fourth group\u2014Fresenius\u2014expressed concern about the reliability of data  on the costs of home dialysis, which was consistent with our  recommendation that CMS needs to improve the reliability of these data.  RPA, in addition to agreeing with this recommendation, questioned the  reliability of the data on total facility costs that we used for our analysis.  Although it was beyond the scope of our report to verify the accuracy of  each facility\u2019s cost report, we took several steps to assess the cost report  data that we analyzed. These steps included verifying the cost report data  for internal consistency and checking the number of dialysis treatments  reported against Medicare claims. The fact that implementing these steps  caused us to exclude some facilities\u2019 data from our analysis suggests that  the potential exists to improve the accuracy of these data. CMS\u2019s  implementation of our recommendation and auditing of cost reports under  the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 create the opportunity for  CMS to begin addressing this issue. NRAA, another group that agreed  with our first recommendation, recommended that we or CMS develop  mechanisms in addition to the cost reports to more accurately capture the  resources devoted to providing home dialysis to each patient, but  developing such mechanisms was beyond the scope of this report.", "One group (HDU) agreed with our second recommendation that CMS  examine and, if necessary, revise Medicare payment policies for  physicians to manage the care of dialysis patients, but a second group  (RPA) urged us to reconsider the recommendation out of concern that  implementing it could lead to cuts in physician payments for home  dialysis. While RPA agreed that the current payment method gives  physicians a disincentive for prescribing home dialysis, the group  emphasized that it was only one of numerous factors that affect this  treatment decision. RPA also stated that it would support certain payment  changes that would increase physicians\u2019 incentives to prescribe home  dialysis, which could include using performance measures to promote  home dialysis use. However, RPA expressed concern that the process  CMS may use for examining and potentially revising this payment method  could lead to cuts in physician payments for home dialysis, which RPA  asserted would further discourage its use and be contrary to the intent of  our recommendation. We agree that Medicare\u2019s current method of paying  physicians to manage patients\u2019 dialysis care is one of several factors that  could influence physicians\u2019 decisions to prescribe home dialysis and  described these factors in our report. In addition, while we do not know  what changes, if any, CMS will make to physician payments for managing  patients\u2019 dialysis care, we believe the intent of our recommendation\u2014to  ensure that these payments are consistent with CMS\u2019s goal to encourage  the use of home dialysis when appropriate\u2014is clear.", "Three groups (HDU, NRAA, and RPA) agreed with our third  recommendation that CMS examine the KDE benefit and if appropriate  seek revisions to the categories of providers and patients eligible for the  benefit. RPA also emphasized its agreement with our findings that the  statutory limitations on the providers and patients eligible for the benefit  have contributed to the limited use of the benefit. These groups also  urged other changes to the KDE benefit such as removing the  requirement for a copayment and making documentation requirements  more flexible. The limitations in the categories of eligible providers and  patients were cited in our interviews with stakeholders as the main  reasons for the limited use of the KDE benefit, but we acknowledge that  other opportunities may exist for improving the benefit\u2019s design. NRAA  also pointed out that facilities currently educate patients with chronic  kidney disease on the choice of type of dialysis but are not reimbursed by  Medicare for doing so. We stated in the report that, according to the large  and small dialysis facility chains we interviewed, they have the capacity to  educate such patients about their condition.

For example,  DaVita suggested that the incentive to provide home hemodialysis  could increase if a single entity were financially responsible for all  Medicare services provided to a Medicare patient. This incentive  could increase because, according to DaVita, the cost of inpatient  care may be lower for home hemodialysis patients than for in-center  hemodialysis patients. We agree that choosing one type of dialysis  over another could affect the use of other types of Medicare services,  but examining such implications was beyond the scope of this report.", "NRAA and RPA appreciated that our report addressed the role of  nephrology training programs in the use of home dialysis, and both  groups said that we or CMS should further examine how physicians  can receive greater exposure to home dialysis through these  programs.
