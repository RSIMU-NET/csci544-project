In 1998, the Congress amended HEA to  establish FSA as a performance-based organization (PBO) in order to  address longstanding management weaknesses. Among other  requirements, HEA called for FSA to annually develop 5-year plans that  establish measurable goals and to issue annual reports on the extent to  which the goals were met. The intent of this law was to provide among  other things, a greater level of accountability for FSA\u2019s administration of  programs.  Additionally, HEA requires FSA to seek the opinions and  suggestions of postsecondary institutions and other stakeholders, such as  lenders and borrowers, regarding their delivery system.  Because of the  large volume of dollars at-risk, we undertook this study to determine (1)  what FSA\u2019s default management goals were for fiscal years 2000 through  2002, (2) whether FSA had achieved its stated performance goals, and   (3) whether school officials from schools with large potential losses from  defaults\u2014schools with high default rates or a high volume of dollars in  default\u2014had suggestions that indicated the need for additional default  management goals.", "To achieve our objectives, we reviewed HEA to identify FSA\u2019s roles and  responsibilities, interviewed FSA officials responsible for overseeing and  administering student aid programs, and obtained and analyzed available  data and reports on FSA\u2019s performance goals and accomplishments for  fiscal years 2000--2002. In addition, we interviewed FSA officials regarding  assistance provided to schools, particularly, schools with high default  rates and those with a high volume of dollars in default. We attempted to  contact officials at 31 schools with high default rates or a high volume of  dollars in default to ask them their views of the assistance provided by  FSA and to obtain their suggestions on ways that FSA could better assist  them. Officials from 23 of the 31 schools agreed to participate in our  survey. We conducted our work between September 2002 and January  2003 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. See appendix I for additional information about our scope and  methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Title IV of HEA authorized several student aid programs including the  Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) and the William D. Ford Direct  Loan (Direct Loan) programs, the Federal Pell Grant program, and  campus-based aid programs. The FFEL and Direct Loan programs are the  largest source of aid for students. The FFEL program provides loans to  eligible students and parents through participating private lenders that  receive a federal guarantee of repayment if the borrower defaults. Under  the Direct Loan program, eligible students and parents borrow funds  directly from the federal government through participating schools. As of  October 2002, about 6,400 schools participated in one or more of the title  IV student aid programs. To be eligible to participate in the FFEL and  Direct Loan programs, schools must manage their loan portfolios to keep  the default rate for their loans below established limits.", "The national student loan default rate, also known as the national cohort  default rate (CDR), is defined as the percentage of borrowers who enter  repayment status in a certain fiscal year and default before the end of the  next fiscal year on Federal Stafford Loans and, under certain  circumstances, Federal SLS loans, and Direct Stafford Loans. For example,  the fiscal year 2000 CDR of 5.9 percent represents the percentage of  borrowers whose first loan repayments came due between October 1,  1999, and September 30, 2000, and who, as of September 30, 2001, had  defaulted. The national CDR is an aggregate of all postsecondary  institutional default rates. The CDR for schools with 30 or more borrowers  in repayment is calculated based on the percentage of borrowers entering  repayment on loans in a fiscal year and defaulting during that fiscal year or  the following fiscal year. FSA issues draft CDRs and supporting data to  schools in January or February of each year for review. A school may  challenge the draft default rate information if it identifies inaccuracies in  data.  In addition, a school with CDRs of 25 percent or more for 3  consecutive years can appeal the draft rate if it can show that the number  of students who obtained loans did not exceed approximately 3.8 percent  of the total number of students at the school, while schools with CDRs  over 40 percent in 1 year can appeal the draft rate if it can show that the  number of students who obtained loans did not exceed approximately 6  percent of the total number of students at the school. FSA makes revisions  as needed, and releases the final CDR to the schools and the public no  later than September 30 of each year.", "Unless a school has 30 or fewer borrowers who entered repayment for the  3 most recent fiscal years, it could lose its eligibility to participate in some  title IV student aid programs if its final CDR exceeds established  thresholds. For example, under HEA, if schools have CDRs of 25 percent  or more for 3 consecutive years, they face loss of eligibility to participate  in the FFEL and Direct Loan programs.  A regulation imposes the same  restriction on eligibility if schools have CDRs exceeding 40 percent in a  given year.  Additionally, schools that are ineligible to receive FFEL and  Direct Loans due to CDRs of 25 percent or more for 3 consecutive years  are also generally prohibited by statute from receiving Pell Grants. These  schools are subject to suspension from title IV programs for the remainder  of the fiscal year in which FSA notifies them of termination and the  following 2 fiscal years. However, schools have appeal rights and retain  program eligibility while their appeals are pending. Schools may apply to  be reinstated to participate in title IV loan and/or Federal Pell Grant  programs after the later of the expiration of their suspension or   18 months after the effective date of their termination. Over the last  decade, approximately 1,200 schools have been subject to suspension due  to default rates above the 25 percent threshold for fiscal years 1998  through 2000.", "From fiscal year 1990 to fiscal year 1999, the national student loan default  rate declined from 22.4 percent to 5.6 percent. In fiscal year 2000, the rate  climbed slightly to 5.9 percent. Figure 1 shows the trend in national cohort  default rates from fiscal years 1990 through 2000.", "Despite the overall progress made in reducing the national default rate, the  cumulative student loan funds in default had doubled to almost $22 billion  by fiscal year 2001 from their fiscal year 1990 level of nearly $11 billion.  During this same time period, the total student loan portfolio grew by  more than 400 percent from $54.1 billion to $233.2 billion and the defaults,  as a percent of the total loan portfolio, declined from 20.1 percent to 9.4  percent.

Since 1990, because  of concerns about Education\u2019s vulnerabilities to losses due to fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement, we have included student financial aid  programs on our high-risk list. To address longstanding management  weaknesses, the Congress amended HEA in 1998, establishing FSA as a  performance-based organization (PBO) to improve Education\u2019s delivery of  student financial aid services. As a PBO, FSA has increased flexibilities,  subject to the direction of the Secretary of Education, in certain  government operations, such as hiring and procurement, provided that it  establish and operate according to a 5-year performance plan with  measurable goals and specific annual performance targets. HEA also  requires that FSA annually prepare and submit, through the Secretary of  Education, a 5-year plan that is available to the public, and annual  performance reports to the Congress.  Furthermore, HEA requires FSA\u2019s  Chief Operating Officer (COO) to ask its stakeholders about the degree of  satisfaction with the delivery system and to seek suggestions on  improvements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FSA\u2019s Default Management Goals Were Mostly to Prevent Defaults, Increase Collections, and Verify Student Eligibility, but the Agency Lacked a Plan to Guide its Efforts", "paragraphs": ["FSA identified 39 default management goals for fiscal years 2000 through  2002, which were mainly to prevent defaults, increase collections, or verify  student eligibility.

FSA\u2019s goals to increase  collections focused on facilitating repayment for borrowers in good  standing as well as aggressively pursuing those in default. For example,  they planned to use tools such as Internet billing and on-line  correspondence to facilitate repayment for borrowers in good standing  and used administrative wage garnishments and federal tax refund  recoveries to pursue borrowers in default. These collection goals included  fostering competitive behavior among its private collection agencies to  increase collections on defaulted loans, matching student loan records  with federal databases such as the Health and Human Services (HHS)  National Directory of New Hires database to locate defaulted borrowers,  and using other available default recovery methods. The FSA goals to  improve student eligibility included verifying students\u2019 or their families\u2019  income through a data match with Internal Revenue Service (IRS) records  and apprising foreign postsecondary institutions about the rules and  regulations for title IV assistance and the need to limit financial aid awards  to eligible students only.", "Of FSA\u2019s 39 default management goals during fiscal years 2000 through  2002, 5 were continued throughout the period and 6 more were continued  for 2 of the 3 years. Specifically, the goals that continued for all 3 years  were to maintain the cohort default rate, implement and monitor voluntary  flexible agreements with a limited number of guaranty agencies, reduce  default rates over the life of the loan, increase the recovery rate for  defaulted loans, and increase the number of student aid applications filed  electronically. As for those that continued for 2 years, they addressed   (1) reports to the Congress on the progress and performance of VFAs,   (2) student awareness publications, (3) use of the new hires database,   (4) NSLDS data quality, (5) program monitoring and assistance to schools,  and (6) eliminating fraudulent death and disability cases. Further, most of  these goals began in 2001 and were continued in 2002.", "However, 28 of the 39 goals were single year goals\u20146 were implemented  in fiscal year 2000, another 6 were implemented in fiscal year 2001, and   16 more were implemented in fiscal year 2002. Such significant changes  may reflect the fact that FSA did not have a long-term plan to direct its  default management goals. Although agency officials stated that many of  the goals were reached and did not need to be continued in the next year,  some were discontinued for various other reasons. For example, agency  officials indicated that a 2001 goal to implement a pilot program to track  student enrollment at foreign schools in an effort to reduce the potential  of loans being obtained through fraudulent means was completed.  However, available documents show that the pilot program was  discontinued because a key institution complained that the program  requirements were too burdensome and withdrew from the pilot.  Furthermore, it is not clear from available documentation whether this  program will be revisited or continued in subsequent years, even though  foreign schools collectively administer more than $225 million in federal  student financial assistance. Recently, GAO reported that the agency  certified a fictitious foreign school to participate in the FFEL program and  approved loans for three fictitious students. As such, there continues to be  a need for the agency to have a goal to reduce the potential for students at  foreign schools to obtain loans through fraudulent means.

Officials made   4 suggestions to improve the usefulness of loan data and access to the loan  information in NSLDS. One school official suggested that FSA could  improve the usefulness of NSLDS data by allowing users to distinguish the  principal amount borrowed, the accrued interest, and service charges.

FSA  had goals to improve the NSLDS in 2000 and 2002. FSA\u2019s fiscal year 2000  NSLDS goal was to continue to work with guaranty agencies and lenders  to maintain the quality of data in NSLDS and its fiscal year 2002 NSLDS  goals were to analyze NSLDS data to identify students ineligible for federal  aid. An official from a large public university with a high volume of dollars  in default suggested that FSA provide a profile of the various demographic  groups that make up the school\u2019s CDR. In support of its continuing goal to  keep the default rates low, FSA provides schools\u2014at their request\u2014with  default rate analysis tools to assist them in identifying the defaulted  student population. FSA typically shares information about default  management tools at its National Default Prevention Day symposiums.

The other school  official expressed frustration that FSA staff was not always knowledgeable  about the loan data for her school. This school official suggested that FSA  make certain staff members responsible for knowing about information  related to particular schools.

In addition, we obtained and  analyzed fiscal year 1990 to 2001 trend data on the number of borrowers,  default rates, and dollars in default for the guaranteed and Direct Loan  programs.", "To determine what FSA\u2019s default management goals were for fiscal years  2000 through 2002, we reviewed various FSA internal planning documents,  including program plans for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. These  documents listed the goals for all FSA programs, including the default  management goals. Additionally, we reviewed FSA\u2019s High-Risk Plan for  fiscal year 2002, which summarized the major actions the agency planned  to take with regard to default management and other issues in order to  remove its student financial assistance programs from our high-risk list.  We also interviewed FSA officials responsible for managing and  administering student financial assistance programs in order to clarify  which goals were related to default management. On the basis of these  documents and information obtained from the interviews, we developed a  summary of the default management goals for fiscal years 2000 through  2002.", "To determine whether FSA had achieved the performance targets for its  default management goals, the second objective, we obtained and  analyzed available data and reports related to the performance for fiscal  years 2000, 2001, and 2002 goals. We discussed both the performance  targets achieved and the performance targets missed during interviews  with FSA officials. We determined whether a goal was met or not by  reviewing the agency\u2019s collective efforts over a 3-year period, where  applicable.", "To determine whether school officials from schools with high default rates  or high dollars in default had suggestions that indicated the need for  additional default management goals, our third objective, we reviewed title  IV school eligibility regulations, interviewed FSA officials, analyzed default  data, and surveyed officials from selected schools. We identified and  reviewed title IV eligibility criteria for program participation, including the  cohort default rate (CDR), which is used to determine a school\u2019s  continued eligibility to participate in FFEL, Direct Loan, and Federal Pell  Grant programs and procedures for reinstatement after schools are  removed from the program. We interviewed FSA officials responsible for  assisting schools with their default management efforts to determine the  types of assistance provided to all schools, ascertain whether FSA  provided additional assistance to schools at risk of losing their eligibility  to continue participating in the student loan programs due to high default  rates, and determine whether any additional assistance was provided to  schools with high amounts of dollars in default. We participated in the  2002 National Default Prevention Day held in August 2002 in Washington,  D.C., because this was one of the primary methods FSA officials use to  provide default management information to schools. Additionally, we  reviewed regional listings of school visits made by FSA during fiscal years  2000, 2001, and 2002.", "We obtained data on default rates for fiscal years 1999 and 2000 (about  6,000 schools) and dollars in default for fiscal year 2000 (about 5,000  schools) for all schools that participated in the Title IV programs. We  analyzed fiscal year 1999 default rate data to identify those with default  rates above the regulatory thresholds \u2013 default rates at or above 25 percent  for 3 consecutive years or above 40 percent in one year. We determined  that a total of 55 schools had default rates that exceeded regulatory  thresholds, 46 of these were excluded from our review due to exceptional  mitigating circumstances, such as having 30 or fewer borrowers in  repayment on loans, and the remaining 9 schools were candidates for  removal from the loan programs. FSA officials verified our analysis. We  also obtained and analyzed data on default rates and dollars in default for  fiscal year 2000 to identify schools with default rates between 20 and   24 percent for 3 consecutive years or with default rates between 30 and   39 percent in 1 year\u2014those at risk of removal from the program. We  identified 26 of these schools. In addition, we obtained data from FSA  officials on all schools with defaulted loans (about 4,000) and the amount  of dollars in default for each school. We analyzed the data and identified  47 schools with at least $1 million in defaulted loans as of fiscal year 2000.", "We developed a survey designed to determine the extent that officials  from schools with high default rates and schools with high volumes of  dollars in default were knowledgeable about the methods used by FSA to  assist them, had participated in any of the FSA conferences or used any of  the tools provided by FSA. Additionally, the survey asked the officials  about their views of the assistance provided by FSA and if they had  suggestions about ways that FSA could better assist them. We focused on  schools with high default rates because historically they were a significant  factor contributing to high national cohort default rates, and schools with  high dollars in default because they represent most of the total dollars in  default.", "We selected and attempted to contact officials at 31 postsecondary  schools, which included 4-year institutions, 2-year institutions, and non- degree institutions. Although the 31 schools are not statistically  representative of the universe of postsecondary schools that receive title  IV funds, we selected them to provide a cross-section of schools with high  default rates and high dollars in default. Our sample included all 9 schools  with default rates above regulatory thresholds based on fiscal year 1999  CDRs, the latest data available at the time we drew the sample. We also  randomly selected 12 schools with default rates near regulatory thresholds  based on fiscal year 2000 CDRs, and 10 randomly selected schools with $1  million or more in defaulted loans as of fiscal year 2000. We limited the  number of schools in the randomly selected groups in order to have the  three groups of nearly equal size. In total, directors or financial aid  administrators from 23 schools participated in our survey. The 23 schools  consisted of 7 of the 9 schools with CDRs above regulatory thresholds, 6 of  the 12 schools with CDRs near the regulatory thresholds, and all 10 of the  schools with a high volume of dollars in default.
