Only 27 of the 73 study questions identified as compliance indicators conclusively demonstrated whether a plan was compliant or not. Consequently, the 44 percent reported to have one or more instances of noncompliance is at best an upper limit on the extent of noncompliance found.

IRS monitors plan adherence to requirements primarily through audits but also through periodic compliance studies. Compliance studies are conducted by IRS to better design and implement enforcement activities, such as targeted plan audits, and provide information that IRS can use to inform pension plan sponsors and administrations about key aspects of noncompliance. In 2000, IRS released a study on 401(k) plan compliance with certain statutory requirements that govern tax-qualified plans.", "To conduct the study, IRS selected a sample of 401(k) plans on the basis of information that plan sponsors filed with IRS for the 1993 plan year, and IRS agents answered study questions after they completed audits of these plans. The study, including the audits and data analysis, was conducted between 1995 and 1998, and IRS published the study results in 2000.

In addition, we compared IRS\u2019s study design, data collection, and analysis with published American Statistical Association (ASA) and GAO guidance on conducting research studies. Because IRS was not able to provide us with documentation, data, or both that support the published results, we were not able to assess IRS study results on specific types of noncompliance to verify their accuracy or determine whether the instances of noncompliance that IRS reported were significant. We reviewed IRS work plans in the employee plans area and interviewed IRS officials to identify plans for ongoing and future compliance research initiatives.

With DC plans, employees have individual accounts to which employers, employees, or both make periodic contributions.

In some types of DC plans, including 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans and the Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE), employees may choose to make tax-deferred contributions instead of receiving the same amount as taxable salary.", "IRS and the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration (PWBA) of the Department of Labor are primarily responsible for enforcing laws related to private DC plans. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974, IRS and PWBA jointly enforce standards for coverage and participation, for vesting, and for funding that, respectively, determine how plan participants become eligible to participate in benefit plans, define how participants become eligible to earn rights to benefits, and ensure that plans have sufficient assets to pay promised benefits. IRS also enforces provisions of the IRC that apply to tax-qualified pension plans, including provisions under section 401(k) of the Code. PWBA enforces ERISA\u2019s reporting and disclosure provisions and fiduciary standards, which concern how pension plans should operate in the best interest of participants.", "Since the IRS 401(k) plan compliance study was undertaken in 1995, various changes have occurred in certain legal requirements for tax- qualified status that IRS examined in the study. Certain requirements IRS examined in the 401(k) study are no longer applicable to tax-qualified DC plans or have been materially modified. Also, the IRC has since been amended to permit employers to adopt SIMPLE 401(k) plans and safe- harbor design methods for 401(k) plans. SIMPLE 401(k) plans and safe- harbor designs exempt 401(k) plan sponsors from certain rules that apply generally to 401(k) plans. However, many of the statutory requirements that IRS examined in the 401(k) study have not changed materially. We were not able to assess the extent to which changes in relevant pension laws and 401(k) plan designs have affected the overall prevalence and incidence of noncompliance among the population of 401(k) plans (see app. II for more detail on changes in relevant pension laws since the study was published).", "IRS groups violations of the IRC and corresponding regulations that must be satisfied to achieve tax-qualified status into four categories.", "Plan Document failure occurs when the language of the plan documents does not comply with provisions of the tax Code.", "Operational failure occurs when the implementation and operation of a plan does not comply with provisions of the tax Code.", "Demographic failure occurs when a plan fails to comply with fundamental nondiscrimination requirements faced by all tax-qualified plans.", "Employer Eligibility failure occurs when an employer that is not allowed to establish a section 401(k) plan, such as a state or local government, adopts such a plan.", "IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2001-17 in February 2001 to establish its current framework for promoting the compliance of tax-qualified pension plans with the applicable requirements of the IRC. This framework has evolved since IRS first introduced voluntary compliance procedures in the early 1990s. To promote compliance, IRS developed the Self-Correction Program (SCP), the Voluntary Correction Program (VCP), and the Audit Correction Agreement Program (Audit CAP). SCP is used to correct insignificant Operational failures at any time, without fee or sanction and without IRS supervision. VCP allows plan sponsors to voluntarily report and correct all types of qualification failures with IRS approval. Upon receiving IRS approval of the proposed correction measures, plan sponsors must implement the specified corrective measures and pay a compliance fee, one that is, on average, much less than the financial sanctions assessed for violations identified by IRS audits. The Audit CAP allows plan sponsors to correct all types of qualification failures that IRS identifies through formal audits. Under Audit CAP, plan sponsors must correct all qualification failures and pay a negotiated financial sanction commensurate with the nature, extent, and severity of the failures. If IRS and the plan sponsor do not reach an agreement with respect to the correction of the failure(s), IRS can pursue disqualification of the plan for tax purposes.", "All IRS audits of tax-qualified employer-sponsored plans are carried out under one of two audit programs, the Examination Program or the Compliance Research Program. The Examination Program includes a wide range of compliance-related activities. These activities include auditing based on referrals and computer targeting, training for IRS examiners who perform plan audits, and reviewing closed audit cases. The Compliance Research Program sponsors studies, such as the 401(k) study, to identify and monitor noncompliance among private plans. Compliance studies are based on plan audits, which IRS conducts so that it can collect study data. IRS is in various stages of planning and conducting compliance research on several types of private pensions, and intends to use data from these studies to develop more effective enforcement and compliance activities. However, plan audits conducted under the auspices of the Compliance Research Program represent a small proportion of IRS\u2019s total audit activity. In fiscal year 2001, IRS plans allocated a total of 1,845 staff days to audits for the Compliance Research Program, compared with 33,734 staff days allocated to audits for the Examination Program. For fiscal year 2002, IRS plans to increase the number of staff days related to compliance research activities, but direct examination activities will still constitute the majority of IRS\u2019s audit work.", "Audits of employer pension plans are initiated when the IRS selects for audit a plan return, or form 5500 filing, from the Return Inventory Classification System. A notification letter is sent to the plan sponsor with a request for information that the examiner needs to complete the audit. IRS examiners complete a process that includes interviewing the plan benefits administrator, reviewing plan documents, and holding a closing conference to discuss the results of the audit with the plan sponsor. If an examiner finds a qualification issue, or a failure that can potentially disqualify a plan\u2019s tax-exempt status, the examiner can resolve the violation through correction under IRS\u2019s SCP (Self-Correction Program disposal) or enter into a closing agreement with the plan sponsor through the Audit CAP (closing agreement disposal). Both of these audit disposal methods indicate that the examiner identified a violation that could potentially disqualify the plan, but the Audit CAP closing represents a more significant disposal than correction under the SCP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Audited a Sample of 401(k) Plans to Estimate Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["IRS audited a sample of 401(k) plans to collect data and estimate noncompliance with certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code.

IRS identified 143,535 plans that reported a 401(k) plan feature, but excluded about 470 plans prior to sample selection, because these plans had no participants at the end of 1993 or had recently been audited by IRS.

To create a sample of 525 plans, IRS randomly drew equal numbers of plans from these small, medium, and large categories. The method that IRS used to create the sample of 525 401(k) plans from these categories was basically equivalent to drawing a simple random sample in which each plan had an equal probability of selection. However, before drawing 175 plans from each of these three groups, IRS carved out the 25 largest plans from the large-plan category and put these plans into a separate group that it called \u201csuper- large plans\u201d; this super large category was selected as a 100 percent sample of the largest 401(k) plans. Taken together, IRS\u2019s sampling method was intended to produce a representative sample from, and reliable results for, the 401(k) plan population.

IRS used this available questionnaire to collect data relevant to its study objective of measuring 401(k) plan compliance. Once the study questionnaires were completed, they were sent to IRS Employee Plans headquarters for review and data analysis.

IRS analyses counted 251 instances of noncompliance that it categorized by requirements to which tax-qualified 401(k) plans should adhere. In total, the study publication uses 16 categories, such as nondiscrimination, loans, coverage, vesting, and participation, to report on various types of noncompliance that IRS found among the 401(k) plans in the study. For each of the compliance categories, the study publication reports the total number of violations that occurred. According to the study report, the total number of violations for each compliance category cannot be correlated to the number of plans containing these violations because some plans may have contained more than one violation within a category.

Initially, IRS used its noncompliance indicator data to produce estimates of 401(k) plan noncompliance. For some plans, however, IRS found problems with the data for specific compliance indicators. During its analysis, IRS told us that it sometimes discovered instances in which data for certain compliance indicators were found to be either inaccurate or insufficient to determine whether an instance of noncompliance had occurred. However, IRS\u2019s discovery of discrepancies in the data was not the result of systematically reviewing all the compliance indicator data for each plan in the study. Instead, in some of these instances where IRS discovered problems with its compliance indicator data, these data were compared with information that IRS routinely captures about the results of their plan audits. According to IRS, analysts who worked on the data analysis met occasionally to review the data recorded on the study questionnaires and to determine whether the compliance study data were sufficient to identify noncompliance. After comparing the compliance indicator data with the other information that IRS collects on their audits of these 401(k) plans, the analysts made adjustments to the compliance indicator data. However, IRS analysts sometimes adjusted the data solely on the basis of their assessments that specific compliance indicators were not reliable or sufficient to determine whether or not a violation had occurred. Because these adjustments were not based on a systematic review of the accuracy and sufficiency of the data, we could not determine whether the adjustments that IRS made resolved all potential problems with its compliance indicator data.", "These adjustments changed noncompliant plans to compliant, and vice versa.

We asked IRS analysts involved in the study\u2019s data analysis to evaluate the 73 questions that were selected as compliance indicators and determine whether these questions could definitively demonstrate a compliance violation. In evaluating each of the compliance indicators, IRS assessed whether the answers to these questions would provide information that was relevant to, or suggestive of, noncompliance or in fact demonstrated an instance of noncompliance. As a result of this evaluation, the IRS analysts identified only 27 questions that could definitively demonstrate noncompliance. In contrast, IRS determined that the remaining 46 questions were not sufficient by themselves to demonstrate noncompliance because potential problems rendered these indicators less conclusive. Although a positive response was generally sufficient to demonstrate compliance, the IRS analysts whom we spoke with told us that additional information would be needed to determine whether or not negative answers to these questions conclusively indicated noncompliance. Consequently, the 44 percent of plans reported to have one or more compliance violations is at best an upper-bound estimate of the extent of noncompliance found in this study because the reported results are not limited to those items with sufficient information to identify noncompliance.", "IRS\u2019s compliance indicators were not initially developed to specifically identify and substantiate noncompliance among 401(k) plans and the answers were not validated as accurately demonstrating noncompliance. Instead of formulating study questions that were directly relevant and sufficient to demonstrate noncompliance, IRS used an already available questionnaire that had been developed as part of a broad information- gathering project. This broadly scoped research project had been revised to address the narrower objective of 401(k) plan compliance. Only after administering the check sheet and collecting the data did IRS identify the study questions that it expected to demonstrate noncompliance. As a result, most of the 254 questions on the questionnaire were not directly relevant to the study objective of estimating noncompliance among 401(k) plans. Also, some of the answers expected to demonstrate noncompliance from IRS\u2019s analysis of noncompliance indicator data were found to be suggestive, rather than demonstrative, of noncompliance. Although IRS, to help ensure ease in recording the answers, pretested the software that its examiners used to complete the study questionnaires, it did not pretest the study questions. Because IRS did not pretest the questionnaire for the accuracy and appropriateness of the answers, problems with the questionnaire were not identified or remedied before the data were collected. For example, answers might have more accurately reflected the types of information that were being sought if a preliminary evaluation and pretesting of the 73 compliance indicators had been used to improve the wording of the questions and the instructions provided to the examiners collecting the information.", "We found that the accuracy of IRS estimates was also hampered by the lack of adequate training for examiners who filled out the study questionnaires after completing the audits. Each field office sent representatives to a kickoff conference that provided training for the 401(k) study. However, the training did not address which study questions would be used to distinguish compliance from noncompliance, because IRS identified these questions after the data were collected. Additionally, IRS told us that uniform audit standards were not developed to guide examiners in conducting the audits and in using the audit information to answer the study questions. As a result, an IRS analyst responsible for the data analysis stated that the 401(k) plan audits were not uniform and that some of the data were not collected consistently. Further, the representatives trained were not the examiners expected to conduct the audits and complete the subsequent questionnaires but rather the field office representatives charged with managing the local data collection efforts and transmitting data to headquarters for analysis. However, the field office representatives did not receive information regarding which questions would be used to distinguish compliance from noncompliance and thus could not relay this information to the auditing examiners.", "Despite the discovery of inaccurate and inconsistent answers, IRS did not systematically verify the accuracy of all the data analyzed. Instead, the IRS analyst who summarized the study data told us that he made some judgmental corrections to obviously incorrect or inconsistent answers rather than ordering the relevant closed case file or contacting the relevant examiner to obtain valid and accurate answers. As a result, some answers to certain study questions were not used in IRS\u2019s final estimates of 401(k) plan noncompliance and others were used but judgmentally adjusted. In addition, the use of additional information to revise estimates of noncompliance was not well documented. We could not verify the revisions in IRS estimates, because IRS was not able to provide us with a single complete data file to check whether its reclassifications of plans as compliant or noncompliant were accurate. More complete documentation would have helped IRS ensure that it accurately estimated the proportion of plans that had one or more compliance errors and the frequency of occurrence for specific violations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reported Results Cannot Be Generalized to Broader 401(k) Plan Population", "paragraphs": ["Not all of the IRS study findings could be generalized to the broader population of all 401(k) plans, a fact that makes them less useful.

For example, the report estimates that 53 percent of the 162 medium plans audited had no violations. This figure can also be used as an estimate of the percentage of medium-size plans in the broader population that had no violations (other data issues notwithstanding). However, in cases where compliance information was aggregated to include results from more than one group, such results are not reliable estimates for compliance errors of other plans in these groups. IRS sampled all of the super-large 401(k) plans to ensure their inclusion in the study. Because the super-large plans were a 100 percent sample and the plans sampled in the other plan-size categories each represented about 1,000 plans from the total population, combining sample results for these groups without weighting them gives the super-large plans more influence in the final answer than is warranted by their representation in the total 401(k) plan population. Proper weighting of all sample cases is necessary to make tabulations and other estimates that can be generalized to the broader 401(k) population. In some cases, information from large and super-large plans was combined for reporting. In other cases, information was combined for all plans studied. For example, the report estimates that 56 percent of the 171 large and super-large plans studied had no compliance errors and that 56 percent of all 472 plans studied had no errors. In these cases where IRS has combined information for all plans in the study or for two plan-size categories, the reported percentages do not represent the percentages in the corresponding population of 401(k) plans. If IRS\u2019s analysis had accounted for its sampling methodology, it is possible that IRS would have produced estimates similar to the reported results of the 401(k) study because the reported estimates of the proportion of plans with one or more instances of noncompliance were similar across plan- size categories.", "Furthermore, the 401(k) study findings cannot be used as estimates of noncompliance among the current population of 401(k) plans. To assess whether the 401(k) study results reflect the level and types of noncompliance among the current population of 401(k) plans, the data that support the published results would need further analysis to account for changes that have occurred in relevant pension laws since the study was undertaken. Although the 401(k) study publication describes changes to relevant pension laws that occurred during the course of the study, it is not possible to determine how these changes have affected noncompliance among 401(k) plans by simply examining the study findings.

According to IRS, these guidelines will help IRS examiners, including examiners involved in compliance studies, collect and record information consistently and accurately.", "IRS told us that it intends to incorporate other improvements into its upcoming 401(k) plan compliance studies. For example, IRS said that examiners who participate in upcoming IRS compliance studies will have a role in developing the questionnaires used to collect compliance study data, and IRS will pretest compliance study questionnaires to help determine their usefulness and the accuracy of the information that they are intended to collect. Also, IRS is developing automated tools that its examiners will use to record answers to compliance study questions. Automated tools that IRS examiners can use to collect information during the course of an audit have been developed for the 401(k) plans but are still in development for other plan segments.

The findings from such studies can provide data on the prevalence and types of noncompliance among pension plans, helping IRS shape its enforcement efforts. For example, IRS can use compliance study findings to identify key aspects of noncompliance among specific types of plans and develop targeted audits and other activities to address compliance issues. In recent years, IRS enforcement efforts have placed greater emphasis on voluntary correction procedures\u2014that is, encouraging plan sponsors to correct violations that are discovered. Information on noncompliance that is useful and accurate could help improve targeting for audits and enhance voluntary compliance initiatives that assist plan sponsors in discovering and making such corrections. Compliance research can also measure the impact of such efforts to determine whether they are effective.", "The more accurate the findings from compliance studies, the better able IRS is to ensure that plans are operating in accordance with applicable requirements, so that participants receive the coverage and benefits to which they are entitled. Compliance study findings can help IRS tailor its initiatives to identify, monitor, and address the most essential aspects of noncompliance among specific types of pension plans and measure whether its activities are effective in promoting compliance among plan sponsors. IRS recognizes the need to improve the way it conducts compliance studies and is in the process of implementing specific steps to improve aspects of planning and conducting these studies. Since IRS compliance research is focused on other types of plans besides 401(k) plans, it is important that IRS consistently implement these steps throughout its ongoing and future compliance research initiatives.", "Several shortcomings of the 1995 IRS 401(k) study undercut its effectiveness in meeting IRS\u2019s research objective of estimating the extent and types of noncompliance among 401(k) plans. These shortcomings cut across important components of the 401(k) study, including questionnaire design, data collection, and data analysis. Whether these and other elements of research are designed and carried-out in a sound manner help determine the effectiveness of research studies in meeting their objectives. For example, the 1995 401(k) study questions were not pretested to determine whether they would have produced demonstrative data on noncompliance, and examiners who completed the study questionnaires were not provided with training on answering the questions in an accurate and uniform manner. To ensure the accuracy of its findings, IRS will need to build steps into its compliance studies that improve the accuracy and usefulness of the data that are collected, analyzed, and reported. Additionally, documenting a research study can help produce evidence that supports the answers to the research questions. Insufficient documentation limits the perceived accuracy and the usefulness of a research study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure the quality and usefulness of ongoing and future compliance studies in providing information that enhances IRS\u2019s efforts to promote compliance among private pension plans, IRS should take steps to improve how it conducts compliance study research.

Without this information, we could not make the appropriate sample weight adjustments to assess IRS estimates of the overall prevalence of noncompliance among all plans in the study or within specific plan size categories. Furthermore, the lack of a complete data set or comprehensive documentation supporting the published results limited our ability to reliably assess revisions in IRS estimates of the proportion of plans that had one or more compliance errors and the frequency with which specific types of errors occurred among the plans in the study. Additionally, the inability of IRS to provide closed case file information on audited plans limited our ability to assess the reliability of the data collected for analysis.", "In light of these limitations, we elected to assess to what extent the IRS study provides accurate estimates on 401(k) plan noncompliance by evaluating, in relation to published guidance for conducting research, how the study was conducted.

Our summary of recent changes in applicable laws is grouped by the compliance categories that IRS used to present its 401(k) study results.", "Neither the IRS 401(k) study report nor this appendix should be regarded as a comprehensive explanation of the laws that relate to tax-qualified pension plans in general and tax-qualified 401(k) plans in particular. While this appendix provides context where necessary to understand how EGTRRA provisions change certain pension laws, it does not provide a history or complete description of the purpose and nature of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) requirements that EGTRRA changes. The published 401(k) study report provides more in-depth description of the purpose and requirements of the specific IRC provisions that IRS examined as part of its 401(k) study.", "A. Distributions Eligible For Rollover Treatment EGTRRA section 636(b) mandates that any distribution made upon hardship of an employee will not be an eligible rollover distribution. Thus, no assets distributed to an employee on account of his or her hardship will be eligible for direct rollover to another plan or individual retirement account (IRA). Such distributions will therefore be subject to the withholding rules applicable to distributions that are not eligible rollover distributions.", "Section 401(a)(31) of the Code provides that participants receiving an eligible rollover distribution must have the option to have the distribution transferred in the form of a direct rollover to another eligible retirement plan. If an eligible rollover distribution is not transferred by a direct rollover, the distribution is subject to withholding at a 20% rate, under section 3405(c)(1).", "Regulations under section 401(k) currently provide that elective (pre-tax) deferrals under a 401(k) plan can, if the plan provides, be distributed (without earnings) in the event of the financial hardship of the employee. The regulations provide that a distribution is made on account of hardship only if the distribution is made on account of an immediate and heavy financial need of the employee and the distribution is necessary to satisfy such financial need. Under pre-EGTRRA law, hardship withdrawals of elective deferral amounts under 401(k) plans were not eligible for rollover, while other types of hardship distributions (e.g., employer matching contributions distributed on account of hardship) were eligible rollover distributions. Different withholding rules apply to eligible rollover distributions than to distributions that are not eligible rollover distributions.", "EGTTRA section 641(c) also provides for an expanded explanation to recipients of rollover distributions. This provision requires that the rollover notice include a description of the provisions under which distributions from the eligible retirement plan receiving the distribution may be subject to restrictions and tax consequences which are different from those applicable to the plan making the distribution.", "Effective for distributions after December 31, 2001, EGTRRA section 641 allows rollovers among 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans, or governmental section 457 plans. EGTRRA section 657 mandates that unless the participant elects otherwise, any eligible rollover distribution in excess of $1,000 that may be distributed without the participant\u2019s consent be automatically rolled over to a designated IRA. This change applies to distributions that occur after the Department of Labor issues final regulations implementing section 657.", "Section 642(a) of EGTRRA provides that an eligible rollover distribution from an IRA may be rolled over to another IRA or an eligible retirement plan as long as the amount is transferred no later than 60 days after the date the distribution was received.", "Section 642(b)(3) of EGTRRA provides that a distribution from a Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA may also be rolled over to another SIMPLE IRA.", "Under pre-EGTRRA law, elective (pre-tax) deferrals may not be distributed earlier than one of the events described in section 401(k)(2)(B) or section 401(k)(10). EGTRRA modifies these rules as they apply in the case of a corporate transaction, such as an asset or stock sale, that results in employees of the seller going to work for the buyer. Pre-EGTRRA law permits distribution in the case of certain types of transactions but not others. EGTRRA section 646 amends section 401(k)(2)(B) by replacing \u201cseparation from service\u201d with the more lenient standard of \u201cseverance from employment.\u201d This generally will permit distributions to employees who move from seller to buyer in connection with a corporate transaction, unless corresponding assets of the seller\u2019s plan move as well.

Second, it specifies that in determining whether or not a plan is top heavy, only distributions made within the preceding 1 year, rather than the preceding 5 years (except for in-service distributions, for which the 5-year rule will continue to apply) must be added. Third, it requires that matching contributions to a top-heavy plan be counted in determining whether nonkey employees have received the required minimum benefit. Last, it states that certain plans meeting safe- harbor requirements applicable to the nondiscrimination rules regarding 401(k) and matching contributions will automatically be deemed to not be top heavy, and frozen defined benefit plans (with respect to which there are no current benefit accruals for current or former key employees) will be exempt from certain of the minimum accrual requirements.
