The Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) awards CARE Act funding to grantees that include states, territories, and metropolitan areas. Because minorities have been disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, the CARE Act's Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI) provides funding through five parts (A, B, C, D, and F) of the act with the goal of reducing HIV-related health care disparities among minorities. The reauthorization of CARE Act programs changed the process by which HRSA awards MAI grants under Part A (funding for metropolitan areas) and Part B (for states and territories) from a formula based solely on demographics of the metropolitan area, state, or territory to a competitive process. The CARE Act requires GAO to report on MAI and related issues. This report provides information on (1) the effect on grantees and service providers of the new competitive process for awarding Part A and B MAI funds, (2) the types of services grantees funded under MAI, and (3) barriers to minorities obtaining services from HIV/AIDS programs that were identified by grantees. GAO surveyed CARE Act grantees and interviewed selected grantee and HRSA officials. GAO also reviewed Part A and B MAI applications."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The new competitive process for Parts A and B altered MAI funding amounts from what they would have been under the old formula-based process, increased administrative requirements for grantees, and resulted in continued funding for existing initiatives to reduce health disparities for minorities. In determining the award amounts under the new process, HRSA considered the number of minorities with HIV/AIDS living in the grantee metropolitan area, state, or territory, along with the MAI applications grantees were required to file. The quality of the grant applications sometimes resulted in considerable differences in grantees' share of MAI funds from what they would have received under the old process. Part A and B grantees that received MAI funding told us that the administrative requirements increased significantly because of the new process. All Part A and B grantees that applied for MAI funding received it, but some Part B grantees decided that the administrative requirements, including a separate application for MAI funds, were not worth the amount of funds that they expected to receive and therefore chose not to apply. Grantees generally funded the same service providers and initiatives to reduce minority health disparities as they had in prior years. After the reauthorization of CARE Act programs, MAI grantees continued to fund a range of core medical services, which include essential medical care services, and support services, which are services needed for individuals with HIV/AIDS to achieve their medical outcomes. Consistent with HRSA guidance, the types of services funded under MAI generally did not differ from services provided with other CARE Act funds. The five services Part A grantees funded most frequently were medical case management, outpatient and ambulatory health services, outreach services, substance abuse outpatient care, and mental health services--outreach services being the only support service among these. Part B grantees used MAI funds for efforts associated with the CARE Act-funded HIV/AIDS drug program, Part C and D grantees funded a range of core medical and support services with MAI funds, and Part F grantees used MAI funds for education efforts targeting health care professionals who are from, or primarily serve, minority communities. Grantees identified many barriers that make it more difficult for minorities to obtain services from HIV/AIDS programs, including those funded by the CARE Act. Barriers to HIV/AIDS care can delay or prevent individuals' timely entrance into, or continuation of, core medical or support services, thus reducing the likely success of care. The barriers grantees identified included the presence of other diseases that impact immune systems, housing issues, and poverty. In commenting on this report, HHS suggested that we identify the law authorizing Ryan White programs as either Title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) or the Ryan White HIV/AIDS program. We continue to refer to the law authorizing Ryan White programs as the CARE Act, but have clarified that it refers to Title XXVI of PHSA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have been  disproportionately affected by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  (AIDS) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the beginning of  the HIV/AIDS epidemic. According to the most recent Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) data, 60 percent of all estimated AIDS cases  since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic have been among racial and  ethnic minorities and in 2006 racial and ethnic minorities represented 69  percent of AIDS cases and 67 percent of estimated new HIV infections.  Since the first U.S. cases of what would become known as AIDS were  reported in June 1981, over 1 million people in the United States have been  infected with HIV, including almost 550,000 who have already died and  over 1 million living with HIV/AIDS today. The Ryan White Comprehensive  AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (CARE Act), administered by the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Health Resources and  Services Administration (HRSA), was enacted to address the needs of  jurisdictions, health care providers, and people with HIV/AIDS and their  family members. Total CARE Act grant funding was approximately   $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2007. The Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI), first  known as the Congressional Black Caucus Initiative, originated in fiscal  year 1999 and it included the provision of funds to CARE Act grantees to  reduce HIV-related disparities in access to health care and to improve  health-related outcomes among racial and ethnic minority populations.  Total MAI grant funding in fiscal year 2007 was approximately   $131.2 million, representing 6 percent of overall CARE Act grant funding.  Organizations that provide care to minorities living with HIV/AIDS have  suggested that barriers exist for minorities in accessing HIV/AIDS services,  which often make it more difficult for minorities living with HIV/AIDS to  receive treatment and other HIV/AIDS services. Barriers to HIV/AIDS care  can delay or prevent minorities\u2019 timely entrance into, or continuation of,  HIV/AIDS services, thus reducing the likely success of those services.", "The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 (RWTMA)  reauthorized CARE Act programs for fiscal year 2007 through fiscal year  2009 and included new provisions on MAI. There are five primary sections  of the CARE Act under which HRSA awards grants\u2014Parts A, B, C, D, and  F. Together, grants made under these provisions annually fund services  for approximately 500,000 people living with or affected by HIV/AIDS.  CARE Act Part A provides for grants to selected metropolitan areas\u2014 known as eligible metropolitan areas (EMA) and transitional grant areas  (TGA)\u2014that have been disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS  epidemic. Part B provides for grants to states and territories to improve  quality, availability, and organization of HIV/AIDS services. Part C provides  for grants to public and private nonprofit entities to provide early  intervention services, such as HIV testing and ambulatory care. Part D  provides for grants to programs for family-centered comprehensive care to  children, youth, and women and their families. Part F provides for grants  for demonstration and evaluation of innovative models of HIV/AIDS care  delivery for hard-to-reach populations and training of health care  providers. Part E does not provide for funding for HIV/AIDS services but  rather includes provisions to address various administrative functions. To  be eligible for MAI funds, grantees must also have received CARE Act   Part A, B, C, D, or F funds.", "Grantees can arrange with service providers to offer essential medical  care, referred to as core medical services, as well as support services  needed to achieve positive medical outcomes.

The CARE Act now requires HRSA to award MAI funds  under Parts A and B according to a competitive process. Under this new  process, HRSA evaluates grantee applications for MAI funds in addition to  the demographic characteristics of the jurisdictions.", "The CARE Act requires us to report on MAI and related issues. In this  report, we provide information on (1) the effect on grantees and service  providers of the new competitive process for awarding Part A and B MAI  funds, (2) the types of services grantees funded under MAI, and   (3) barriers to minorities obtaining services from HIV/AIDS programs that  were identified by grantees. The CARE Act also requires us to report on  the challenges of integrating CARE Act\u2013funded programs with HIV/AIDS  programs funded from other sources, such as Medicaid, Medicare, CDC,  and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. (See  app. I for information on the challenges of HIV/AIDS program integration  experienced by CARE Act grantees.)", "To determine the effect on grantees and service providers of the new  competitive process for awarding Part A and B MAI funds, we conducted a  Web-based survey of CARE Act fiscal year 2007 Part A and B grantees to  learn how the grantees applied for funds, distributed funds to service  providers, and provided oversight, and what services they provided prior  to and after the enactment of RWTMA. The survey response rates were  about 77 percent (43 of 56) for Part A and about 81 percent (48 of 59) for  Part B. Also, we created estimated funding amounts for Part A and B  grantees based on the old formula-based process and analyzed the  difference between these amounts and the actual funding for fiscal year  2007. To create these estimated funding amounts, we reviewed CARE Act  MAI funding data for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, case counts of minorities  living with AIDS for fiscal year 2006, and case counts of minorities living  with HIV/AIDS for fiscal year 2007, all of which were provided by HRSA.  We used this information to assess the effect of the new competitive  process on MAI funding. (See app. II for more information on the survey  and how estimated funding amounts were determined.) To assess the  validity of the funding amounts, we compared data we received from  HRSA to previously published funding amounts. We provided HRSA  officials with a copy of our tables, and they agreed with our methodology.  We determined that the funding data and case count data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "Additionally, we reviewed HRSA\u2019s policies and reporting requirements  under MAI for Part A and B grantees. We interviewed HRSA officials and  staff from selected grantees for Parts A and B to determine how funds  were distributed and how grantees provided oversight. We selected  grantees to interview based on the amount of MAI funding they received  and their location to ensure geographic diversity.

Barriers to HIV/AIDS  care can include issues such as histories of substance abuse disorders or  domestic violence. For example, research studies show that individuals  living with HIV/AIDS who also have substance abuse disorders and are  actively using substances are less likely to adhere to medical care.  Barriers to care, such as lack of transportation to medical care or social  stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, can also affect minority communities.

For example, if a Part A  grantee\u2019s minority case count accounted for 4 percent of the total number  of minority AIDS cases in all eligible metropolitan areas, that grantee  would receive 4 percent of the total available Part A MAI funds. The new  competitive MAI process, as implemented by HRSA, considers the  minority case count in determining a grantee\u2019s MAI award, but does so in  conjunction with the grantee\u2019s MAI application score. Because a grantee\u2019s  MAI application score is considered along with the number of HIV/AIDS  cases in the metropolitan area, state, or territory, there is no longer a one- to-one relationship between an applicant\u2019s proportion of cases and its  proportion of MAI grant funding. As a result, we found differences  between the amounts many grantees would have received under the old  formula-based process and the amounts they received under the new  competitive process. For example, in fiscal year 2007, Phoenix received  $127,578 (39.8 percent) less than it would have received under the old  formula, while Houston received $154,018 (10.9 percent) more. In addition,  in some cases we found that grantees with a lower number of HIV/AIDS  cases received more funding under MAI than grantees with a higher  number of HIV/AIDS cases because of their competitive scores.

Grantees explained that integrating the Part A  and Part B base funding program activities with MAI activities has become  difficult because under the new process, these activities must be reported  separately. Reporting on MAI activities has also been made substantially  more difficult because of HRSA\u2019s designation of different fiscal years for  different CARE Act grant programs.

In interviews, Part C and D MAI grantees generally reported  funding core medical and support services based on their clients\u2019 needs as  well as their organizational missions. For example, five Part D MAI  grantees reported focusing their services on the needs of women and  youth, including offering child care services and targeted case  management. The CARE Act restricts the use of Part B MAI funds to  efforts related to increasing the number of minorities in ADAP. Part F MAI  grantees told us that they use MAI funds for education efforts targeting  health care professionals who are from, or primarily serve, minority  communities. These education efforts are similar to services they fund  using other CARE Act grants.", "Some MAI grantees reported changing the mix of services they funded  from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2007. Grantees we interviewed  said that they changed the mix of services they funded to comply with the  requirement added by RWTMA that at least 75 percent of grant funding be  spent for core medical services. Among the 43 respondents to our survey  of Part A grantees, the number of MAI grantees funding medical case  management more than doubled from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year  2007, while the number funding nonmedical case management decreased  by a third. In addition, Part A grantees indicated changes in the types of  support services they funded from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year  2007. Survey results showed increases in the number of grantees providing  referrals to health care services and transportation services and a decrease  in the number providing outreach services. Some Part A grantees reported  that since the enactment of RWTMA, they have had to curtail support  services such as housing, emergency financial assistance, and client  advocacy as well as capacity building in historically underrepresented  communities. Furthermore, in interviews, some grantees reported  changing the types of services they funded as a result of RWTMA\u2019s  enactment. For example, two grantees, one Part A and one Part B,  reported changing existing case management services to fit within the  medical case management definition, which includes, for example, the  coordination and follow-up of medical treatments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MAI Grantees Identified Multiple Barriers to Minorities\u2019 Access to the Services Provided by HIV/AIDS Programs", "paragraphs": ["MAI grantees identified multiple barriers that make it difficult for  minorities to obtain services through HIV/AIDS programs. Similar to the  barriers minorities face, in general, in obtaining health care, these barriers  present challenges for individuals in obtaining HIV/AIDS services that may  not only prevent or delay entry into care but could also decrease  adherence to treatment. Barriers to minorities\u2019 access to HIV/AIDS  services are often interconnected and include issues such as a lack of  transportation to HIV/AIDS services, mistrust of service providers, lacking  or insufficient insurance, homelessness, poverty, and language issues.  Language issues, for example, suggest the need for the linguistic services  of an interpreter or translated materials to receive HIV/AIDS services. If a  minority must overcome language issues in order to receive HIV/AIDS  services and cannot do so, then these issues become a barrier to obtaining  HIV/AIDS services. Complications for care, such as comorbidities, also  were reported as barriers to minorities obtaining HIV/AIDS services.", "We found that Part A and B grantees generally identified similar barriers in  their MAI applications. Table 5 shows the 10 barriers to minorities  obtaining HIV/AIDS services most frequently identified by Part A and B  MAI grantees. They identified co-morbidities, housing issues, and poverty  as the top three barriers to care, with at least 8 out of 10 grantees  identifying each barrier. Co-morbidities can include hypertension, mental  illness, sexually transmitted infections/diseases, and tuberculosis.  Unstable housing can prevent minorities with HIV/AIDS from accessing  health care and adhering to complex HIV/AIDS treatments because they  often must attend to more immediate needs, such as obtaining food and  shelter. Poverty, defined by the federal government according to income  thresholds that vary by family size and composition, can have similar  implications. Appendix IV provides descriptions and a more complete list  of barriers identified by Part A and B grantees in their fiscal year 2007 MAI  competitive grant applications.", "In our interviews, grantees under Parts C, D, and F also described many of  the issues in table 5 as barriers to minorities obtaining HIV/AIDS services.  Grantees explained that HIV/AIDS care may not be the primary issue on an  individual\u2019s list of needs or concerns. Without overall programs to support  these competing needs, minorities will experience barriers to obtaining  HIV/AIDS medical services. For example, some grantees discussed  barriers related to language issues within some minority communities. A  Part C grantee identified the lack of bilingual health care providers as a  major barrier to care for minorities served by the grantee. The director of a  Part C grantee explained that stigma associated with HIV/AIDS is a barrier  for some minorities because they are less likely to seek services within  their communities for fear of revealing that they have HIV/AIDS. Part F  grantees we interviewed stated that the barriers to care included the lack  of specialty care, mistrust of health systems by patients, and the lack of  insurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["HHS provided comments on a draft of this report.

Challenges to program integration are issues that can prevent grantees and  service providers from working together to coordinate HIV/AIDS service  provision and can prevent clear communication between these  organizations regarding funding and program requirements. To identify the  challenges to HIV/AIDS program integration experienced by CARE Act  grantees, we interviewed staff from selected Part A, B, C, D, and F  grantees. To gather background information about the challenges to  HIV/AIDS program integration experienced by CARE Act grantees, we  interviewed officials from the Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Health and Human Services  and staff of the National Minority AIDS Council, Kaiser Family  Foundation, the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors,  and the Communities Advocating Emergency AIDS Relief Coalition.", "Grantees reported that few challenges exist to HIV/AIDS program  integration. Many grantees and service providers funded under different  parts of the CARE Act interact with other grantees, service providers, and  federal and state HIV/AIDS programs to provide services. However, few  problems were identified. For example, an official from a grantee told us  that the organization promotes program integration by designing its  services to create a \u201cseamless flow\u201d of care for individuals. This includes  using targeted outreach programs to bring minorities into care and  providing case management services. The service provider then follows up  with minority individuals through case management services as well as  mental health, substance abuse, and psychosocial support services, as  needed.", "Grantees reported few challenges to HIV/AIDS program integration even  though they receive funding from multiple sources to provide HIV/AIDS  services. Funding for HIV/AIDS programs to provide services can come  from Medicaid, Medicare, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) grants, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration (SAMHSA) grants, and state programs. Grantees we  interviewed may receive funding from a variety of federal and state  sources. However, CARE Act grants are designated as the \u201cpayer of last  resort\u201d and therefore pay for HIV/AIDS services that are not covered by  other resources, such as Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurance. Some  grantees reported in interviews that they have mechanisms in place to  ensure that these CARE Act programs are the payers of last resort, which  usually consists of closely tracking funding and expenditures on services  rendered for individuals, and to identify the appropriate program to pay  for HIV/AIDS services for individuals, including those with specific needs.", "One challenge some grantees identified was a lack of uniform data  collection and reporting requirements across the multiple parts of the  CARE Act, even though the required data are similar. Some grantees we  interviewed told us that differences in data collection and reporting  systems are challenges to program integration across the multiple parts of  the CARE Act.", "Another challenge to achieving program integration is that definitions of  services may differ between the CARE Act and other federal and state  funding sources. Officials from a Part B grantee told us that differing  definitions present challenges to collaboration and integration because  grantees and service providers may be referencing different services  despite using the same term. For example, the definition of \u201ccase  management\u201d is different depending on whether one uses the term in  reference to the CARE Act or to another federally funded program, such as  the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The CARE Act requires us to report on the Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI)  and related issues.

The CARE Act also  requires us to report on the challenges of integrating CARE Act\u2013funded  programs with HIV/AIDS programs funded from other sources such as  Medicaid, Medicare, the Centers for Disease, Control and Prevention and  SAMHSA. (See app. I for information on the challenges of HIV/AIDS  program integration experienced by CARE Act grantees.)", "To determine the effect of the new competitive process for awarding MAI  funds on grantees and service providers, we conducted a Web-based  survey of CARE Act grantees under Parts A and B. We obtained contact  information for Part A and Part B grantee officials, including names and   e-mail addresses, from HRSA. The survey questions focused on how  grantees applied for MAI funds, distributed funds to service providers, and  provided oversight, and what services they provided prior to and after the  passage of the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006  (RWTMA). We included in the survey Part B grantees that did not apply for  MAI funding for fiscal year 2007 in order to obtain their reasons for not  applying. The survey response rates were about 77 percent (43 out of 56)  for Part A grantees and about 81 percent (48 out of 59) for Part B grantees.", "During the development of our survey, we conducted pretests with two  Part A grantees (in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland) and two   Part B grantees (in Georgia and Pennsylvania). We opened the survey on   May 15, 2008, and closed it on June 27, 2008. While the survey was open,  we contacted each nonrespondent by e-mail to follow up and subsequently  contacted any remaining nonrespondents by telephone to follow up as a  way to address any problems and to encourage nonrespondents to  complete the survey. Because this survey was conducted with all of the  Part A and B grantees, it is not subject to sampling error. However, there  are practical difficulties in conducting any survey that may introduce other  types of errors, such as nonsampling errors. For example, nonsampling  error may introduce unwanted variability or bias in the survey results and  can result when survey respondents inconsistently interpret particular  survey questions. We took steps to minimize nonsampling errors in  developing the questionnaire and in data collection and analysis. While the  response rates of 77 and 81 percent are high, if those not responding  differed materially from those responding on any particular question we  analyzed, our analysis may not accurately represent the group surveyed.", "Therefore, our results are representative only of those responding to our  survey and are not generalizable to a larger population.", "In addition, we reviewed HRSA\u2019s policies and reporting requirements for  Parts A, B, C, D, and F. We interviewed HRSA officials and staff from  selected grantees for Parts A and B to determine how funds were  distributed to service providers.", "We estimated funding amounts for Part A and B grantees based on the old  formula-based process and analyzed the difference between these  amounts and the actual funding for fiscal year 2007. To create these  estimated funding amounts, we reviewed CARE Act MAI funding data for  fiscal years 2006 and 2007, case counts of minorities living with AIDS for  fiscal year 2006, and case counts of minorities living with HIV/AIDS for  fiscal year 2007, all of which were provided by HRSA. To estimate funding  amounts for each Part A and Part B grantee, we followed the old formula- based process, which used a proportion that represented the relationship  between a grantee\u2019s minority HIV/AIDS case count for fiscal year 2007 and  the total minority HIV/AIDS case count for all jurisdictions, and then  multiplied that proportion by the total amount of MAI funding available.  This gave us the estimated amount of funding for each grantee. We then  determined the difference between the actual funding the grantee received  under the new competitive process for 2007 and our estimated funding  amount to establish the impact of the change to the new competitive  process. To assess the validity of the funding amounts, we compared data  we received from HRSA to previously published funding amounts. To  assess the reliability and validity of the computer-generated estimated  funding amounts, we provided HRSA officials with a copy of our tables.  They agreed with our methodology and were able to duplicate our funding  amounts. We determined that the funding data and case count data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To identify the types of services grantees funded under MAI, we conducted  a Web-based survey of Part A and B grantees, as described above, and  interviewed selected Part A, B, C, D, and F grantees about services they  provided under MAI prior to and after the passage of RWTMA. We  interviewed HRSA officials and staff from six Part A and six Part B  grantees to determine how funds were distributed. Although there was no  change in the process for awarding funds under Parts C, D, and F, we  interviewed grantees under those parts to learn about the services they  funded. We interviewed staff from six Part C, six Part D, and three Part F  grantees. We selected grantees to interview based on the amount of MAI  funding they received and to ensure geographic diversity. All interviews  were conducted over the telephone using a structured interview guide that  was provided to the interviewees in advance.
