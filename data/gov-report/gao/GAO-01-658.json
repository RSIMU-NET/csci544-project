The three types of emissions interact in the atmosphere to form ozone gas and sulfate particles, which are linked to respiratory illnesses.

In addition, we were directed to examine the Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s (TVA) plans to reduce its emissions of regulated pollutants from generating electricity.

Designated a national park in 1934, it is 95 percent forested and is renowned for the diversity of its plant and animal resources and the beauty of its ancient mountains. Elevations in the park range from 800 feet to 6,643 feet.", "Areas adjacent to the park are growing in population and economic activity. For example, between 1990 and 2000, while the U.S. population grew 13 percent, the population of North Carolina and Tennessee grew 21 percent and 17 percent, respectively, and the population grew 18 percent in Buncombe County, the most populous county in western North Carolina. Recreational visits to the park increased from 8.2 million in 1990 to 10.2 million in 2000, and non-recreational visits to the Park increased from 9.4 million to 10.9 million during the same period.", "The burning of coal, gasoline, and other fossil fuels\u2014by electric utilities, motor vehicles, manufacturing facilities, and other sources\u2014generates sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide gases. When emitted into the air, these gases, and the substances, into which they can be transformed, may be transported hundreds of miles away. In the atmosphere, these gases may be transformed into tiny particles or may react with other chemicals. Visibility is impaired when light encounters these tiny airborne particles and is absorbed or scattered before reaching the observer. Humidity magnifies the problem because the particles may attract water and grow in size, thereby scattering more light. In addition to reducing visibility, these tiny particles, which can be inhaled deeply into the lungs, have been consistently associated in epidemiological studies with hospital admissions and premature deaths.", "Ozone is not emitted; it forms when nitrogen oxides react with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. Repeated exposure to ozone may permanently damage lungs or trigger symptoms, such as chest pains or coughing. It may also interfere with plants\u2019 ability to produce and store food, making them more susceptible to pathogens, pests, and other pollutants. (By contrast, in the upper atmosphere, ozone forms a protective layer that shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet rays.)", "The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in concert with state and local air pollution agencies, to regulate mobile and stationary source emissions of certain air pollutants. In addition, for pollutants it determines to be harmful to human health, EPA is responsible for setting standards for concentrations of those pollutants in the air that people breathe. It has designated six such principal pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, and ozone. Finally, certain provisions of the act specifically address visibility impairments.", "Although the 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act established tougher requirements for new power plants and certain other facilities, existing facilities\u2014including those operated by TVA and many other electric utilities\u2014were exempted from these requirements, so long as they did not make physical changes to the plants that resulted in increased emissions. EPA alleged in 1999 that TVA and several privately owned utilities had violated the Clean Air Act provisions by making physical changes to their units that had resulted in emissions increases. EPA\u2019s lawsuit against TVA is pending.", "Despite the progress over the past 20 years in reducing the emissions of most principal pollutants and improving air quality, ozone concentrations in many counties in the United States exceed national standards, and visibility in many otherwise pristine areas remains a problem.

On average days (the middle one-fifth of all days), visibility stayed at about 27 miles during the decade and, on the best days (those ranked in the top one-fifth of all days), it stayed at about 51 miles.", "Reduced visibility is primarily caused by airborne particles that either scatter or absorb light. In the eastern states generally, and in the park specifically, during the summer, these particles are predominantly fine sulfate particles formed from sulfur dioxide gas, a product of burning coal and other fossil fuels. The electric utility sector accounted for 67 percent of the nation\u2019s sulfur dioxide emissions in 1999 (latest available data); the transportation sector, 7 percent; and other sources, the remaining 26 percent.", "Because sulfur dioxide gas and the sulfate particles, into which it can be transformed, can travel hundreds of miles on wind currents, the particles that degrade visibility in the park may originate from emissions released over a large area. According to a recent National Park Service analysis of the air masses that reached the park on low-visibility days (that is, days with high levels of particulates), the majority started, or spent considerable time, over the industrial Midwest, which allowed them to accumulate substantial quantities of sulfur dioxide. Air masses arrived from the west on a lesser, but still significant, portion of the low-visibility days, while few air masses arrived from the east and south on such days.", "In 1994, the year before the provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 limiting sulfur dioxide emissions took effect, the nation\u2019s electric utilities emitted 14.9 million tons of sulfur dioxide.

It is believed that the decline is related to the cooler summer temperatures in 2000.", "Because sunlight is necessary to the formation of ozone and heat accelerates chemical reactions, ozone levels tend to peak in the summer months. The two principal precursors of ozone\u2014nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds\u2014have diverse sources. Motor vehicles and other transportation sources produced 55.5 percent of the nation\u2019s nitrogen oxide emissions in 1999 (latest available data); electric utilities produced 22.5 percent; and other sources produced the remaining 22 percent. Volatile organic compounds include isoprene, which trees produce, and various hydrocarbons, such as those emitted when gasoline evaporates or is burned incompletely. In North Carolina, Tennessee, and other southeastern states, trees and other natural sources produce relatively high levels of isoprene. Thus, there is an abundance of naturally occurring volatile organic compounds in these areas to react with nitrogen oxides to form ozone.", "According to a recent National Park Service analysis, on high-ozone days, most of the air masses reaching the park arrived from the north and northwest\u2014generally after passing through the industrial Midwest. Fewer air masses arrived from the west and south and very few arrived from the east.", "The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 are expected to reduce national nitrogen oxide emissions by 2 million tons a year by 2010, relative to the level without these provisions.

(These rates are age-adjusted to allow comparability between states and over time; however they were not adjusted for other influences, such as rates of smoking and socioeconomic levels.)", "In the past 50 years, studies conducted in the United States and abroad have consistently shown that people who breathe polluted air are more likely to suffer adverse health effects. These effects may be reflected in increases in breathing problems, hospital admissions, and premature mortality from lung and heart conditions. People over the age of 65 and those with pre-existing chronic heart and lung conditions, such as heart disease and asthma, are more likely than others to experience adverse health effects from exposure to air pollutants.

In 2000, TVA\u2019s peak capacity to generate electricity was 29.5 gigawatts (a gigawatt is a million kilowatts). TVA estimates that its peak demand for electricity will grow about 1.7 percent each year between 2001 and 2010. To meet this level, TVA will have to plan for an additional one-half a gigawatt increase each year\u2014the equivalent of building an average-sized power plant every year.

To achieve this reduction, TVA, among other actions, switched to coals with lower sulfur contents and installed equipment called \u201cscrubbers\u201d to remove sulfur dioxide from exhaust gases. TVA estimates that such emissions will decline 36 percent between 1999 and 2005. TVA\u2019s emissions of nitrogen oxide (an ozone precursor) were relatively stable during the 1990s; however, it estimates that its emissions of nitrogen oxides\u2014during the warm-weather months when ozone levels peak\u2014will decline 70 percent between 1999 and 2005.
