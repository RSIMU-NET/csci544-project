CBP has also implemented national targeting training and sought to improve the quality and timeliness of manifest information, which is one of the inputs for its Automated Targeting System. However, regarding risk management, CPB has not performed a comprehensive set of assessments vital for determining the level of risk for oceangoing cargo containers and the types of responses necessary to mitigate that risk. Regarding recognized modeling practices, CBP has not subjected the Automated Targeting System to adequate external peer review or testing. It has also not fully implemented a process to randomly examine containers in order to test the targeting strategy. Without incorporating all key elements of a risk management framework and recognized modeling practices, CBP cannot be reasonably sure that its targeting strategy provides the best method to protect against weapons of mass destruction entering the United States at its seaports. GAO's visits to selected seaports found that the implementation of CBP's targeting strategy faces a number of challenges. Although port officials said that inspectors were able to inspect all containers designated by the Automated Targeting System as high-risk, GAO's requests for documentation raised concerns about the adequacy of CBP's data to document these inspections. CBP lacks an adequate mechanism to test or certify the competence of students who participate in their national targeting training. Additionally, CBP has not been able to fully address longshoremen's safety concerns related to inspection equipment. Addressing these concerns is important to ensure that cargo inspections are conducted safely and efficiently. Challenges to both the development and the implementation of CBP's targeting strategy, if not addressed, may limit the effectiveness of targeting as a tool to help ensure homeland security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide a summary of our  recent report for you on the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS)  programs to target oceangoing cargo containers for inspection.

If terrorists did so and  detonated such a weapon (e.g., a nuclear, or radiological, explosive  device) at a seaport, the incident could cause widespread death and  damage to the immediate area, perhaps shut down seaports nationwide,  cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars, and seriously hamper  international trade.", "DHS and its U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are responsible  for addressing the threat posed by terrorist smuggling of weapons in  oceangoing containers.

Organizations that are involved in  security matters, such as CBP, frequently employ certain risk management  practices, including computer modeling, to help them prioritize their  activities and use of resources.

Many experts on terrorism\u2014including those at  the Federal Bureau of Investigation and at academic, think tank and  business organizations\u2014have concluded that oceangoing cargo containers  are vulnerable to some form of terrorist action. A terrorist incident at a  seaport, in addition to killing people and causing physical damage, could  have serious economic consequences. In a 2002 simulation of a terrorist  attack involving cargo containers, every seaport in the United States was  shut down, resulting in a simulated loss of $58 billion in revenue to the  U.S. economy, including spoilage, loss of sales, and manufacturing  slowdowns and halts in production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Has Layered Approach to Select and Inspect Cargo Containers", "paragraphs": ["CBP is responsible for preventing terrorists and weapons of mass  destruction from entering the United States. As part of its responsibility, it  has the mission to address the potential threat posed by the movement of  oceangoing containers. To perform this mission, CBP has inspectors at the  ports of entry into the United States. Inspectors assigned to seaports help  determine which containers entering the country will undergo inspections,  and then perform physical inspections of such containers. These  determinations are not just based on concerns about terrorism, but also  concerns about illegal narcotics and/or other contraband.", "The CBP Commissioner said that the large volume of imports and CBP\u2019s  limited resources make it impossible to physically inspect all oceangoing  containers without disrupting the flow of commerce. The Commissioner  also said it is unrealistic to expect that all containers warrant such  inspection because each container poses a different level of risk based on  a number of factors including the exporter, the transportation providers,  and the importer. These concerns led to CBP implementing a layered  approach that attempts to focus resources on potentially risky cargo  containers while allowing other cargo containers to proceed without  disrupting commerce.", "As part of its layered approach, CBP employs its Automated Targeting  System (ATS) computer model to review documentation on all arriving  containers and help select or target containers for additional scrutiny. The  ATS was originally designed to help identify illegal narcotics in cargo  containers, but was modified to help identify all types of illegal contraband  used by smugglers or terrorists. In addition, CBP has a program, called the  Supply Chain Stratified Examination, which supplements ATS by  randomly selecting additional containers to be physically examined. The  results of the random inspection program are to be compared with the  results of ATS inspections to improve targeting. If CBP officials decide to  inspect a particular container, they might first conduct a nonintrusive  inspection with equipment such as the Vehicle and Cargo Inspection  System (VACIS), which takes a gamma-ray image of the container so  inspectors can detect any visual anomalies. With or without VACIS,  inspectors can open a container and physically examine its contents.", "Other components of the layered approach include the Container Security  Initiative (CSI) and the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C- TPAT). CSI is an initiative whereby CBP places staff at designated foreign  seaports to work with foreign counterparts to identify and inspect high- risk containers for weapons of mass destruction before they are shipped  to the United States. C-TPAT is a cooperative program between CBP and  members of the international trade community in which private companies  agree to improve the security of their supply chains in return for a reduced  likelihood that their containers will be inspected.

CBP officials told us that, given the urgency to take steps to  protect against terrorism after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks,  they had to take an \u201cimplement and amend\u201d approach. That is, they had to  immediately implement targeting activities with the knowledge they would  have to amend them later. Steps taken by CBP include the following:  In November 2001, the U.S. Customs Service established the National  Targeting Center to support its targeting initiatives. Among other  things, the National Targeting Center interacts with the intelligence  community and manages a national targeting training program for CBP  targeters.", "In August 2002, CBP modified the ATS as an antiterrorism tool by  developing terrorism-related targeting rules and implementing them  nationally. CBP is now in the process of enhancing the ATS terrorism- related rules.", "In 2002, CBP also developed a 2-week national training course to train  staff in targeting techniques. The course is intended to help ensure that  seaport targeters have the necessary knowledge and ability to conduct  effective targeting.

Penalties for non- compliance can include a CBP order not to load a container on a ship  at the port of origin or monetary fines. The rule is intended to improve  the quality and the timeliness of manifest information submitted to  CBP, which is important because CBP relies extensively on manifest  information for targeting. According to CBP officials we contacted,  although no formal evaluations have been done, the 24-hour rule is  beginning to improve both the quality and timeliness of manifest  information.

A number of factors constrain the use of  inspection equipment, including crowded port terminals, mechanical  breakdowns, inclement weather conditions, and the safety concerns of  longshoremen at some ports. Some of these constraints, such as space  limitations and inclement weather conditions, are difficult if not  impossible to avoid.", "According to CBP and union officials we contacted, concern about the  safety of VACIS is a constraint to using inspection equipment. Union  officials representing longshoremen at some ports expressed concerns  about the safety of driving cargo containers through VACIS because it  emits gamma rays when taking an image of the inside of the cargo  container. Towing cargo containers through a stationary VACIS unit  reportedly takes less time and physical space than moving the VACIS  equipment over stationary cargo containers that have been staged for  inspection purposes. As a result of these continuing safety concerns, some  longshoremen are unwilling to drive containers through VACIS. CBP\u2019s  response to these longshoremen\u2019s concerns has been to stage containers  away from the dock, arraying containers in rows at port terminals so that  the VACIS can be driven over a group of containers for scanning purposes.  However, as seaports and port terminals are often crowded, and there is  often limited space to expand operations, it can be space-intensive and  time-consuming to stage containers. Not all longshoremen\u2019s unions have  safety concerns regarding VACIS inspections. For example, at the Port of  New York/New Jersey, longshoremen\u2019s concerns over the safety of  operating VACIS were addressed after the union contacted a consultant  and received assurances about the safety of the equipment.

The internal environment  includes an entity\u2019s organizational and management structure and  processes that provide the framework to plan, execute, and control and  monitor an entity\u2019s activities, including risk management. Within the  organizational and management structure, an operational unit that is  independent of all other operational (business) units is responsible for  implementing the entity\u2019s risk management function. This unit is  supported by and directly accountable to an entity\u2019s senior management.  For its part, senior management (1) defines the entity\u2019s risk tolerance (i.e.,  how much risk is an entity willing to assume in order to accomplish its  mission and related objectives) and (2) establishes the entity\u2019s risk  management philosophy and culture (i.e., how an entity\u2019s values and  attitudes view risk and how its activities and practices are managed to deal  with risk).

Vulnerability  assessments identify these inherent states and the extent of their  susceptibility to exploitation, relative to the existence of any  countermeasures. As applied to the global supply chain, a vulnerability  assessment might involve, first, establishing a comprehensive  understanding of the business and commercial aspects of the chain (as a  complex system with multiple interacting participants); and, second,  \u201cmapping\u201d the chain and identifying vulnerability points that could be  exploited.", "Risk assessment\u2014risk assessment is a qualitative and/or quantitative  determination of the likelihood (probability) of occurrence of an adverse  event and the severity, or impact, of its consequences.

If the entity does  choose to take action, such action falls into three categories: (1) risk  avoidance (exiting activities that expose the entity to risk), (2) risk  reduction (implementing actions that reduce likelihood or impact of risk),  and (3) risk sharing (implementing actions that reduce likelihood or  impact by transferring or sharing risk). In each category, the entity  implements actions as part of an integrated \u201csystems\u201d approach, with  built-in redundancy to help address residual risk (the risk that remains  after actions have been implemented). The systems approach consists of  taking actions in personnel (e.g., training, deployment), processes (e.g.,  operational procedures), technology (e.g., software or hardware),  infrastructure (e.g., institutional or operational\u2014such as port  configurations), and governance (e.g., management and internal control  and assurance). In selecting actions, the entity assesses their costs and  benefits, where the amount of risk reduction is weighed against the cost  involved and identifies potential financing options for the actions chosen.", "Monitoring and evaluation of risk mitigation\u2014Monitoring and  evaluation of risk mitigation entails the assessment of the functioning of  actions against strategic objectives and performance measures to make  necessary changes.

CBP  characterized ATS as a knowledge, or rule-based, expert system or model  that serves as a \u201cdecision support tool\u201d in implementing its targeting  strategy. Accordingly, for purposes of this report, we identified four  practices that are applicable to our review of ATS as such a tool. We  identified these practices through our interviews with terrorism experts  and representatives of the international trade community\u2014who were  familiar with modeling related to terrorism or to ATS\u2014and GAO\u2019s chief  scientist; and our review of relevant literature, such as reports by the U.S.  Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science and Technology and the  National Research Council (part of the National Academies) and GAO.  The four practices are  Initiating an external peer review of ATS. Many agencies conduct  various types of internal reviews of projects and programs. However, these  reviews are usually conducted by managers or supervisors and thus are  not independent. Peer review is a process that includes an independent,  documented, critical assessment of the technical, scientific merit of  research or programs by external peers who are highly qualified scientists  with knowledge and expertise equal to that of those whose work they  review. In this regard, peers must be capable of making independent  judgments about the merit and relevance of what they are reviewing and  have no conflicts of interest. If the results are to be used in programmatic  decision making, peer reviews can improve the technical quality of  projects by recognizing technical weaknesses and suggesting  improvements that might be overlooked by those too close to the project;  peer review can also enhance the credibility of the decision-making  process by offering frank assessments not constrained by organizational  concerns and by avoiding the reality and the perception of conflicts of  interest. Peer review cannot ensure the success of a program, but it can  increase the probability of success.", "Instituting a process of random inspections to supplement  targeting. The experts we spoke with told us that the absence of a  process to randomly select containerized cargo for screening or physical  examination to supplement ATS was a shortcoming of CBP\u2019s targeting  strategy. Randomness pertains to a process whose outcome or value  depends on chance or on a process that simulates chance, with the  implication that all possible outcomes or values have a known, non-zero  probability of occurrence\u2014for example, the outcome of flipping a coin or  executing a computer-programmed random number generator. A random  selection process would not only help mitigate residual risk (i.e., the risk  remaining after the original risk mitigation actions have been  implemented), but also help evaluate the performance of targeting relative  to other approaches.", "Enhancing the sources and types of information input into ATS.", "Terrorism experts and representatives of the international trade  community told us that ATS needed to incorporate additional types of  information in order to be able to perform complex \u201clinkage\u201d analyses in  an attempt to identify documentary inconsistencies that must be detected  to target suspicious containers. They also told us that the ship\u2019s manifest  (or transportation document that lists a summary of the cargo on board)  does not contain enough information in sufficient detail to be useful, by  itself, in targeting suspicious containers. These individuals further told us  that the movement of containers through the global supply chain  generated an additional amount of commercial documentation that could  be used for this purpose. Examples of commercial documentation that  could be used include purchase orders, commercial invoices, shippers\u2019  letters of instruction, and certificates of origin.", "Testing and validating ATS by staging simulated terrorist  events.
