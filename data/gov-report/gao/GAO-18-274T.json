VA also developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. Further, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts, but instead, 79 percent of the items available for purchase under MSPV-NG were added through non-competitive agreements.

These supplies are intended to  meet the health care needs of about 7 million veterans. In fiscal year  2015, VA obligated $465 million for these types of supplies, and, in 2016,  it stated that it planned to achieve $150 million in cost avoidance through  a supply chain transformation effort, which includes MSPV-NG. This  transition represents a significant change to how medical and surgical  supplies are purchased, which has raised questions about whether  MSPV-NG will appropriately balance medical needs with logistical  efficiency, and whether VA can achieve its planned cost avoidance.  Effective supply chain management is an essential part of delivering  quality health care to veterans\u2014for instance, an April 2017 interim report  issued by the VA Inspector General detailed supply management issues  at the District of Columbia VA Medical Center that posed risks to patient  care.", "My remarks today are based on our recently issued report on the MSPV- NG program, and I will summarize a few key findings from that report.  Specifically, I will address the extent to which VA\u2019s implementation of  MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program goals.", "As part of our work for our November 2017 report, we reviewed VA policy,  communications, briefings, and other documents, prior GAO reports on  best practices for organizational transformation, and internal control  standards. We interviewed Veterans Health Administration (VHA)- and  VA-wide procurement leaders, program office managers, and members of  three integrated product teams who helped develop the product  descriptions for supply items (known as requirements). We also  interviewed supply chain managers from four leading hospital networks  regarding their medical supply management practices and compared  them to those used by VA when implementing the MSPV-NG program.  To assess VA\u2019s MSPV-NG contracting process, we analyzed the contents  of the formulary (a list of specific items that medical centers are allowed  to purchase) to determine what acquisition instrument was used to add  the items. We determined that the MSPV-NG formulary data were  sufficiently reliable by tracing data to a sample of source documents,  among other steps. We selected three VHA regional networks based on  those with the highest total contract obligations in fiscal years 2014  through 2016, geographic diversity, and other factors. We conducted site  visits to six medical centers within these three regional networks,  interviewing contracting and clinical officials. Finally, we obtained and  analyzed data on VA\u2019s metrics for the program and determined the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purpose of measuring utilization by  interviewing officials responsible for maintaining the data and other  measures.", "More detailed information on our objectives, scope, and methodology for  our work can be found in our November 9, 2017 report. We conducted  the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that  we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.

Many of those items were purchased using the Federal Supply  Schedules, which provided medical centers with a great deal of flexibility.  However, as we reported in 2016, this legacy program prevented VHA  from standardizing items used across its medical centers and affected its  ability to leverage its buying power to achieve greater cost avoidance.  Standardization is a process of narrowing the range of items purchased to  meet a given need, such as buying 10 varieties of bandages instead of  100, in order to improve buying power, simplify supply chain  management, and provide clinical consistency. In part because of the  legacy MSPV program\u2019s limited standardization, VHA decided to  transition to a new iteration, called MSPV-NG.", "The transition to MSPV-NG has been a major effort, involving the MSPV- NG program office, stakeholders from the VHA\u2019s Procurement and  Logistics Office and VA\u2019s Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC)\u2014a VA-wide  contracting organization\u2014and logistics and clinical personnel at every  medical center. The program also includes hundreds of new contracts  with individual supply vendors and a new set of prime vendor contracts to  distribute the supplies.", "VA\u2019s goals for the MSPV-NG program include (1) standardizing  requirements for supply items for greater clinical consistency; (2)  demonstrating cost avoidance by leveraging VA\u2019s substantial buying  power when making competitive awards; (3) achieving greater efficiency  in ordering and supply chain management, including a metric of ordering  40 percent of medical centers\u2019 supplies from the MSPV-NG formulary;  and (4) involving clinicians in requirements development to ensure  uniform clinical review of medical supplies.", "VHA launched the MSPV-NG program in December 2016, but allowed a  4-month transition period. After April 2017, medical centers could no  longer use the legacy program. MSPV-NG now restricts ordering to a  narrow formulary. VHA policy requires medical centers to use MSPV- NG\u2014as opposed to other means such as open market purchase card  transactions\u2014when purchasing items that are available in the formulary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Supply Chain Practices Identified by Selected Leading Hospital Networks", "paragraphs": ["Leading hospital networks we spoke with have similar goals to VA in  managing their supply chains, including clinical standardization and  reduced costs. These hospital networks reported they analyze their  spending to identify items purchased most frequently, and which ones  would be the best candidates to standardize first to yield cost savings.  The hospitals\u2019 supply chain managers reported establishing consensus  with clinicians through early and frequent collaboration, understanding  that clinician involvement is critical to the success of any effort to  standardize their medical supply chain.

Specifically, VHA lacked a documented  program strategy, leadership stability, and workforce capacity for the  transition that, if in place, could have facilitated buy-in for the change  throughout the organization. Further, the initial requirements development  process and tight time frames contributed to ineffective contracting  processes. As a result, VHA developed an initial formulary that did not  meet the needs of the medical centers and has yet to achieve utilization  and cost avoidance goals. VA made some changes in the second phase  of requirements development to address deficiencies identified in the  initial roll out. Key among these was to increase the level of clinical  involvement, that is, to obtain input from the doctors and nurses at VA\u2019s  individual medical facilities. Despite changes aimed at improving  implementation, the agency continues to face challenges that prevent the  program from fully achieving its goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA\u2019s Lack of an Overarching Strategy and Leadership Instability Were Obstacles to Effective Implementation of MSPV-NG", "paragraphs": ["VA did not document a clear overall strategy for the MSPV-NG program  at the start and has not done so to date. About 6 months after our initial  requests for a strategy or plan, a VHA official provided us with an October  2015 plan focusing on the mechanics of establishing the MSPV-NG  formulary. However, this plan was used only within the VHA Procurement  and Logistics Office and had not been approved by VHA or VA  leadership. Leading practices for organizational transformation state that  agencies must have well-documented plans and strategies for major  initiatives (such as MSPV-NG) and communicate them clearly and  consistently to all involved\u2014which included VHA headquarters, the SAC,  and all 170 medical centers. Without such a strategy, VA could not  reasonably ensure that all stakeholders understood VHA\u2019s approach for  MSPV-NG and worked together in a coordinated manner to achieve  program goals. In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the  Director of the MSPV-NG program office should, with input from SAC,  develop, document, and communicate to stakeholders an overarching  strategy for the program, including how the program office will prioritize  categories of supplies for future phases of requirement development and  contracting. VA agreed with this recommendation and reported it would  have a strategy in place by December 2017.", "Leadership instability and workforce challenges also made it difficult for  VA to execute its transition to MSPV-NG. Our work has shown that  leadership buy-in is necessary to ensure that major programs like MSPV- NG have the resources and support they need to execute their missions.  Due to a combination of budget and hiring constraints, and lack of  prioritization within VA, the MSPV-NG program office has never been fully  staffed and has experienced instability in its leadership. As of January  2017, 24 of the office\u2019s 40 positions were filled, and program office  officials stated that this lack of staff affected their ability to implement  certain aspects of the program within the planned time frames. In  addition, since the inception of MSPV-NG, the program office has had  four directors, two of whom were acting and two of whom were fulfilling  the director position while performing other collateral duties. For instance,  one of the acting MSPV-NG program office directors was on detail from a  regional health network to fulfill the position, but had to abruptly leave and return to her prior position due to a federal hiring freeze. In our November  2017 report, we recommended that VHA prioritize the hiring of a MSPV- NG program director on a permanent basis. VA agreed with this  recommendation and indicated a vacancy announcement will be posted  by the end of 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The MSPV-NG Initial Requirements Development Process Had Limited Clinician Involvement and Did Not Prioritize Categories of Supplies", "paragraphs": ["The MSPV-NG program office initially developed requirements for items  to be included in the formulary based almost exclusively on prior supply  purchases, with limited clinician involvement. The program office  concluded in its October 2015 formulary plan that relying on data from  previous clinician purchases would be a good representation of medical  centers\u2019 needs and that clinician input would not be required for  identifying which items to include in the initial formulary. Further, rather  than standardizing purchases of specific categories of supplies\u2014such as  bandages or scalpels\u2014program officials told us they identified medical  and surgical items on which VA had spent $16,000 or more annually and  ordered at least 12 times per year, and made those items the basis for  the formulary. Officials said this analysis initially yielded a list of about  18,000 items, which the program office further refined to about 6,000  items by removing duplicate items or those that were not considered  consumable commodities, such as medical equipment. This approach to  requirements development stood in sharp contrast to those of the leading  hospital networks we met with, which rely heavily on clinician input to help  drive the standardization process and focus on individual categories of  supplies that provide the best opportunities for cost savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements Development and Tight Time Frames Contributed to Ineffective Contracting Practices for Initial Formulary", "paragraphs": ["Based on the requirements developed by the program office, SAC began  to issue competitive solicitations for the 6,000 items on the initial  formulary in June 2015. Medical supply companies had responded to  about 30 percent of the solicitations as of January 2016. As a result,  according to SAC officials, they conducted outreach and some of these  companies responded that VHA\u2019s requirements did not appear to be  based on clinical input and instead consisted of manufacturer-specific  requirements that favored particular products instead of broader  descriptions. Furthermore, SAC did not solicit large groups of related  items, but rather issued separate solicitations for small groups of supply  items\u2014consisting of three or fewer items. This is contrary to industry  practices of soliciting large groups of related supplies together. Therefore,  according to SAC officials, some medical supply companies told them  that submitting responses to SAC\u2019s solicitations required more time and  resources than they were willing to commit.", "By its April 2016 deadline for having 6,000 items on the formulary, SAC  had been working on the effort for over a year and had established  competitive agreements for about 200 items, representing about 3  percent of the planned items. Without contracts for the items on the  formulary in place, VA delayed the launch of the MSPV-NG program until  December 2016 and SAC began establishing non-competitive  agreements in the last few months before the launch of MSPV-NG. As  shown in figure 1, these non-competitive agreements accounted for  approximately 79 percent of the items on the January 2017 version of the  formulary. While this approach enabled the MSPV-NG program office to  establish the formulary more quickly, it did so at the expense of one of the  primary goals of the MSPV-NG program\u2014leveraging VA\u2019s buying power  to obtain cost avoidance through competition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initial Formulary Did Not Meet Medical Center Needs, Resulting in Low Utilization of MSPV-NG and a Missed Opportunity to Leverage VA\u2019s Large Buying Power", "paragraphs": ["Once VA\u2019s MSPV-NG initial formulary was established in December  2016, each medical center was charged with implementing it. According  to logistics officials we spoke with at selected medical centers, they had  varying levels of success due, in part, to incomplete guidance from the  program office. Without clear guidance, many medical centers reported  they were unable to find direct matches or substitutes on the MSPV-NG  formulary for a substantial number of items they routinely used, which  negatively impacted utilization rates for the initial formulary. In our  November 2017 report, we recommended that the Director of the MSPV- NG program office provide complete guidance to medical centers for  matching equivalent supply items. VA agreed with this recommendation  and indicated it would provide this guidance to medical centers by  December 2017.", "According to SAC, as of June 2017, only about a third of the items on the  initial version of the formulary were being ordered in any significant  quantity by medical centers, indicating that many items on the formulary  were not those that are needed by medical centers. Senior VHA  acquisition officials attributed this mismatch to shortcomings in their initial  requirements development process as well as with VA\u2019s purchase data.", "VA had set a target that medical centers would order 40 percent of their  supplies from the MSPV-NG formulary, but utilization rates were below  this target with a nationwide average utilization rate across medical  centers of about 24 percent as of May 2017. Specifically, Chief Supply  Chain Officers\u2014who are responsible for managing the ordering and  stocking of medical supplies at six selected medical centers\u2014told us that  many items they needed were not included in the MSPV-NG formulary.  As such, we found that these six medical centers generally fell below  VA\u2019s stated utilization target. As shown in figure 2, among the six selected  medical centers we reviewed, one met the target, while the remaining five  were below 25 percent utilization.", "Instead of fully using MSPV-NG, the selected medical centers are  purchasing many items through other means, such as purchase cards or  new contracts awarded by their local contracting office, in part, because  they said the formulary does not meet their needs. These approaches run  counter to the goals of the MSPV-NG program and contribute to VA not  making the best use of taxpayer dollars.", "Greater utilization of MSPV-NG is essential to VA achieving the cost  avoidance goal of $150 million for its supply chain transformation effort.  Under the legacy MSPV program, the National Acquisition Center tracked  cost avoidance achieved by comparing prices for competitively-awarded  MSPV supply contracts with prices available elsewhere. However, VHA  officials stated that they are not currently tracking cost avoidance related  specifically to MSPV-NG. In our November 2017 report, we  recommended that the VHA Chief Procurement and Logistics Officer, in  coordination with SAC, should calculate cost avoidance achieved by  MSPV-NG on an ongoing basis.

In the fall of 2016, the program office began to establish  panels of clinicians to serve on MSPV-NG integrated product teams (IPT)  assigned to the task of developing updated requirements for the second  phase of the formulary. Program officials said they had difficulty recruiting  clinicians to participate. We found that slightly more than half (20 of the  38) of the IPTs had begun their work to review items and develop  updated requirements by the time the MSPV-NG program launched in  December 2016. Staff on the IPTs had to complete their responsibilities  by the end of March 2017 while simultaneously managing their regular  workload as physicians, surgeons, or nurses.", "By early March 2017, the IPTs still had about 4,200 items to review.  Faced with meeting this unrealistic time frame, the MSPV-NG program  office had 9 IPT members travel to one location\u2014with an additional 10  members participating virtually\u2014to meet for 5 days to review the  remaining items. Members told us that this time pressure limited the  extent to which they were able to pursue the goal of standardizing  supplies, and that their review ended up being more of a data validation  exercise than a standardization review. VHA ultimately met this  compressed timeline, but in a rushed manner that limited the impact of  clinician involvement.", "In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the VHA Chief  Procurement and Logistics Officer use input from national clinical  program offices to prioritize its requirements development and  standardization efforts beyond Phase 2 to focus on supply categories that  offer the best opportunity for standardization and cost avoidance. VA  agreed with this recommendation and stated it is in the process of  finalizing guidance that will detail the importance of involving the national  clinical program offices in MSPV-NG requirements development and  standardization efforts.", "The SAC plans to replace the existing Phase 1 non-competitive  agreements with competitive awards based on the Phase 2 requirements  generated by the IPTs, but it may not be able to keep up with expiring  agreements due to an unrealistic schedule. Because they were made  on a non-competitive basis, the Phase 1 agreements were established for  a period of 1 year. In order to keep the full formulary available, the SAC  director said the staff must award 200 to 250 contracts before the Phase  1 agreements expire later this year. SAC officials acknowledged that it is  unlikely that they will be able to award the contracts by the time the  existing agreements expire. According to SAC officials, they are in the  process of hiring more staff to deal with the increased workload. Further,  the SAC division director told us that they canceled all outstanding Phase  2 solicitations in September 2017 due to low response rates, protests  from service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and changes in  overall MSPV-NG strategy.", "In our November 2017 report, we recommended that the MSPV-NG  program office and SAC should establish a plan for how to mitigate the  potential risk of gaps in contract coverage while SAC is still working to  make competitive Phase 2 awards, which could include prioritizing supply  categories that are most likely to yield cost avoidance. VA agreed with  this recommendation and indicated it has developed a plan to mitigate the  risk of gaps in contract coverage with short- and mid-term procurement  strategies to ensure continued provision of medical and surgical supplies  to VHA facilities. The department also stated that it plans to replace the  current MSPV-NG contract and formulary process with a new approach  where the prime vendor would develop the formulary.
