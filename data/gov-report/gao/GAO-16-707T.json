According to TSA, these changes were necessary to ensure security and resulted in a 20 percent decrease in the number of individuals receiving expedited screening. Previously, in December 2014, GAO found that TSA had not tested the overall effectiveness of the Managed Inclusion process, and recommended that TSA ensure that its planned testing adhere to established evaluation design practices to yield reliable test results. DHS concurred with the recommendation and plans to begin testing the effectiveness of the Managed Inclusion process as a system during fiscal year 2016.", "TSA uses data on Transportation Security Officer (TSO) performance obtained from its various testing programs to ensure that individual TSOs are (1) demonstrating through annual proficiency reviews and resulting recertification that they are qualified to continue conducting passenger and checked baggage screening, and (2) demonstrating proficiency during live screening operations in adhering to screening procedures. However, in a report containing sensitive security information completed in May 2016, GAO found that TSA's ability to fully evaluate TSO performance in screening passengers and baggage for prohibited items is constrained by incomplete and unreliable testing data and a lack of data analysis. For example, some airports did not report testing data on TSOs' ability to identify prohibited items over fiscal years 2009 through 2014 as required by TSA policy. TSA officials also stated they do not systematically analyze test results to determine any national trends for informing future TSO training. In addition, TSA determined that pass rate data for one of its covert testing programs that uses role players at airports to assess TSO performance was unreliable. Specifically, testing by an independent contractor indicated that TSA's covert testing data likely overstated TSO performance. TSA is taking action to determine the root cause of the variance in the testing results and is implementing corrective actions. Further, GAO found that TSA does not track the implementation, where appropriate, of recommendations made based on the covert testing results.

TSA, an agency within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the primary federal agency  responsible for the security of the nation\u2019s aviation system. As part of this  responsibility, TSA screened or oversaw the screening of more than 708  million passengers and more than 1.6 billion carry-on bags at about 450  U.S. airports in 2015. TSA-employed screening personnel (i.e., TSOs)  carry out passenger and checked baggage screening operations to  identify prohibited items that could pose a threat to the aircraft and  passengers. These screening operations may include pat downs, search  of property, and operating metal detectors and explosives detection  equipment, among other things. While TSA\u2019s primary aviation  responsibility is to ensure security, it also strives to balance the safety  and security of the traveling public with the efficient flow of passengers  through the screening process. In an effort to strengthen and improve  these screening operations, TSA began providing expedited screening to  selected passengers through its TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae program in October 2011.  The TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae program uses risk-based, intelligence-driven screening  concepts and technology to determine passenger risk prior to travel. The  use of expedited screening procedures is intended to allow TSA to devote  more time and resources at the airport to screening the passengers TSA  determines to be of higher risk or unknown risk while providing expedited  screening to those passengers determined to pose a lower risk. To further  expedite passenger travel for selected passengers not approved through  TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae, TSA implemented the Managed Inclusion process in 2012.  Managed Inclusion assesses passenger risk in real time at the airport  using randomization procedures, behavior detection officers (BDOs), and  passenger screening canine teams.", "Each year, TSA also conducts certification testing of its TSOs, and in an  effort to measure the performance of aviation security screening, both  TSA and the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector  General (DHS-OIG) conduct regular covert testing of TSA screening  operations. In response to the failure rates stemming from recent covert  testing conducted by the DHS-OIG, the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) directed TSA in June 2015 to take a number of  actions to address the vulnerabilities identified in the testing. Specifically,  the Secretary directed TSA to revise its standard operating procedures  (SOP) for screening, brief all Federal Security Directors (FSD) across the  country on the Inspector General\u2019s findings, and to conduct further  training for all screening personnel and supervisors, among other things.  In October 2015, the TSA Administrator testified before Congress on the  steps TSA was taking to respond to the Secretary\u2019s directive, including  delivering further training to every TSO and supervisor across the  country.", "My testimony today addresses the extent to which TSA (1) has taken  steps to improve the security effectiveness of expedited screening and (2)  uses TSO performance testing data to enhance TSO performance in  screening for prohibited items. This statement is based on reports we  issued in May 2016 and December 2014, and selected updates.  Specifically, for our past work we analyzed TSA documentation including  expedited screening and Managed Inclusion procedures, memorandums  of agreement, and decision memorandums, TSA\u2019s risk assessment  methodologies, and TSA\u2019s security assessment of the Managed Inclusion  process, among other documents, to gain an understanding of how  expedited screening and Managed Inclusion operate. Moreover, we  reviewed data (ranging from 2009 to 2015) on TSA\u2019s performance  evaluation testing programs, compared the results by airport security  category, and also assessed the reliability of the data. We found that  some testing programs had incomplete or unreliable data for the years we  analyzed and therefore were not sufficiently reliable for describing  national trends. We also reviewed TSA\u2019s processes and actions for using  screener performance testing results to inform its operations and future  TSO training, and assessed these processes against standards in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government. Further, we  interviewed program officials at TSA headquarters and at select airports  about how they analyze performance test data and how, if at all, they use  the results to adjust training or take other actions. Further details on the  scope and methodology for the previously issued reports are available  within each of the published products. We conducted this work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions, based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Expedited Screening", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, TSA began developing new expedited security procedures  intended to strengthen security and improve the passenger experience by  shortening lines and wait times, and in October 2011, implemented its  expedited screening program\u2014known as TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae. According to TSA,  expedited screening involves a relatively more efficient and convenient  screening process for individuals from whom TSA has obtained sufficient  information to determine them to be lower risk, compared with the  standard screening process for a traveler for whom TSA does not have  such information. For example, passengers eligible for expedited  screening may no longer have to remove their shoes; may leave their  permitted liquids, gels, and laptops in carry-on baggage; and are not  required to divest light outerwear, jackets, or belts when passing through  screening checkpoints unless the screening technology alarms, in which  case these items must be removed.", "TSA uses the following methods to assess whether a passenger is low  risk and therefore eligible for expedited screening.", "Approved TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae lists of known travelers\u2014These lists are comprised of individuals whom TSA has determined to be low risk by virtue of their membership in a specific group, such as active duty military members, or based on group vetting requirements, or if approved through the TSA Pre\uf0fc\u00ae Application Program.", "Automated TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae risk assessments of all passengers\u2014 Using these assessments, TSA assigns passengers scores based upon information available to TSA to identify low risk passengers eligible for expedited screening for a specific flight prior to the passengers\u2019 arrival at the airport.", "Real-time threat assessments through Managed Inclusion\u2014 These assessments use several layers of security, including procedures that randomly select passengers for expedited screening, behavior detection officers who observe passengers to identify high- risk behaviors, and passenger screening canine teams to help ensure that passengers selected for expedited screening have not handled explosive material. TSA developed Managed Inclusion as a tool to improve the efficiency of dedicated TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae screening lanes.", "When TSA began offering expedited screening at airports in the summer  of 2011, TSOs initially provided such screenings in standard lanes to  passengers aged 12 and younger, and subsequently extended expedited  screening to certain flight crew members and then to passengers aged 75  and older. However, in October 2011, TSA began to expand the concept  of expedited airport screening to more of the flying public by piloting the  TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae program. This pilot program allowed certain frequent fliers of  two air carriers to experience expedited screening at four airports. These  frequent fliers became eligible for screening in dedicated expedited  screening lanes, called TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae lanes, because they had opted into  the TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae program through the air carrier with which they had  attained frequent flier status.", "Since October 2011, TSA has further expanded the known traveler  populations eligible for expedited screening. TSA established separate  TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae lists for additional low-risk passenger populations, including  members of the U.S. armed forces, Congressional Medal of Honor  Society Members, members of the Homeland Security Advisory Council,  and Members of Congress, among others. In March 2015, TSA officials  stated that the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard  branches of the U.S. armed forces, as well as Reserve and National  Guard personnel, were eligible to participate. TSA also created its own  TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae list composed of individuals who apply to be preapproved as  low-risk travelers through the TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae Application Program, an  initiative launched in December 2013. To apply, individuals must visit an  enrollment center where they provide biographic information (i.e., name,  date of birth, and address), valid identity and citizenship documentation,  and fingerprints to undergo a TSA Security Threat Assessment.  Applicants must be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or lawful permanent  residents, and cannot have been convicted of certain crimes. As of  December 2015, about 8.8 million individuals were eligible, through TSA  Pre \uf0fc\u00ae lists, for expedited screening. Figure 1 shows the populations for  each TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae list."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessing TSO Performance", "paragraphs": ["To carry out passenger and checked baggage screening operations, TSA  employs TSOs at the vast majority of the nation\u2019s commercial airports.  TSOs must complete the New Hire Training Program (NHTP), which  includes at least 40 hours of classroom training focused on their duties as  a screener, a minimum of 60 hours of on-the-job training, and certification  tests for the functions they will be performing. In addition, TSOs are  required to take recurrent training throughout the year to maintain  proficiency with skills learned during the NHTP, and to remain up-to-date  with changes in screening standard operating procedures (SOP), as well  as emerging threats. Also, TSOs who are absent from their screening  duties for a period of time must undergo some level of \u201creturn-to-duty\u201d  training based on the amount of time they were absent. Lastly, if TSOs  fail an operational test, they are required to take remedial training  customized to fit the specific screener\u2019s performance improvement  needs. Furthermore, each year, TSA conducts certification testing for its  airport security screeners, and in an effort to measure the performance of  aviation security screening, both TSA and the DHS-OIG conduct regular  covert testing of TSA screening operations.", "Recent covert tests conducted by the DHS-OIG highlighted the following  areas of concern: (1) the effectiveness of the passenger screening  process, (2) TSA\u2019s Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) screening  equipment, (3) related automated target recognition software used by the  AIT systems, and (4) checkpoint screener performance in identifying and  resolving potential security threats at airport checkpoints. In response to  the results of the covert testing, TSA updated its screening SOPs,  retrained TSOs to address the Inspector General\u2019s findings, and provided  additional classroom training nationwide to all TSOs. In addition, TSA  developed new measures of effectiveness that it expects will better  emphasize the agency\u2019s goals for improving security effectiveness by  focusing the measures on both the screening system and workforce in the  areas of readiness and performance.", "To measure TSO performance, TSA uses the following performance  measurement tests:", "Annual Proficiency Reviews (APR) evaluate TSOs\u2019 ability to identify  prohibited items on an X-ray machine, ability to resolve explosives  detection system machine alarms using the appropriate tools, and  whether TSOs can perform various practical skills such as pat downs,  bag searches, and use of explosive trace detection technology. If a  screener does not pass one of the components of the APR after two;  or, in some cases, three attempts, they are subject to removal from  their position.", "Threat Image Projection (TIP) monitors TSOs\u2019 ability to identify  prohibited items in x-ray images of carry-on baggage at the passenger  checkpoint by projecting fictional threat items onto the bags. TIP also  aides in keeping TSOs focused and attentive, and in keeping their  skills sharp in identifying items they do not routinely see. According to  TSA policy, FSDs must monitor TIP results monthly and, if one of their  TSOs identifies less than a target percentage of TIP images  accurately in a month, then the TSO is required to attend remedial  training.", "Aviation Screening Assessment Program (ASAP) is a form of  covert testing to measure, at a national level, TSO screening  performance against screening SOPs. TSA\u2019s Office of Security  Operations utilizes local role players to take prohibited items such as  knives, guns, or simulated improvised explosive devices, through the  screening checkpoints to test TSOs performance in accurately  identifying those items. ASAP tests are conducted by TSA at both  screening checkpoints and checked baggage screening areas. The  tests are designed to assess the operational effectiveness of  screeners. TSA implemented a series of improvements to ASAP in  2010 and 2012 that introduced (1) specific testing scenarios to  improve the level of standardization, (2) a formalized debriefing  process, (3) training scenarios by which airports can tailor lessons  learned to their operations, and (4) a strategy for allowing the  reporting of comparable testing results, over time, from the airports.  After these improvements, TSA renamed the program ASAP  Advantage. TSA implements ASAP Advantage according to a 6- month testing schedule, and at the completion of each 6-month cycle,  generates a report identifying trends in screening performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Is Taking Steps to Improve the Security Effectiveness of Expedited Screening", "paragraphs": ["TSA has taken steps to improve the security effectiveness of expedited  screening since we issued our December 2014 report. Specifically, TSA  has begun planning for the testing of the security effectiveness of the  Managed Inclusion process as an overall system\u2013ensuring that the  testing adheres to established design practices. In addition, TSA has  adjusted the TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae Risk Assessment program algorithm used to  assign passengers scores and identify low risk passengers because the  DHS-OIG found that the algorithm allowed a high-risk individual access to  expedited screening. Also, according to TSA documentation, TSA  reduced the number of passengers screened by the Managed Inclusion  process by limiting its use to airports that have canine teams to detect  explosives.", "Our December 2014 report found that TSA has tested the effectiveness of  the individual Managed Inclusion security layers, but that TSA had not yet  tested the Managed Inclusion process as an overall system. We stated  that our previous work identified challenges in several of the layers used  in the Managed Inclusion process, raising concerns regarding their overall  effectiveness. For example, in November 2013, we found that TSA had  not demonstrated that behavioral indicators can be used to reliably and  effectively identify passengers who may pose a threat to aviation  security. While TSA is taking steps to revise and test the behavior  detection program, such as working to provide scientifically validated  evidence that demonstrates that behavioral indicators can be used to  identify passengers who may pose a risk to aviation security, the issue  remains open. As of May 2016, TSA told us that it is taking actions to  optimize the effectiveness of its behavior detection program and plans to  begin an operational test of these efforts in September 2016. In our  December 2014 report, we noted that TSA has previously faced  challenges designing studies to test the security effectiveness of  programs in accordance with established methodological practices such  as ensuring an adequate sample size or randomly selecting items in a  study to ensure the results can be generalizable\u2014key features of  established evaluation design practices. As a result, we recommended  that TSA take steps to ensure and document that its planned testing of  the Managed Inclusion process as a system adheres to established  evaluation design practices. DHS concurred with our recommendation,  and according to TSA officials, TSA has developed a data collection and  analysis plan to be used for the testing of the Managed Inclusion system.  As of May 2016, TSA is reviewing and finalizing the plan and intends to  test it at ten airports in late summer or early fall 2016 according to TSA  officials. We will continue to monitor TSA\u2019s progress in addressing this  recommendation.", "In addition, according to a TSA memorandum dated November 2015,  TSA made changes to the TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae Risk Assessment program and  Managed Inclusion process to enhance aviation security as a result of the  findings and recommendations included in three prior DHS-OIG audit  reports. Specifically, TSA made changes to the TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae Risk  Assessment program algorithm used to assign passenger scores  because the DHS-OIG found that the program created a potential  aviation security vulnerability in at least one instance by identifying a  convicted felon as low risk and eligible for expedited screening. As a  result, TSA recognized the increased level of uncertainty surrounding a  potential threat posed by individuals who obtain expediting screening  eligibility  through the Risk Assessment program as compared to individuals who  have been vetted and are included on one of the TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae lists.  Following the public release of the DHS-OIG\u2019s covert testing results,  TSA officials stated that TSA began a thorough review of checkpoint  operations, and as a part of that review, evaluated all methods in which  individuals without background checks became eligible for expedited  screening. As a result of this evaluation and based on a recommendation  from another DHS-OIG audit, TSA documentation shows that TSA  discontinued the use of Explosives Trace Detection (ETD) devices as a  method used to conduct real time threat assessments and is now limiting  the use of Managed Inclusion to airports that employed canine team to  detect explosives. According to the TSA administrator, these changes  have resulted in a 20 percent decrease in the number of individuals who  receive expedited screening.", "To address this decrease in expedited screening and its likely effect on  passenger wait times, TSA plans to undertake efforts to increase the  number of individuals included on the TSA Pre \uf0fc\u00ae lists of known  travelers from the nearly 8.8 million individuals currently enrolled to 25  million individuals. In order to achieve this increase, TSA plans to change  the  enrollment  process,  increase  marketing  and  communication  efforts,  and expand the number of contractors that provide enrollment services.

Officials stated that, due to software compatibility issues  with the new machines, TIP image capability was turned off for an  extended period of time, meaning that TIP testing was not occurring on  these machines and, therefore, TIP data were neither collected nor  reported for these airports. TSA officials also told us that their older X-ray  machines do not have the capability to automatically upload TIP data  results to headquarters. As a result, some airports relying on these older  X-ray machines were not able to submit TIP data automatically by  electronic means and did not submit it manually. TSA officials reported  that they do not have a process for determining whether TIP data have  been submitted by all airports, on a regular basis, as required. TSA  officials told us they are making efforts to install automatic uploading  capabilities to all new machines that they expect will help ensure that TIP  data reporting is complete and timely. However, TSA has placed these  efforts on hold pending security concerns that must first be addressed  stemming from the recent cybersecurity breaches at the Office of  Personnel Management that have led to TSA reviewing its own  cybersecurity efforts before moving forward with installation of automatic  uploading capabilities on its X-ray machines.", "TSA officials also acknowledged that, in addition to the airports discussed  above that did not report any TIP data for a year or more at a time, other  airports may have reported only partial TIP results data during this same  time frame. TSA officials stated that, in the nationwide results data  provided to GAO, it would be difficult to ascertain how much data might  be missing from individual airports (during the time period covered by our  data) since the number and type of machines in use at those airports at  any particular point in time could vary.", "Based on our observation of the incomplete TIP data, we recommended  in May 2016 that DHS ensure that TSA officials at individual airports  submit complete TIP results to the national database as required by TSA  policy. In addition, we noted that Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government states that the information requirements needed to  achieve the agency\u2019s objectives should be identified and communicated  to management in a timely manner in order that they may carry out their  internal control and other responsibilities.

While TSA officials are still in the process of  determining root causes for the variances of the testing results between  the contractor and TSA personnel at the airports, they acknowledged that  initial results from the contractor appeared to confirm their prior concerns  that problems existed with maintaining the covert nature of the tests.", "These prior concerns had been based on higher detection rates at some  airports when compared to other airports on the same tests performed.", "In order to address the concerns stemming from the contractor\u2019s test  results, TSA initiated the following actions after reviewing results of the  contractor\u2019s initial round of testing in fiscal year 2015:", "Conducted briefings with FSDs on the contractor\u2019s findings and ongoing ASAP testing which included expectations that the FSDs use the information as input in overseeing their local ASAP testing programs. According to TSA officials, they are engaging in more frequent and improved communication with FSDs and staff responsible for the ASAP testing and are including discussions of potential corrective actions when warranted.", "Extended the work of the contractor by 6 months in order to determine if the previously-identified variances in results are continuing.", "Engaged in efforts to better identify root causes of ASAP testing failures, including the development of a data collection tool to facilitate these efforts.", "Added an ASAP headquarters testing program that will supplement the ASAP testing conducted by TSA field personnel. These headquarters testing teams will perform, on a permanent basis, the quality assurance and validation activities for ASAP that are currently being performed by the contract test teams. However, field personnel will continue to conduct the majority of ASAP testing.", "TSA officials stated that, through these measures, they believe they are  enhancing the accountability of the local FSDs and their staff for ensuring  the quality and reliability of the local ASAP testing programs moving  forward. The officials added that partial results during the 6-month  extension period of contract testing indicated that the previously-identified  variances in contractor and local ASAP testing had been reduced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Does Not Follow Up On Implementation of Recommendations Stemming from ASAP Testing at Airports", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in May 2016, TSA does not track whether  recommendations from their summary reports on ASAP results have  been implemented or reasons for not implementing them. These  recommendations may include, among other things, additional training for  certain points in the screening process and further testing in certain  areas. TSA officials stated that the various recommendations in the  reports are strictly for the consideration of FSDs in the field and  implementation is not mandatory. Such tracking would be consistent with  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government which requires  that internal controls be designed to ensure that ongoing monitoring  occurs during the course of normal operations. This tracking would also  help ensure that airports nationwide are taking corrective actions to  improve TSA performance, which the agency has identified as an area of  concern. Moreover, we reported that tracking the implementation of its  recommendations, including the extent to which identified corrective  actions are improving subsequent TSO performance and test results, will  help TSA better determine the extent to which its implemented  recommendations are leading to improvements in screening operations  and appropriately addressing identified root causes for previous test  failures. Further, without the assurance that recommendations for  corrective actions based on the root causes identified in ASAP testing will  be fully implemented\u2014where appropriate\u2014nationwide, we stated that  TSA would be limited in its ability to take full advantage of any findings  from the program.", "Based on TSA\u2019s lack of a tracking mechanism for the implementation of  its ASAP-related recommendations to the field, we recommended in May  2016 that DHS direct TSA to track implementation by airports of these  recommendations to ensure that corrective actions identified through  ASAP testing are being applied. DHS concurred with this  recommendation and is taking steps to address it. Specifically, DHS  reported that TSA is taking actions to formalize ASAP reporting including  the development of a standard format for corrective action plans that will  help TSA track corrective actions and their effectiveness in addressing  findings from ASAP tests. TSA expected to complete these actions by  May 31, 2016.", "Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper and Members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
