In addition to these annual appropriations, the individual park units are permitted to supplement their appropriations by keeping funds from certain in-park activities and by accepting certain other benefits from park support groups or concessioners. The funds going to the park units from these activities are not always subject to the annual congressional appropriations process. For the purposes of this report, we are collectively referring to these funds as special accounts.", "Concerned about the amount and use of monetary and other benefits that the park units receive in addition to their annual appropriations, you requested us to determine (1) the sources and amounts of special account funds available Park Service-wide and, for a sample of park units, the amount of special account funds that were available to each of them and (2) whether the expenditures of funds in special accounts were consistent with the purposes for which those accounts were established."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the years, the Park Service\u2019s basic mission of protecting the national park system for the enjoyment of current and future generations has not changed. Since the first park unit was created at Yellowstone over 100 years ago, the system has grown to encompass 369 units covering about 80 million acres and includes parks, monuments, and historic sites. The value of the infrastructure of buildings, roads, bridges, utility systems, and other facilities constructed to provide access to or to make use of natural resources on Park Service lands has grown to an estimated $35 billion. In addition, the Park Service\u2019s duties and responsibilities have expanded to include protecting endangered and threatened species, maintaining or restoring environmental quality, identifying and assessing the effects of its own activities on the environment and natural resources, and developing long-range plans.", "Recognizing the continuing growth and popularity of the national park system and the Park Service\u2019s increasing responsibilities, the Congress has increased appropriations to operate and maintain the Park Service by more than 30 percent (in constant dollars) over the past 10 fiscal years to about $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1994. However, despite these funding increases, we and others have shown that the health of the national park system is deteriorating. As recently as August 1995, we reported that the scope and quality of services for visitors within the park system have been declining and that many park units lack sufficient data to determine the overall condition or trend of their cultural and natural resources.", "The Congress and the Department of the Interior have taken measures to help deal with the parks\u2019 deteriorating conditions.

The other three accounts are not designed to recover costs, but provide park units with cash and noncash benefits to be used for a variety of purposes within the parks. In fiscal year 1994, according to data provided by the Park Service, the cost-recovery accounts totaled $6.5 million; the noncost-recovery accounts were valued at $38.5 million.

The use of these accounts has increased over the past few years as park unit managers look for ways to improve the facilities that serve visitors beyond what is normally provided through the annual appropriations. Expenditures from concessioners\u2019 special accounts are to be made only for improvements authorized by park unit managers. For example, replacing a roof on a lodge could be paid for from a concessioner\u2019s special account.", "According to data from the Park Service\u2019s headquarters, in fiscal year 1994, 21 park units had this type of account; headquarters officials estimated that the deposits totaled $13.9 million. However, Park Service officials acknowledged that the data were not complete because the Park Service did not have a system in place for fiscal year 1994 to routinely or systematically collect information on concessioners\u2019 special accounts. In March 1995, the Park Service introduced a computerized tracking system for concessioners\u2019 special accounts to address this situation. Although the system is still being implemented, Park Service officials stated that it should provide more complete data on the number of concessioners\u2019 special accounts and the amounts in them for fiscal year 1995.", "Table 1 provides information about the eight special accounts for which the Park Service provided us information.

While the Park Service\u2019s headquarters reported $13.9 million in concessioners\u2019 special accounts nationwide, the 27 park units in the sample reported to us a total of $19.4 million\u2014a difference of $5.5 million. Park Service officials explained most of the discrepancies as primarily due to park unit managers\u2019 differing interpretations of what is to be included in concessioners\u2019 special accounts. Table 2 compares the funds available in concessioners\u2019 special accounts as reported by Park Service headquarters with the amounts reported by the 14 park units in our sample that had such accounts.", "We discussed the $5.5 million difference between the Park Service headquarters\u2019 total for concessioners\u2019 special accounts and the individual figures we obtained at the 14 park units with concession officials at Park Service headquarters. On the basis of these discussions, we found that the discrepancies were due to differing interpretations among Park Service concessions officials\u2014both at headquarters and at the individual park units\u2014as to what should be counted as concessioners\u2019 special accounts.", "For example, the $7.909 million in concessioners\u2019 special accounts reported to us by a Yellowstone National Park concession official includes funds for a cyclic maintenance program which had $3.6 million in deposits for fiscal year 1994. According to Park Service headquarters officials, these deposits should not be considered as a concessioners\u2019 special account because the $3.6 million is money that is used to fulfill normal contractual maintenance requirements. However, a Yellowstone National Park concession official told us that this fund was established so that the concessioner could repair and maintain the historic structures which had fallen into disrepair due to neglect by the previous concessioner. According to the Yellowstone National Park concession official, maintenance provided by these funds is not routine; it is more extensive than that required of other concessioners, such as the preservation of historic log structures, because of the poor condition of the structures. We have included the $3.6 million in our totals because, as indicated by a Yellowstone National Park concession official, the expenditures from this account are over and above normal maintenance and similar to expenditures made from concessioners\u2019 special accounts at the parks we visited.", "According to Park Service headquarters officials, other differences between what the park units and headquarters reported could be due to different reporting cutoff dates between the concessioners and the Park Service so that some deposits appeared in a preceding or succeeding year. For example, Statue of Liberty National Monument officials reported to us $1.425 million in concessioners\u2019 special accounts for fiscal year 1994, while Park Service headquarters included this amount as a fiscal year 1993 deposit.", "Park Service management has been aware of the problem with tracking concessioners\u2019 special accounts since at least May 1992. At that time, we reported on the Park Service\u2019s inability to track accounts set aside by concessioners to improve government-owned facilities that they used (a forerunner to concessioners\u2019 special accounts). In response to our recommendation that the Park Service develop procedures to track these accounts, the Park Service introduced its \u201cSpecial Account Tracking System\u201d in March 1995. Although still in the process of implementing this system, concession officials at headquarters thought it would improve the accuracy and consistency of the data maintained by Park Service headquarters on concessioners\u2019 special accounts for fiscal year 1995.

The six park units used six of the eight types of special accounts. These park units did not receive any income from leasing historic properties or have any damaged resources that were subject to reimbursement. Our review showed that the special account expenditures at the six park units were consistent with the purposes for which the accounts were established. However, we noted that a concessioners\u2019 special account with deposits of $299,500 had been improperly established at one park unit.

These cost-recovery accounts were for living history demonstrations, special-use permits, and mess operations.", "Two of the six park units we visited had living history accounts, and they used most of the fee revenues to defray the salary expenses of the park unit employees who provided special tours or educational experiences. The remaining funds were used to purchase supplies to support these activities.", "At Lowell National Historical Park, staff provided tours of the locks and floodgates of the canal surrounding the town and provided interpretation for the Boott Cotton Mills Museum, including the weaving room and interactive exhibits about the industrial revolution. In addition, under a cooperative agreement with the University of Massachusetts, teachers provided educational experiences to students, including such hands-on activities as working on an assembly line, weaving, and role-playing as immigrants and inventors. In fiscal year 1994, the park unit collected $164,000 from the Boott Cotton Mills exhibits and the educational program with the University of Massachusetts. As authorized, the fees from these activities were used to pay the salaries of the teachers and the park unit employees that provided the services and to purchase supplies to support the activities.", "Carlsbad Caverns National Park also used the living history account. At Carlsbad, visitors are charged a fee to tour portions of the caverns with fragile or sensitive resources that need protection or when the number of tour participants must be limited due to physical conditions or some other reason. For example, because touring the Hall of the White Giant cavern requires crawling through tight passageways and some free climbing, knee pads and gloves are recommended, and the number of participants in each tour group is limited to eight. In fiscal year 1994, $170,000 was collected by the park unit in fees from these tours that were deposited into its living history account. The fees were used to pay the salaries of the park rangers that provided the tours.", "Five of the park units we visited had issued special-use permits during fiscal year 1994 and were collecting fees for the expenses incurred by the park unit as a result of the activity for which the special-use permit was issued.

For example, the activities at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks included weddings and cabin rental management, the activities at Grand Canyon National Park included commercial filming and whitewater rafting, and the activities at Mesa Verde National Park included photography workshops.", "The five park units that charged for special-use permits generated about $166,000 for fiscal year 1994 from these activities. In most instances, the expenses incurred were the salary costs of park unit staff who provided the special services. Other costs were for support expenses, such as supplies. The documentation we reviewed indicated that the expenditures supported only special-use activities.", "Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks used the mess operations account for collections made for meals furnished by the Park Service to Park Service and state employees\u2014firefighters and trail maintenance crews\u2014in the field.

For example, at Carlsbad Caverns National Park, donations were used to pay overtime salaries and purchase photography supplies. At Grand Canyon National Park, donations were used to purchase a computer and for search and rescue operations. The Jefferson National Expansion Memorial used its donated funds to purchase supplies, pay for training and travel for interpretive staff, and provide educational displays. At Mesa Verde National Park, a computer and printer for the park\u2019s Interpretative Division was purchased with donated funds. Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks used donated funds for a trail reconstruction project. Lowell National Historical Park received donations in fiscal year 1994 but reported no expenditures, choosing to spend the donations at a later date when a particular need surfaces. Park units are authorized to do this.", "The park cooperating associations were created to aid the Park Service in its mission of education and service. They provide noncash benefits to park units in the form of salaries for the nonpark personnel working in bookstores in visitors\u2019 centers, compensation for the volunteers who help with interpretive and other educational programs, and the publication of park unit newspapers. The cooperating associations may also provide cash donations to the park units.", "In fiscal year 1994, the benefits from the cooperating associations at the six park units we visited were valued at $2.8 million. With one exception, the benefits the cooperating associations provided supported education and service to the park units and their visitors as authorized. For example, at the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial, the cooperating association provided the park with 44 full-time and part-time paid cooperative staff to assist visitors in the Museum of Westward Expansion, the Old Courthouse, the park library, and at various other exhibits. In addition, the association paid for travel and training for Park Service employees in the interpretive branch for a total donation of $985,000 in fiscal year 1994.", "At Grand Canyon National Park, donations valued at $1.2 million from the cooperating association provided a stipend and paid other expenses, such as uniforms and supplies, to students who worked part-time in all areas of the park and paid for about seven full-time association employees who spent about half of their time providing information to visitors in stores run by the cooperating association. In addition, the association provided a new trailside exhibit and renovated the historic Kolb Studio\u2019s bookstore and art gallery.", "At Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, cooperating association donations totaled $87,000 in fiscal year 1994. These donations included salaries of 11 part-time guides and 3 part-time ticket collectors for the cave tours, several interpretive exhibits, and free publications, such as the park unit\u2019s newspaper. The cooperating association also provided $3,600 toward the salary of a seasonal park ranger.

Included in the cooperating association\u2019s donation to Mesa Verde National Park were funds toward the construction of a new interpretive center near the park entrance.", "Concessioners\u2019 special accounts are contractual arrangements between the Park Service and the concessioners. These arrangements occur when the concessioners and park unit managers agree that the concessioners will establish commercial bank accounts that are to be used to rehabilitate and construct the facilities that directly support the concessioners\u2019 services. These commercial bank accounts are established in addition to, or sometimes in lieu of, franchise fees, which, in contrast, are deposited in the U. S. Treasury. Any expenditures from these special accounts must be authorized by park unit managers.", "Concessioners\u2019 special accounts were established at three of the six park units we visited\u2014Mesa Verde National Park, Grand Canyon National Park, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.

We found that the expenditures from the concessioners\u2019 special accounts at these park units were made for authorized purposes.", "Mesa Verde National Park had one concessioner\u2019s special account. The deposits for fiscal year 1994 totaled about $44,000. Expenditures were made from this account to purchase and install bear-proof trash cans at a government-owned, concessioner-operated campground.", "Grand Canyon National Park had seven separate concessioners\u2019 special accounts. The deposits to these accounts totaled about $895,000 for fiscal year 1994. Expenditures were made from these accounts for several projects, such as painting and repairing an historic railway depot and leasing a van to transport employees\u2019 dependents to and from the concessioner-operated day-care facility. In several instances, funds had not yet been expended from the concessioners\u2019 special account but were being accumulated to fund more costly projects. For example, a concessioner\u2019s special account with a fiscal year 1994 balance of about $9,900 was earmarked for the construction of a backcountry toilet facility estimated to cost about $40,000.", "When we visited Grand Canyon National Park, we identified one concessioner\u2019s special account where the concessioner had made deposits of about $299,500 for 1994. The funds deposited into this concessioner\u2019s special account had, in previous years, been deposited into the U.S. Treasury as franchise fees. We noted, however, that the deposits to the concessioner\u2019s special account had occurred before the effective date of the agreement between the concessioner and park unit officials to establish the account. Since then, action has been initiated by park unit officials to remove the 1994 payments from the concessioner\u2019s special account and deposit them into the U.S. Treasury. In addition, park officials told us that deposits occurring after the effective date of that agreement were going into the concessioner\u2019s special account.", "At Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, the concessioner\u2019s special account was used to replace the Grant Grove food market, which was destroyed by fire in 1992.
