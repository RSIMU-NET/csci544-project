These concerns may have been in part due to PI firms' business strategies and their lack of financial transparency compared to publicly traded companies. In September 2010, GAO reported on the extent of PI ownership of nursing homes and firms' involvement in the operations of homes they acquired. In this report, GAO examined how nursing homes that were acquired by PI firms changed from before acquisition or differed from other homes in: (1) deficiencies cited on state surveys, (2) nurse staffing levels, and (3) financial performance. GAO identified nursing homes that had been acquired by PI firms from 2004 through 2007 and then used data from CMS's Online Survey, Certification, and Reporting system and Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility Cost Reports to compare these PI homes to other forprofit and nonprofit homes. For PIacquired homes, GAO also compared homes for which the operations and real estate were owned by the same firm to those that were not. Because research has shown that other variables influence deficiencies, staffing, and financial performance, GAO statistically controlled--that is adjusted--for several factors, including the percent of residents for whom the payer is Medicare, facility size, occupancy rate, market competition, and state. Any differences GAO found cannot necessarily be attributed to PI ownership or acquisition."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["On average, PI and other for-profit homes had more total deficiencies than nonprofit homes both before (2003) and after (2009) acquisition. PI-acquired homes were also more likely to have been cited for a serious deficiency than nonprofit homes before, but not after, acquisition. Serious deficiencies involve actual harm or immediate jeopardy to residents. From 2003 to 2009, total deficiencies increased and the likelihood of a serious deficiency decreased in PI homes; these changes did not differ significantly from those in other homes. Reported average total nurse staffing ratios (hours per resident per day) were lower in PI homes than in other homes in both 2003 and 2009, but the staffing mix changed differently in PI homes. Staffing mix is the relative proportion of registered nurses (RN), licensed practical nurses (LPN), and certified nurse aides (CNA). RN ratios increased more from 2003 to 2009 in PI homes than in other homes, while CNA ratios increased more in other homes than in PI homes. The increase in RN ratios in PI homes from 2003 to 2009 was greater if the same PI firm acquired both operations and real estate than if not. The financial performance of PI homes showed both cost increases from 2003 to 2008 and higher margins in those years when compared to other for-profit or nonprofit homes. Facility costs as well as capital-related costs for PI homes increased more, on average, from 2003 to 2008 than for other ownership types. The increase was less if the same PI firm acquired both the operations and real estate than if it did not. In 2008, PI homes reported higher facility costs than other for-profit homes (but lower costs than nonprofit homes) and higher capital-related costs than other ownership types. Despite increased costs, PI homes also showed increased facility margins and the increase was not significantly different from that of other for-profit homes. In contrast, the margins of nonprofit homes decreased. Although the acquisition of nursing homes by PI firms raised questions about the potential effects on quality of care, GAO's analysis of data from before and after acquisition did not indicate an increase in the likelihood of serious deficiencies or a decrease in average reported total nurse staffing. The performance of these PI homes was mixed, however, with respect to the other quality variables GAO examined. We found differences among PI-acquired homes that reflected management decisions made by the firms and, to varying degrees, some of the changes in the PI firms we studied were consistent with attempts to increase their homes' attractiveness to higher paying residents. HHS provided CMS's observations on our methodology. CMS suggested an alternative to our \"before and after\" acquisition methodology to take into account the fact that PI firms acquired nursing homes at different points in time during 2004 through 2007. One of the studies we cited used such a methodology and we believe that the use of different methodologies enhances the understanding of an issue. CMS also identified a number of additional approaches for exploring the relationship between PI ownership and quality. We agree that such approaches merit future attention. CMS also acknowledged that the report is an important step toward better understanding the effect of nursing home ownership on the quality of care provided to residents."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The acquisition by private investment (PI) firms of several large nursing  home chains led to congressional and media attention in 2007 stemming  from concerns that the quality of resident care may have been adversely  affected. For example, a 2007 New York Times article reported that PI  firms had reduced nursing home costs and increased profitability by  cutting registered nurse (RN) staffing. These concerns may have been  due in part to PI firms\u2019 business strategies and their lack of financial  transparency compared to publicly traded companies. PI firms may hold  their investments for relatively short time frames while they attempt to  improve financial and operating performance. In addition, they may place  large levels of debt on the acquired company. Since the ownership  interests of PI firms generally are not publicly traded on a stock  exchange, the nursing home companies acquired by such firms are not  subject to the same federal financial disclosure requirements, making  their finances and management less transparent than publicly traded  companies.", "Together, the Medicare and Medicaid programs funded about $89 billion  for nursing home care for elderly and disabled individuals in 2009.  Medicaid, which funds about two-thirds of all nursing home resident days,  pays for individuals who typically require long-term custodial care, such  as help with bathing and toileting. Medicare, which funds about   12 percent of nursing home resident days, pays for individuals who  require more intensive skilled care for a relatively short period of time  following a hospital stay. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) oversees both programs and contracts with state survey agencies  to conduct inspections, known as standard surveys, and complaint  investigations to determine whether nursing homes that participate in the  Medicare and Medicaid programs are complying with federal quality  standards. State surveyors cite deficiencies when a nursing home is  found to be out of compliance with these standards, which include a  requirement that homes have sufficient nursing staff. Research has  shown both deficiencies and nurse staffing levels to be indicators of the  quality of care in nursing homes.", "You asked us to examine the impact of PI ownership on the quality of  care provided and on nursing homes\u2019 financial performance. This report  builds on our September 2010 report, which addressed the extent of PI  ownership of nursing homes and the involvement of PI firms in the  operations of homes they acquired. We reported that PI firms acquired  about 1,900 unique nursing homes from 1998 through 2008. In this  report, we examine how nursing homes that were acquired by PI firms  changed from before acquisition or differed from other homes with regard  to (1) health deficiencies cited on state surveys, (2) nurse staffing levels,  and (3) financial performance.", "To determine whether PI-owned nursing homes changed from before  acquisition or differed from other nursing homes in deficiencies, nurse  staffing levels, or financial performance, we (1) identified nursing homes  that had been acquired by PI firms from 2004 through 2007 and   (2) compared data from before and after PI acquisition of these homes to  data from other for-profit and nonprofit homes. The PI homes we studied  were acquired by the top 10 PI acquirers of nursing homes we identified  in our September 2010 report and were still owned by the same PI firm in  2009. We included homes for which a PI firm acquired the operations,  the real estate, or both. We obtained data for our outcome variables from  CMS: deficiency and nurse staffing data came from CMS\u2019s Online  Survey, Certification, and Reporting system (OSCAR) and data regarding  financial performance came from Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF)", "Cost Reports. OSCAR is the only national, uniform data source that  contains data on nursing home deficiencies and nurse staffing. Medicare  SNF Cost Reports are the only publicly available source of financial data  on most Medicare providers.  \uf0b7  Deficiencies. We examined total deficiencies and whether there were  any \u201cserious\u201d deficiencies using data from both standard surveys and  complaint investigations. Deficiencies are categorized into levels  according to the number of residents potentially or actually affected  and the degree of relative harm involved. Serious deficiencies are  those at the levels indicating actual harm or immediate jeopardy  (actual or potential death or serious injury). As we have noted in prior  reports, state surveys may underestimate deficiencies.  \uf0b7  Nurse staffing. We examined the total number of nursing hours per  resident per day (nurse staffing ratios), as well as ratios for each of  three types of nursing staff separately\u2014RNs, licensed practical  nurses (LPN), and certified nurse aides (CNA). Nurse staffing data are  self-reported by nursing homes.  \uf0b7  Financial performance. We examined (1) facility costs per resident  day, defined as the total facility costs\u2014including both operating and  capital costs\u2014divided by total resident days; (2) capital-related costs  per resident day, defined as capital-related costs allocated to nursing  home resident care divided by nursing home resident days; and   (3) facility margins, defined as the amount of total facility revenues  exceeding total facility costs, divided by total facility revenues.  Financial data are self-reported by nursing homes.", "Data analyses. To determine whether the PI, other for-profit, and  nonprofit homes we studied differed from one another, we analyzed data  from two points in time, one before and one after our target acquisition  period of 2004 to 2007. In general, we analyzed data from 2003 and 2009  (for deficiencies and staffing) or 2003 and 2008 (for financial  performance). The 2008 and 2009 data were the latest available, which  allowed as much time as possible for any changes associated with PI  acquisition to take effect. We included data from before PI acquisition so  we could determine whether the post acquisition data reflected  preexisting differences. Throughout this report, we refer to the homes that  were acquired by PI firms as \u201cPI homes,\u201d even when referring to 2003,  which preceded our target acquisition period. We included data from  other types of nursing homes so we could determine whether any  changes from before to after acquisition reflected changes that occurred  regardless of type of ownership. For PI-acquired homes, we also  compared homes for which the operations and real estate were owned by  the same firm to those that were not. Because research has shown that  other variables can influence deficiencies, staffing, and financial  performance, we statistically controlled\u2014that is adjusted\u2014for these  variables when analyzing our data. This adjustment allowed us to  examine data from homes with different types of ownership after  neutralizing the effect of these variables. Our control variables included  membership in a chain, payer mix (i.e., the percent of residents for whom  the payer is Medicare, Medicaid, or another source), facility size (number  of beds), occupancy rate, market competition (based on the number of  beds in each county), and geographic location (state). Payers other than  Medicare and Medicaid include private insurance, religious organizations,  the Department of Veterans Affairs, residents who pay for their own care,  and others. Unless otherwise specified, all results that we present are  based on our adjusted analyses and are statistically significant at the   0.05 level. To provide context, we show the unadjusted values in our  figures and also describe the key differences that were significant in our  analyses of adjusted data.", "In addition, to determine whether there were systematic differences  among nursing homes acquired by PI firms from 2004 to 2007 in  outcomes we studied, we conducted a series of analyses in which we  separately compared each of five PI firms\u2019 homes to all other PI-acquired  nursing homes in our study. We restricted our analyses to those PI firms  and homes for which we could identify both the PI owner of operations  and real estate and those PI firms for which we determined we had data  from a sufficient number of homes.  \uf0b7  For three PI firms\u2019 homes, the same PI firm acquired both operations  and real estate.  \uf0b7  For two PI firms that acquired nursing home operations, a different PI  firm acquired the real estate.", "In each of five separate analyses, we compared the homes owned by a  PI firm to all other PI homes in our larger aggregate analysis, including  homes owned by the other firms we studied and any other homes owned  by that PI firm (e.g., those for which we could not identify the real estate  owner). Again, we adjusted for other variables that can influence  deficiencies, staffing, and financial performance. Unless otherwise  specified, all results that we present were statistically significant at the  0.05 level in analyses of adjusted data. We also interviewed  representatives of PI firms that acquired nursing home operations, real  estate, or both, and representatives of companies that operate PI-owned  homes and, if their homes were part of our firm level analyses, we  discussed the results for their homes.", "For all analyses, we excluded nursing homes when extreme values  suggested data entry or other reporting errors. We performed data  reliability checks on the list of PI homes we compiled and on data we  used from OSCAR, Medicare\u2019s Provider of Services, and Medicare SNF  Cost Reports. We also reviewed relevant documentation and discussed  these data sources with knowledgeable officials and industry experts. In  addition to our statistical analyses, we reviewed published research on  the quality and costs of nursing home care, our prior work on nursing  homes, and other relevant documentation. We interviewed officials from  CMS and experts on nursing home quality and costs. We reviewed all  data for soundness and consistency and determined that they were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "Limitations. Our analyses have several important limitations. Our  findings cannot be generalized beyond the PI-acquired nursing homes we  studied, which were limited to only those homes acquired from 2004 to  2007 by the 10 largest PI acquirers of nursing homes. Because they may  have been caused by other uncontrolled and unquantified variables, the  differences between PI-acquired and other nursing homes that we  observed cannot necessarily be attributed to PI ownership and the  differences we observed from before to after acquisition cannot  necessarily be attributed to PI acquisition. Despite these limitations, our  analyses do provide a reasonable basis for comparing deficiencies, nurse  staffing, and financial performance of the PI-owned homes we studied to  each other and to other types of nursing homes at two points in time.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 to July 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Owners may be for-profit, nonprofit, or government  entities; about two-thirds of nursing homes are for-profit businesses.  In general, for-profit businesses, which may be publicly traded or  privately owned, have a goal of making profits that are distributed  among the owners and stockholders. In contrast, a nonprofit entity  receives favorable tax status because it may not operate for the  benefit of nor distribute revenues to private interests.  \uf0b7  Management involvement. Nursing home owners vary in terms of their  involvement in management of the business: they may be the  operators, and hold the state license, or they may contract with  separate licensed entities to manage the day-to-day operations.  \uf0b7  Number of homes owned. Owners or operators may have only one  facility or they may have multiple facilities across one or more states  that are part of a chain. Owners or operators may also have multiple  chains. According to a study conducted for the Department of Health  and Human Services, about half of nursing homes are part of a  chain.  \uf0b7  Real estate. Owners or operators do not necessarily own the real  estate where care is delivered, but instead may lease it. The  separation of real estate assets from the operations may be done to  obtain financing or in an attempt to protect real estate assets from  malpractice claims. Furthermore, the owners, leaseholders, and  operators may or may not be owned by the same or related entities.", "PI firm nursing home ownership. In general, PI firms use a combination  of investment capital and debt financing to acquire companies, including  nursing home companies, with a goal of making a profit and eventually  returning that profit to investors and the firm. As we noted in our prior  report, some of the 10 PI firms we studied acquired both the operations  and the real estate of nursing home chains while others only acquired the  real estate. The former firms sit on the chains\u2019 boards of directors and  told us that their role is to provide strategic direction rather than directing  day-to-day operations. In contrast, PI firms we studied that only  purchased real estate do not sit on the nursing home chains\u2019 boards of  directors. Among the PI firms that shared their reasons for investing in  the nursing home industry, most cited the increased demand for long- term care due to an aging population. We also reported that the  investment time horizons and objectives of PI firms vary. Some PI firms  purchased the homes with a planned short-term \u201cexit strategy\u201d and others  intended to hold the investment over the long term. PI firm managers  said they are able to make business improvements that their publicly  traded competitors may be less willing to make because they generally  are not subject to periodic disclosure requirements about their financial  performance and therefore are not tied to producing profits on a quarterly  basis. In addition, PI firms have said that they increase the operator\u2019s  access to funding that can be used to increase staff wages, enhance  operations, or modernize facilities and which ultimately may result in  improved quality of care.", "PI firm business strategies. PI firms may pursue different business  strategies with respect to the types of residents they want to attract and  the efficiency of their operations. Researchers have found that some  nursing homes may specialize in caring for residents with certain care  needs or Medicare residents. Care for such residents may result in higher  levels of reimbursement. Indeed, prior to and after acquisition, PI homes  we studied had a higher average percentage of residents whose care was  reimbursed by Medicare compared to other for-profit and nonprofit  homes. After acquisition, the percentage of residents in PI homes whose  care was paid for by a source other than Medicare or Medicaid was  higher on average than in other for-profit homes, but lower than in  nonprofit nursing homes.", "Prior to acquisition, the average occupancy rates in PI homes were not  significantly different from other homes.

Under contract with CMS, state survey agencies  conduct standard surveys, which occur once a year, on average, and  complaint investigations as needed. A standard survey involves a  comprehensive assessment of about 200 federal quality standards. In  contrast, complaint investigations generally focus on a specific allegation  regarding resident care or safety made by a resident, family member, or  nursing home staff member. Deficiencies identified during either  standard surveys or complaint investigations are classified in 1 of 12  categories according to their scope (i.e., the number of residents  potentially or actually affected) and severity (i.e., the potential for or  occurrence of harm to residents).

For example, a higher  proportion of RNs may be employed to meet residents\u2019 needs in homes  that serve greater numbers of residents with acute care needs or those  with specialty care units (such as units for residents who require  ventilators).

By  statute, nursing homes that participate in Medicare and Medicaid are  required to have sufficient nursing staff to provide nursing and related  services to allow each resident to attain or maintain the highest  practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being. In addition to  this general requirement, every nursing home must have 24 hours of  licensed nurse (RN or LPN) coverage per day, including one RN on duty  for at least 8 consecutive hours per day, 7 days per week.

Residents who require low- intensity nursing and therapy or custodial care, like the typical Medicaid  resident, are less costly, in part because their care needs are not as  heavily dependent on the services of licensed nurses. Medicare  beneficiaries are typically more costly than Medicaid residents, have  shorter stays, and are admitted with the expectation that they will  rehabilitate, recover, and return to their residences.

Under such  payment systems, nursing homes have an incentive to provide care at a  cost below the payment amount because they can retain any excess  revenue not spent providing care. Although Medicare generally pays for  the care of the nursing home residents with the most complex care  needs, Medicare and private insurance have the highest payment rates  for nursing home care and, on average, reimburse homes more than the  costs of care. On the other hand, industry representatives perennially  express concerns that Medicaid payment rates in many states are so low  that they do not cover the costs of providing care. Some nursing homes  trying to increase their profitability may focus on reducing their costs, by  providing fewer or less expensive services. Other homes trying to  increase their profitability may staff their homes and renovate their  buildings to attract the better-paying Medicare and private insurance  residents that will enhance their revenues or profits.

A  home that increases its nurse staffing or adopts a new technology to  improve the quality of care may also reduce its profitability because it  increased costs without increasing revenues. However, some  expenditures may prevent additional costs or increase revenues and  therefore lead to improved profitability. For example, an expense can  prevent subsequent, costly care needs, such as when higher levels of RN  staffing result in reduced levels of infections.

CMS also acknowledged that the  report is an important step toward better understanding the effect of  nursing home ownership on the quality of care provided to residents. In  general, representatives of the PI firms commented that the report  handled a complex topic well and that its conclusions were fair and  balanced.

We selected the 2004 through 2007 timeframe because it was  the period of heaviest PI acquisition of nursing home chains. Finally, CMS  said that the exclusion of homes acquired from 2004 through 2007 but  sold by PI firms by 2009 could have biased our results. However, only 6  homes were excluded because they were sold and another 55 were  excluded because we could not verify they were still owned by the  acquiring PI firm in 2009. These exclusions represented less than   5 percent of the PI homes we studied. We believe these exclusions were  appropriate and that it is unlikely that such a small share of homes would  have notably affected our findings.", "CMS also suggested a number of alternative approaches for exploring the  relationship between private investment and quality of care, such as   (1) using measures derived from its Five-Star Quality Rating System,   (2) examining the citation of serious deficiencies on successive surveys,  and (3) studying the association between aggregate staffing payroll and  quality of care.

Specifically, if no state standard survey was available from  2003 or 2009, we substituted data from 1 year later, if available;  otherwise, we used data from 1 year before\u2014with the constraint that the  data for PI-acquired homes had to be from before the acquisition and at  least 1 year after acquisition. For example, if 2009 data were not available  for a particular home, we sought 2010 data, if available; otherwise, we  used 2008 data with the constraint that the data must be from 1 year after  acquisition for PI-acquired homes. We also collected OSCAR data on  deficiencies cited during complaint investigations in calendar years 2003  and 2009. To avoid double counting, we excluded any complaint  deficiencies that matched a deficiency cited in a standard survey that was  conducted within 15 days of the complaint investigation. We refer to all  data used in our analyses of deficiencies as having been from 2003 or  2009.", "We included data from 12,956 nursing homes in our analyses of  deficiencies, of which 1,270 were PI-owned in 2009 and had been  acquired from 2004 through 2007. Because we used data from 2003 and  2009 for homes acquired anytime from 2004 through 2007, the amount of  time between the surveys that identified any deficiencies and PI  acquisition varied. In most cases, the surveys were within 3 years of  acquisition.", "Nurse staffing. We calculated four different staffing ratios, that is,  nursing hours per resident per day: registered nurse (RN) ratios, licensed  practical nurse (LPN) ratios, certified nurse aid (CNA) ratios, and total  nurse staffing ratios (i.e., the total number of nursing hours, whether by  RNs, LPNs, or CNAs, per resident per day). In each case, we included  full-time, part-time, and contract hours, but we excluded hours reported  for performing administrative duties or as Directors of Nursing. When  calculating CNA staffing, we also included two other types of nursing  staff\u2014nurse aides in training and medication aides.", "We used the same set of nursing homes included in our analyses of  deficiencies to analyze nurse staffing, but excluded homes from the  staffing analyses if the data related to staffing appeared to represent data  entry or other reporting errors. Specifically, we excluded facilities that, in  either 2003 or 2009, reported  \uf0b7  more residents than beds, \uf0b7  more than 10 percent of the home\u2019s beds as not certified for Medicare  \uf0b7  0 total nursing hours per resident per day, \uf0b7  24 or more total nursing hours per resident per day, or staffing and census data that resulted in nurse staffing ratios that were  three or more standard deviations above the mean, indicating that  they were statistical outliers.", "We included data from 11,522 nursing homes in our analyses of staffing  ratios, of which 1,176 were PI-owned in 2009 and acquired from 2004  through 2007.", "Financial performance. To examine nursing homes\u2019 financial  performance, we used Medicare SNF cost reports to compute three  measures:  \uf0b7  Facility costs per resident day, defined as the total facility costs\u2014 including both operating and capital costs\u2014divided by total resident  days.  \uf0b7  Capital-related costs per resident day, defined as capital-related costs  allocated to nursing home resident care divided by total resident  days.  \uf0b7  Facility margins, defined as the amount of total facility revenues  exceeding total facility costs, divided by total facility revenues.", "All Medicare-certified nursing homes\u2014or SNFs\u2014must submit cost  reports on an annual basis to CMS. The cost report contains provider  information\u2014such as facility characteristics, utilization data, costs, and  financial data\u2014generally covering a 12-month period of operations based  on the provider\u2019s fiscal year. The cost report contains utilization and cost  information on Medicare-covered services, and also contains information  for services provided to all residents, regardless of payer.", "We used cost report data for the provider\u2019s fiscal years 2003 and 2008  because fiscal year 2009 Medicare SNF cost reports were not available at  the time we collected our data. For PI-acquired homes, we ensured that  these data were from before and after acquisition. Our analyses of  financial data also required information from OSCAR about facility  characteristics such as the percentage of residents whose care was paid  by Medicare or Medicaid and occupancy rate. We sought OSCAR data  from calendar years 2003 and 2008, and if these data were not available,  we substituted data from 1 year after, if available, otherwise 1 year  before. We refer to all data used in our analyses of financial  performance as having been from 2003 or 2008.", "We created different datasets to examine our three calculated measures  of financial performance. For each measure, we excluded nursing homes  if the cost report covered less than 10 or more than 14 months and those  that did not have Medicare SNF cost reports or OSCAR data from both  time periods. We also excluded nursing homes for which the data  appeared to represent data entry or other reporting anomalies or were  statistical outliers.  \uf0b7  Facility costs. Data for our analyses of facility costs were from 9,616  nursing homes, of which 1,089 were PI-owned in 2009 and acquired  from 2004 through 2007. We excluded homes that, in either 2003 or  2008, reported  \uf0b7  no facility costs or  facility costs per resident day that were more than two times the  interquartile range below the 25th or above the 75th percentile.  \uf0b7  Capital costs. Data for our analyses of capital-related costs were from  9,707 nursing homes, of which 1,088 were PI-owned in 2009 and  acquired from 2004 through 2007. We excluded facilities that, in either  2003 or 2008, reported  \uf0b7  no capital-related costs or  capital costs per resident day that were more than two times the  interquartile range below the 25th or above the 75th percentile.  \uf0b7  Facility margins. Data for our analyses of facility margins were from  8,630 nursing homes, of which 955 were PI-owned in 2009 and  acquired from 2004 through 2007. We excluded facilities that, in either  2003 or 2008, reported  \uf0b7  no facility revenues or missing margins or  facility margins that were in the top or bottom 1 percent of all  homes we studied, regardless of type of ownership.", "Table 2 lists the variables we included in our datasets, describes our  operational measures of these variables, and identifies the sources of the  data we used to calculate these measures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Analytic Approach", "paragraphs": ["We conducted both aggregated data analyses and analyses of data from  specific PI firms\u2019 homes.

Using these models, we compared  outcome data from homes with different types of ownership (PI, other for- profit, and nonprofit) at each of two points in time (2003 and 2009 for  deficiencies and staffing, and 2003 and 2008 for financial performance)  and we examined whether there were differences between years for PI  homes and whether any such differences were similar to any differences  between years in the other for-profit and nonprofit homes. We included  data from before PI acquisition so we could determine whether the  postacquisition data reflected preexisting differences. We included data  from other types of nursing homes so we could determine whether any  changes from before to after acquisition reflected changes that occurred  regardless of type of ownership. We also compared data from PI homes  for which the same firm acquired both operations and real estate to data  from PI homes for which the same firm did not acquire both operations  and real estate.", "Our panel regression models statistically controlled for variables that  research has shown can influence nursing home deficiencies, staffing,  and financial performance. These variables were (1) the percentage of  residents for whom the payer was Medicare in 2003 and 2009; (2) the  percentage of residents for whom the payer was neither Medicare nor  Medicaid in 2003 and 2009; (3) chain affiliation in 2009; (4) facility size as  indicated by the number of beds certified by Medicare, Medicaid, or both  in 2009; (5) occupancy rate in 2003 and 2009; (6) market competition in  2003 and 2008; and (7) geographic location (state).", "We used random effects models rather than fixed effects models to  measure not only the change in outcomes for the same nursing home  groups over time, but also the difference between groups at each point in  time. Moreover, we wanted to accurately reflect the change over time in  our control variables and their effects on our outcome variables\u2014 something that can be accomplished using a random effects model, but  not a fixed effects model.", "Illustration. To illustrate our analytic strategy, consider the example of  reported RN ratios. Unadjusted average (or mean) reported RN ratios are  presented in table 3, along with the number of homes in our analyses.", "Our panel models analyze the data to identify the size and statistical  significance of differences between means. Statistical significance is  indicated by the probability (P-value) of coefficients calculated by the  panel regression for the comparisons it tests. The specific comparisons  tested by our panel regressions are based on independent variables and  their interactions. Our panel regression models included a main effect for  year and a main effect for ownership type (PI, other for-profit, and  nonprofit). The models also included an interaction between year and  ownership type, which allowed for the comparison of data between  different types of ownership at each point in time as well as the difference  between years. Therefore, the five terms in the model are year, other  for-profit homes, nonprofit homes, year by other for-profit homes, and  year by nonprofit homes. The interpretation of the model terms are as  follows: (1) the main effect year measures the difference between 2003  and 2009 for PI homes, (2) the main effect for other for-profit measures  the difference between PI and other for-profits in 2003, (3) the main effect  for nonprofit measures the difference between PI and nonprofits in 2003,  (4) the interaction effect of year by other for-profit measures the  difference between PI and other for-profits in the change from 2003 to  2009, and (5) the interaction effect year by nonprofit measures the  difference between PI and nonprofits in the change from 2003 to 2009.", "Table 4 shows the results of our panel regression analysis of reported RN  ratios without including control variables\u2014that is, the coefficients and  associated P-values for tested comparisons. With unadjusted data, the  coefficients calculated by the panel regression can be calculated directly  from the means in table 3. For example, the coefficient shown in table 4  for the difference between other for-profit homes and PI homes in 2003 is  -0.023, which is the difference between the relevant means shown in  table 3: 0.275 minus 0.298. As another example, the coefficient shown in  table 4 for the change from 2003 to 2009 for PI homes is 0.100, which is  the change from 2003 to 2009 for PI homes shown in table 3. Similarly,  the coefficient of -0.068 in table 4 indicates the difference in the change in  RN ratio from 2003 to 2009 between other for-profit and PI homes and is  equal to the difference between the change for other for-profit homes and  the change for PI homes shown in table 3: (0.032 minus 0.100).", "In contrast, table 5 shows the results of a parallel panel analysis of the  reported RN ratios using the same independent variables described  above, but in this second analysis, we included our control variables.  When the regression model includes control variables, coefficients can  not be calculated directly from means. The change in key results between  table 4 and table 5 reflects the impact of control variables on RN ratios.  For example, when we controlled for these variables, we found that the  average reported RN ratios for PI homes did not differ significantly from  those of other for-profit homes in 2003.", "To examine differences between means that were not directly addressed  in our panel regressions, we conducted chi-square tests. For example,  after applying our panel regressions, we used chi-square tests to  determine whether there were significant differences between other for- profit and nonprofit homes.", "Deficiencies. To apply a panel model regression to deficiencies, we first  examined the data to select an appropriate statistical model and ensure  that the data were consistent with relevant statistical assumptions. Our  measure of total deficiencies was a count of how many deficiencies were  cited in the nursing home. Count variables can be modeled by a negative  binomial regression. Coefficients from a negative binomial model  represent the expected log-count of an event and can be transformed into  incidence-rate ratios, which represent how much more or less the  expected incidence rate is for one group in comparison to another. In this  report, we refer to these ratios as total deficiencies.", "When we examined the data regarding whether a home was cited for a  serious deficiency or not, we determined that a different panel regression  model was most appropriate. Because a relatively small proportion of  nursing homes were cited for serious deficiencies, and most homes with  any serious deficiency had no more than two, our measure was whether  or not a home had been cited for any serious deficiencies. For such  binary outcomes, a logistic regression model is appropriate. Logistic  regression model coefficients represent log-odds ratios and can be  transformed to odds ratios, which indicate how much more or less likely  the odds are for a binary (yes/no) event to occur for one group in  comparison to another. In this report, we refer to these ratios as the  likelihood of a serious deficiency.", "Nurse staffing. After excluding nursing homes with staffing ratios that  appeared to represent data entry or other reporting errors, the distribution  of each staffing ratio approximated a normal distribution, so we used an  Ordinary Least Squares panel regression model to analyze these data.", "Financial performance. After excluding nursing homes with extreme  values, the distributions of facility costs per resident day and capital- related costs per resident day were highly positively skewed, that is, they  were not distributed normally or symmetrically around the average. We  transformed these variables by taking their natural logarithms; the  resultant distributions were consistent with the relevant statistical  assumptions. We used Ordinary Least Squares panel regression models  to analyze the log-transformed values.", "After excluding nursing homes with extreme values, facility margins  approximated a normal distribution, so we used an Ordinary Least  Squares panel regression model to analyze the data. We conducted two  additional regression analyses of facility margins in which we controlled  for case mix (the average acuity of the residents in a nursing home) and  other sources of revenue (such as home health or hospice care).

In addition, the differences between PI-acquired and other  nursing homes that we observed cannot necessarily be attributed to PI  ownership because they may have been caused by other uncontrolled  and unquantified variables, such as specific characteristics of the  particular sets of homes or particular PI firms in our review or the fact that  these homes changed ownership, rather than the effect of PI ownership  per se. Moreover, although our data for homes that were acquired by PI  firms came from before and after the PI firm acquired them, we cannot  assume that any difference we observed between the data from 2003 and  the data from 2008 or 2009 were due to acquisition by the PI firm  because other things could have occurred between those years. For  example, changes we observed could have occurred after 2003, but  before acquisition by the PI firm.", "In addition, each of our measures has limitations:  PI ownership. Our sample of PI-acquired homes did not include all PI- owned homes. Specifically, to compare data from before and after  acquisition by a PI firm, we excluded PI-owned homes that were acquired  before or after our target acquisition interval. Moreover, the 10 PI firms in  our sample acquired about 94 percent of the nursing homes that were  acquired by PI firms from 2004 through 2007; we could not identify the  other approximately 6 percent of PI-acquired nursing homes, and as a  result, some homes that we classified as other for-profit or nonprofit  homes may have been PI-owned.", "Deficiency data. We have previously documented inconsistencies in  states\u2019 citation of deficiencies. Our analyses controlled for variation  across states, but may not have captured all variation associated with  state surveys. In addition, deficiency data provide incomplete  information about quality of care. Although cited deficiencies indicate  problems with the quality of care that were identified during a survey, the  absence of cited deficiencies does not necessarily indicate that the quality  of care was good because surveyors may have failed to identify and cite  actual quality problems.", "Staffing data. Although OSCAR was the most suitable data source  available for our analyses, OSCAR staffing data have several limitations.  First, OSCAR provides a 2-week snapshot of staffing and a 1-day  snapshot of residents at the time of the survey, so it may not have  accurately depicted a facility\u2019s staffing or number of residents over a  longer period. Second, staffing is reported across the entire facility, while  the number of residents is reported only for Medicare- and Medicaid- certified beds; as a result, our calculations may have overstated staffing  ratios for homes with noncertified beds. Third, neither CMS nor the  states regularly attempt to verify the accuracy of the OSCAR staffing  data, and at least some studies question these data. For example,  research in one state suggested systematic inaccuracies, with larger and  for-profit homes being more likely to report higher levels of RN staffing in  OSCAR than in their audited state Medicaid cost reports.", "Financial data. Although Medicare cost reports provided the most  suitable data for our analyses, they are not routinely audited and are  subject to minimal verification, so they may contain inaccuracies. Since  the implementation of the Medicare prospective payment system (in 1998  for SNFs), providers are no longer reimbursed directly on the basis of  costs, and some have raised concerns that the quality and level of effort  providers put into accurately completing Medicare cost reports may have  eroded. In addition, the Medicare program limits the amount of capital- related costs that may be reported\u2014for example, by limiting the reporting  of certain financing costs associated with acquisition of a facility. If a  provider\u2019s financing costs exceed these limits, the provider\u2019s full financing  costs cannot be reported. As a result, a portion of the providers\u2019 reported  margins may be needed to offset these unreported financing costs. Also,  for about one-third of PI homes, our 2008 financial performance data are  from less than 1 year after acquisition. Thus, our postacquisition time  period may not fully capture any impact of PI ownership on the home\u2019s  financial performance.", "Despite these limitations, our analyses do provide a reasonable basis for  comparing deficiencies, nurse staffing, and financial performance of the  PI-owned homes we studied to each other and to other types of nursing  homes at two points in time. We reviewed all data for soundness and  consistency and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We performed data reliability checks on the list of PI homes we  compiled, OSCAR, Medicare\u2019s Provider of Services, and Medicare SNF  cost report data we used, reviewed relevant documentation, and  discussed these data sources with knowledgeable officials and industry  experts. We also reviewed published research on the quality and costs of  nursing home care, our prior work on nursing homes, and other relevant  documentation.
