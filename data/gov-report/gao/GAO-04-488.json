The general and flag officer study validated requirements for general and flag officer positions that exceeded congressional authorizations for both the active and reserve components. However, the validated requirements data generated by the study were not disclosed in the March 2003 report to Congress. In its report, DOD did not address the magnitude of the gap between validated requirements of 1,630 positions and congressional authorizations of 1,311--a difference of 319. DOD's report also did not address the impact of \"workarounds\" used to fill the gap between requirements and authorizations, such as the practice of assigning colonels and Navy captains to general and flag officer positions. Fully disclosing the study results and discussing the implications of these findings in the March 2003 report to Congress would have provided a more complete picture of DOD's general and flag officer requirements and may have helped to explain its recommendation not to seek additional authorizations. DOD used an established methodology to conduct a position-by-position validation of general and flag officer requirements. This methodology, known as job evaluation, has been widely used in the United States. Job evaluation, however, has numerous subjective features, including the selection of factors used for measurement. In addition, it is not designed to project emerging needs, such as those that could result from transformation efforts. Periodic updates could capture changes in requirements. Such limitations do not invalidate DOD's methodology; however, an explicit acknowledgment and assessment of these limitations would have provided more context for the study results. In addition, the study did not clearly account for dual-hatted positions (where one individual holds more than one position simultaneously) or assess how each service's authorizations were affected by the need to contribute general and flag officers to fill external (joint) positions. Addressing these issues could have enhanced the precision and usefulness of DOD's study. In addition, we noted that while Congress directed DOD to ensure the Reserve Forces Policy Board participated in development of the report's recommendations, the Board played a minimal role in producing DOD's 2003 report. The Board registered strong objections to DOD's recommendation not to seek additional authorizations now to meet validated requirements and to the limited role it played in the process. DOD, in conducting its 2003 general and flag officer study, incorporated some of the lessons learned from a GAO review of DOD's 1997 general and flag officer study. DOD recognized the need to identify general and flag officer positions that could conceivably be converted from the military ranks to the civilian workforce, although it deferred this assessment until after the general and flag officer study was complete.

First, the study did not distinguish  whether positions were dual-hatted for organizational efficiencies or  due to limited manpower. Separate studies of general officers conducted  for the Army and Marine Corps under the 1997 mandate stated that  dual-hatted positions may be created to increase efficiency of operations  or administration.

As a result, the Army had total active component  requirements\u2014including internal and external\u2014of 352 general officers,  compared with active component authorizations for 307 generals, a  difference of 45 generals. Using these calculations for the other services,  active component requirements exceeded active component  authorizations by 20 for the Air Force, 47 for the Navy, and 18 for the  Marine Corps.

The separate service reviews together created at least 24 different  definitions of a general or flag officer. At the time, the Office of the  Secretary of Defense stated that it permitted the services to use their own  methodologies for three reasons: (1) The methodology selected had to  recognize the unique mission and structure of each service.

Our review of this documentation  showed that an explanation was provided for 34 of the 38 adjustments and  was lacking for the other 4 adjustments.
