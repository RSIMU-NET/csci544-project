The United Nations and other international mediators were generally unsuccessful in their attempts to stop the war until the U.S. government took the lead in negotiations during mid-1995.

Also, the U.S. government initiated a separate program to train and equip a unified Federation military.

This was in large part due to Radovan Karadzic\u2019s blocking of attempts of more moderate Bosnian Serb political leaders to work with the international community in efforts that would link Bosnia\u2019s ethnic groups politically or economically. Karadzic is a war crimes indictee and unifying force of the then-ruling political party in Republika Srpska, the SDS. Because of Karadzic\u2019s intransigence, the international community gave very little economic assistance to Republika Srpska in 1996 and 1997.", "On June 27, 1997, the President of Republika Srpska, President Plavsic, announced that she had fired the Republika Srpska Minister of Interior. According to an OHR report, Plavsic fired the Minister because he had attempted to remove police officers and units involved in compiling a special report on illegal trade and other economic activities in Republika Srpska. This action was the first visible sign of a political division between President Plavsic, whose political base is in Banja Luka, and Karadzic and his hard-line SDS supporters, whose political base is in Pale.", "By the end of October 1997, the political struggle in Republika Srpska had resulted in (1) Plavsic being expelled from the SDS and gaining control of civilian police in three of nine public security centers in Republika Srpska (see fig. 1.3); (2) Karadzic and the SDS losing control of the transmitters of Serb Radio and Television (SRT) television, the primary Bosnian Serb media outlet; and (3) Plavsic disbanding the Republika Srpska National Assembly and calling elections for a new assembly, which were held on November 22 and 23, 1997, and resulted in the formation of a new, more moderate Republika Srpska government based in Banja Luka. Appendix II provides information on key events in the Republika Srpska political crisis through January 31, 1998.", "Many observers told us that President Plavsic is an ardent Serb nationalist who maintains a long-term goal of a separate Serb state. However, she has allowed more open political expression in Republika Srpska and, unlike Karadzic and the SDS, is willing to work with the international community to implement at least some civilian measures called for in the Dayton Agreement, including those that would link the ethnic groups politically and economically. President Plavsic would do so, according to these observers, because (1) she sees the growing economic gap between the Federation and Republika Srpska and realizes that to obtain economic aid she must cooperate with the international community and (2) she intends to build a Serbian state based on democracy and the rule of law rather than on the corruption of the hard-line SDS. According to one observer, Plavsic has not repudiated all of her former beliefs; however, her actions indicate that her views appeared to have evolved in a more pro-Dayton direction.", "By the end of 1997, the political division of Republika Srpska had affected the operating environment of all aspects of the peace operation. The evolving political situation that followed the initial split provided the international community with many opportunities to encourage and/or force further implementation of the Dayton Agreement.

The three police restructuring efforts in 1997 had different standards for ethnically integrating police forces and made different amounts of progress toward their goals: The integration of Bosniak and Bosnian Croat police in the Federation had made important progress by the end of 1997; the creation of a multiethnic police force in Brcko started very late in the year; and the integration process had not yet started in other areas of Republika Srspka (see table 2.2).", "The joint patrolling by Bosniak and Bosnian Croat police forces was viewed as a positive development by human rights and other observers.
