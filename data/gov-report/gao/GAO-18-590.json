PLCY supports cohesiveness by, among other things, coordinating departmentwide policy and strategy. In the past, however, questions have been raised about PLCY's efficacy. In December 2016, the NDAA codified PLCY's organizational structure, roles, and responsibilities.", "GAO was asked to evaluate PLCY's effectiveness. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS established an organizational structure and processes and procedures that position PLCY to be effective, (2) DHS and PLCY have ensured alignment of workforce with priorities, and (3) PLCY has engaged relevant component staff to help identify and respond to emerging needs. GAO analyzed the NDAA, documents describing specific responsibilities, and departmentwide policies and strategies.

For example, PLCY's coordination efforts for a strategy and policy executive steering committee have been successful, particularly for strategies. However, PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to develop, update, or harmonize policies that affect multiple DHS components. In large part, these challenges are because DHS does not have clearly-defined roles and responsibilities with accompanying processes and procedures to help PLCY lead and coordinate policy in a predictable, repeatable, and accountable manner. Until PLCY's roles and responsibilities for policy are more clearly defined and corresponding processes and procedures are in place, situations where the lack of clarity hampers PLCY's effectiveness in driving policy are likely to continue. Development of a delegation of authority, which involves reaching agreement about PLCY's roles and responsibilities and clearly documenting them, had been underway. However, it stalled due to changes in department leadership. As of May 2018, the effort had been revived, but it is not clear whether and when DHS will finalize it.", "PLCY does some workforce planning as part of its annual budgeting process, but does not systematically apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help ensure that PLCY's workforce aligns with its and DHS's priorities and goals. According to PLCY officials, the nature of its mission requires a flexible staffing approach. As such, a portion of the staff functions as generalists who can be assigned to meet the needs of different situations, including unexpected changing priorities due to an emerging need. However, shifting short-term priorities requires tradeoffs, which may divert attention and resources from longer-term priorities. As of June 5, 2018, PLCY also had a number of vacancies in key leadership positions, which further limited attention to certain priorities. According to PLCY officials, PLCY recently began a review to identify the office's authorities in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA) and other statutes, compare these authorities to the current organization and operations, and address any workforce capacity gaps. Employing workforce planning principles\u2014in particular, systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and strategies to address them\u2014consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as possible under uncertain conditions and to communicate effectively with DHS leadership about tradeoffs.", "Officials from PLCY and DHS operational components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy, but component officials identified opportunities to better connect PLCY and component staff to improve communication flow about emerging policy and strategy needs.

That  year, we designated implementing and transforming DHS as high risk  because DHS had to transform 22 agencies\u2014several with major  management challenges\u2014into one department. Further, failure to  effectively address DHS\u2019s management and mission risks could have  serious consequences for U.S. national and economic security. Given the  significant effort required to build and integrate a department as large and  complex as DHS, our initial high-risk designation addressed the  department\u2019s implementation and transformation efforts to include  associated management and programmatic challenges. We reported that  the creation of DHS was an enormous undertaking and successfully  transforming large organizations, even those undertaking less strenuous  reorganizations, could take years to implement. Over the past 15 years,  the focus of this high-risk area has evolved in tandem with DHS\u2019s  maturation and evolution. The overriding tenet has consistently remained  DHS\u2019s ability to build a single, cohesive, and effective department that is  greater than the sum of its parts\u2014a goal that requires effective  collaboration and integration of its various components and management  functions.", "DHS\u2019s Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans (PLCY) is responsible for  some of these management functions, including developing and  coordinating departmentwide policies and strategies, conducting analyses for senior leadership, and supporting the Secretary\u2019s initiatives.

The National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA), enacted in  December 2016, established PLCY in statute. Although largely  consistent with the roles and responsibilities of DHS\u2019s Office of Policy, as  PLCY was named before enactment of the NDAA, implementation of the  act required organizational changes designed to respond to certain  challenges the office had identified as barriers to its ability to perform  effectively.", "For a number of years, questions have been raised about the office\u2019s  efficacy and engagement with key stakeholders, like the DHS operational  components. For example, we have reported on challenges related to  obtaining stakeholder feedback under the office\u2019s leadership of the 2010  and 2014 Quadrennial Homeland Security Reviews (QHSR). We have  also reported on opportunities for select components of the office\u2014the  Screening Coordination Office and the Office of International Affairs\u2014to  implement better management controls to help enhance monitoring and  accountability for their respective missions. DHS agreed with all of our  recommendations in those prior reports.", "In light of past concerns about efficacy and the recent statutory changes,  you asked us to review how PLCY is contributing to efforts to build a  single, cohesive department by driving departmentwide and crosscutting  strategy and policy. This report addresses the extent to which (1) DHS  has established an organizational structure and processes and  procedures that position PLCY to achieve its organizational objectives, (2)  DHS and PLCY have ensured that PLCY\u2019s workforce is aligned with  PLCY\u2019s and DHS\u2019s priorities and goals, and (3) PLCY has effectively  engaged across the operational components to identify and respond to  emerging policy and strategy needs.", "To address all three objectives, we analyzed key documents and  interviewed officials from PLCY and other DHS offices, including officials  responsible for policy, strategy, and plan development and  implementation at all eight of DHS\u2019s operational components. Specifically,  to better understand the roles and responsibilities of PLCY, DHS\u2019s eight  operational components, and other offices at DHS, we reviewed the  NDAA and analyzed documents, such as departmental directives that  describe what is required and expected of each office. In addition, we  interviewed officials from PLCY to understand its roles and  responsibilities, workforce planning practices, and collaboration with DHS  operational components.", "Furthermore, we interviewed officials from DHS\u2019s Office of the Under  Secretary for Management to understand the differences between  PLCY\u2019s roles and responsibilities and those of the Office of the Under  Secretary for Management, who oversees all internal management  operations and oversight of management functions for components at  DHS headquarters. To further understand PLCY\u2019s engagement with DHS  operational components as well as their perspectives on PLCY\u2019s roles  and responsibilities, we conducted both unstructured and structured  interviews with each of DHS\u2019s eight operational components. For the  structured interviews, we developed a questionnaire that we tested  internally before administering it to DHS officials. At the structured  interviews, we asked officials at each operational component the same  questions in the same order to ensure we collected information  consistently and reliably across the different respondents. We compared  our findings to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  leading collaboration practices identified in our prior work, and the DHS  Workforce Planning Guide to determine the extent to which PLCY is able  to achieve its goals given its organizational structure, workforce planning,  and communication and collaboration with operational components.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2017 to September 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Since the  passage of the act, the undersecretary position has been vacant, and as  of June 5, 2018, the President had not nominated an individual to fill the position. According to PLCY officials, elevating the head of the office to  an undersecretary was important because it equalizes PLCY with other  DHS management offices and DHS headquarters components. The  NDAA further authorizes, but does not require, the Secretary to establish  a position of deputy undersecretary within PLCY. If the position is  established, the NDAA provides that the Secretary may appoint a career  employee to the position (i.e., not a political appointee). In March 2018,  the Secretary named a Deputy Under Secretary, who has been  performing the duties of the Deputy Under Secretary and the Under  Secretary since then.

For example, PLCY officials said that DHS  observed an increase in e-commerce and small businesses shipping  items via carriers other than the U.S. Postal Service, thus exploiting a  gap in DHS monitoring, which covers the U.S. Postal Service and  other traditional shipping entities. PLCY officials noted that DHS\u2019s  interest in addressing e-commerce issues occurred just before opioids  and other controlled substances were being mailed through small  businesses and the U.S. Postal Service. As a result, PLCY developed  an e-commerce strategy for, among other things, the shipping of  illegal items and how to provide information to U.S. Customs and  Border Protection before parcels are shipped to the United States  from abroad.", "In accordance with the NDAA, as PLCY leads, conducts, and coordinates  policy and strategy, it is to do so in a manner that promotes and ensures  quality, consistency, and integration across DHS and applies risk-based  analysis and planning to departmentwide strategic planning efforts.

In addition to  the roles PLCY plays that are directly related to leading, conducting, and  coordinating policy and strategy, the office is responsible for select  operational functions. For example, PLCY is charged with operating the  REAL ID and Visa Waiver Programs.", "The NDAA also conferred responsibilities to PLCY that had not been  responsibilities of the DHS Office of Policy prior to the NDAA\u2019s  enactment. Among other things, the NDAA charged PLCY with  responsibility for establishing standards of reliability and validity for  statistical data collected and analyzed by the department, and ensuring  the accuracy of metrics and statistical data provided to Congress.

In  this role, PLCY routinely serves as the executive agent for the Deputies  Management Action Group and the Senior Leaders Council, which  involve analytical and coordination support. PLCY also provides support  for deputy- and principal-level decision making. For example, the Strategy  and Policy Executive Steering Committee (S&P ESC) meetings have  been used to discuss components\u2019 implementation plans for crosscutting  strategies, PLCY\u2019s requests for information from components for an  upcoming strategy, and updates on departmentwide strategic planning  initiatives. According to PLCY and operational component officials, PLCY  also provides leadership for the Resource Planning Guidance and Winter  Studies, both of which help inform departmentwide resource decision- making. For example, officials from one operational component stated  that PLCY\u2019s leadership of the Resource Planning Guidance is a helpful  practice for coordination and collaboration on departmentwide or  crosscutting strategies. The officials stated that PLCY reaches out to  ensure that the component is covering the Secretary\u2019s priorities and this  helps the component to ensure that its budget includes them.  Furthermore, PLCY develops and coordinates policy options and opinions  for the Secretary to present at the National Security Council and other  White House-level meetings. For example, PLCY officials told us that, in  light of allegations of Russian involvement in using poisonous nerve  agents on two civilians in Great Britain, PLCY coordinated the collection  of information to develop a policy recommendation for the Secretary to  present at a National Security Council meeting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ambiguity in Roles and Responsibilities and a Lack of Predictable, Repeatable, and Accountable Procedures Have Limited PLCY\u2019s Ability to Lead and Coordinate Policy", "paragraphs": ["PLCY has encountered challenges leading and coordinating efforts to  develop, update, or harmonize policy\u2014also a key organizational  objective\u2014because it does not have clearly-defined roles, responsibilities,  and mechanisms to implement these responsibilities in a predictable,  repeatable, and accountable way. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government states that management should establish an  organizational structure, assign responsibility, and delegate authority to  achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. As such, an organization\u2019s management  should develop an organizational structure with an understanding of the  overall responsibilities and assign these responsibilities to discrete units  to enable the organization to operate in an efficient and effective  manner. An organization\u2019s management should also implement control  activities through policies. It is important that an organization\u2019s  management document and define policies and communicate those  policies and procedures to personnel, so they can implement control  activities for their assigned responsibilities. In addition, leading  collaboration practices we have identified in our prior work include  defining and articulating a common outcome, clarifying roles and  responsibilities, and establishing mutually-reinforcing or joint strategies to  enhance and sustain collaboration, such as the work that PLCY and the  components need to do together to ensure that departmentwide and  crosscutting policy is effective for all relevant parties.", "According to PLCY officials, in general, PLCY is responsible for leading  the development of a policy when it crosses multiple components or if  there is a national implication, including White House interest in the  policy. However, PLCY officials acknowledged that this practice does not  always make them the lead and there are no established criteria that  define the circumstances under which PLCY (or another organizational  unit) should lead development of policies that cut across organizational  boundaries. PLCY officials said the lead entity for a policy is often  announced in an email from the Secretary\u2019s office, on a case-by-case  basis. According to PLCY officials, once components have been assigned responsibility for a policy, they have generally tended to retain it, and  PLCY may not have oversight for crosscutting policies that are  maintained by operational components. Therefore, there is no  established, coordinated system of oversight to periodically monitor the  need for policy harmonization, revision, or rescission.", "In the absence of clear roles and responsibilities, and processes and  procedures to support them, PLCY and officials in 5 of the 8 components  have encountered challenges in coordinating with each other. Although  PLCY and most component officials we interviewed described overall  positive experiences in coordinating with each other, we identified  multiple instances of (1) confusion about which parties should lead and  engage in policy efforts, (2) not engaging components at the right times,  (3) incompatible expectations around timelines, and (4) uncertainty about  PLCY\u2019s role and the extent to which it can and should identify and drive  policy in support of a more cohesive DHS.", "Confusion about who should lead and engage. Officials from one  operational component told us that they were tasked with leading a  departmentwide policy development effort they believed was outside their  area of responsibility and expertise. Officials in another operational  component stated that components sometimes end up coordinating  among themselves, but that policy development could be more effective  and efficient if PLCY took the role of convener and facilitator to ensure the  departmentwide perspective is present and all relevant stakeholders  participate. Officials from a third component stated that they spent  significant time and resources to develop a policy directly related to their  component\u2019s mission. As the component got ready to implement the  policy, PLCY became aware of it and asked the component to stop  working on the policy, so PLCY could develop a departmentwide policy.  According to component officials, while they were supportive of a  departmentwide policy, PLCY\u2019s timing delayed implementation of the  policy the component had developed and wasted the resources it had  invested. Moreover, officials from four operational components told us  that sometimes counselors from outside PLCY, such as the Secretary\u2019s  office, have led policy efforts that seem like they should be PLCY\u2019s  responsibility, which created more confusion about what PLCY\u2019s ongoing  role should be. PLCY officials agreed that, at times, it has been challenging to define PLCY\u2019s role relative to counselors for the Secretary,  and acknowledged that clear guidance to define who is leading which  types of policy development and coordination would be helpful.", "Not engaging components at the right times. Officials from 5 of 8  operational components told us that they had not always been engaged  at the right times by PLCY in departmentwide or crosscutting policies that  affected their missions. For example, officials from an operational  component described a crosscutting policy that had significant  implications for some of its key operational resources, but the component  was not made aware of the policy until it was about to be presented at the  White House. Officials from another component stated that they learned  of a new policy after it was in place and had to find significant training and  software resources to implement it even though they viewed the policy as  unnecessary for their mission. PLCY officials stated that, while they  intend to identify all components that should be involved in a policy, there  are times when PLCY is unaware a component is developing a policy that  affects other components. PLCY officials said they will involve other  components when PLCY becomes aware that a component is developing  such a policy. PLCY officials stated that it would be helpful to have a  process and procedures for cross-component coordination on policies to  help guide engagement regardless of who is developing the policy.", "Incompatible expectations around timelines. Officials at 4 of 8  operational components stated that short timelines from PLCY to provide  input and feedback can prevent PLCY from obtaining thoughtful and  complete information from components. For example, officials from one  component stated that PLCY asked them to perform an analysis that  would inform major, departmental decision-making and quickly provide  the analysis. Component officials told us that they did not understand why  PLCY needed the analysis on such an accelerated timeline, which  seemed inappropriate given the level of importance and purpose of the  analysis. Officials from another component told us that PLCY had not  always provided enough time to provide thoughtful feedback; therefore,  component officials were not sure if PLCY really wanted their feedback.  Officials from a third component stated that sometimes PLCY did not  provide sufficient time for thoughtful input or feedback that had cleared  the component\u2019s legal review, so component officials elected to miss  PLCY\u2019s deadline and provide late feedback. PLCY officials told us that,  frequently, timelines are not within their control, a situation that some  component officials also noted during our interviews with them. However,  PLCY officials agreed that a documented, predictable, and repeatable  process and procedures for policies may help ensure PLCY provides  sufficient comment time when in its control and may provide a basis to  help negotiate timelines with DHS leadership in other situations. PLCY  officials stated that, even with a documented process and procedures,  there would still be circumstances when short timelines are unavoidable.", "Uncertainty about PLCY\u2019s role in driving policy harmonization. Policy  officials at 6 of 8 operational components told us that they were unsure or  not aware of PLCY\u2019s role in harmonizing policy across the department,  and stated a desire for PLCY to be more involved in harmonizing or  enhancing departmentwide and crosscutting policy or for greater clarity  about PLCY\u2019s responsibility to play this role. As previously discussed,  PLCY\u2019s policy and strategy efforts fall into four categories\u2014statutory  responsibilities, interagency efforts, Secretary\u2019s priorities, and self- initiated activities; these activities include efforts to better harmonize  policies and strategies. According to PLCY officials, the category with the  lowest priority is self-initiated activities. PLCY officials stated that PLCY  makes tradeoffs and rarely chooses to work on self-initiated projects over  its other three categories of effort. According to the officials, PLCY\u2019s work  on the other three higher-priority categories is sufficient to ensure that the  office is effectively leading, conducting, and coordinating strategy and  policy across the department. Given its organizational position and  strategic priorities, PLCY is uniquely situated to identify opportunities to  better harmonize or enhance departmentwide and crosscutting policy, a  role that is in line with its strategic priority to build departmental  policymaking capacity and foster Unity of Effort.

This process  provides a framework to: align workforce planning to the department\u2019s mission and goals, predict, then assess how evolving missions, new processes, or  environmental conditions may impact the way that work will be  performed at DHS in the future,  identify gaps in capacity, develop and implement strategies and action plans to address  capacity and capability gaps, and  continuously monitor the effectiveness of action plans and modify, as  necessary.", "The DHS Workforce Planning Guide stipulates that an organization\u2019s  management should not only lead and show support during the workforce  planning process, but ensure alignment with the strategic direction of the  agency. Moreover, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government states that management should use quality information to  achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. For example, management uses an  entity\u2019s operational processes to make informed decisions and evaluate  the entity\u2019s performance in achieving key agency objectives.", "According to PLCY officials, the current staffing paradigm involves shifting  the office\u2019s staff when new and urgent issues arise from the Secretary or  White House, and adding these unexpected tasks to staff\u2019s existing  responsibilities. However, this means that tradeoffs are made, resulting in  some priority items taking longer to address or not getting attention at all.  PLCY officials stated that they have been caught off-guard at times by  changes in demands placed on PLCY and had to scramble to address the  new needs.", "Additionally, PLCY officials said they have a number of vacancies, which  hamper the office\u2019s ability to meet certain aspects of its mission. For  example, PLCY\u2019s Office of Cyber, Infrastructure, and Resilience was  created in 2015. According to PLCY officials, PLCY has had some  resources to address cyber issues, however, there has not been funding  to staff this office and an assistant secretary has not been appointed to  lead it. Therefore, PLCY officials stated that PLCY has not been able to  address its responsibilities for infrastructure resilience.", "Similarly, PLCY has limited capacity for risk analysis. A provision of the  NDAA provides that PLCY is to:  develop and coordinate strategic plans and long-term goals of the  department with risk-based analysis and planning to improve operational  mission effectiveness, including consultation with the Secretary regarding  the quadrennial homeland security review under section 707 [6 U.S.C. \u00a7  347].", "However, PLCY officials acknowledged that their focus on identifying  needs for risk analyses and conducting them has been limited, in part,  because DHS disbanded the risk management office.", "Officials from one component told us that they contribute to a report that  PLCY coordinates, called Homeland Security National Risk  Characteristics, which is prepared as a precursor to the DHS Strategic  Plan. PLCY officials stated that, outside of these foundational documents  and some risk-based analyses completed as part of specific policy  development efforts, PLCY does not have the capacity to complete any  additional risk analysis activities.", "Although PLCY officials said they conduct some analysis of potential  demands as a starting point for how to allocate PLCY\u2019s annual staffing  budget, these efforts are largely informal and internal and have not  resulted in a systematic analysis that provides PLCY and DHS  management with the information they need to understand the effects of  resource tradeoffs. Also, PLCY officials said they track accomplishments  toward PLCY\u2019s strategic priorities as part of a weekly meeting and report,  however, officials acknowledged they do not analyze what role workforce  decisions have played in achieving or not achieving strategic priorities.  Moreover, although PLCY officials stated that they have intermittent, in- person, informal communication about resource use, they have not used  the principles outlined in the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to  systematically identify and communicate workforce demands, capacity  gaps, and strategies to address workforce issues. According to PLCY  officials, they have not conducted such analysis, in part, because the  Secretary\u2019s office has not requested it of them or the other DHS offices  that are funded in the same part of the DHS budget. Regardless of  whether the Secretary expects workforce analysis as part of the  budgeting process, the DHS Workforce Planning Guide could be used  within and outside of the budgeting process to help inform resource  decision making throughout the year.", "PLCY officials stated that at the PLCY Deputy Under Secretary\u2019s  initiative, they recently began a review of all relevant statutory authorities,  which they will map against the current organizational structure and day- to-day operations. The Deputy Under Secretary plans to use the results of  the review to enhance PLCY\u2019s efficiency and effectiveness, and the  results could serve as a foundation for a more holistic and systematic  analysis of workforce demand, any capacity gaps, and strategies to  address them. Employing workforce planning principles\u2014in particular,  systematic identification of workforce demand, capacity gaps, and  strategies to address them\u2014consistent with the DHS Workforce Planning  Guide could better position PLCY to use its workforce as effectively as  possible under uncertain conditions. Moreover, using the DHS guide  would help PLCY to systematically communicate information about any  workforce gaps to DHS leadership, so there is transparency about how  workforce tradeoffs affect PLCY\u2019s ability to support DHS goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional External Communication Practices Could Enhance PLCY\u2019s Collaboration with DHS Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier, officials from PLCY and DHS operational  components praised existing mechanisms to coordinate and  communicate at the senior level, especially about strategy. However,  component officials identified opportunities for PLCY to better connect at  the staff level to identify and respond to emerging policy and strategy  needs. Leading practices for collaboration that we have identified in our  prior work state that it is important to ensure that all relevant participants  have been included in a collaborative effort, and positive working  relationships among participants from different agencies or offices can  bridge organizational cultures. These relationships build trust and foster  communication, which facilitate collaboration.", "Also, as previously stated, PLCY has mechanisms like the S&P ESC to  communicate and coordinate with operational components and other  DHS stakeholders at the senior level (e.g., Senior Executive Service  officials). However, PLCY does not have a mechanism to effectively  engage in routine communication and collaboration at the staff level (e.g.,  program and policy specialists working at operational components to  oversee or implement policy and strategy functions). Specifically, officials  with responsibility for policy and strategy at 6 of 8 operational  components told us that they did not have regular contact with or know  who to contact at PLCY for questions about policies or strategies, or that  the reason they knew who to contact was because of existing working  relationships, not because of efforts PLCY had undertaken to facilitate  such contacts. In addition, some component officials noted that, when  they tried to use the PLCY website to coordinate, they found it to be out of  date and lacking sufficient information. PLCY officials acknowledged that  the website needs improvement. They stated that the office has  developed improved content for the website, but does not have the  necessary staff to update the website. According to the officials, the  needed staff should be hired soon and improved content should be on the  website by the end of summer 2018.", "Although officials at 5 of the 8 operational components we interviewed  stated that the quality of PLCY\u2019s coordination and collaboration has  improved in the past 2 years or so, component officials offered several  suggestions to enhance PLCY\u2019s coordination and collaboration,  especially at the staff level. Among these were:  conduct routine information sharing meetings with staff-level officials  who have policy and strategy responsibilities at each operational  component,  clearly articulate points of contact, their contact information, and their  portfolios at PLCY as well as at other policy and strategy  stakeholders, ensure the PLCY website is up-to-date with contact information for  PLCY and components that work in strategy and policy areas, and  with relevant information about crosscutting strategy and policy  initiatives underway, host a forum\u2014such as an annual conference\u2014to bring together policy  and strategy officials from PLCY and DHS components to share ideas  and make contacts, and prepare a standard briefing for component officials with strategy and  policy responsibilities to help ensure that staff at all levels understand  what PLCY does, how it works, and opportunities for engagement on  emerging policy and strategy needs or identified harmonization  opportunities.", "For example, officials from one component told us that they would like  PLCY officials to have in-person meetings with component staff to  discuss what PLCY does, who to contact in PLCY, where to find  information about policies and strategies, and other relevant information  to ensure a smooth working relationship between the component and  PLCY.", "According to PLCY officials, the office recognizes the value of creating  mechanisms to connect staff, who work on policy and strategy at all levels  in DHS. PLCY officials said they have historically done a better job in  coordinating at the senior level, but are interested in expanding  opportunities to connect other staff with policy and strategy  responsibilities. PLCY officials stated that they are considering creating a  working group structure that mirrors existing organizational mechanisms  to coordinate at the senior level, but have not taken steps to do so.", "Routine collaboration among PLCY, operational components, and other  DHS offices at the staff level is important to ensure that PLCY is able to  carry out its functions under the NDAA, including the effective  coordination of policies and strategies. A positive working relationship  among these stakeholders can build trust, foster communication, and  facilitate collaboration.

Without a delegation of authority or similar  documentation from DHS leadership clearly articulating PLCY\u2019s missions,  roles, and responsibilities\u2014along with defined processes and procedures  to carry them out in a predictable and repeatable manner\u2014there is  continuing risk that confusion and uncertainty about PLCY\u2019s authority,  missions, roles, and responsibilities will limit its effectiveness.", "PLCY employs some workforce planning, but does not systematically  apply key principles of the DHS Workforce Planning Guide to help predict  workforce demand, and identify any workforce gaps and design strategies  to address them. Without this analysis, PLCY faces limitations in ensuring  that its workforce is aligned with its and DHS\u2019s priorities and goals.  Moreover, the results of this analysis would better position PLCY to  communicate to DHS leadership any potential tradeoffs in workforce  allocation that would affect PLCY\u2019s ability to meet priorities and goals.", "PLCY could enhance its use of mechanisms for collaboration and  communication with DHS stakeholders at the staff level.

The letter  described a number of actions, including actions that are also described  in the report, which PLCY takes to help ensure alignment of its staff with  organizational needs. In the letter, PLCY officials pointed to the workforce  activities PLCY undertakes as part of the annual budgeting cycle. We  acknowledge that the actions described to predict upcoming priorities and  resource needs as part of the annual budgeting cycle are in line with the  DHS workforce planning principles. However, as we noted, there are  opportunities to apply the workforce planning principles outside the  annual budgeting cycle to provide greater visibility and awareness of  resource tradeoffs to management inside PLCY and in the Secretary\u2019s  office.", "In the letter, PLCY officials made note of the dynamic and changing  nature of its operational environment, stating that it often required them to  shift resources and priorities on a more frequent or ad hoc basis than  many organizations. We acknowledged in the report that PLCY\u2019s  operating environment requires it to maintain flexibility in its staffing  approach. However, PLCY has a number of important duties, including  helping foster Unity of Effort throughout the department and helping to  ensure the availability of risk information for departmental decision  making, that require longer-term, sustained attention and strategic  management. During interviews, PLCY officials acknowledged that  striking a balance between these needs has been difficult and at times  they have faced significant struggles. The report describes some areas  where, during the time we were conducting our work, it was clear that  some tasks and functions, such as risk analyses, lacked the resources or  focus necessary to ensure they received sustained institutional attention.  It is because of PLCY\u2019s dynamic operating environment, coupled with the  need for sustained institutional attention to other key responsibilities, that  we recommended PLCY undertake workforce planning activities that  would help generate better information for PLCY and DHS management  to have full visibility and awareness of gaps and resource tradeoffs.", "Finally, the letter stated that because PLCY is a very small and flat  organization, it is able to identify capacity gaps and develop action plans  without obtaining all of the data collected through each recommended  element, worksheet, form, and template of the model proposed in the  DHS Workforce Planning Guide. We acknowledge that it would be  counterproductive for PLCY to engage in data collection and analysis that  are significantly more elaborate than its planning needs.
