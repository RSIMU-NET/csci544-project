GAO surveyed local election officials in 14 jurisdictions in 7 states (AZ, CA, MI, NY, TX, VA, and WI) to obtain their views on managing voter registration for the 2004 election. GAO selected the 7 states considering characteristics relevant to voter registration, such as whether a statewide voter registration list existed prior to the enactment of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002. Locations were selected within each state to represent one small and one large election jurisdiction. This report discusses election officials' characterization of (1) challenges receiving voter registration applications, including checking them for completeness; (2) removing voters' names from voter registration lists and ensuring that names were not inadvertently removed; and (3) implementing HAVA's provisional voting and identification requirements. HAVA, in part, requires that states offer provisional ballots to voters not listed as registered who declare eligibility and first-time voters who registered by mail after January 1, 2003, and could not provide identification. GAO offered election officials the opportunity to verify the accuracy of their responses used to prepare this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Local election officials representing all but 1 of the 14 jurisdictions GAO surveyed after the November 2004 election reported facing some challenges processing voter registration applications and took steps to address them. Processing applications received from voter registration drives sponsored by non-governmental organizations posed a challenge to election officials in 12 of the 14 jurisdictions, while half of the officials reported challenges receiving applications from other external sources, such as motor vehicle agencies. Challenges occurred in processing these applications for reasons such as incomplete or inaccurate information on voter registration applications. Half of the officials reported that their offices faced challenges checking applications for completeness, accuracy, or duplicates, citing, among other things, insufficient staffing to check the applications. Steps taken by election officials to address these and other challenges included hiring additional staff to handle the volume of applications received and contacting applicants to get correct information. All but 1 of the 14 election officials reported that, using various sources of information, they removed names from voter registration lists during 2004 if, for example, voters had moved, were deceased, or were ineligible due to a felony conviction. To help ensure names of eligible voters were not inadvertently removed from voter registration lists, officials reported contacting voters to confirm removal, matched voters' identifying information (such as name and address) with address changes provided by the U.S. Postal Service, and matched voter registration records with felony or death records. GAO reported in June 2005 about problems officials in these same jurisdictions experienced verifying voter information with death or felony information from existing data sources. GAO's survey showed that all 14 election jurisdictions permitted citizens to cast provisional ballots during the November 2004 election. HAVA gives states discretion to implement provisional voting based on state voter eligibility requirements. According to the election officials surveyed, about 423,000 provisional ballots were cast in 13 of the 14 jurisdictions, and 70 percent of those votes were counted. Also, 8 of the 14 jurisdictions reported challenges implementing provisional voting, in part, because some poll workers were not familiar with provisional voting or staff did not have sufficient time to process provisional ballots. To address these challenges, election officials in these jurisdictions said they hired extra staff or provided training to poll workers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["After the November 2000 election, reports in the media and elsewhere  have questioned the mechanics and effectiveness of voter registration and  voter registration list maintenance by highlighting accounts of individuals  who thought they were registered being turned away from polling places  on Election Day. In managing the voter registration process and  maintaining voter registration lists, state and local election officials must  balance two goals\u2014(1) minimizing the burden on eligible people of  registering to vote and (2) ensuring that voter lists are accurate (limited to  those eligible to vote), which includes ensuring that appropriately  registered voters are not inadvertently removed from the voter registration  lists. All the while, state and local election officials must try to ensure that  eligible citizens have the opportunity to cast their votes and have them  counted accurately in federal, state, and local elections.", "Over the last several years, federal legislation has been enacted to expand  the opportunities for citizens to become registered to vote, improve the  accuracy of voter registration lists, and ensure that eligible voters have the  opportunity to cast their ballots. In 1993, the National Voter Registration  Act (NVRA), commonly called the Motor Voter Act, was enacted. Among  other things, NVRA expanded the opportunity of citizens to register to  vote in federal elections at state motor vehicle agencies and other public  organizations, such as public assistance agencies and armed forces  recruiting centers.  NVRA also limited the circumstances under which  states could remove the names of eligible voters from registration lists for  federal elections and required states to take certain steps to accurately  maintain such voter registration lists by removing the names of certain  types of ineligible persons. In 2002, the Help America Vote Act (HAVA)  was enacted and, among other things, it requires states to implement  provisional voting for elections for federal office.  HAVA, in general,  requires that individuals not listed as registered or whose eligibility is  questioned by an election official must be notified about and permitted to  cast a provisional ballot that is set aside for review by election officials at  a later time so that they can determine whether the person is eligible to  vote under state law. HAVA also requires that provisional ballots be  provided to first-time voters who had registered to vote by mail on or after  January 1, 2003, but were unable to show photo identification or another  qualifying identification document when voting in person or by mail in a  federal election. In addition, HAVA requires that election officials must  provide access to information that permits voters to learn if their  provisional ballot was counted, and, if not, why not.", "Our work, which began in January 2004, focuses on the efforts of local  election officials in 14 jurisdictions within 7 states to manage the  registration process, maintain accurate voter registration lists, and ensure  that eligible citizens in those jurisdictions had the opportunity to cast  ballots during the 2004 election. Specifically, for the 2004 election, we are  reporting on election officials\u2019 characterization of their experiences with  regard to (1) managing the voter registration process and any challenges  related to receiving voter registration applications; checking them for  completeness, accuracy, and duplication; and entering information into  voter registration lists; (2) removing voters\u2019 names from voter registration  lists and ensuring that the names of eligible voters were not inadvertently  removed; and (3) implementing HAVA provisional voting and identification  requirements and addressing any challenges encountered related to these  requirements. We are also providing information on motor vehicle agency  (MVA) officials\u2019 characterization of their experiences assisting citizens  who apply to register to vote at MVA offices and forwarding voter  registration applications to election offices. This information is contained  in appendix VIII.", "In addition to this report, we have also issued, or plan to issue this year,  reports on other specific election issues. In June 2005, we issued a report  on the efforts of state and local election officials in seven states\u2014the same  seven states and local jurisdictions covered in this report\u2014to ensure that  voter registration lists are accurate. Later this year we plan to issue  reports on (1) actions by nine states without HAVA waivers to create and  maintain computerized, statewide voter registration lists as of January 1,  2004; (2) significant security and reliability concerns that have been  identified for electronic voting systems; and (3) the Department of  Defense\u2019s implementation of the Federal Voting Assistance Program to  facilitate absentee voting by military personnel during the November 2004  election. These reports respond to congressional requests made prior to  the November 2004 election. In addition, given concerns about the  November 2004 election process, we are undertaking a broader, more  comprehensive study of election administration and processes related to  the November 2004 general election. This more comprehensive study,  which we plan to issue in 2006, will address activities and challenges\u2014 people, processes, and technology\u2014associated with each major stage of  election administration to include registration, absentee and early voting;  Election Day preparation and activities; and vote counting and  certification. In October 2001, we issued a similar report that focused on  how elections were conducted in the United States, and the people,  processes and technology that were generally associated with the  preparation for and administration of elections. Among other things, the  report discussed the activities and challenges associated with each stage  of election administration, including voter registration.", "To address our objectives for this report, we analyzed information  collected from elections and motor vehicle agency offices in seven  states\u2014Arizona, California, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia, and  Wisconsin. Our selection of the seven states is geographically diverse, and  took into consideration a range of voter registration-related factors and  unique characteristics of the states that might affect the implementation of  HAVA. Specifically, we selected states that took various approaches for  administering elections\u2014for example, Wisconsin has same-day  registration, which exempts the state from the HAVA provisional voting  requirement; Arizona has on-line registration; Michigan has a reputation as  a model for registration practices; and some local jurisdictions administer  elections at the county level and others at the city or township level.  Within each of the seven states, using population data from the 2000 U.S.  Census, we then selected two jurisdictions: a local jurisdiction with a large  population and a local jurisdiction with a small population. Other criteria  we applied to select these jurisdictions included the proximity of the  locations to our site visits with state election and motor vehicle officials,  suggestions by state election officials, and proximity to a local motor  vehicle office. The 14 jurisdictions we selected were Gila and Maricopa  Counties, Arizona; Los Angeles and Yolo Counties, California; City of  Detroit and Delta Township, Michigan; New York City and Rensselaer  County, New York; Bexar and Webb Counties, Texas; Albemarle and  Arlington Counties, Virginia; and the cities of Franklin and Madison,  Wisconsin. The selected states and jurisdictions are the same states and  jurisdictions we discussed in our June 2005 report.", "We gathered information from state and local officials using a multi- pronged approach. First, we reviewed relevant laws, state reports, and  documents related to the voter registration process in the seven states.  Second, we interviewed state and local election officials in the seven  states and 14 jurisdictions to obtain information on their registration  processes and implementation of the HAVA requirements for provisional  voting and voter identification. Third, we sent a survey to election officials  in the 14 jurisdictions to gather information about their experiences with  the November 2004 election. We developed our survey questions on the  basis of our review of laws, reports, and documents and our interviews  with state and local election officials in the seven states and 14  jurisdictions. Our survey primarily asked questions on (1) challenges, if  any, in processing voter registration applications\u2014specifically, challenges  receiving voter registration applications from MVAs, other NVRA agencies,  and voter registration drives sponsored by non-governmental  organizations; checking voter registration applications for completeness,  accuracy, and duplicates; and entering voter information into registration  lists or systems; (2) whether names of registrants were removed from  voter registration lists, reasons why names were removed, and steps taken  to ensure that names of eligible registrants were not inadvertently  removed; and (3) HAVA\u2019s provisional voting and first-time voter  identification requirements\u2014specifically, the number of provisional  ballots cast and counted, including reasons why jurisdictions did not count  provisional ballots if this did occur; how voters were informed about  provisional voting and its outcome; and whether first-time voters who  registered by mail were allowed to cast provisional ballots if they did not  provide required identification. Appendix II provides a copy of the survey  we sent to each jurisdiction.", "Finally, to provide information on MVA officials\u2019 characterization of their  experiences with voter registration applications received before the  November 2004 election, we sent a survey to state and local MVA officials  in six of the seven states and 12 of the 14 jurisdictions. The survey  primarily asked questions about the MVA offices\u2019 experiences with   (1) assisting citizens with completing voter registration applications,   (2) forwarding the applications to election offices, and (3) responding to  individuals and state or local election officials who contacted their offices  about individuals who declared they had applied to register to vote at MVA  offices but their names were not on voter registration lists when they went  to vote in the November 2004 election. Appendix IX provides a copy of the  survey we sent to the MVA officials.", "We did not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of  responses provided from our surveys of election officials and MVA  officials. However, local election officials and state and local MVA officials  we surveyed were provided the opportunity to verify the accuracy of their  responses for this report and, on the basis of the comments we received,  we made technical changes, where appropriate. The results of our work  cannot be generalized to state and local election jurisdictions and MVA  offices at the state level or nationwide.", "We conducted our work from January 2004 through September 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Also, various agencies, such as those involved in providing public  assistance, U.S. armed forces recruitment offices, and offices in a state  providing state-funded services to people with disabilities, must be  designated as voter registration agencies. Each state may also designate  other offices as voter registration agencies, such as public libraries,  schools, offices of city and county governments, and unemployment  compensation offices. In addition, NVRA requires states to accept and use  a mail-in registration application developed by the Federal Election  Commission.", "NVRA also outlined various requirements for the processing of registration  forms and maintenance of voter registration lists for elections for federal  office. Under NVRA, agencies designated as voter registration agencies,  such as motor vehicle agencies, are to transmit completed voter  registration forms to the appropriate state election officials not later than  10 days after the date of acceptance or, if accepted within 5 days before  the end of the registration deadline for an election, the forms are to be  transmitted not later than 5 days after acceptance. Also, under NVRA, the  names of people who are registered to vote may not be removed from  voter registration lists for federal elections except for the following  reasons: upon written confirmation of a change of address outside the  election jurisdiction; on the grounds that the voter has changed address to  a location outside the election jurisdiction on the basis of change of  address information from USPS, but only if there is also a failure to  respond to confirmation mailings and a failure to vote in any election  within two subsequent general federal elections; the request of the voter;  the death of the voter; a criminal conviction, as provided by state law; and  mental incapacity, as provided by state law.", "HAVA was enacted in October 2002 and, in addition to establishing  requirements for provisional ballots for federal elections effective 2004,  the law requires, in general, that individuals who registered by mail on or  after January 1, 2003, and have not voted in a federal election beginning in  2004 in the state since registering to vote to show photo identification or  another qualifying identification document when voting in person or by  mail in a federal election.

Ensuring that  eligible persons are registered to vote is an ongoing challenge for election  officials and is complicated by factors such as jurisdiction size, mobility of  voters, and community diversity. Communities with large student or  military populations must manage voters constantly moving in or out of a  jurisdiction, and communities with diverse populations must handle  substantial numbers of new citizens and face language challenges in  communicating voter registration requirements. U.S. citizens who meet  state voter eligibility requirements have numerous opportunities to  register to vote and can do so by filling out and submitting applications by  certain deadlines. States establish voting eligibility requirements that  generally include that the voter is at least 18 years of age on the day of the  election, a citizen of the United States, mentally competent, and meets  state eligibility qualifications regarding felon status. In general, to register  to vote, eligible citizens may apply at local election offices or at motor  vehicle agencies and other agencies, such as public assistance agencies,  covered by NVRA; by submitting applications to local election officials; or  through registration drives sponsored by various groups, including  political parties.

FEC reiterated its  conclusion about the disenfranchisement of those who had applied but  whose registrations were not processed by election day and  recommended, as in the earlier report, that states develop an ongoing  training program for personnel in agencies covered by NVRA, such as  MVAs, regarding their duties and responsibilities under NVRA.", "In 2001, the National Commission on Federal Election Reform, which was  organized by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of  Virginia and The Century Foundation, expressed concerns through a task  force on voter registration that delegating voter registration  responsibilities to agencies and organizations outside of election offices,  such as organizations that conduct voter registration drives, can result in  citizens who thought they had registered being turned away from the polls  on Election Day.  The Commission\u2019s final report stated that voters can be  turned away from the polls because of administrative errors by election  offices or NVRA agencies that accept voter registration applications and  noted that, although NVRA does not require it,  \u201cmost states allow practically anyone to go out and register voters by  taking and transmitting their mail-in applications. These people thus act in  effect as deputy registrars. Election administrators we have encountered  in every part of the country tell us of numerous cases where these  unofficial registrars, often meaning well, mishandle or lose such  applications. The applicants, of course, rightly believe they have  registered.

In addition, we describe the experiences of  selected motor vehicle agency (MVA) offices during 2004 in carrying out  voter registration application procedures\u2014specifically, assisting MVA  clients with completing voter registration applications, accepting  applications from these clients, and forwarding application to state or  local elections offices.", "We first selected states and, subsequently, local jurisdictions within those  states consistent with our earlier report on maintaining accurate voter  registration lists. We selected the following states using a non-probability  sample: Arizona, California, Michigan, New York, Texas, Virginia, and  Wisconsin. Our selection of the seven states took into consideration  several voter registration-related factors and unique characteristics of the  states that might affect the implementation of HAVA. For example,  Wisconsin has same day registration, which exempts the state from the  HAVA provisional voting requirement; Arizona has on-line voter  registration; and Michigan has a reputation as a model for registration  practices. Also, we selected New York State because, when receiving voter  registration applications or checking applications with voter registration  lists, New York State may have to rely on social security number  verification procedures more than other states because it has a large  population who live in New York City and may not have driver\u2019s licenses.  We also selected states to provide geographic diversity and variation in  election administration\u2014some administer elections at the county level and  others at lower levels such as city or townships. Our goal was not to target  a particular state, but rather to identify a range of issues facing states in  managing the voter registration process, including updating voter  registration lists, and implementing HAVA provisional voting and  identification requirements. Information from these seven states cannot be  generalized to all states. Table 4 describes the voter registration-related  characteristics of each state.", "Within each state, we selected the two jurisdictions using a non- probability sample. Our selection criteria for the 14 jurisdictions (2  jurisdictions in each of the 7 states) included population size, the  proximity of the locations to our site visits with state election and motor  vehicle officials, suggestions by state election and motor vehicle officials,  and proximity to an MVA office.

First, we  reviewed HAVA and other relevant laws, state reports, and documents  related to the voter registration process in the seven states. Second, we  interviewed state and local election officials in the 7 states and 14  jurisdictions to obtain information on their registration processes and  implementation of the HAVA requirements for provisional voting and voter  identification. Third, because so many voter registrations originate with  applications from motor vehicle agencies, we also interviewed officials  from these agencies in 10 jurisdictions to discuss their procedures for  processing voter registration applications. In Michigan, where we spoke  only with Secretary of State officials, the Secretary of State\u2019s office is  responsible for elections and motor vehicle functions, such as issuing  driver\u2019s licenses.", "Following our site visits, we sent a questionnaire to the same officials in  the 14 local elections offices in the seven states to gather information  about their experiences with the November 2004 election. We did not  survey state election officials because voter registration and operations  are carried out at the local level (e.g., county, city, or township).  Consistent with our objectives, our survey focused primarily on (1)  challenges, if any, processing voter registration applications, specifically,  challenges receiving voter registration applications from MVAs, other  NVRA agencies, and voter registration drives sponsored by non- governmental organizations; checking voter registration applications for  completeness, accuracy, and duplicates; and entering voter information  into registration lists or systems; (2) whether voters names were removed  from voter registration lists, reasons why names were removed, and steps  taken to ensure that voters names were not inadvertently removed; and (3)  HAVA\u2019s provisional voting and first-time voter identification requirements,  specifically, the number of provisional ballots cast and counted, including  reasons, if any, why jurisdictions did not count provisional ballots; how  voters were informed about provisional voting and its outcome; and  whether first-time voters who registered by mail were allowed to cast  provisional ballots if they did not provide identification. We also sent a  survey to the state and local motor vehicle agency officials in six of the  seven states to gather information about (1) their experiences assisting  citizens in filling out voter registration applications and forwarding  applications to election offices and (2) their experiences with the  November 2004 election related to voter registration applications.", "Because our surveys were not sample surveys, there are no sampling  errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may  introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling errors. For  example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted, in the  sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how the  responses we received are entered into a database or were analyzed, can  introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in  the development of the surveys, the data collection, and the data analysis  to minimize these nonsampling errors and help ensure the accuracy of the  answers that were obtained. For example, a social science survey  specialist designed the surveys in collaboration with our staff with subject  matter expertise. When the data were analyzed, a second, independent  analyst checked all computer programs. With regard to numbers received  as part of our surveys, such as the number of provisional ballots cast and  counted, we determined that the data reported via the surveys were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report by asking the survey  respondents to identify any limitations associated with using the numbers  provided and actions taken to check the accuracy of the numbers. We did  not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of responses  provided from our surveys of election officials and MVA officials. Local  election officials and state and local MVA officials we surveyed were  provided the opportunity to verify the accuracy of their responses for this  report and, on the basis of the comments we received, we made technical  changes, where appropriate.
