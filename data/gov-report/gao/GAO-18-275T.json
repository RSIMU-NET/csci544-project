GAO made six recommendations to DOJ related to these efforts. As of December 2017, DOJ has implemented two of the six recommendations and has not fully addressed the remaining four. Specifically, to enhance efforts to measure program outcomes, DOJ issued guidance on proper data entry and began tracking data on different types of pretrial diversion programs that allow certain offenders to avoid incarceration if they satisfy program requirements. In addition, as of December 2017, DOJ has taken steps to partially implement GAO's recommendation to address unnecessary delays in reviewing inmates' petitions to commute their sentences.", "DOJ has not taken action to address recommendations to better assess the results of pretrial diversion programs or another effort to prioritize prosecutions and reform sentencing to eliminate unfair disparities, among other goals.

The guidelines specify sentencing  guideline ranges\u2014a range of time (in months) that offenders should serve  given the nature of their offense and other factors\u2014but also permit  sentences to depart upward or downward from guideline ranges because  of aggravating or mitigating circumstances. In 2005, the Supreme Court  found the sentencing guidelines, which had previously been binding for  federal judges to follow in sentencing criminal defendants, to be advisory  in nature.

In  addition, toward the end of inmates\u2019 periods of incarceration, BOP may  place inmates in residential reentry centers (RRC, also known as halfway  houses), in which inmates are housed outside of a prison environment  prior to their release in the community. During their time in RRCs, inmates  are authorized to leave for approved activities, such as work; are  monitored 24 hours a day, such as through sign-out procedures; are  required to work or be actively seeking work; and are required to pay a  percentage of their salaries as a subsistence fee to cover some of their  expenses at the RRC.", "In addition, BOP may place inmates in home confinement toward the end  of their sentences. While in home confinement, inmates are required to  remain in their homes when not involved in approved activities, such as  employment, and are supervised and monitored, such as through  curfews, random staff visits, or electronic monitoring. RRC staff may  provide the supervision of inmates in home confinement. Through an  interagency agreement, BOP and the PPSO also established the Federal  Location Monitoring Program, through which PPSO officers provide  supervision for BOP inmates on home confinement under certain  conditions.

Individuals convicted of a crime generally face a sentence, which can  include fines, probation, and incarceration in jail or prison. In addition to  the sentence, individuals may also face collateral consequences\u2014 penalties and disadvantages, other than those associated with a  sentence, which can be imposed upon an individual as a result of a  conviction. For example, collateral consequences may prohibit people  who committed crimes involving a sex offense or offense involving a child  victim from working in a child care facility. Collateral consequences can  be contained in federal and state laws and regulations. Notably, federal  collateral consequences can serve various functions, such as enhancing  public safety or protecting government interests. In 2012, the American  Bar Association began compiling the first nationwide inventory of  collateral consequences, known as the National Inventory of the  Collateral Consequences of Conviction (NICCC). As of December 31,  2016, the NICCC contained roughly 46,000 collateral consequences  established through federal and state laws and regulations.", "We reported on collateral consequences contained in federal laws and  regulations (i.e., federal collateral consequences) that can be imposed  upon individuals with nonviolent drug convictions (NVDC). Our review of  the NICCC found that, as of December 31, 2016, there were 641  collateral consequences in federal laws and regulations that can be  triggered by NVDC. The NICCC data indicated that these 641 collateral  consequences can limit many aspects of an individual\u2019s life, such as  employment, business licenses, education, and government benefits. For  example, individuals may be ineligible for certain professional licenses,  federal education loans, or federal food assistance.

Most of the stakeholders that we interviewed\u201413 of 14\u2014said it was  important for the federal government to take action to mitigate federal  collateral consequences for NVDC. Thirteen stakeholders said that  mitigating federal collateral consequences could potentially reduce the  likelihood that individuals with NVDC reoffend.

In June 2015 and June 2016, we  reported that in part to help address challenges associated with  overcrowding in certain institutions and related costs of incarceration,  DOJ had taken steps to reduce the prison population by pursuing  initiatives to: use alternatives to incarceration for low-level nonviolent  crimes; prioritize prosecutions to focus on serious cases; and commute,  or reduce, sentences of qualified federal inmates. In these reports, we  highlighted potential areas for continued oversight of these initiatives and  made six recommendations. DOJ concurred with five of these  recommendations and partially concurred with the other. As of December  2017, DOJ has implemented two of the six recommendations and had not  fully addressed the remaining four.", "DOJ could better measure effectiveness of pretrial diversion  alternatives. In June 2016, we reported that DOJ had taken steps to  pursue alternatives to incarceration for certain offenders, but could  improve data collection and efforts to measure outcomes resulting from  the use of pretrial diversion alternatives. Our review examined two  pretrial diversion programs on the front-end of the criminal justice process  that provided offenders an opportunity to avoid incarceration if they satisfy  program requirements. Title 9 of the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Manual permits U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 Offices to divert, at the discretion of a U.S. Attorney, certain  federal offenders from prosecution into a program of supervision and  services administered by the PPSO. Under the Title 9 diversion program,  if the offender fulfills the terms of the program, the offender will not be  prosecuted, or, if the offender has already been charged, the charges will  be dismissed.", "In addition to the Title 9 Pretrial Diversion Program, federal criminal  justice stakeholders within some judicial districts have voluntarily  established court-involved pretrial diversion practices. Court-involved  pretrial diversion allows certain federal offenders the opportunity to  participate in supervised programs or services, such as a drug court to  address criminal behavior that may be linked to addiction to drugs or  alcohol. Program participants are to meet regularly with court officials  including a judge and pretrial services officer to discuss their progress in  the program. If the offender satisfies program requirements, the offender  may not be prosecuted, charges may be dismissed, or the participant  may receive a reduced sentence.", "While DOJ had collected some data on the use of pretrial diversion, we  found that the data were of limited usefulness and reliability because its  case management system did not distinguish between the different types  of diversion and DOJ had not provided guidance to U.S. Attorneys\u2019  Offices as to when and how pretrial diversion cases are to be entered into  the system. In addition, we found that DOJ had not measured the  outcomes or identified the cost implications of its pretrial diversion  programs. To address these deficiencies, we made four  recommendations to DOJ. The first two relate to tracking and entering  pretrial diversion data, while the second two relate to assessing outcomes  based on the data. Specifically, we recommended that DOJ (1) separately  identify and track the different types of pretrial diversion programs, (2)  provide guidance to its attorneys on the appropriate way to enter data, (3)  identify, obtain, and track data on the outcomes and costs of pretrial  diversion programs, and (4) develop performance measures to assess  diversion program outcomes. DOJ concurred with all four of our  recommendations.", "In October 2016, DOJ took actions to fully implement the first two  recommendations. Specifically, in September 2016, DOJ provided  guidance to staff in its U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices that outlines (1) the use of  two new pretrial diversion codes\u2014one for Title 9 pretrial diversion and  another for court-involved diversion and (2) the appropriate entries to  create and dispose of each type of pretrial diversion. Attorneys were  instructed to use the codes starting on October 1, 2016. However, as of  December 2017, DOJ has not implemented the third and fourth  recommendations. We continue to believe that by obtaining data on the  costs and outcomes of pretrial diversion programs and establishing  performance measures, DOJ would gain multiple advantages in its ability  to manage these programs and optimize their outcomes and cost  implications.", "DOJ could better assess initiatives to address prison overcrowding  and costs. In June 2015, we reported that DOJ could better measure the  efficacy of two incarceration initiatives designed to address challenges  related to overcrowding and rising costs. One of these was the Smart on  Crime initiative, announced in August 2013 as a comprehensive effort to: prioritize prosecutions to focus on the most serious cases;  reform sentencing to eliminate unfair disparities and reduce  overburdened prisons; pursue alternatives to incarceration for low-level nonviolent crimes;  improve reentry to curb repeat offenses and re-victimization; and  surge resources to prevent violence and protecting most vulnerable  populations.", "In our report, we found that DOJ had established indicators that were  well-linked to these goals; however, the indicators lacked other key  elements of successful performance measurement systems, such as  clarity, a measurable target, or context. For example, none of the  indicators had numerical targets by which to assess whether overall goals  and objectives are achieved. To address this deficiency, we  recommended that DOJ modify its Smart on Crime indicators to  incorporate key elements of successful performance measurement  systems. DOJ partially concurred with the recommendation, and agreed  to continually refine and enhance the indicators to improve their clarity  and context. However, DOJ did not agree that establishing measurable  targets for its indicators was appropriate. We recognized that it might not  be appropriate to create targets for every indicator. Nevertheless, we  maintained that measurable performance targets that are properly  developed, communicated, and managed, can aid Department leadership  in the admittedly challenging task of assessing progress in the Smart on  Crime Initiative.", "In March 2017, DOJ noted that, due to a change in administration, the  status of the Smart on Crime Initiative was uncertain. In May 2017, the  Attorney General issued a new charging and sentencing policy to all  federal prosecutors that effectively rescinded any previous policy of DOJ  that is inconsistent with the new charging and sentencing policy, including  certain aspects of the Smart on Crime Initiative. In December 2017,  DOJ stated it would start to collect data on and monitor the  implementation of this new policy. However, DOJ did not provide  information on how it plans to modify its indicators to incorporate key  elements of successful performance measurement systems. To the  extent that DOJ continues to implement other aspects of the Smart on  Crime initiative, such as improving reentry and surging resources to  prevent violence we continue to believe this recommendation is valid.", "The second initiative we addressed in our June 2015 report was the  Clemency Initiative, which encourages nonviolent, low-level federal  offenders to petition to have their sentences commuted, or reduced, by  the President. Commutation of sentence, as we reported, has long been  considered to be an extraordinary remedy that is rarely granted.  According to DOJ, in 2013, then-President Obama expressed a desire to  review more petitions, and DOJ pledged to expedite the review of such  petitions in order to provide them to the President for consideration.  However, we found that DOJ had not adequately assessed the extent to  which the Clemency Initiative is expeditiously identifying meritorious  petitions because it had not tracked how long it takes for petitions to clear  each step in its review process or identified and addressed any processes  that may contribute to unnecessary delays. We made a recommendation  to DOJ to address this deficiency. DOJ concurred, but in March 2017  DOJ stated that it had no standard review process to evaluate. In  December 2017, DOJ reported to us that it has taken steps to accelerate  the review of commutation cases, such as assigning two attorneys to  spend additional time on commutation cases. Although DOJ\u2019s actions are  consistent with our recommendation, DOJ has not tracked how long it  takes for petitions to clear each step in its review process.

In June  2015, we reported that BOP had 18 reentry programs available to  inmates in BOP institutions in the areas of inmate treatment and  education. We found that while BOP had plans to evaluate the  performance of some of its reentry programs, it did not have a plan in  place to prioritize evaluations across all of these programs. As a result,  we recommended that BOP include, as part of its current evaluation plan,  all 18 of BOP\u2019s national reentry programs, and prioritize its evaluations by  considering factors such as resources required for conducting  evaluations. In May 2016, BOP provided to us an evaluation plan that  was consistent with our recommendation. BOP has continued to update  the evaluation plan to reflect changes in priority. For example, the most  recent plan, updated in July 2017, lists BOP\u2019s Mental Health Step Down  Unit program as its top priority, with a target evaluation date of fiscal year  2018. According to BOP, this reflects the need for analysis of services for  seriously mentally ill inmates.", "BOP has taken steps to assess costs of home confinement services.  In February 2012, we reported that BOP did not know the actual cost of  home confinement services. To facilitate inmates\u2019 reintegration into  society, BOP may transfer eligible inmates to community corrections  locations for up to the final 12 months of their sentences. Inmates may  spend this time in a RRC and in confinement in their homes for up to 6  months. BOP contracts with private organizations to manage the RRCs  and monitor inmates in home confinement. At the time of our review,  BOP was paying a rate of 50 percent of the overall per diem rate  negotiated with the RRC for each inmate in home confinement. For  example, if BOP paid a contractor the average community corrections per  diem rate of $70.79 for each inmate housed in a RRC, BOP would pay  $35.39 per day for that contractor\u2019s supervision of each inmate in home  confinement. However, according to BOP, the agency did not require  contractors to provide the actual costs for home confinement services as  part of their contract and therefore did not know the cost of home  confinement. To help BOP better manage its costs, we recommended  that BOP establish a plan for requiring contractors to submit separate  prices of RRC beds and home confinement services. BOP implemented  this recommendation and determined that all new solicitations as of  February 1, 2013, will have separate line items for RRC in-house beds  and home confinement services. According to BOP, as of November  2017, 184 solicitations with separate RRC bed and home confinement  service line items have been issued since February 2013.", "BOP could better measure the outcomes of RRCs and home  confinement. In June 2016, we reported that BOP was not positioned to  track the information it would need to help measure the outcomes of  inmates placed in RRCs and home confinement and did not have  performance measures in place. Specifically, we found that, as part of  its strategic plan, BOP had two measures\u2014one to track the number of  inmates placed into RRCs, and another to track the number of inmates  placed in home confinement. However, these measures did not help  assess the outcomes of RRCs and home confinement, such as how  these programs may or may not affect the recidivism rates of inmates. To  address this deficiency, we made two recommendations to BOP to (1)  identify, obtain, and track data on the outcomes of the RRC and home  confinement programs; and (2) develop performance measures by which  to help assess program outcomes. DOJ concurred with these  recommendations.", "As of December 2017, BOP has taken steps to implement our  recommendation to identify, obtain, and track data on the outcomes of  RRCs and home confinement. In particular, BOP reported to us that it has  developed a revised Statement of Work for use with its RRC contractors  that requires the contractors to track and report quarterly to BOP on,  among other things, the number of placements into and releases from  RRCs and home confinement; revocations from RRCs or home  confinement; and RRC and home confinement residents that have  secured full, part-time, or temporary employment. BOP plans to compile  these data to track contractor performance and program outcomes.  Further, BOP reported to us that it has developed a voluntary survey that  asks RRC residents about their RRC experiences, including the amount  of help they received in finding and keeping a job, and finding a place to  live. These actions are in line with our recommendation and we will  continue to monitor their implementation.
