Additionally, the agency has faced significant needs in its information technology area. In response to these trends and several high-profile corporate failures and financial scandals, Congress approved significant increases in SEC's appropriations to help improve oversight and increase public confidence in financial markets. This report builds on several reports GAO has issued on these issues.

Although these allocations appear consistent with legislative directions, they were made without the benefit of an updated agencywide strategic plan, which was not approved until July 9, 2004. Although SEC received more flexible pay and hiring authority, SEC continues to face challenges filling critical vacancies, such as accountants. Officials cite competition from the private sector as a major factor. SEC's information technology (IT) budget increased from $46.6 million in fiscal year 2002 to over $100 million in fiscal year 2003. It increased another 20 percent to $120 million in fiscal year 2004. SEC used most of these large increases for maintenance and infrastructure needs, compared with new technology initiatives. Also, SEC's Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report detailing its concerns, which we share, about the decision-making process for IT capital investments. OIG made several recommendations to improve this process, and SEC staff have begun to take actions to address some of them.

We also interviewed SEC officials to obtain their views on SEC\u2019s budget  and IT decision-making processes. We performed limited data reliability  testing of SEC\u2019s budget data by interviewing knowledgeable agency budget  officials and comparing the data with other published budget data.

In our March  2002 report, we stated that since 1996, SEC\u2019s staff resources had not  grown commensurate with its workload. We noted that SEC tended to  develop its annual budget request based on the previous year\u2019s  appropriation rather than on what it would actually need to fulfill its  mission. The result was that the modest growth in staff resources in the  1990s at SEC was insufficient to manage its workload.

In 2002 the  former Chairman directed SEC staff to conduct an internal study of SEC\u2019s  current operations, workload, resource allocations, methods for assigning  and managing work, and measures of performance, productivity, and  quality of effort. Soon after the current Chairman joined SEC in February  2003, he asked that the division and office heads prepare analyses to  justify their staffing requests.

The revisions were based on recommendations  in an audit report issued by SEC\u2019s OIG in August 2001 that reviewed SEC\u2019s  IT capital investment decision-making process in order to improve  communication between OIT and SEC staff. Beginning in 2002, SEC  developed a new decision-making process for IT investments, with SEC\u2019s  IOC and ITCPC responsible for managing the portion of SEC\u2019s IT budget  related to new technology initiatives. Specifically, IOC, which includes  program office senior staff familiar with both the business and IT needs  within their programs, receives and evaluates specific IT investment  proposals submitted by SEC\u2019s divisions and program offices. Based on  their review, IOC makes recommendations regarding which projects  should be approved for funding. These recommendations are forwarded to  ITCPC, a more senior council of division directors and program office  heads, for final funding decisions.", "Although SEC has taken steps to develop a formal decision-making  process for IT investments, in a 2004 follow-up report, OIG raised  concerns about the current state of this process. According to the OIG  report, OIG evaluated SEC\u2019s compliance with the Clinger-Cohen Act of  1996 (CCA) by applying GAO\u2019s IT Investment Management Framework for  Assessing and Improving Process Maturity (IT IM Maturity Model). In  general, GAO\u2019s framework includes standards for the selection, control,  and evaluation of federal information technology investments, in  accordance with the fundamental IT governance mandates of the CCA.  OIG found that SEC has made progress in establishing an IT investment  process that complies with applicable laws and regulations and  incorporates best practices from the public and private sectors. However,  OIG also identified some concerns. For example, OIG found that SEC\u2019s  process still did not meet the minimum criteria of GAO\u2019s IT IM Maturity  Model because SEC had not assigned specific responsibility or delegated  appropriate authority for establishing a compliant and effective decision- making process in order to strengthen the governance over the process.  Based on this review, OIG concluded, and we generally agree, that the lack  of clearly defined and formally approved IT governance policies, criteria,  and procedures resulted in an undisciplined IT investment decision- making process subject to broad interpretation by SEC management,  which lacked auditable and enforceable standards and controls.", "OIG made a number of recommendations to address SEC\u2019s IT investment  decision-making governance issues, including (1) the development of a  work plan for implementing the OIG\u2019s recommendations; (2) formalizing  charters, roles, and responsibilities for the Chief Information Officer  (CIO), IOC, ITCPC, and other relevant IT governance bodies, including  delegating to the CIO sufficient authority to effectively administer, control,  implement, and enforce the IT capital planning responsibilities; (3)  revising the project funding process and associated investment thresholds  and criteria; (4) improving the strategic planning for IT investments, which  includes finalizing an IT specific strategic plan that establishes the  strategic direction for IT capital planning and tactical operations within  SEC and establishing a single agencywide IT control process and structure  for the entire IT budget to select, prioritize, and fund all IT investments to  be managed by IOC and ITCPC; (5) linking IT project planning with SEC\u2019s  enterprise architecture; (6) improving the tracking of IT projects in  progress; and (7) supporting IOC and ITCPC with adequate staff.", "SEC has taken steps to implement some of the recommendations  contained in the OIG\u2019s report. According to SEC officials, staff are in the  process of formalizing the charters, roles, and responsibilities for the CIO,  IOC, ITCPC, and other relevant governance bodies by reviewing the  pertinent legislation, Office of Management and Budget requirements, and  other relevant guidance. Further, the SEC Chairman recently delegated to  the CIO the necessary authority to issue and enforce agencywide IT policy  and regulations, and to implement the recommendations in the OIG report.  In addition, SEC officials stated that starting with the 2004 IT budget, SEC  will establish a single agencywide IT control process and structure for the  entire IT budget, managed by IOC and ITCPC, to select, prioritize, and  fund all IT investments.", "SEC officials have articulated a preliminary plan to respond to the  remaining OIG recommendations. SEC officials stated that their ability to  respond to the OIG\u2019s recommendation depends on how quickly they can  hire the staff responsible for managing the capital planning process. Most  importantly, the Senior Program Manager position for the project  management/capital planning group\uf8e7who will be responsible for seeing  that the OIG\u2019s recommendations are responded to\uf8e7is currently vacant.  Therefore, officials stated that they would most likely be able to address  25 percent to 33 percent of the OIG\u2019s recommendations by the end of fiscal  year 2004."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["Since Congress increased SEC\u2019s budget to improve the agency\u2019s oversight  of financial markets in fiscal year 2003, SEC has made significant progress  in hiring staff and is continuing its efforts to fill the remaining vacancies.  The number of vacancies appears reasonable, given that SEC had to  contend with competition from the private sector and a continuing  resolution that limited the time SEC had for recruiting. SEC has also taken  steps to improve its information technology by using the increased funding  to augment its budget for technology\uf8e7and, in turn, upgrade its  infrastructure\uf8e7and by continuing to address the OIG\u2019s concerns about the  agency\u2019s decision-making process on IT spending. Although SEC\u2019s staff  allocations appear to be consistent with Sarbanes-Oxley, these allocations  were made without the benefit of a strategic plan. As we have previously  noted and the SEC Chairman has agreed, a comprehensive strategic plan  could provide SEC management with a basis for determining whether  SEC\u2019s resource level and allocations, as well as its processes and  organizational structure, are tied to the mission and goals of the agency.

First,  since March, SEC has made additional progress hiring about 130 new  employees, and approximately 130 others have committed to start with  SEC before the end of the fiscal year.
