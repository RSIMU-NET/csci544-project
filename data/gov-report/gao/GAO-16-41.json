This cost, referred to as subsidy cost, equals the net present value of estimated cash flows from the government (e.g., loan disbursements and claim payments to lenders) minus estimated cash flows to the government (e.g., loan repayments, interest payments, fees, and recoveries on defaulted loans) over the life of the loan, excluding administrative costs. Discount rates that reflect the federal government's cost of financing are used to determine the net present value of estimated cash flows. Agencies generally update\u2014or reestimate\u2014subsidy costs annually to reflect both actual loan performance and changes in expected future loan performance.", "Based on GAO's analyses of credit program reestimates for direct loans and loan guarantees obligated or committed from fiscal years 2001 through 2014 and considering various factors to identify trends, GAO did not identify any overall consistent trends in under- or overestimates of subsidy costs across federal credit programs government-wide. Overall, both direct loan and loan guarantee programs government-wide underestimated costs by $3.1 billion and $39.0 billion, respectively, over the 14-year period. These amounts represent less than 1 percent of the amounts disbursed or guaranteed during the period. Annual reestimates fluctuated from year to year, indicating both under- and overestimates of subsidy costs. Further, significant lifetime reestimates could generally be explained by specific events affecting a few large programs. For example, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Program reported underestimating costs over this period because of a variety of factors, including long-term housing prices and interest rate changes stemming from the mortgage and financial crises in the late 2000s.", "While subsidy cost estimates under the fair value approach may provide useful information to decision makers for evaluating the costs against the benefits of credit programs, GAO does not support the use of the fair value approach to estimate subsidy costs for the budget. Proponents of the fair value approach have asserted that beyond the cash flows associated with a direct loan or loan guarantee, costs are imposed on taxpayers who would, in a similarly risky private market transaction, require compensation for bearing the risk associated with making the loan or guarantee. Taxpayers as investors with diversified portfolios would still demand compensation, or a premium, for bearing the risk that the macroeconomy\u2014the national or global economy\u2014may falter. This risk\u2014referred to as aggregate risk (a portion of overall market risk)\u2014arises from the possibility of significant economic downturns, when even a well-diversified portfolio of financial investments will decrease in value. To incorporate the cost of bearing aggregate risk into subsidy cost estimates for the budget, the fair value approach adds an aggregate risk premium to the discount rate used in FCRA calculations, which is based on interest rates of Treasury securities. Including the aggregate risk premium incorporates a noncash cost into the subsidy cost estimate. The actual cash flows to and from the federal government associated with a credit program are the same under the fair value approach and FCRA. The debate over the fair value approach rests on whether the cost associated with aggregate risk should be considered in the subsidy cost estimates for the budget of the federal government.", "Reflecting a different concern, some proponents of the fair value approach cited as motivation the perceived overreliance on federal credit programs as a policy tool and the desire to correct any bias toward underestimates of costs under FCRA. Raising the subsidy cost would likely result in fewer loans being made. In contrast, some proponents of FCRA stated that any overreliance on credit programs should be addressed as a policy decision, and that to the extent that agencies were underestimating subsidy costs under FCRA, improvements in the subsidy estimation process should be pursued.", "The additional market risk recognized under the fair value approach does not reflect additional cash costs beyond those already recognized by FCRA. The introduction of market risk into subsidy costs under the fair value approach would (1) be inconsistent with long-standing federal budgeting practices primarily based on cash outlays; (2) be inconsistent with the budgetary treatment of similarly risky programs; (3) introduce transparency and verification issues with respect to inclusion of a noncash cost in budget totals; and (4) involve significant implementation issues, such as the need for additional agency resources. Consequently, GAO does not support the use of the fair value approach to estimate subsidy costs for the budget and believes the current FCRA methodology is more appropriate for this purpose as it represents the best estimate of the direct cost to the government and is consistent with current budgetary practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO supports maintaining the current FCRA method for estimating credit subsidy cost for the budget and therefore is not making any recommendations.

Twenty-five years ago, the enactment of the Federal Credit Reform Act of  1990 (FCRA) changed the method used to budget for the cost of federal  credit programs. Before fiscal year 1992, when FCRA took effect, the  cost of credit programs was recorded in the budget on a cash basis (the  expected amount of cash paid out minus the cash received in a given  year). As a result, the budget cost associated with a loan guarantee was  not recorded until a default occurred, which may have been many years  after the guarantee was made. Further, direct loans appeared to cost the  same as grants because the total amount of a loan was recorded as a  cost when the loan was made and loan repayments were not recorded  until the year received.

In light of this growing portfolio of outstanding direct loans and  loan guarantees, as well as concerns about underestimates of subsidy  costs and the suggestions to modify FCRA, you asked us to review  issues related to the budgetary treatment of the cost of federal credit  programs. Our objectives were to determine (1) the extent to which trends  exist in the size and direction of subsidy cost reestimates across, or  within, federal credit programs and, based on this analysis of reestimates,  what factors, if any, help explain any significant trends in reestimates and  (2) the implications of using subsidy cost estimates developed under the  fair value approach in the budget and whether we believe such concepts  should be incorporated into subsidy cost estimates for the budget.

We categorized these  programs by seven loan purposes (e.g., housing or education) and by the  type of budget spending. We examined reestimate trends by agency,  program, purpose, cohort fiscal year (the fiscal year of obligation for direct  loans or commitment for loan guarantees), and the type of budget  spending (discretionary or mandatory). We focused on identifying trends  in lifetime reestimate amounts, annual reestimate amounts, and a  comparison of original subsidy rates to reestimated subsidy rates. We  encountered some limitations with the data reported in the President\u2019s  Budgets, which we individually evaluated based on professional  judgment. For each data limitation, we adjusted the data, identified  alternative data calculation methods when available, or determined that  the data were reliable for our purposes. Our conclusions about possible  trends were based on our professional judgment in assessing the data  and not based on a statistical analysis. To evaluate implications of using  subsidy cost estimates developed under the fair value approach for the  budget, we reviewed literature related to FCRA, the purpose and uses of  the federal budget, and the fair value approach.

The policies enacted under  FCRA, sometimes referred to simply as credit reform, recognized that the  actual cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee was not captured by its cash  flows in any one year, but rather is the net present value\u2014worth in terms  of money paid immediately\u2014of its cash flows over the life of the loan.

Some have suggested  revising FCRA to include in the subsidy cost an additional estimated cost  related to certain market risk. This suggestion has been referred to as the  fair value approach and centers around the debate that beyond the cash  flows associated with the direct loan or loan guarantee, which are  recognized under FCRA, costs are imposed on taxpayers who would, in a  similarly risky private market transaction, require compensation for  bearing the aggregate risk associated with making the loan. However, it  is important to note that this cost to the taxpayer does not represent a  monetary cost to the government as it is not a cash outlay by Treasury.", "Instead, it can be thought of as representing a noncash social cost of  federal lending.", "CBO has provided information on fair value estimates to aid  congressional decision making regarding the value of resources being  devoted to federal credit programs for several years. In a 2004 report,  CBO initially laid out the conceptual foundation for the fair value approach  and subsequently issued several more reports more fully examining the  implications of using the fair value approach in the decision-making and  the budget process. In a 2014 testimony, CBO compared and  contrasted the use of the fair value approach versus FCRA in informing  decisions and in budget formulation and execution, laying out advantages  and disadvantages of each method. At present, CBO provides  congressional budget committees with cost estimates for credit programs  using both the fair value approach and the FCRA methodology.", "The term fair value in the context of suggested revisions to FCRA subsidy  costs is similar in concept to its use in private-sector generally accepted  accounting principles (GAAP) for financial accounting; however, there are  differences in how the two would be applied. The fair value approach  discussed in this report relates to budgeting for federal credit programs,  while the term \u201cfair value\u201d under private-sector GAAP applies to the  valuation of certain assets and liabilities of private-sector entities and is  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to  transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. In  a general sense, the \u201cfair value\u201d label for federal budgeting purposes  suggests a parallel between federal and private-sector notions of  appropriate compensation for making loans. The label \u201cfair value\u201d reflects  the perspective that this compensation\u2014the risk premium\u2014that  taxpayers demand can be found by observing what they would require to  make similarly risky investments in private financial markets. That view  provides the analogue to the situation contemplated in private-sector  GAAP fair value.", "The federal budget has for decades represented a system of cash  accounts. FCRA, therefore, was designed to put credit programs on the  same plane as noncredit programs: FCRA reflects only the cost  associated with estimated cash flows between the government and the  borrower or lender, such as repayment of principal, payments of interest  and fees, and claim payments to lenders. All federal programs, including  those for spending programs or tax provisions whose cash costs appear  in the budget, also have associated noncash costs and benefits that  accrue to society at large. However, these noncash costs and benefits  are not included in the budget. Accordingly, budget decisions demand  trade-offs beyond just the cash cost; such decisions need to also consider  noncash costs and benefits. For example, a project supported by federal  spending could reduce unemployment\u2014while at the same time result in  detrimental environmental effects. Because the federal budget was not  envisioned to present a complete picture of the total costs and benefits to  society of government programs and policies, it should not be used as the  sole rationale for federal activities. Specifically, OMB guidance in Circular  No. A-94, Guidelines and Discount Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of  Federal Programs, directs agencies to perform program evaluations,  including consideration of social costs and not just the costs to the federal  government. The compensation cost to taxpayers of making risky  investments, grants, or loans would be a noncash social cost considered  in performing benefit-cost analysis.", "A fuller examination of the fair value approach, including the nature of the  social, noncash costs and the arguments for and against their inclusion in  the budget, is presented later in this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "No Overall Consistent Trends Identified in Under- or Overestimates of Subsidy Costs, and Various Economic and Portfolio Changes Caused Certain Significant Reestimates", "paragraphs": ["We analyzed direct loan and loan guarantee programs\u2019 annual and  lifetime reestimates from fiscal years 2001 through 2014 by cohort,  program, agency, and purpose to identify any trends.

For example, upward  reestimates could indicate that borrowers are delinquent in repaying  loans, and as a result, loan performance is worse than initially expected.  Reestimates take into account actual loan performance and expected  changes in future loan performance, which can both vary because of  portfolio changes (e.g., changes in the credit-worthiness of borrowers)  and changes in the economy\u2014external events that affect borrower  behavior. Reestimates of subsidy costs are to be expected as loan  cohorts age and as the economy deviates from the paths assumed when  subsidy costs were originally estimated. When estimating or reestimating  subsidy costs, agencies must respond to changes in their credit program  portfolios and the economy. While forecasting future loan performance  can be challenging, the goal is to avoid consistent bias, reflected in either  recurring upward or downward reestimates. Consistent bias in forecasting  loan performance would result in subsidy cost estimates that provide  misleading information about program performance. At the same time, a  period of recurring overestimates or underestimates does not necessarily  mean that the original estimates were biased. A particularly challenging  period for forecasting loan performance was the onset of the 2008  financial crisis. A key question in evaluating subsidy cost estimates is  whether agencies were able to foresee deteriorating performance in credit  program portfolios.", "Government-wide, a total of 101 direct loan programs reported  reestimates for the fiscal years 2001 through 2014 cohorts. As shown in  table 1, 42 programs had lifetime upward reestimates and 59 programs  had lifetime downward reestimates. Overall, the reestimates for these  programs totaled a net lifetime upward reestimate of $3.1 billion, meaning  that the original subsidy costs of the cohorts obligated during this period  were underestimated by $3.1 billion, which is less than 1 percent of the  amount of loans disbursed by the cohorts in our review. Based on data  reported in the President\u2019s Budget, the estimated lifetime subsidy income,  meaning negative subsidy cost, of the fiscal years 2001 through 2014  cohorts of direct loan programs totaled about $91 billion, after considering  the effects of lifetime reestimates.

Based on our analyses of these factors related to reestimate  data for the fiscal years 2001 through 2014 cohorts, we did not identify  any overall consistent trends in under- or overestimates of subsidy costs  across federal credit programs government-wide. Specifically, although  both direct loan and loan guarantee programs government-wide had  overall lifetime upward reestimates for the cohorts over the 14-year period  of our analysis, the reestimates fluctuated significantly from year to year.  For example, as shown in figure 8, from fiscal years 2006 through 2014,  direct loan programs recorded overall net upward reestimates for 4 years  and overall net downward reestimates for 5 years. Also during this period,  loan guarantee programs recorded overall net upward reestimates for 5  years and overall net downward reestimates for 4 years. The large  upward reestimates in fiscal year 2012 for loan guarantees and in fiscal  year 2014 for direct loans were primarily attributed to HUD\u2019s MMI Fund  and Education\u2019s Direct Student Loan Program, respectively, which are  discussed later.", "We also analyzed reestimates over time based on whether programs are  discretionary or mandatory. Under FCRA, as previously discussed,  appropriations for initial subsidy costs of discretionary programs are  typically limited to a definite amount. Mandatory credit programs are  funded by the operation of their authorizing statutes, typically in indefinite  amounts. However, both discretionary and mandatory programs  automatically receive permanent indefinite budget authority for the cost of  upward reestimates. Thus, agencies with discretionary credit programs  theoretically could have an incentive to initially underestimate subsidy  costs so that they could make more loans or loan guarantees within a  given appropriation level. If this incentive did not exist and absent any  overriding economic trend, one could expect reestimates to lower the  original subsidy cost estimates as often as they raise it, and the patterns  would be similar for discretionary and mandatory programs.", "Overall, we did not identify any consistent trends that would indicate  whether for some discretionary programs there was an effort to benefit  from initially underestimating subsidy costs. As shown in table 3,  generally the same proportion of discretionary and mandatory credit  programs had upward and downward reestimates. The one pattern we  observed was in relation to the magnitude of loan guarantee reestimates.  Specifically, regarding the dollar amount of reestimates, about 95 percent  of the upward reestimates were from discretionary loan guarantee  programs, while about 93 percent of the downward reestimates were from  mandatory loan guarantee programs. These trends are primarily driven by  two programs\u2014upward reestimates for HUD\u2019s discretionary MMI Fund  and downward reestimates for Education\u2019s mandatory FFEL program.  The reestimates for these programs, which can generally be explained by  economic events and portfolio changes, are described in more detail in  the following section.", "Our analysis of reestimates trend data excluded activity from Treasury\u2019s  Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). TARP is an example of a  federal program that implemented a budgeting process similar to the fair  value approach. TARP was required by law to estimate the budgetary  cost of purchases and guarantees of troubled assets in accordance with  FCRA, except that such costs were required to be calculated by adjusting  the discount rate for market risk. These cost estimates were reestimated  annually, at fiscal year-end, to reflect revised assumptions for market risk,  asset performance, and other key variables and economic factors.  Interest earned or paid on financing account transactions with Treasury  was based on FCRA discount rates (not adjusted for market risk). As a  result, as program funds were repaid, reestimates reflected reduced costs  because of improvements in the economy and also because the noncash  cost that was considered in the market-risk-adjusted discount rates was  not reflected in the actual federal cash flows. Overall, TARP has had  lifetime downward reestimates of nearly $177 billion through fiscal year  2014.

The primary cost driver of the Direct  Student Loan Program is the difference between borrowers\u2019 interest rates  on their loans and Education\u2019s cost of borrowing to finance its lending,  represented by the discount rate in the subsidy cost calculation.  Consistent with the process to develop the President\u2019s Budget, Education  prepares its initial subsidy cost estimates in advance of knowing the  actual borrower interest rates on its lending and interest rates to finance  its lending. Further, interest rate changes are impossible to predict with  certainty. As a result, changes in interest rates, which are outside the  control of Education, can have a significant effect on subsidy cost  reestimates for the program.", "According to Education, this program experienced generally upward  reestimates over the years mainly driven by discount rate changes;  revised assumptions related to income-driven repayment plans and  public service loan forgiveness; and rising borrower default rates. After  fiscal year 2014, the Direct Student Loan Program reported an upward  reestimate of $21.0 billion, which, according to Education officials, was  primarily related to newly implemented income-driven repayment plans  for borrowers. This reestimate had a significant effect not only on the  reestimates in the education category but also on direct loan program  reestimates government-wide. The size of the Direct Student Loan  Program also contributes to the magnitude of its reestimates.

With this loan  volume, a 1 percentage point change in the subsidy rate for all cohorts  would result in an $8.25 billion reestimate.

Chief among these changes affecting the cost were downward  adjustments to long-term housing price and interest rate assumptions  stemming from the mortgage and financial crises in the late 2000s.  Housing prices are an important variable in estimating the MMI Fund\u2019s  subsidy costs because of their influence on the probability of mortgage  default and the severity of losses in the event of default. However, long- term housing price forecasts are inherently uncertain. In addition, the  budget process requires these assumptions to be made more than a year  in advance. HUD officials told us that the assumptions used to make the  original credit subsidy estimates were more optimistic than the revised  assumptions used to make the reestimates, which contributed to upward  reestimates. Another key reason for the MMI Fund\u2019s upward reestimates  was a downward adjustment in mortgage interest rate assumptions.  Mortgage interest rates are an important variable in estimating the fund\u2019s  subsidy costs because of their influence on both mortgage prepayments  and defaults.", "A number of portfolio and mortgage market developments associated with  higher-than-expected losses also contributed to the MMI Fund\u2019s upward  reestimates. For example, growth in the proportion of MMI-insured  mortgages with seller-funded down-payment assistance and competition  from private mortgage institutions in the low down-payment mortgage  market contributed to upward reestimates that began in the early 2000s.  MMI-insured loans with seller-funded down-payment assistance grew  from about 6 percent of the MMI Fund\u2019s business in 2000 to about 30  percent in the mid-2000s. Unlike other key mortgage industry participants,  HUD allowed borrowers to obtain down-payment assistance from  nonprofits that operated programs supported partly by financial  contributions and service fees from participating property sellers. The  seller-funded down-payment assistance loans performed worse than  comparable loans with down-payment assistance from other sources or  with no assistance, possibly because these homebuyers had less equity  in the transactions and thus may have been more likely to default.

More  specifically, proposals calling for the adoption of the fair value approach  are motivated by the idea that the social costs to taxpayers of making  loans should be recognized. The social cost of making a loan includes not  only the estimated cash cost to the government for making the loan and  for providing for the possibility of default\u2014both of which are currently  recognized under FCRA requirements\u2014but also the noncash cost to  taxpayers for bearing the risk associated with the loan\u2014which is not  currently recognized under FCRA requirements.

In this  sense, taxpayers could be considered as analogous to investors in a  private corporation who must contribute more resources if the corporation  experiences losses. In private financial markets, taxpayers as investors  with diversified portfolios would still demand compensation for bearing the  risk that the macroeconomy\u2014the national or global economy as a  whole\u2014may falter. As shown in figure 11, this risk\u2014referred to as  aggregate risk (which represents a portion of overall market risk)\u2014arises  from the possibility of significant economic downturns, when even a well- diversified portfolio of financial investments will experience a reduction in  value. In such bad economic times, loan payments are likely to fall just  when returns are worth most to investors. Compensation for taking on this  aggregate risk\u2014the aggregate risk premium\u2014is over and above that  demanded to account for the time value of money (i.e., the notion that a  dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because it can earn  interest). The fair value approach is based on the premise that the  subsidy cost of credit programs should include this aggregate risk  premium due to taxpayers, even if it is not a cash cost to Treasury.", "While proponents of the fair value approach suggested several methods  to estimate the cost of credit programs under the fair value approach, we  are focusing on the most commonly discussed method for use in federal  budgeting, which calls for adjusting the discount rate to account for the  aggregate risk premium. Some proponents of the fair value approach  also viewed adjusting the discount rate as the most straightforward  method to derive fair value approach measurements. Under this method  to implement the fair value approach, the difference between FCRA and  fair value approach subsidy cost estimates arises from the choice of  discount rates. The estimates of expected cash flows associated with the  loan program, including repayments, interest, or the net amount lost  through defaults or other loan performance, are the same in both  approaches. However, the difference in discount rates means that those  expected cash flows will have different present values under the fair value  approach and FCRA.", "To incorporate the cost of bearing this aggregate risk into budget costs for  loans, the fair value approach adds an aggregate risk premium to the  discount rate used in FCRA calculations, which is determined based on  interest rates on Treasury securities. The Treasury rate is considered to  be default-free because investors are protected against default by the  government\u2019s ability to cover its debts by raising tax revenue or by cutting  other federal spending. Adding the aggregate risk premium to the  discount rate incorporates a noncash social cost into the subsidy cost  estimate. When the expected future cash flows (i.e., payments of interest  and repayments of principal) associated with the loan are discounted  using a discount rate above the Treasury rate, the resulting present value  of these future payments to the government is lower than it would be if  discounting were done using the Treasury rate. A lower present value for  these future payments to the government translates into a higher subsidy  cost to the government when the loan is made. As shown in figure 12,  the aggregate risk premium is one factor that may explain differences  between market interest rates and Treasury interest rates. The debate  over the fair value approach rests on whether the cost associated with  aggregate risk should be considered in the subsidy cost of credit  programs for the budget of the federal government.", "The budget, as presented under FCRA, does not recognize an aggregate  risk premium, and the cost of the government making loans is lower than  it would be under the fair value approach. Some proponents of the fair  value approach have stated that the disconnect of subsidy cost estimates  under FCRA from market valuation is at odds with the presentation of  other costs in the budget that do reflect values in private market  transactions (e.g., purchase of office supplies or wages paid). Market  prices are key benchmarks in assessing the costs to society of using its  resources in one project versus another. In this context, the budget under  FCRA does not reflect the social costs of making loans, which fair value  approach proponents believed should be considered in making budget  decisions that require trade-offs in the presence of a federal budget  constraint.", "The social benefits and costs of extending credit is an important  consideration in decision making about funding levels. As stated in OMB  Circular No. A-94, federal programs should be evaluated based on  comprehensive estimates of the expected benefits and costs to society  and not just the monetary benefits and costs to the government.  Therefore, for credit programs, both cash costs to the government and  social costs imposed on taxpayers could be weighed against benefits to  borrowers and to the public at large. These social costs would include the  cost of bearing risk that the government has transferred to taxpayers,  represented by the aggregate risk premium. OMB Circular No. A-129,  Policies for Federal Credit Programs and Non-Tax Receivables, requires  agencies to provide benefit-cost analyses as part of biennial program  reviews. These reviews are also intended to take account of changes in  program risks and costs. In this context, the fair value approach  aggregate risk premium could be classified as a cost imposed by a  program and included in total societal costs along with the cash costs to  the government. It is in this setting that several proponents of FCRA  believed, and we concur, that the fair value approach would be most  appropriately considered by decision makers, rather than in budget  estimates.", "Reflecting a different concern, some proponents of the fair value  approach to budgeting for federal credit programs, cited as motivation the  perceived over-reliance on federal credit as a policy tool and the desire to  correct any bias toward underestimated costs under FCRA. Consistent  with this view, some proponents of the fair value approach generally  supported the approach for initial subsidy cost estimates that are used by  congressional decision makers to determine loan levels to approve. After  loan levels are approved, these proponents of the fair value approach  generally expressed no preferences for the methodology used to  determine subsidy cost estimates for existing credit program portfolios.  The effects of the 2008 financial crisis on parts of the federal credit  portfolio demonstrated the sensitivity of loan performance to conditions in  the macroeconomy. Subsidy cost estimates of loan guarantee programs  related to housing and small business and agriculture, in particular, had  not anticipated the possibility of large losses associated with the crisis in  the mortgage market and extreme weakness in market demand for goods  and services experienced during the 2008 financial crisis. Repayment of  student loans also declined significantly during this period. Some  proponents of the fair value approach told us that adopting the fair value  approach would help address concerns about the over-reliance on federal  credit programs by raising the subsidy cost of credit programs, likely  resulting in fewer loans being made. Also, according to some  proponents of the fair value approach, raising the cost of credit programs  would weigh against any bias in underestimating costs. In contrast,  proponents of the FCRA methodology stated that to the extent that  agencies were underestimating subsidy costs under FCRA, this would be  more appropriately addressed through improvements in the subsidy  estimation process rather than application of the fair value approach.", "Going forward, there are some reasons to expect that agencies\u2019  estimates of expected loan losses will better reflect the possibility of a rise  in defaults in a macroeconomic downturn. Typically, agencies project  future losses based on historical experience. Before the 2008 financial  crisis, program experience generally did not include the effect of a  significant economic downturn. Therefore, expected loss projections  made prior to 2008 would have likely underestimated the actual losses.  Now, the depressing effects of the 2008 financial crisis across the  government\u2019s credit portfolio are included in each program\u2019s historical  data. Although agencies can project individual loan programs\u2019 expected  losses with the downturn included in historical data, the possibility of  extreme losses occurring simultaneously across loan programs would not  be reflected in the loss estimates of any one program. For that, the  government would have to evaluate performance across its entire credit  portfolio, trying to assess the potential size of total losses in a bad  economy. However, our analysis of credit program reestimates over the  course of the 2008 financial crisis revealed that only parts of the portfolio  experienced significant increases in reestimates, implying some degree of  diversification against the risk of aggregate losses.

Specifically, FCRA introduced  this apparent anomaly by presenting the current and future costs of loan  making in terms of today\u2019s dollars, meaning their worth today, so that the  costs may be compared to the outlays made today when the loan is  disbursed. The subsidy cost of the loan is the budget authority the  Congress appropriates and is the net present value of outflows and  inflows from the government over the life of the loan. Putting credit  program costs in present value terms differs from the current cash basis  used in other programs\u2019 budget accounts to reflect the time value of  money. FCRA could be called modified cash budgeting and serves to  represent the lifetime cost of the loan in today\u2019s dollars. This is consistent  with the method used to compute the fiscal gap and discounts cash flows  in and out of Treasury at the default-free Treasury rate of borrowing.

The higher initial estimated  subsidy cost under the fair value approach would increase the budget  authority required for a given volume of loans compared to that required  under FCRA, thereby raising the federal budget deficit through the effect  on outlays. The federal budget deficit has significance in policy making  and in analyzing the economy, and experts who opposed the fair value  approach cautioned against the inclusion in the budget of what they  termed phantom costs of aggregate risk under the fair value approach.  Ultimately though, as noted above, net cash outlays under both the fair  value approach and FCRA are the same, so any upward bias in initial  subsidy cost estimates introduced by the fair value approach would be  eliminated through downward reestimates as receipts from loan  repayments are recognized.", "Under the fair value approach, if actual cash flows were as initially  estimated, there would be an additional amount in the financing account  that represents the compensation to taxpayers for bearing risk, which is a  social cost and not a cash cost to Treasury. Social costs do not produce  fiscal effects insofar as they are not cash receipts or disbursements from  Treasury. Consequently, to avoid misrepresenting the fiscal effect of  credit programs on the federal budget deficit, some proponents of the fair  value approach suggested recording a revenue to offset this noncash  social cost to clear the additional amount in the financing account and  correct deficit balances.", "Several experts we spoke with disagreed with the fair value approach of  reflecting social costs or the compensation to taxpayers for bearing risks  associated with credit programs in subsidy cost estimates for the budget.  These experts, who favored the current FCRA approach, rejected the  characterization by some financial economists of the government\u2019s being  a pass-through to a collection of taxpayers, no different than investors in  a private corporation. Unlike private corporations, the federal government  is enduring and can avoid insolvency through exercise of its power to levy  taxes and can more easily access credit through the Treasury securities  market. These proponents of FCRA noted that the government has a  lower cost of borrowing than a private financial institution, and as an  entity, the government has the ability to more readily collect on loans  through tax refund offsets and garnishment of wages. In addition, some  federal loans, such as student loans, may not be discharged through  bankruptcy. Therefore, these experts claimed, the cost of providing a  credit program is less expensive for the government than the private  sector. The more fundamental disagreement over the fair value approach  concerns whether the government\u2019s true cost of capital is represented by  the \u201criskless\u201d rate at which it borrows or whether that cost should also  include compensation to taxpayers for bearing aggregate risk. This  debate in the financial economics literature about the government\u2019s cost  of capital dates back several decades and has not been settled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistency with the Budgetary Treatment of Similarly Risky Programs", "paragraphs": ["If the fair value approach were deployed for the government\u2019s portfolio of  direct loans and loan guarantees, inconsistency of treatment across  budgetary accounts would have to be considered. Potential  inconsistencies arise from (1) the comparability of loan program budget  totals that include social costs with noncredit program cash costs that do  not include social costs, (2) the exclusion of social costs associated with  costs of programs that present risks similar to those of loans, and (3) the  treatment of the presence of risk and uncertainty in federal activities other  than loan making. These inconsistencies could distort the decisions the  budget is intended to support by making loans appear relatively more  expensive than other programs because of the inclusion of noncash  social costs.", "The federal budget is primarily recorded on a cash and obligations  basis. The inclusion of social cost in the form of the fair value approach  risk premium raises the relative costs of loans compared to other  programs budgeted based on cash. However, many other federal  programs impose social costs in addition to incurring cash outlays. One  example would be the costs of environmental damage resulting from  federally funded construction projects. Such social costs may not be  priced in the market as an aggregate risk premium might be, but they are  real costs to society in terms of losses in environmental quality and  services. If the fair value approach were to be adopted for budgeting  credit program costs, maintaining consistency in the budget would require  recognition of the social costs of all federal programs across the board,  presenting a daunting analytical problem, at a minimum.", "The introduction of aggregate risk compensation in the budget would  create another inconsistency in the budget\u2019s portrayal of the costs of  uncertain outcomes. Under the fair value approach, an agency would\u2014as  it does now under FCRA\u2014make an estimate of expected loan  performance, including repayments, prepayments, defaults, and  recoveries. The expected cash flows would be associated with average  losses over the life of the loan cohort, implying equal weight on both lower  and higher levels of loss. With the fair value approach, the addition of the  aggregate risk premium implicitly weights the worse outcome more  heavily by adding a cost associated with the possibility that losses are  greater than expected. Elsewhere, the budget presents as point estimates  the expected value of uncertain spending outcomes with the prospects of  better and worse outcomes equally weighted. For example, the  President\u2019s Budget includes funding requests for the costs of fighting  forest fires. That request represents the expected value of the funding  level required based on the probability of a good outcome (i.e., few fires)  and a bad outcome (i.e., an active fire season). To the extent that this risk  cannot be diversified\u2014that is, offset by risk elsewhere in government  spending\u2014then, as with the fair value approach, a risk premium would be  added. Weighting bad outcomes more heavily, as with the fair value  approach, would thus be inconsistent with the treatment of risk and  uncertainty in all other budget estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transparency and Verification Issues", "paragraphs": ["Cost estimates prepared under the fair value approach in the budget  would introduce a number of transparency and verification issues.  Regarding transparency in the presentation of the budget, it may not be  obvious that credit program costs included an aggregate risk premium, so  the lack of comparability with other programs\u2019 cash budgeting would not  be clear. Moreover, as previously discussed, some proponents of the fair  value approach believed that the use of fair value would address the  perceived over-reliance on federal credit and correct for any bias in  underestimates of costs. However, as also previously discussed, our  analysis of reestimates for the fiscal years 2001 through 2014 cohorts of  direct loans and loan guarantees did not identify any overall consistent  trends in under- or overestimates of subsidy costs across federal credit  programs government-wide. Further, some proponents of FCRA asserted  that any problem with subsidy cost estimates will not be solved by  revising a budget estimate via the fair value approach but by engaging  decision makers in discussions about the types and amounts of federal  credit that should be provided in the budget. For example, one expert  stated that concerns about credit program losses could be addressed by  tightening eligibility criteria or reducing appropriations. In addition,  proponents of FCRA felt that any inaccuracy in estimating subsidy costs  should more appropriately be tackled by strengthening the data and  methods agencies use in forecasting expected cash flows.", "Using the fair value approach may also mask information about direct  loan and loan guarantee performance. Under FCRA, the annual  reestimates may provide useful information to analyze actual loan  performance and to evaluate the quality of the estimation process as,  year by year, actual loan performance is recorded and expectations of  future loan performance are updated. Under the fair value approach, such  information may not be transparent because the effects of the adjusted  discount rate would also be included.", "Further, under the fair value approach, the accuracy of the estimate of the  aggregate risk premium is not transparent and verifiable, which is an  important consideration given its cost-increasing effect. A primary  challenge in the fair value approach to budgeting is identifying the  aggregate risk premium applicable to any particular program. If the credit  program has a close counterpart in private credit markets, referred to as a  comparable, the difficulty is reduced though not eliminated. For  example, private credit markets could likely provide a proxy for HUD\u2019s  MMI Fund. However, there is likely not a private market comparable for  SBA\u2019s Disaster Loan Program. In the absence of a market comparable,  the analytical task would be significant and subjective, and in any event,  resulting estimates could be subject to criticism and controversy that  would be hard to resolve. Moreover, even when a market comparable  exists, the task of extracting the aggregate risk premium from the  difference between the default-free Treasury rate and the observed  market rate would still be subjective. This complication arises because  other kinds of costs and risks that are not applicable to government  lending may be compensated in the market rate, as was illustrated in  figure 12. Arriving at a verifiable and auditable estimate of the aggregate  risk premium for each credit program is essential if there is to be  confidence in decisions that depend on comparing their relative costs.", "Some proponents of the fair value approach suggested that TARP  illustrates successful implementation of the fair value approach. TARP  was required to use market-risk adjusted discount rates when determining  subsidy costs for the budget. For investment programs, TARP\u2019s  valuations were based on market prices of securities for comparable  institutions and not solely the aggregate risk. In addition, because the  intention of TARP was to liquidate the assets when economically feasible  rather than hold them to maturity, the use of market prices was an  appropriate measure of expected cash proceeds to be received from  liquidation when the assets were sold. Therefore, TARP\u2019s use of market- risk adjusted discount rates may not be directly comparable to other credit  programs. Under FCRA and in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-11,  Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget, if an agency were  to plan to sell loan assets, the cash flows developed to estimate subsidy  costs would include assumptions related to expected sale proceeds,  which could be based on market information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Significant Implementation Issues", "paragraphs": ["Several experts we spoke with stated that there would be significant  challenges to implementation of the fair value approach.

Several experts,  including proponents of both the fair value approach and FCRA, stated  that agencies and OMB do not currently have sufficient resources to  implement the fair value approach for subsidy cost estimates in the  budget. Some proponents of the fair value approach suggested that  private-sector expertise could be recruited to address the challenges of  identifying the appropriate aggregate risk premium for a program.  However, other experts stated that for programs that lack a market  comparable, private-sector expertise may or may not be more suited to  address the challenge of identifying the aggregate risk premium.", "Conceptual and practical implementation difficulties would also confront  agency analysts. For example, a decision would need to be made about  whether the aggregate risk premium for an existing cohort should be  updated during the reestimate process. Updating the aggregate risk  premium could add significant volatility to subsidy cost estimates, making  it more difficult to understand reasons for reestimates (i.e., poor estimates  or worse-than-expected performance). However, not updating the  aggregate risk premium would result in cost estimates based on out-of- date or noncurrent estimates of risks. Further, to the extent that the  financial accounting for credit programs continues to be consistent with  the budgeting for credit programs, not updating the aggregate risk  premium would be difficult for an agency to support during a financial  statement audit because the auditor would expect credit program cost  estimates to be based on current risk information. In addition, because  fair value approach subsidy cost estimates would include noncash costs  that would, if actual cash flows were as initially estimated, eventually  result in downward reestimates, decisions would need to be made on  whether to recognize these downward reestimates each year or as a one- time adjustment. If the fair value approach were used, decisions would  also need to be made regarding the interest rate used to calculate interest  income and expense amounts on financing account balances so that the  financing account will break even over time as it uses its collections to  repay its Treasury borrowing.", "Other implementation challenges would relate to programs that are  currently required to set borrower fees or interest rates to produce  subsidy-neutral cost estimates, such as the Department of Energy\u2019s Loan  Guarantee Program, or even negative-subsidy cost estimates to cover  administrative costs or to generate reserves, such as HUD\u2019s MMI Fund  loan guarantee program. Decisions would also be needed related to  whether any increases to discretionary spending caps would be made if  the fair value approach were implemented. Lastly, because the financial  accounting for credit programs currently mirrors FCRA and budgetary  accounting, the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board would  need to determine whether accounting standards would need to be  revised for any changes made related to the use of the fair value  approach for the budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparisons between the Fair Value Approach and Private- Sector GAAP Fair Value", "paragraphs": ["Consideration of the fair value approach has been complicated by the  introduction of financial economics concepts and by the use of the term  \u201cfair value\u201d in both FCRA and private-sector GAAP contexts. Financial  economics aims to explain the behavior of private market participants  when confronted with risk and uncertainty in making investment  decisions. This requires an understanding of the alternatives available for  managing risks and of their respective costs. Application of these private- sector concepts to a government setting is an unfamiliar exercise to many  in the public sector. Further, awareness of the private-sector GAAP  guidance on the use of fair value for measuring private financial  institutions\u2019 assets may mistakenly suggest relevance to federal  budgeting. The label \u201cfair value\u201d as it relates to federal credit program  subsidy cost proposals reflects the perspective that the risk premium  taxpayers demand can be found by observing what they would require to  make similarly risky investments in private financial markets. That view  provides the analogue to the situation contemplated in private-sector  GAAP uses of fair value, wherein the valuation of certain assets and  liabilities of private-sector entities is based on the price that would be  received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants. For those who advocate the  application of private-sector accounting principles to the public sector,  employing private-sector GAAP in estimating the costs of federal credit  programs is attractive. However, any parallels between the public and  private-sector settings are not straightforward. Consequently, the  suggestion to apply private-sector GAAP to federal budgeting for credit  programs creates the potential for misrepresentation of the costs of  government programs.", "Federal Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles (U.S. GAAP)  U.S. GAAP is established by the Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board  (FASAB).   The primary accounting standard for federal  credit programs is Statement of Federal  Financial Accounting Standards No. 2,  Accounting for Direct Loans and Loan  Guarantees, which became effective in fiscal  year 1994.  When FASAB established this accounting  standard, it stated that it recognized the value  of having financial accounting support the  budget. It also endorsed the logic underlying  the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990  (FCRA) and recommended that accounting  standards for credit programs be consistent  with budgeting under FCRA.", "While the concepts behind the fair value approach and private-sector  GAAP fair value are similar, there are differences in how the two would be  applied. First, under private-sector GAAP, fair value is defined as the  price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in  an orderly transaction between market participants. In contrast, because  private-sector GAAP fair value\u2014which is based on market prices\u2014 includes costs that may not be relevant to the federal government, such  as liquidity costs, the fair value approach extracts aggregate risk from  overall market risk to recognize the risk applicable to federal credit  programs in the view of a taxpayer. Consequently, the fair value approach  does not reflect the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to  transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants  because the aggregate risk premium recognized under the fair value  approach represents only a portion of the risks and other factors that are  reflected in market prices.", "Private-Sector Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles (GAAP) Fair Value  To increase consistency and comparability in  GAAP fair value measurements and related  disclosures, GAAP requires entities to  disclose fair value information based on a  hierarchy of inputs used to determine fair  values.

These unobservable  inputs are used because there is little to  no direct market activity.", "Second, under private-sector GAAP, generally loans that a bank holds for  investment are recorded at amortized cost, net of an impairment  allowance for estimated credit losses. Such loans typically comprise the  bulk of assets held by banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation. However, loans originated with the intent to sell in the  secondary market to government-sponsored entities and other investors  are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, unless the institution has  elected to account for the loans at fair value under the fair value option.  The private-sector GAAP fair value measurement provides information on  the current value of the asset that is available for sale. In contrast, the fair  value approach would be applied to all credit programs, regardless of  whether the government plans to sell assets or hold them to maturity.  Currently, Treasury is the only federal agency routinely selling some of its  credit programs\u2019 assets. However, under FCRA and in accordance with  OMB Circular No. A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the  Budget, if an agency were to plan to sell loan assets, the cash flows  developed to estimate subsidy costs would include assumptions related  to expected sale proceeds, which could be based on market information.", "Financial institution  Percentage of loan  portfolio measured  at GAAP fair value  2%  2%  2%  1%  1%  As of the end of 2013, the five largest (based  on total assets) domestic private-sector  financial institutions used GAAP fair value for  approximately 2 percent or less of their loan  portfolios and these fair values were classified  as level 2 or level 3.", "GAO believes the current FCRA methodology is more appropriate to  estimate credit program subsidy costs for the budget. The construction,  use, and interpretation of the federal budget as a system of primarily cash  accounts have been the norm for decades. Subsidy cost estimates  prepared under the fair value approach would not be consistent with  federal budgeting practices of recognizing expected cash outlays.  Further, the application of the fair value approach to only credit programs,  the loss in transparency and in the ability to verify the noncash cost, and  significant implementation issues argue against change from the FCRA  approach. In addition, to the extent that agencies were consistently  underestimating subsidy costs under FCRA, this kind of bias would be  more appropriately addressed through improvements in the subsidy  estimation process, rather than application of the fair value approach.  However, based on our analyses of reestimate data for the fiscal years  2001 through 2014 cohorts, we did not identify any consistent trends in  overall under- or overestimates of subsidy costs across federal credit  programs government-wide. Although the fair value approach may be  useful to decision makers for evaluating the costs against the benefits of  federal credit programs in that it accounts for market risks beyond those  risks already recognized under FCRA, and the provision of this type of  information is consistent with OMB\u2019s guidance in OMB Circular No. A-129  requiring biennial reviews of credit programs, it is not appropriate for use  in estimating credit subsidy costs for the budget."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CBO and OMB for their review and  comment.

We chose loan cohorts beginning in fiscal year 2001 to  ensure that our analysis covered a full business cycle. Reestimate data  were obtained from the President\u2019s Budgets for fiscal years 2003 through  2016. Specifically, we used tables 7 and 8 reestimate data from the  Federal Credit Supplement (FCS) to the Budget of the U.S. Government  for fiscal years 2003 through 2016. The FCS for fiscal year 2003 is the  first year in which data for the fiscal year 2001 cohorts were reported.  Because of the 2-year lag between the timing of the loan cohort  disbursement and the reporting in the FCS, the fiscal year 2014 cohort of  direct loans and loan guarantees (from the fiscal year 2016 FCS) is the  most recent cohort in our data.", "The reestimate data were in spreadsheets that reproduce the data as  they appear in the FCS.

We found that some names were  reported differently over time. For example, the risk category Farm  Storage Facility Loan Program reported in the fiscal year 2003 to 2008  FCSs is the same as the risk category Farm Storage Facility Loans  reported in the fiscal year 2009 to 2016 FCSs. In another example, the  Indian Land Acquisition risk category, reported in fiscal year 2003 to 2008  FCSs, was called Indian Tribe Land Acquisition in subsequent years\u2019  FCSs. In cases such as these, we standardized the program names to  facilitate our analysis of credit programs over time.

Our analysis focused on lifetime  reestimate amounts, annual reestimate amounts, and a comparison of  most recently reported reestimated and original subsidy rates for each  program. For each year of the FCS, we calculated program-level lifetime  reestimate amounts as the sum of the lifetime reestimate amounts  reported for each cohort in the program. We examined the direction of the  most recent lifetime reestimate amounts by purpose and by agency. We  identified programs with relatively large lifetime reestimate amounts and  examined their influence on upward and downward reestimates  government-wide.

Instead, all reestimates were combined and reported with the  most recent cohort. We also noted some discrepancies between the  lifetime reestimate amount reported for each cohort and the running total  of the annual reestimate amounts that had been reported since the cohort  of direct loans or loan guarantees was first disbursed.

Generally, most proponents of the fair value approach whom we  interviewed suggested that private market information could be used to  determine the risk premium. If the type of federal lending has a close  counterpart in private credit markets, the difficulty of this task is reduced,  but not eliminated. However, most proponents of the FCRA methodology  suggested that it would be difficult to find a private market comparable for  federal credit programs because the federal government tends to  intervene in either inefficient or nonexistent markets. In the absence of a  private market comparable, the analytical task of arriving at an  appropriate aggregate risk premium would be significant and subjective.  Moreover, even when a market comparable exists, the task of extracting  the aggregate risk premium from the difference between the default-free  Treasury interest rate and the observed market rate would be subjective.  This complication arises because some of the costs and risks that may be  compensated in the market rate might be significant to an individual  investor but not relevant to the federal government, such as a more or  less favorable tax treatment or liquidity. Overall, the experts we  interviewed could not provide clear insight into how aggregate risk  premium applicable to the federal government could be extracted from  the market rate.

Under the fair value approach,  discount rates would be derived from a market comparable, if available,  and each agency could use different methodologies to determine the  aggregate risk premium. Of the experts we interviewed, proponents of the  FCRA methodology generally believed that because of the addition of the  risk premium in the fair value approach discount rate, fair value approach  estimates would be more subjective than FCRA estimates, in part  because more assumptions would be involved. Some proponents of the  fair value approach, on the other hand, believed that fair value approach  cost estimates would be as, or less, subjective than FCRA estimates  because market information would inform the cost estimates. If the fair  value approach resulted in more subjective estimates, this could create a  wider variety of estimates, reducing transparency and consistency across  programs. This inconsistency would be even greater if each agency  estimating subsidy costs used a different methodology to determine the  aggregate risk premium applicable to a program. Some experts we  interviewed suggested, however, that the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) or the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) should be  responsible for developing the fair value approach aggregate risk  premium to add on to the discount rate for each credit program, which  could reduce inconsistencies.

Some experts stated that the resources used to implement the fair value  approach would be better used by agencies to either (1) improve their  estimates of expected cash flows used in both the FCRA or fair value  approach subsidy cost estimates or (2) gain a more thorough  understanding of, and reporting on, the benefits of credit programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Locking the Discount Rate", "paragraphs": ["Under FCRA, the discount rate is locked\u2014meaning that the discount rate  is determined and cannot be changed\u2014after a cohort of loans is  substantially disbursed. This helps ensure that the reasons for  reestimates are limited to changes in estimation methodologies or actual  loan performance, rather than fluctuations in interest rates, which are  outside the control of agencies. Based on our interviews, there were  differing views as to whether the discount rate should be locked or should  fluctuate under the fair value approach. Under the fair value approach, if  the discount rate was allowed to fluctuate, reestimates could fluctuate  significantly year to year based on the market. This volatility in the  reestimates would be caused by market conditions, which are outside the  control of agencies. In addition, it would be more difficult to determine  whether reestimates were due to estimates of expected cash flows that  differed from actual loan performance or changes in the aggregate risk  premium. Under the fair value approach, the accuracy of the estimate of  the aggregate risk premium cannot be objectively assessed. For example,  under FCRA agencies perform comparisons of estimated and actual loan  performance to assess the estimation process. Because the aggregate  risk premium reflects a noncash cost, there is no method that can be  used to verify the reasonableness of the aggregate risk premium  estimate. In addition, updating the risk premium increases the  administrative activities and would require additional resources.  Conversely, under the fair value approach if the discount rate were locked  in order to avoid this volatility in the reestimates and to reduce workload  burdens, then the resulting reestimates would be based on out-of-date  risk information. The financial accounting for credit programs currently  mirrors FCRA and budgetary accounting. If the financial accounting were  to be revised to incorporate any changes to implement fair value  approach subsidy cost estimates for the budget, then not updating the  aggregate risk premium would result in cost estimates based on  noncurrent risks.

Auditing credit program  balances as part of an agency\u2019s financial statement audit includes  determining whether direct loans and loan guarantees outstanding are  properly reported in the agency\u2019s financial statements and footnotes. This  auditing goal would not change if the fair value approach were adopted  for financial reporting purposes. One expert noted that with the fair value  approach, external auditors would need to focus on assessing whether  agencies have identified an appropriate private market comparable to  identify the aggregate risk premium, or if the agency claims there was no  market comparable, the auditor will need to verify the reasonableness of  that claim. Under the fair value approach, each agency could identify its  own methodologies to identify a private market comparable and to derive  the aggregate risk premium to add to the discount rate for a particular  program. However, the current cash budgeting process allows federal  credit program officials and auditors to see the outflows and inflows of  accounts and permits the comparison of actual cash flows to estimated  cash flows with the goal of verifying the reasonableness of subsidy cost  estimates and improving estimates going forward. With the fair value  approach, there would be no mechanism to verify the reasonableness of  the aggregate risk premium because it does not correlate to any cash  flow of the program.

Social costs do not produce fiscal effects insofar as they are  not cash receipts or disbursements from Treasury. Some proponents of  the FCRA methodology referred to this as a phantom cost, which could  cause swings in the federal deficit depending on how the social cost is  cleared from the financing account. This could (1) occur immediately after  the loans are disbursed, (2) be amortized over the life of the loan cohort  through the reestimate process, or (3) be cleared by a closing reestimate  after the entire loan cohort was repaid. To avoid misrepresenting the  fiscal effect on the federal deficit, the social cost in the financing account  would have to be liquidated by means of an offsetting \u201cphantom\u201d receipt  immediately after the loans are disbursed. If the social cost is amortized  over the life of a cohort or cleared at the end of the cohort, this would be  reflected in downward reestimates for programs.

If the  financing account interest rate is based on the FCRA discount rate, then  recording the annual interest income and expense on the financing  account helps to amortize the additional amount in the financing account  that represents the noncash social cost. If the interest rate includes the  aggregate risk premium, this would in essence monetize the social cost  but would result in interest payments between agencies and Treasury to  be based on rates not tied to Treasury borrowing costs. Based on our  interviews, most experts did not have a conclusive answer or did not  provide an answer as to what the financing account interest rate should  be under the fair value approach.

For programs with these types of requirements,  agencies estimate expected loan performance cash flows and then  determine fees that are necessary to generate the required subsidy rate.  Under the fair value approach, while the expected loan performance cash  flows would be the same, because the discount rate includes the  aggregate risk premium, the cost appears higher. As a result, agencies  would need to charge borrowers higher fees to cover the initially  estimated noncash social costs of a program. However, these noncash  social costs would then be offset, or cleared, during the reestimate  process, meaning that borrowers would be charged more than is needed  to cover the initially estimated cash costs of the program. These higher  fees could affect borrower demand for the credit program. The experts we  interviewed stated that this was a congressional decision on how fees  should be charged.
