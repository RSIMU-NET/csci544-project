This report examines, among other things, (1) the extent of and reasons for such suspensions and (2) the approach BLM uses to monitor the status of lease suspensions. GAO analyzed all data on suspensions in a BLM database and the official lease files for a nongeneralizable sample of 48 leases recorded as suspended in, Montana and Wyoming, which GAO selected based in part on the large number of suspensions these states had.

During a suspension, the government generally does not collect revenues from the lease. Determining the reasons for suspensions is difficult, in part because BLM does not require the inclusion of this information in its database. To obtain this information, BLM officials would have to review the official lease files, of which many are in hard copy. Under Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government , management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. BLM field officials GAO interviewed said that additional, more detailed information in the database on reasons for suspensions would be helpful in tracking lease suspensions. By including a data field in the database to record the reasons for suspensions, BLM could better ensure that federal lands are not being inappropriately kept from development\u2014potentially foregoing revenue\u2014or from other valuable uses of public lands.", "The approach BLM uses to monitor lease suspensions does not ensure consistent and effective oversight because BLM does not have procedures in place for monitoring. BLM state offices generally delegate responsibility for monitoring lease suspensions to their field offices. Officials from 12 selected field offices in two states with relatively large numbers of lease suspensions reported various frequencies in their monitoring of suspensions, ranging from every few months to rarely or not at all. In the absence of BLM monitoring procedures, field officials have discretion in how and when to monitor. By developing procedures for monitoring lease suspensions, including when to conduct monitoring efforts, BLM could better ensure that lease suspensions in effect are warranted."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure that federal lands are not being inappropriately kept from development, GAO is making four recommendations, including that BLM record the reasons for lease suspensions in its database and develop procedures for monitoring suspensions.

Under the terms of these leases,  operators have 10 years to begin drilling for oil and gas unless BLM  suspends their leases. BLM may suspend leases, for example, when an  environmental review is necessary to avoid harm to endangered species  on the leased lands or during periods of extraordinary weather conditions,  such as hurricanes or other natural catastrophes. Suspensions typically  remain in effect until the conditions that led to the suspensions no longer  apply. There is no limit on how long a lease can be suspended.

We also interviewed BLM officials about how they use these criteria. To  examine the extent of oil and gas lease suspensions and the reasons for  the suspensions, we analyzed data on all lease suspensions recorded in  BLM\u2019s LR2000 database as of September 30, 2016. We took a number  of steps to assess the reliability of these data\u2014such as checking the  extent to which the data were complete and within expected ranges and  interviewing BLM officials about how the data were collected\u2014and  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to give a high-level  summary of suspension information, such as the number of leases in  suspension and the lengths of the suspensions (see app. I for additional  detail).", "We also analyzed information contained in the official lease files,  maintained by BLM state offices, for a nongeneralizable sample of leases  in suspension in Montana and Wyoming to identify the reasons behind  the suspensions as well as to assess their status. We chose these states  because they were among the states with the largest numbers of  recorded lease suspensions. We also selected Montana because their  files were electronically maintained and easily accessible and Wyoming  because it had some leases recorded as suspended for the longest  period of time of any state as of September 30, 2016. We selected 48  suspended leases in these two states and limited the extent to which we  selected multiple leases that were suspended at the same time for the  same reason. For Montana leases, we found that there were only 12  suspension dates. Therefore, we randomly selected a single lease from  each date. For Wyoming, we selected leases based on a combination of  suspension date, similarity of lease numbers, and field office of  jurisdiction. In addition, to review suspensions that had been in effect for  a relatively long period of time, we selected suspensions that had been in  effect for 20 or more years. The results of our review of selected leases  are not generalizable to other BLM leases in suspension but provide  examples of the types of reasons given for suspensions.", "To verify the status of each selected lease, we compared information in  LR2000 and the official lease file with information in the Office of Natural  Resources Revenue\u2019s database. We also interviewed officials from the  BLM state and field offices in our sample about specific lease files to  learn more about the status of specific lease suspensions and the  reasons why these suspensions were still in effect. We compared how  BLM maintains and verifies its lease suspension information with  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government for information  and communication. To examine the approach BLM uses to monitor the  status of lease suspensions and the extent to which this approach  provides for oversight of such lease suspensions, we reviewed agency  databases and documents, including information in LR2000 and selected  lease files from the Montana and Wyoming state offices. These two state  offices comprised a total of 12 field offices that were responsible for  monitoring the 48 suspended leases in our sample.

BLM offers  leases through a competitive bidding process and requires a uniform  national minimum bid of $2 per acre, due as a one-time payment when a  bidder is awarded the lease. If BLM receives any bids on an offered  lease, the lease is awarded to the bidder with the highest bid. Since  1992, BLM has offered leases with a 10-year primary term\u2014the initial  period of time prescribed in a lease to begin oil and gas development.  Operators generally begin oil and gas exploration on leased lands by  analyzing available geologic and seismic information and other testing to  determine if economically viable oil and gas reservoirs exist. If the  findings are positive, the operators may begin efforts to prepare for  development, such as completing the environmental studies required to  apply for permits to begin lease development activities. For example,  operators holding leases for oil and gas development must submit a  drilling permit application to BLM and obtain approval before preparing  the land and drilling new oil or gas wells. After receiving a permit  application, BLM generally communicates with operators until they  provide all of the required documents, including necessary environmental  information or studies. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires BLM to  approve or defer permit applications within 30 days of submission by the  operator. After such applications are approved, operators may begin  development activities, including building roads to the well site,  constructing platforms, drilling wells, and constructing additional pipeline  transportation necessary to transport the oil and gas to market.", "BLM has the authority to inspect federal oil and gas sites, including well  pads and production facilities, under the Federal Oil and Gas Royalty  Management Act of 1982, as amended.

A suspension of operations and  production\u2014the most common type of suspension, according to BLM  officials\u2014is broader because it halts both operations and any production  of oil and gas.

During either type of suspension, the time remaining in the primary term  of the lease is reserved until the suspension is terminated, so that the  operator is not penalized for the time the lease is in suspension.", "According to BLM officials, lease suspensions typically are initiated by the  operator but may also be initiated by BLM. BLM guidance states that  before an operator can request a suspension, the operator must first  demonstrate being hampered in performing some operation or activity on  the lease. The operator must submit thorough documentation of the  reason for requesting a suspension and should include evidence that  activity has been attempted on the lease, such as filing an application for  a drilling permit, and that the activity has been prevented by actions  beyond the operator\u2019s control. For BLM\u2019s part, according to BLM\u2019s  guidance, requests filed less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the  lease are considered late and should normally be denied. If a request is  filed in a timely manner, BLM is to assess the request and, if the reasons  for the request are acceptable and justify a suspension, BLM should  approve the request, according to BLM guidance. The state director at  each BLM state office is responsible for reviewing and approving requests  for lease suspensions; however, BLM\u2019s guidance encourages the  delegation of this responsibility to the field manager at the field office with  jurisdiction over the lease.

The state director then has 10 days to render a  decision. If the state director denies the request for suspension, the operator can challenge the decision at the Interior Board of Land  Appeals. After the board\u2019s decision, the operator may make additional  appeals in federal court. In cases in which a decision is overturned, the  state office is to issue a decision letter to the operator that highlights  changes in the lease\u2019s terms and conditions. The state office is to record  the new terms and conditions in LR2000, notify the Office of Natural  Resources Revenue of any rental or royalty payments that are to be  deferred, and update the official lease file in the state office.

For instance, they said  suspensions that involve seasonal protection of wildlife habitat, which can  last for several months, typically require relatively little monitoring  because the time frames for these suspensions are more clearly defined.  In contrast, suspensions involving environmental reviews often require  more frequent monitoring because the time frames associated with these  suspensions are less definitive and can range from several months to  several years. Several of these officials said that their offices have  established prompts to alert staff when to conduct monitoring activities.  For example, an official from 1 field office told us the office\u2019s staff use  handwritten notes to track their lease suspensions. An official from  another field office informed us that their office uses an electronic  calendar feature to alert staff when to monitor, and several other field  office officials reported that they rely on various spreadsheets and emails  to remind them when to monitor.

These  officials said they generally rely on petroleum engineers in their  respective offices to monitor lease suspensions because these individuals  are normally the most familiar with leases. However, some officials  added that staffing limitations, particularly a shortage in petroleum  engineers, have hindered their ability to monitor lease suspensions in a  timely manner. Several of the field officials we interviewed noted that, in  recent years, they have had to rely on other staff or petroleum engineers  who were on loan from other field offices because their offices did not  have a petroleum engineer on staff. According to two field officials we  interviewed, while assistance from other field offices is needed and  appreciated, there is invariably a lack of consistency in the knowledge  that engineers from other offices have about the lease sites involved.  Field officials also said that there have been instances in which petroleum  engineers left the agency for the private sector, resulting in a loss of  institutional knowledge about certain leases, possibly contributing to  lapses in follow-up on particular leases. Officials from offices that rarely or  never conduct monitoring also cited problems with staff availability. We  reported on human capital challenges at BLM, specifically in hiring and  retaining petroleum engineers, in March 2010. We also noted BLM\u2019s  human capital constraints in our High-Risk Series update report in  February 2011, and we reported on human capital issues at BLM in  January 2014 and September 2016. In several of these reports, we  recommended that BLM take a number of actions, including using  existing authorities and incentives to improve staff retention. BLM  generally agreed with these recommendations and has taken action on  some, but not all, of these recommendations.", "Nonetheless, the extent of variability we found, including 3 field offices  that monitor rarely or not at all, indicates that allowing individual field  offices to determine when to monitor suspensions may not ensure that  monitoring takes place. Under Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, management should design control activities, such  as procedures, to ensure the objectives of the program are achieved.  The Office of Management and Budget has also acknowledged the  importance of internal guidance documents to channel the discretion of  employees, increase efficiency, and enhance the fair treatment of  similarly situated parties. Some field officials we interviewed said that  procedures to help guide them on monitoring could be beneficial and  provide a level of consistency. By developing procedures for monitoring  lease suspensions, including when to conduct monitoring efforts, BLM  could promote more consistent monitoring to better ensure that lease  suspensions in effect are warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BLM State Offices and Headquarters Generally Do Not Oversee Field Office Monitoring of Lease Suspensions and Do Not Always Have Current or Complete Information on Suspensions", "paragraphs": ["Officials from BLM\u2019s state offices told us that they do not oversee field  office monitoring of suspensions, and we found that they did not always  have current or complete information on suspensions. We found that  more than three-quarters of the official lease files in BLM state offices we  reviewed contained outdated documentation regarding the status of lease  suspensions. Specifically, files for 37 of the 48 lease suspensions we  reviewed did not contain updated information on whether the lease  suspension had been monitored or reviewed since the suspension was  initially issued. For example, we reviewed a lease file for a suspension  issued in 1949 for economic reasons, but the file only contained information on the suspension issuance and not whether monitoring  occurred to assess the economic conditions associated with the lease.  Additionally, we discovered that some official lease files were not  complete and did not have certain required information, such as letters  issuing the suspension. For example, three of the lease files we reviewed  were missing required information. We could not verify the reasons these  leases were suspended, their current status, or any information  concerning monitoring efforts associated with them. Field officials we  interviewed did not have any information on these suspensions and said  that they may have been initiated by the state office more than 30 years  ago. However, BLM state officials were unable to confirm or deny this.  For another lease, there was no lease file. Officials in BLM headquarters  and state offices said that there is no requirement for them to oversee the  field offices\u2019 monitoring activities. However, they said that performing  such oversight could help to ensure effective and consistent monitoring of  lease suspensions.", "We also identified some instances in LR2000 where data on suspensions  were not up to date. Specifically, 7 of the 48 leases we reviewed were  recorded in LR2000 as suspended, but information we received from  agency officials indicated that the suspensions were no longer warranted.  We later confirmed with state and field officials that none of the 7  suspensions remained in effect. Five of these 7 leases were recorded as  being in suspension for 22 years or more for what appeared to be short- term reasons, such as weather-related issues or economic conditions.  One Wyoming suspension, for instance, was granted in 1990 because of  low oil prices at the time, which made repairing wells uneconomical.  While this lease was still recorded as suspended in LR2000 as of  September 2016, a termination letter in the lease file indicated that the  suspension was terminated in 1991. In another example, a lease was  listed in the official lease file as suspended for 3 years because of delays  in processing a drilling permit application. When we followed up with field  officials about the lease, they informed us that the suspension should  have been terminated years ago; however, we found no termination letter  in the official lease file maintained by the state office. Field officials  speculated that the letter may not have been sent because the case  manager had retired and no one in the field office knew to follow up on  the lease. Because field officials informed us that these leases were no  longer suspended, we confirmed with officials from Interior\u2019s Office of  Natural Resources Revenue that payments were being appropriately  collected for these 7 leases.", "Moreover, these data are not available in a standardized report that could  be used to help oversee monitoring, such as a report showing the  average length or frequency of suspensions. BLM produces standardized  reports from LR2000 for other aspects of oil and gas leases, such as  when leases have been issued or are set to expire. BLM officials said that  a standardized report for lease suspensions could assist headquarters  and state officials in conducting oversight of field offices\u2019 monitoring  efforts.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should design control activities, such as conducting top- level reviews of actual performance, to ensure the objectives of the  program are being achieved. By requiring that management, particularly  cognizant headquarters and state office officials, conduct top-level  reviews of field offices\u2019 monitoring efforts, as well as top-level reviews of  official lease files and databases, BLM could better ensure that lease  suspensions in effect continue to be warranted and that information on  suspensions is current and complete. Additionally, federal standards for  internal control state that management should design control activities,  such as developing mechanisms that enforce management\u2019s directives,  to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives and address related risks.

Over the past several years,  BLM has worked to improve the quality of the data in LR2000, including  data related to oil and gas lease suspensions. These efforts have helped  to improve the accuracy of certain data, but they do not address some constraints of LR2000. In particular, LR2000 does not contain a data field  for recording the reasons for suspensions. BLM officials told us that they  will upgrade or replace LR2000 in the near future. By including a data  field in the update or replacement for LR2000 to record the reasons for  suspensions, BLM could better ensure that federal lands are not being  inappropriately kept from development\u2014potentially foregoing revenue\u2014 or from other valuable uses of public lands.", "BLM\u2019s ability to effectively manage the program also depends on the  establishment of effective internal controls.

Specifically,  we reviewed BLM\u2019s statutory requirements for granting a lease  suspension. We also reviewed BLM\u2019s guidance for reviewing suspension  requests\u2014Suspensions of Operations and/or Production Manual\u2013\u2013which  outlines the process and criteria BLM uses to approve or deny a lease  suspension request as well as the process for appealing a suspension  decision. We interviewed BLM officials at headquarters, as well as state  and field offices responsible for leases in our review, about how they  apply these criteria when assessing suspension requests. We also  interviewed representatives from the Interior Board of Land Appeals  about suspension decisions that are appealed to the board, how these  appeals are handled, board decisions that are subsequently appealed,  and the process involved with those appeals.", "To examine the extent of oil and gas lease suspensions and the reasons  for the suspensions of selected leases, we analyzed data on lease  suspensions from BLM\u2019s Legacy Rehost 2000 System (LR2000)  database as of September 30, 2016. We took a number of steps to  assess the reliability of suspension data and related fields in LR2000.  Specifically, we performed electronic tests to check the extent to which  data were complete and within expected ranges. Testing included  comparison of data extractions prepared by BLM officials for us against  data we downloaded directly from LR2000. We also interviewed BLM  officials responsible for managing the system about how data are  collected and entered into the system as well as the steps the officials  take to help ensure that the data are accurate and complete. We also  clarified discrepancies regarding lease suspension data with these  officials when necessary. We determined the data were sufficiently  reliable to give a high-level summary on suspensions, including  information on the number and location of leases, the number in  suspension, and suspension length.", "LR2000 contains information on activities related to an oil and gas lease\u2019s  status, among other things. For each lease, we identified the latest  record, if any, for actions in fiscal year 2016 and earlier that indicate  suspension initiation or termination. We determined that a lease was in  suspension if the most recent action related to a suspension indicated  that the suspension was initiated. We determined the length of  suspension based on the date of that initiation record. We then  determined distributions of the numbers of leases recorded as still in  suspension in each state as of the end of fiscal year 2016.", "We also reviewed the official lease files, maintained by BLM state offices,  for a nongeneralizable sample of leases recorded as suspended as of  September 30, 2016, in Montana and Wyoming to assess their status and  the reasons behind the suspensions. We chose these two states because  they were among the states with the largest numbers of suspended  leases. Montana\u2019s official lease files were electronically maintained and  easily accessible, while Wyoming, which had leases recorded as  suspended for the longest period of time as of September 30, 2016,  maintained hard copy official lease files. Montana and Wyoming  collectively represent about 50 percent of all oil and gas leases recorded  as suspended. We used the following approaches to select a sample of  48 suspended leases in these states and limited the extent to which we  selected multiple leases that were suspended at the same time for the  same reason.", "For Montana leases, we found that only 12 suspension initiation dates  were recorded for the leases in suspension as of the end of fiscal year  2016. We therefore randomly selected for review a single lease from  those suspended on each of these dates. For Wyoming, the suspension  initiation dates were much more dispersed, so we identified groups of 15  or more leases based on a combination of suspension date, similarity of  lease numbers, and the field office of jurisdiction. From these groups, we  selected 19 suspended leases\u2014each lease was the lease with largest  acreage from each field office within its group. There were a number of  leases that did not fit into these groups because there were fewer than 15  suspensions on a given date with similar lease numbers, so we selected  a single lease file with the largest acreage from each year that was at  least 20 years old. This allowed us to review suspensions that have been  in effect for a relatively long period of time. This approach resulted in our  selection of an additional 17 suspended leases in Wyoming. While our  review of suspended lease files is not generalizable to other BLM lease  suspensions, our findings provide examples of types of reasons that are  cited for lease suspensions.", "To verify the status of each selected lease, we compared information in  LR2000 and the official lease file to information in the Offices of Natural  Resources Revenue\u2019s database. The Office of Natural Resources  Revenue, within the Department of the Interior, is responsible for  collecting rental and royalty payments associated with oil and gas leases.  We also interviewed the BLM state and field office officials responsible for  the specific lease files we reviewed to obtain additional information about  the status of certain lease suspensions and the reasons these  suspensions remained in effect. We compared how BLM maintains and  verifies its lease suspension information with Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government for information and communication.", "To examine the approach BLM uses to monitor the status of lease  suspensions and the extent to which the approach provides for oversight,  we reviewed agency data, guidance and requirements, and official lease  documents. In particular, we reviewed monitoring information in LR2000,  BLM\u2019s Suspensions of Operations and/or Production Manual, and  monitoring information in the official lease files for our sample of 48  leases recorded as being in suspension as of September 30, 2016.
