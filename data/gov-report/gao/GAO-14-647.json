Passengers who, through the redress process, are determined to have been misidentified to a TSDB-based high-risk list are added to the TSA Cleared List, which allows them to be cleared (not identified as high risk) nearly 100 percent of time. The DHS TRIP process also allows passengers determined to have been improperly included on a TSDB-based list (mislisted) to be removed, minimizing the likelihood they will be identified as matches during future travels.

We  assessed these documents against Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government. To clarify our understanding of Secure Flight\u2019s  privacy requirements and the mechanisms for monitoring compliance with  these requirements, we reviewed key TSA documents that provide  information on Secure Flight privacy requirements, such as management  directives, the Secure Flight Privacy Rules of Behavior, and Secure Flight  System of Records Notices and Privacy Impact Assessments, and  interviewed Secure Flight privacy officials and a representative of the  contract staff who are responsible for monitoring compliance with these  requirements.", "To answer our second question, we reviewed DHS TRIP standard  operating procedures and other documentation related to the redress  process, such as the standard letters DHS sends to redress applicants.  To identify the outcomes of the DHS TRIP redress process, we reviewed  relevant DHS TRIP data for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 on the  number of travelers who applied for redress and the number of redress  cases DHS TRIP forwarded to the Terrorist Screening Center (TSC)\u2014a  multi-agency organization administered by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI)\u2014for review. We also reviewed TSC data on the extent  to which redress applications resulted in individuals being delisted from  certain watchlists, meaning that they were removed from a watchlist  because TSC determined that they did not meet current criteria for  inclusion on that watchlist. To determine the extent to which DHS TRIP is  meeting performance goals for the redress process, we reviewed DHS  TRIP performance data. Additionally, to determine the extent to which  DHS TRIP is meeting its performance goal for processing appeals cases,  we calculated the average processing time for 49 closed appeals cases  DHS TRIP received during fiscal years 2011 through 2013, using DHS  TRIP data, and compared this average with the goal. To assess the  reliability of DHS TRIP redress and appeals data, we examined  documentation about these data, interviewed knowledgeable officials, and  reviewed the data for obvious errors and inconsistencies. To further  assess the reliability of the appeals data used to calculate average  processing times, we compared the DHS TRIP data with data on appeals  cases maintained by TSC, which reviews and makes recommendations  on appeals, and followed up on any discrepancies.

We also reported that TSA had designated a program privacy officer and  a team of privacy experts to work on various aspects of the Secure Flight  program, and planned to establish several privacy oversight mechanisms,  including the following: privacy rules of behavior, which require that individuals handling PII  use it only for a stated purpose; audit logs of system and user events to provide oversight of system  activities, such as access to PII and transfer of PII into or out of the  system; general privacy training for all Secure Flight staff and role-based  privacy training for employees handling PII; periodic privacy compliance reports, intended to track and aggregate  privacy concerns or incidents; and a system for tracking privacy issues that arise throughout the  development and use of Secure Flight, and conducting follow-up  analysis of significant privacy issues and providing resolution  strategies for management consideration.", "Since our May 2009 report, TSA has made progress in implementing  some of these privacy oversight mechanisms, although more work  remains to fully implement them. Overall, the Secure Flight privacy team,  composed of TSA\u2019s Privacy Officer, the designated Secure Flight  program privacy officer, TSA\u2019s Office of the Chief Counsel, and dedicated  contract staff, has worked closely with the DHS Privacy Office to ensure  periodic consultation on program plans and operations that may have  privacy implications. The publication of revised PIAs and SORNs to  address the changes in the Secure Flight program, such as the use of  rules-based high-risk lists and TSA Pre\uf0fc TM risk assessments, is evidence  of this consultation process. TSA issued Secure Flight Privacy Rules of  Behavior in September 2008 that set forth the practices staff (including  federal employees, contractors, and other persons authorized to access  or use SFPD) should follow in accessing, using, maintaining or collecting  Secure Flight PII. According to TSA officials, in 2013, TSA initiated a  review of the rules of behavior to ensure that they still align with current  Secure Flight directives and practices, which have changed since the  rules of behavior were first issued in 2008. In May 2014, TSA officials  stated that they are in the final stages of developing an updated version  of the Privacy Rules of Behavior. In December 2013, TSA also issued a  management directive discussing TSA\u2019s policy for responding to requests  for Secure Flight data by TSA employees and other agencies. Secure  Flight also maintains audit logs of Secure Flight system and user events,  as it planned to do in 2009. Specifically, TSA maintains logs of  successful and unsuccessful log in attempts to access the component  of Secure Flight that allows carriers to submit passenger information  via the Internet, known as eSecure Flight;  the Secure Flight User Interface, which is the system Secure Flight  analysts use to retrieve passenger data and review potential matches;  and  requests to access the Report Management System, which generates  reports on Secure Flight activities.", "According to Secure Flight privacy officials, the TSA Security Operations  Center monitors these logs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Officials  stated that these logs allow TSA to be aware of any attempts to gain  unauthorized access to the system and can be used to make adjustments  in access controls, should they be needed, in response to identified  threats.", "TSA has also implemented privacy training for new Secure Flight staff  and documented privacy issues and decisions through, for example,  periodic compliance privacy reports. However, additional actions could  allow TSA to sustain and strengthen its efforts to ensure compliance with  Secure Flight privacy requirements.", "Privacy training for Secure Flight staff: TSA has developed and  implemented basic and advanced privacy training that, according to TSA  officials, is required for all new Secure Flight staff. In addition, all DHS  staff are required to complete annual DHS privacy training, which  discusses the importance of safeguarding PII. However, Secure Flight  staff do not receive job-specific privacy refresher training after they  complete the initial Secure Flight training. OMB requires agencies to train  employees on their privacy and security responsibilities before permitting  access to agency information and information systems, and thereafter to  provide at least annual refresher training to ensure employees continue to   The OMB memorandum also states  understand their responsibilities.that this refresher training must be job-specific and commensurate with  the employee\u2019s responsibilities. TSA officials stated that the annual DHS  privacy training serves as refresher training for Secure Flight staff.  However, DHS\u2019s annual refresher training is not job-specific and does not  reflect the unique privacy requirements of the Secure Flight program. For  example, the DHS training provides a general overview of privacy  requirements Department-wide, but does not provide information on the  unique privacy risks of the Secure Flight program, such as the potential  misuse or unauthorized disclosure of airline passenger data.  Furthermore, the Secure Flight program has expanded from a program  that solely identifies high-risk passengers on the No Fly and Selectee  Lists to one that also identifies additional high-risk passengers using other  records in the TSDB and through rules-based high-risk lists, as well as  low-risk passengers. TSA\u2019s PIAs for these new screening activities  discuss new privacy risks unique to these activities. For example, Secure  Flight\u2019s September 2013 PIA update discusses the importance of  restricting the use and dissemination of TSA Pre\uf0fcTM lists in order to  mitigate the risk associated with collecting and storing information on low- risk travelers. TSA officials told us that TSA updated its privacy training  for new Secure Flight staff in December 2013 to reflect Secure Flight\u2019s  updated PIAs and SORNs. However, because the DHS privacy refresher  training is not job-specific, staff who joined Secure Flight prior to  December 2013, when TSA updated its privacy training for new staff, may  not have received privacy training specific to Secure Flight\u2019s new  screening activities. Our assessment guide for reviewing training and  development efforts in the federal government states that changes, such  as new initiatives, technological innovations, or reorganizations and  restructuring, will likely require agencies to develop new or revised  training programs, and that agencies should have a formal process for  incorporating these strategic and tactical changes to ensure that new and  revised training efforts are quickly brought on line. Providing at least  annual job-specific privacy refresher training, consistent with OMB  requirements, could further strengthen Secure Flight\u2019s protection of PII.", "Documenting privacy issues: TSA documents some aspects of its  privacy oversight mechanisms, such as scheduled destructions of SFPD  and reviews of planned changes to the Secure Flight system. However,  TSA does not have a mechanism to comprehensively document and track  key privacy-related issues and decisions that arise through the  development and use of Secure Flight\u2014a mechanism TSA planned to  develop when Secure Flight was implemented in 2009.", "First, TSA prepares purge reports to document the monthly destruction of  SFPD in accordance with Secure Flight\u2019s data retention schedule. We  requested and reviewed documentation for the 14-month period from  April 2012 through May 2013. The documentation showed that TSA  consistently purged passenger records in accordance with its retention  schedule, with the exception of a 2-month period.", "Second, Secure Flight privacy staff members prepare privacy compliance  validation reports to document privacy concerns or issues that are raised  by staff in the software development process. According to Secure Flight  officials, a proposed change to the Secure Flight system cannot be  implemented until the privacy team completes a compliance validation  report, which includes a summary of privacy findings, conclusions, and  recommendations for corrective measures. For example, two of the eight  reports we reviewed for the period from April 2012 through April 2013  identified a potential privacy issue in Secure Flight\u2019s plans to conduct TSA  Pre\uf0fcTM risk assessments. Specifically, the March and April 2013 reports  stated that Secure Flight should not begin conducting these assessments  until the new PIA and SORN were approved.", "Last, Secure Flight privacy staff also maintain a set of notes regarding  some privacy issues or privacy-related tasks.

Secure Flight privacy officials stated that TSA did not intend for the  Privacy Issue Tracker to serve as the agency\u2019s system for systematically  tracking Secure Flight privacy issues and incidents.", "In the absence of a system for comprehensively documenting and  tracking privacy-related issues and decisions, TSA\u2019s Secure Flight privacy  officer stated that Secure Flight relies on its privacy contract staff to  oversee and monitor privacy protections, in consultation with the  designated Secure Flight program privacy officer and the TSA Privacy  Officer. The privacy contract staff are broadly tasked with ensuring  compliance with Secure Flight\u2019s privacy policies and requirements,  identifying privacy issues, and providing resolution strategies for  management consideration. According to TSA officials, the contract staff  accomplish this through being embedded in the day-to-day operations of  the Secure Flight program. For example, the contract staff attend  meetings in which Secure Flight software or system changes are being  discussed to ensure that the planned software update remains within the  scope of the Secure Flight program mission and that prior to deployment,  a software release has no privacy concerns or that any concerns have  been resolved or mitigated. Contract staff also issue monthly status  reports, which provide an overview of contractors\u2019 accomplishments and  planned activities. These reports refer to ongoing privacy issues, but  according to TSA officials, were not intended to consistently describe the  nature, basis, or resolution of these issues. According to TSA\u2019s Privacy  Officer and the contract staff we spoke with, the contract staff recognize  the potential for privacy issues based on their experience and  professional judgment, and raise the issues as appropriate. Officials also  stated that most privacy issues are resolved through discussions.  Additionally, the TSA Privacy Officer stated that the frequent interaction  between the contract staff, program privacy officer, and TSA Privacy  Officer creates a robust understanding of Secure Flight operations and  plans. However, it is unknown whether this ad hoc communication  between key Secure Flight privacy staff would be sustained after a  personnel change in Secure Flight\u2019s privacy team or contractor personnel,  and whether privacy-related decisions previously made would continue to  be implemented without documentation to inform new staff. Further, TSA  previously stated that it would institute a system for tracking privacy  issues that arise throughout the development and use of Secure Flight.  By institutionalizing such a mechanism, TSA would have greater  assurance that its oversight of Secure Flight privacy protections is  effective because TSA would know the extent to which privacy issues are  identified and resolved.", "DHS has established a department-wide Online Incident Handling System  to document and track information on DHS privacy incidents, which would  include incidents related to the Secure Flight program.

However,  should the Secure Flight program become aware of a privacy incident, the  TSA Privacy Officer would be required to submit a Privacy Incident  Report in the Online Incident Handling System, thereby notifying senior  DHS officials of the incident. Though these Privacy Incident Reports  would track suspected and confirmed incidents involving PII (e.g.,  unauthorized disclosure or access of PII), according to DHS officials, they  were not intended to address privacy issues that arise in the development  and use of Secure Flight when they do not rise to the level of an incident,  such as the potential privacy issues Secure Flight identified when  reviewing system changes.

The  process begins when the appellant files the appeal, and DHS TRIP  forwards all completed appeals paperwork to TSC, as shown in figure 1.  Once TSC receives the documentation, TSC analysts are to review all  derogatory information maintained on the appellant to make a written  recommendation to TSA on the appeal. TSA then reviews TSC\u2019s  recommendation through its own internal process, which can include  going back to TSC for additional information, before the TSA  Administrator makes the final determination to uphold the appellant\u2019s  status, recommend that TSC downgrade the appellant to another TSDB-based list, or recommend that TSC remove the appellant from the list.", "With respect to the redress process, DHS TRIP officials took several  steps in fiscal year 2013 to reduce the overall processing time and a  backlog of redress cases. First, in fiscal year 2013, DHS automated its  response to DHS TRIP applicants, a step that, according to DHS TRIP,  should reduce the initial response time from 3 days to 1 day. Second,  DHS hired additional staff for DHS TRIP, achieving its authorized staffing  level of 11 full-time positions. Third, in January 2013, DHS TRIP  implemented and began training staff on a new redress case  management system, the Redress Management System (RMS). As part  of the migration of the data from the prior system to RMS, DHS TRIP  administratively closed approximately 30,000 cases that were either  duplicates or incomplete because documentation was never received  from the applicant. The new system also includes reporting capabilities  that enable DHS TRIP to generate reports used to monitor its  performance in meeting its performance targets. Fourth, DHS TRIP  created and filled a DHS TRIP Operations Manager position with the  intent that this individual would increase the office\u2019s focus on developing,  analyzing, and monitoring performance metrics. According to DHS TRIP  officials, at the beginning of fiscal year 2014, DHS TRIP\u2019s average case- processing time for redress cases was about 100 days, and as of June  2014, the average case-processing time was about 42 days.", "Consistent with its efforts to reduce processing time for redress, in  January 2014, DHS TRIP reduced its target for one of the department\u2019s  key performance indicators\u2014average number of days for DHS TRIP  redress cases to be closed\u2014from 93 to 78 days."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Appeals Process", "paragraphs": ["DHS also took action in fiscal year 2013 to address timeframes  associated with the appeals process.

To  provide a more structured appeals process, DHS TRIP took the following  steps:  It created an appeals team to manage both the intelligence analysis  and the administrative aspects of appeals.  It developed and began distributing a document that provides  information on the status and, if available, outcome of each appeal  case.  It implemented a more formalized process for reviewing appeals. This  process includes distributing appeal information to TSC, TSA OIA,  and TSA\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel and conducting pre-meetings  among stakeholders, including TSA OIA, TSA\u2019s Office of Chief  Counsel, and DHS TRIP; meetings with TSA leadership; and, as  appropriate, a decision meeting with the TSA Administrator.

It developed and implemented a database to track appeals specifically  and improve process timeliness.", "Additionally, in January 2014, DHS TRIP officials stated they were  reviewing TSC\u2019s appeals standard operating procedures to identify  opportunities for the agencies to further reduce time frames. According to  DHS TRIP officials, as of May 2014, the program director had completed  a review of TSC\u2019s appeals standard operating procedures, provided  metrics on TSC\u2019s timeliness, and provided suggestions to TSC for  reducing its time frames. TSC officials also stated that they meet monthly  with DHS TRIP to discuss opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce  time frames. From fiscal year 2011\u2014the first fiscal year in which DHS  TRIP received a redress appeal\u2014through fiscal year 2013, for appeals  closed within that period, the average number of days, according to DHS  TRIP data, for TSC to review an appeal package and submit a  recommendation to TSA was about 154 days, as shown in table 2.  Therefore, TSC\u2019s review accounted for over half (154 of 276 days) of the  total review time. In addition, DHS TRIP is working to further reduce  processing times for other parts of the appeals process. Specifically,  according to DHS TRIP officials, DHS TRIP has committed to reducing  the number of meetings with TSA\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel and TSA OIA.  In addition, for those meetings that do take place, DHS TRIP officials and  TSA leadership are anticipating questions from participants that could  delay the appeal\u2019s progress through the system because they require  significant follow-up, and working to obtain the answers in advance.", "In addition, in January 2014, DHS TRIP established intermediate and  long-term performance goals for the appeals process for the first time.

TSA could further strengthen  these protections by providing job-specific privacy refresher training  consistent with OMB requirements. Furthermore, developing a  mechanism to comprehensively document and track key Secure Flight  privacy-related issues and decisions could help TSA ensure that its  oversight of privacy protections is effective and that the decisions that  have allowed it to successfully avoid privacy incidents to date are carried  into the future.
