In this report, GAO focused on Down syndrome because it is a medical condition that is associated with disabilities and occurs frequently enough to yield a sufficient population size for an analysis. GAO examined (1) what is known about the extent to which children with Down syndrome receive medical care during early childhood and (2) what resources families of children with Down syndrome receive through their health care providers and what barriers families face to using these resources. GAO analyzed fee-for-service claims data from a very large private health insurance company, for the claims representing its experience with one of the largest national employers, and Medicaid claims data from seven states with high Medicaid enrollment and low percentages of enrollees in Medicaid managed care. GAO also interviewed specialists at six prominent Down syndrome clinics and 12 advocacy groups to examine what resources families receive and to identify barriers they face.

Specifically, children with Down syndrome received, on average, five times more outpatient care (such as care in an urgent care facility) and over two times more office-based care (such as care in a physician's office) than children without Down syndrome. Overall, both groups received more office-based care than outpatient care. A key difference in the amount of care received by children with Down syndrome was the difference in the amount of therapy services, with a greater percentage of children with Down syndrome receiving physical, occupational, and speech therapy. In addition, children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of certain medical conditions and were hospitalized, on average, nearly twice as often and stayed twice as long as other children. Not surprisingly, differences were also found in medical care expenditures. The total average medical expenditures for children with Down syndrome were an average of five times higher than those for other children. However, both total expenditures and the difference in expenditures decreased substantially as the two groups of children reached 3 years of age. GAO's analysis of Medicaid claims data found similar differences between the two groups. Down syndrome advocacy groups in selected communities told GAO that families of children with Down syndrome in those communities were more likely to receive the resources recommended for the time of diagnosis than those recommended for early childhood and may face barriers to using available resources. Specifically, advocacy groups reported that families were likely to receive about two-thirds (20 of 32) of the resources that specialists at the six Down syndrome clinics recommended they receive through their health care providers at the time of diagnosis. However, families were likely to receive only about one-quarter (6 of 23) of the resources that specialists recommended they receive through their health care providers after diagnosis and throughout early childhood. In addition, advocacy groups and results from the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs indicate that families may face barriers that can prevent them from using available resources. For example, barriers such as outdated or inaccurate information could lead parents to underestimate their child's potential. Some advocacy groups reported that they and their communities have made efforts to address some of these barriers. For example, to address issues of inaccurate information, one advocacy group initiated an educational outreach program to health care professionals at area hospitals. GAO provided a draft of this report to the Department of Health and Human Services for comment. It generally agreed with GAO's findings and noted that the report provides a thorough summary of the current practices and the successes and challenges faced by children with Down syndrome and their families."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Families of children who have disabilities, such as children with Down  syndrome, may not always receive the resources necessary to address  their children\u2019s special health care needs. Down syndrome is a  chromosomal condition that is associated with a set of cognitive and  physical symptoms, and each year an estimated 1 in 733 babies is born  with the condition in the United States. Because of an increased risk of  certain medical conditions, such as congenital heart defects,  gastrointestinal problems, and thyroid disease, children with Down  syndrome need timely medical care. According to advocates and Down  syndrome specialists, early identification and treatment of health issues  result in better health and increased capabilities for these children. In  addition, families of children who have disabilities, such as children with  Down syndrome, need certain resources\u2014including information,  programs, and referrals for specialty medical care\u2014at the time of  diagnosis and as their child ages so they can effectively work with their  child\u2019s health care provider to identify and treat medical conditions early.

This act required GAO to submit a  report concerning the effectiveness of current health care and family  support programs for the families of children with disabilities. In this  report, we focused on Down syndrome because it is the most commonly  occurring chromosomal condition at birth and, therefore, occurs  frequently enough to yield a sufficient population size for an analysis.  Moreover, physicians with experience treating children with Down  syndrome and children who have other disabilities reported that many of  the health care issues and experiences faced by families of children with  Down syndrome are similar to those faced by families of children who  have other disabilities. In this report, we examined (1) what is known  about the extent to which children diagnosed with Down syndrome  receive medical care during early childhood and (2) what resources  families of children with Down syndrome receive through their health care  providers and what barriers families face to using these resources.", "To determine what is known about the extent to which children diagnosed  with Down syndrome receive medical care during early childhood, we  analyzed fee-for-service claims data from a very large private health  insurance company for the claims representing its experience with one of  the largest national employers.

From the private health insurance  company, we received nationwide claims data from 2001 through 2008,  and from Medicaid, we received claims data from seven states for 2007.  To select the seven states, we chose states with high Medicaid enrollment  and low percentages of enrollees in Medicaid managed care; in 2006, the  seven states accounted for over 40 percent of all Medicaid enrollees  nationwide. For each 1-year period from birth through age 4, we analyzed  claims data for children with Down syndrome who were enrolled in the  private health insurance company or Medicaid for at least 11 months of  that period. Specifically, we analyzed data on claims for outpatient,  inpatient, and office-based care to describe the medical care received by  children with Down syndrome during early childhood and corresponding  health care expenditures. To provide a point of reference, we analyzed  similar data for children without Down syndrome. The results of these  analyses are not generalizable to all children with or without Down  syndrome. We discussed the reliability of these data sources with  knowledgeable officials and performed data reliability checks, such as  examining the data for missing values and obvious errors, to test the  internal consistency and reliability of the data.

Specifically, we interviewed 10 national Down syndrome  organizations and national disability organizations and asked them to  identify prominent Down syndrome clinics known for their expertise in  treating children with Down syndrome. From these 10 interviews, we  selected the six most commonly cited Down syndrome clinics and asked  specialists at each of these clinics to recommend the resources families  should receive through their health care providers both at diagnosis and  through early childhood. We then selected 12 Down syndrome advocacy  groups, representing six communities across the country, each of which  was located in the same state as one of the six Down syndrome clinics. We  asked the Down syndrome advocacy groups to review the list of resources  that the specialists recommended and comment on whether families in  their communities were likely to have received those resources through  their health care providers.
