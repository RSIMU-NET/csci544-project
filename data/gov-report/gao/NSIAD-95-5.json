The objectives of DOD force management policies are to (1) maintain, during peacetime, as small an active-duty military force as possible and (2) use civilian employees and contractor personnel wherever possible, to free the military forces to perform military-specific functions.

Decisions pertaining to assignment, promotion, rotation, and retention are centrally controlled at service headquarters. The military personnel management system operates totally under policies and guidance established by DOD, which helps ensure that military leaders have control over their personnel.", "The civilian personnel system, on the other hand, is often described as a more \u201copen,\u201d or decentralized, system. Such a system allows new hires to enter an organization at various levels, depending on each person\u2019s qualifications and experience. Although most civilians begin their government service at lower, entry-level pay grades, managers are not restricted to hiring them at lower-graded entry levels. Civilian employees are also subject to the federal civilian personnel regulatory framework that governs such issues as hiring procedures, working hours, overtime, and job retention rights.", "Unlike their military counterparts, who are employed \u201cglobally\u201d and can be transferred anywhere, civilian employees are generally employed at the local installation level. Career opportunities are generally identified at the local level. While civilian personnel management is described as being decentralized, local managers view their control over civilian force management as limited because budget guidance and downsizing goals, established at higher organizational levels, can mandate reductions in end-strength levels and constrain their hiring authority.", "Unlike funding for military personnel, funding for civilian personnel is not aggregated into a single account that permits close monitoring.

Some DOD and service officials believe that a great majority of such positions should be civilian. Yet, DMDC data indicate that many of these job categories are filled more by military members than civilian employees.

Many officers assigned to headquarters organizations and staff offices are classified as operational, even though they might primarily perform administrative functions. For example, an aircraft pilot assigned to manage personnel requirements functions at a local command would still be classified as a pilot in the DMDC database. However, our analysis of other data in DOD\u2019s 1994 Manpower Requirements Report indicates that nearly 48,000 active-duty military officers, about 20 percent of the services\u2019 total officers, were allocated to organizations outside of the services to perform a wide range of noncombat functions.", "Service officials stated that many officer positions are needed in DOD-wide activities because of career progression requirements. For officers to be promoted to senior levels, they need experience in a \u201cjoint\u201d activity. In many instances, however, these joint experiences may not occur within the officer\u2019s military specialty and may have limited applicability to developing joint battle staff experience. Further, such assignments often last only 2 years, which may not provide enough time to develop the expertise to perform the duties proficiently. These frequent reassignments may also disrupt the continuity of key operations. At one joint command we visited, for example, about one-third of the management staff, including all of the directorate chiefs, rotated in 1 year alone.

Table 2.2 shows the occupational specialties with the greatest variations.", "Some service officials attribute much of the variations to the unique missions of each service that require them to use personnel differently. For example, some Air Force officials explained that they have broad responsibilities to safeguard U.S. nuclear weapons and believe military security guards are more appropriate for this mission. Other DOD and service officials in the civilian personnel and manpower requirements offices attribute the differences to the existing military culture, in which officials prefer to use military personnel instead of civilians. These officials state that there is no reason why the services cannot be more consistent.", "Some DOD and service manpower officials explained that some of the military positions, which otherwise could be civilian, are needed to provide adequate time in the continental United States (CONUS) for service members rotating from tours abroad. They said that, as the United States continues to reduce it forces overseas, the need to maintain large numbers of rotation positions will also decline. Requirements officials said the Army and the Air Force are reducing their number of positions held for rotation purposes. They said the Navy is also adjusting, to some extent, the number of positions held for rotation downward.", "We also observed differences within the services. For example, the Navy uses civilians in the Pacific Fleet to perform its shore personnel staffing analyses (called efficiency reviews), while the Atlantic Fleet uses many military personnel for the same function. According to service officials, the Atlantic Fleet is substantially behind the Pacific Fleet in reviewing all of its shore facilities. Atlantic Fleet officials attribute the delays to the frequent turnover of military personnel. Such turnover, the officials said, prevents military members from developing the level of expertise needed to efficiently perform the reviews. Atlantic Fleet officials explained that they currently do not have adequate funds to hire civilians to do their efficiency reviews and are forced to rely on available military personnel, who are always going through a learning curve. The Pacific Fleet, on the other hand, uses civilians who, because of longer tenures, have become more proficient in completing the studies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Replacing Military Personnel With Civilians Can Save Personnel Costs and Achieve Operational Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Significant differences exist between the compensation costs for comparable military and civilian pay grades; replacing the thousands of military personnel who perform civilian functions with civilian employees of comparable ranks can offer significant potential to save personnel costs. Using civilians in certain support positions also provides operational advantages for DOD because a greater proportion of military strength can be devoted more directly to combat-related functions. Some civilians already have technical expertise that would require additional training for military personnel to acquire, especially in areas such as high-technology communications. Civilians also provide continuity in their positions and provide institutional memory, since they are less subject to the frequent assignment rotations associated with military personnel.", "Increasing the percentage of civilians in specific occupations will free up military positions to be used for other purposes. If, for example, all the services adopted a 50-to-50 ratio between military members and civilians in personnel management\u2014a function DOD officials describe as primarily civilian\u2014about 5,200 military positions would be available for conversion to civilian ones. Similar patterns exist in the areas of data processing and disbursing. Using the 50-to-50 ratio, table 2.3 shows over 14,000 positions within four occupational specialties where large numbers of military personnel perform functions that civilians potentially could do.", "Some of our reports and other DOD-sponsored studies show that civilian employees generally cost the government less than military personnel. The differences vary by pay grade, but, as table 2.4 shows, the average difference is about $15,000 per person per year for peacetime support functions performed in CONUS. (App. III provides more detail on the components of military and civilian compensation by pay grade.)", "Savings to be achieved from military-to-civilian conversions will depend on whether DOD eliminates a position from its military end strength or retains the position and reassigns the military member to another unfilled military-specific position. The savings may be even greater than they first appear from table 2.4 because civilian replacements, in the past, have sometimes been made at lower grades than the comparability table suggests. For example, at one command we visited, two supply management officers at the O-3 level were replaced with GS-9 civilians, even though comparison studies show that the comparable civilian pay grade for an O-3 officer is GS-11. On average, the replacement of just two military O-3 personnel with two civilian GS-9 personnel would result in a potential cost savings to the government of more than $46,000 in 1 year alone, if the military positions were eliminated from the service\u2019s end strength. (Even if the two military O-3 personnel were replaced with civilian GS-11 personnel, the government would still save more than $30,000.)", "DOD officials said civilian employees can be paid at grades lower than their military counterparts because civilians either enter government service with specific expertise or they develop more expertise at an earlier stage in their careers since they do not rotate as frequently.
