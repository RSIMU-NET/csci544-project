Before 2008, the enterprises financed about 30 percent of multifamily loans. Their share increased to 86 percent in 2009, but decreased to 57 percent in 2011 as other participants reentered the market. GAO's analysis showed that multifamily activities greatly contributed to the enterprises' ability to meet affordable housing goals. For example, the enterprises' multifamily activities constituted 4.5 percent of their total business in 2008, but about a third of the units used to meet the goal of serving low- and moderate-income persons were multifamily units.", "The enterprises have purchased multifamily loans that generally performed as well as or better than those of other market participants, but the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has identified deficiencies in their credit risk management. In 2005-2008, the enterprises' serious delinquency rates (less than 1 percent) were somewhat lower than the rates on multifamily loans made by commercial banks and much lower than rates for multifamily loans funded by commercial mortgage-backed securities. FHFA, through its examination and oversight of the enterprises, identified a number of credit risk deficiencies over the past few years. For example, FHFA found deficiencies in Fannie Mae's delegated underwriting and servicing program, risk-management practices, and information systems; and Freddie Mac's management of its lower-performing assets.

We met with lender, commercial real estate, and life  insurance trade associations; affordable housing advocacy groups;  industry researchers; and representatives from FHFA, Fannie Mae, and  Freddie Mac to obtain their views on the enterprises\u2019 role. To report on  the extent to which the enterprises met affordable housing goals, we used  HUD data on annual goal performance in 1993 through 2000, and  analyzed data on goal performance in Annual Housing Activity Reports  (activity report) provided by FHFA for 2001 through 2009. To determine  the extent to which the enterprises\u2019 multifamily activities contributed to the  achievement of specific goals, we calculated multifamily purchases as a  percentage of total mortgage purchases under each goal using data from  the activity reports.

A multifamily property is a cash-generating asset, with rental  income used to pay the multifamily mortgage, while single-family  properties are not generally cash-generating assets. Many single-family  mortgages are 30-year, fully amortizing mortgages, while most multifamily  loans have terms of 5, 7, or 10 years with a balloon payment due at  maturity.against borrower prepayment (using a prepayment premium or other  limitation on prepayment), while single-family loans generally do not. In  addition, multifamily mortgages have different risk characteristics. For  example, it is harder to predict credit risk for multifamily mortgages than   Most multifamily loans also include protection for the investor  for single-family mortgages. Finally, securitizing multifamily loans (that is,  packaging them into mortgage pools to support MBS) is more challenging  because they are not as standardized as single-family loans. For  example, the multifamily loan pools that back MBS have varied loan  terms while single-family securities have historically been backed by 15- year and 30-year mortgages.", "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were established to provide liquidity,  stability, and affordability in the secondary market for both single- and  multifamily mortgages. Their charters do not allow them to operate in the  primary mortgage market by originating loans or lending money directly to  consumers. Rather, they purchase mortgages that meet their underwriting  standards from primary mortgage lenders, such as banks or thrifts, and  either hold the mortgages in their portfolios or package them into MBS.  Multifamily loans make up a small part of the enterprises\u2019 total loan  purchases. According to FHFA\u2019s 2011 Annual Report to Congress, the  enterprises purchased single-family mortgages with an unpaid principal  balance of $879.0 billion and multifamily mortgages totaling $44.6 billion  in 2011.", "According to a 1998 article, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both entered  the conventional multifamily loan market in 1983 and were experiencing  significant losses by 1991. For example, the article stated that in 1991,  Fannie Mae\u2019s multifamily loans were 5.7 percent of all its loans, but  multifamily charge-offs were 30.2 percent of its total charge-offs.  Freddie Mac\u2019s 1991 losses were even greater. According to the article, its  multifamily loans were 2.6 percent of all loans, but multifamily charge-offs  were 51.4 percent of its total charge-offs. Due to these losses, Freddie  Mac exited the multifamily market for 3 years starting in 1991. The same  article noted that boom-and-bust cycles are common in the multifamily  housing market due to the relative ease of entry into the industry. During  periods of strong performance, new apartment supply increases, which  leads to overexpansion and high vacancy rates. According to the authors,  such a cycle contributed to the enterprises\u2019 losses in the late 1980s.", "Fannie Mae currently participates in the multifamily mortgage finance  market primarily through its Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS\u00ae)  program. Under this program, which was initiated in 1988, Fannie Mae  approves lenders and delegates to them the authority to underwrite,  close, and sell loans to the enterprise without its prior review. In  exchange for granting this authority, DUS lenders share the risk of loss  with Fannie Mae. The most common loss-sharing structures are standard  DUS loss sharing and pari passu. The standard model has a tiered loss  system, generally with the maximum lender loss capped at the first 20  percent of the original loan amount. Under the pari passu model, lenders  share all losses on a pro rata basis with Fannie Mae (the lender assumes  one-third of the loss and Fannie Mae two-thirds). A small portion of  Fannie Mae\u2019s multifamily business comprises non-DUS deliveries, which  typically are small balance loans or pools of seasoned loans (loans that  have typically been in a financial institution\u2019s portfolio for at least 1 year  and have a satisfactory repayment record). In 1994, Fannie Mae began  securitizing DUS loans by creating DUS MBS, each of which is backed by  a Fannie Mae guarantee to the investor of principal and interest.  Typically, each DUS MBS pool contains one DUS loan, but can  incorporate multiple DUS loans.", "Freddie Mac participates in the multifamily market by underwriting all of  the loans it purchases. It purchases loans from a network of approved  lenders, but completes the underwriting and credit reviews in-house.  Freddie Mac also conducts negotiated transactions or purchases of  seasoned loans. For a majority of its business, Freddie Mac sells a  significant amount of multifamily credit risk, as defined by expected  losses, to investors by issuing securities backed by its mortgages. In  general, these securities, known as K\u2010deals, are backed by pools of  newly originated mortgages underwritten by Freddie Mac.

According to Fannie Mae officials, the  majority of these acquisitions were pools of seasoned multifamily loans  purchased through negotiated transactions to meet affordable housing  goals for the purchase of mortgages that served targeted groups such as  low- and moderate-income households.

With the start of the K-deal program, Freddie Mac began categorizing  multifamily loans it held in portfolio at acquisition as loans held for  investment and loans held for sale. According to Freddie Mac officials,  loans held for investment were those it planned to hold in its portfolio until  maturity. Loans held for sale were those that Freddie Mac initially held in  its portfolio but planned to include in a K-deal (that is, securitize) at a  future time. According to officials, loans held for sale were almost always  securitized. Table 1 shows the unpaid principal balance of loans held for  investment and loans held for sale from 2008 through 2011. Loans held  for sale had become the predominant loan type by 2010.", "The enterprises may hold their own MBS in their retained portfolio. Fannie  Mae officials indicated that MBS it purchased were typically either resold  in their original state or resecuritized with the purpose of making them a  more suitable investment for a broader range of participants.

Since 2005, Freddie Mac has purchased very few multifamily loans  for smaller properties. According to Freddie Mac officials, the enterprise is  not currently active in the small multifamily loan market in part because of  the credit characteristics of these loans. While they are considered by  definition to be \"multifamily\" properties because they have five or more  units, these transactions generally need to be underwritten more similarly  to single-family loans. Freddie Mac officials noted that because the cost  of underwriting is essentially the same for loans on larger and smaller  properties, purchasing loans on small income properties on an individual  loan basis is less cost-effective than the purchase of individual loans on  larger properties.

We relied on two sources of data on market share in the multifamily  housing financing marketplace from 2005 through 2011: (1) data from the  Federal Reserve on all multifamily mortgage debt outstanding and (2)  MBA data on sources of financing for mortgages originated in a given  year. Our analysis of Federal Reserve data shows that as of the end of  2011, the enterprises held or guaranteed almost 34 percent of the  outstanding multifamily mortgage debt compared to about 24 percent in  2005 (see fig. 17).", "According to MBA data on the financing of loans by investor type, the  enterprises financed less than 30 percent of annual multifamily loans  originated before 2008 (see fig. 18). Their share of the multifamily market  increased to 86 percent in 2009, but decreased to about 57 percent in  2011 as other participants reentered the market. These data are based  on MBA\u2019s annual survey of large institutional lenders, which it defines as  firms with a dedicated commercial/multifamily origination platform.   enterprises\u2019 role in the multifamily housing finance marketplace was about  equal to that of the combined total of originations for life insurance  companies and CMBS lenders before the financial crisis (2005 through  2006), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dominated the marketplace during  the height of the crisis (2008 through 2009) as life insurance companies  and CMBS lenders significantly reduced their presence in the market.  Data from the enterprises, ACLI, and Trepp show that by 2008, the  enterprises\u2019 combined purchases were almost $60 billion compared with  almost $4 billion for life insurance companies and CMBS lenders  combined (see table 2). The data from ACLI and Trepp also showed  that life insurance companies and CMBS lenders started reentering the  market in 2010.", "Based on our reviews of existing literature and interviews with  stakeholders, the enterprises have provided access to multifamily  financing although some view their role in the small-loan market segment  as limited. Our review of the available literature on the role the enterprises  have played in the secondary market for multifamily housing revealed few  studies on this issue, partly due to the long-standing emphasis on Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s single-family portfolios. Additionally, the studies  we found generally lacked both empirical research and a balanced  analysis of the benefits and costs of the enterprises. This was driven, in  part, by the lack of publicly available data on the enterprises\u2019 multifamily  activities and on the multifamily housing finance marketplace as a whole.", "However, the available literature we reviewed included statements that  the enterprises have provided liquidity, stability, and affordability. For  example, five of the seven studies we reviewed stated that the  enterprises have helped ensure a robust financing system for multifamily  housing by providing vital liquidity and counter-cyclical stability, but did  not include empirical evidence supporting these statements. According  to these studies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have provided capital to  the secondary mortgage market for multifamily financing during all  economic climates, including times of credit market stress. One study  cited certain instances in which the enterprises had provided liquidity (in  the wake of the currency crisis in 1998, after the 2001 recession, and in  2007 through 2008 when purely private sources withdrew or charged  untenable interest rates).", "Most mortgage finance and housing policy groups with whom we spoke  generally agreed that the enterprises had provided liquidity and counter- cyclical stability. They agreed that the enterprises were a major source of  funding for multifamily projects during the recent financial crisis.   According to one group, the flight of traditional providers of private capital  (such as banks and life insurance companies) would have been more  devastating to renters had it not been for the enterprises\u2019 presence.", "The five studies we cited previously also stated that the enterprises  generally promoted access to affordable rental housing. As discussed in  more detail later in this report, the enterprises must meet affordable  housing goals for targeted groups such as low- and moderate-income  households. One study stated, \u201cthe government\u2019s involvement in ensuring  that capital is available during times of credit contraction is a critical factor  in mitigating fluctuations in the supply of market-rate and affordably priced  rental housing.\u201d All five studies discussed the role the enterprises have  played in the LIHTC program. For example, one housing policy group  wrote that the enterprises have acted both as equity investors and  purchasers of mortgages for affordable housing developments financed  by the LIHTC program. It noted that through their loan purchases, the  enterprises facilitated 15-year, fixed-rate mortgages that were essential  for these tax credits to be attractive to LIHTC investors. However, the  studies also noted that with no income tax liability to shelter, Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac have withdrawn from the LIHTC investment market.  According to FHFA, it instructed the enterprises to withdraw from the  LIHTC market. Although it is no longer an active equity investor, Freddie  Mac officials noted that the enterprise continues to purchase and  guarantee mortgages that support LIHTC programs.", "While representatives of most of the groups we interviewed stated that  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac generally had played a role in providing  access to affordable rental housing, they emphasized that the enterprises  could do more. For example, one association told us that the affordable  housing goal levels are generally set too low. In its comment letter on  FHFA\u2019s proposed rule on the 2010 and 2011 affordable housing goals, it  wrote that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac actually had been doing even  less to finance what it called legitimate, affordable rental housing since  conservatorship. The association provided as an example the experience  of one of its members, a lending consortium whose funds came from a  pool of 45 investors. One of the enterprises had been an investor since  1993, but recently had been the only major investor to not renew its  commitment. According to this enterprise, FHFA has directed it to cease  making certain types of investments and loans.", "In addition, our literature review and interviews indicated that the  enterprises have played a limited role in financing small multifamily  properties, which tend to have lower rents than larger properties.  According to the 2010 American Community Survey, almost one-third of  renters live in structures with 5 to 49 units (see fig. 19).", "Representatives from trade associations, housing policy groups, industry  researchers, and a consumer advocacy group generally agreed on the  limited role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played in the small-loan  market segment. For example, two trade associations stated that  enterprise financing generally has not flowed outside major metropolitan  areas, where there is a need for small-loan financing. In its comment  letter on FHFA\u2019s proposed rule on the 2010 and 2011 affordable housing  goals, one of these trade associations stated that smaller-sized properties  that are affordable to low- and moderate-income persons are the most  underserved segment of the multifamily market, in large part because of  low levels of enterprise activity in this market segment.", "As previously noted, small loans (those for properties with 5 to 50 units)  make up a small percentage of the loans that the enterprises have  purchased. According to Fannie Mae\u2019s 2011 activity report, 22,382 of  the 390,526 multifamily units that Fannie Mae financed (5.7 percent) were  through small loans. Of these multifamily units, 76 percent were low- income or very low-income rental units. According to Freddie Mac\u2019s  2011 activity report, the enterprise\u2019s units financed through small loans  comprised 0.7 percent of the multifamily units it financed (2,173 of  290,116 units). About 35 percent of these units were low-income or very  low-income rental units. Although well below the enterprises\u2019 participation  in the larger property market, officials at FHFA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie  Mac contend that the enterprises\u2019 small-loan activity levels are noteworthy  because this segment of the market has been dominated by banks and  thrifts\u2014institutions that have greater familiarity with local needs. (For  information on how the size of the loans that the enterprises purchased  compares with the size of loans financed by other major participants in  the multifamily housing financing marketplace, see app. IV.)", "While most studies we reviewed and individuals we interviewed stated  that the enterprises played an important role in multifamily housing  finance, two studies stated that private capital should play a larger role.  The first study concluded that without the enterprises over the past 20  years, \u201ca fully functioning, private debt financing market for multifamily  housing would have existed, in the same way that fully private debt  financing markets exist for office, retail, and industrial properties.\u201d  According to the study, the multifamily market is dependent on the  enterprises because of a lack of competition among other lenders,  derived from the enterprises\u2019 unfair pricing advantages. Similarly, the  second study stated that before the enterprises\u2019 involvement, life  insurance companies, pension funds, and banks supported a robust  conventional multifamily lending market. According to the study, once  the enterprises entered the multifamily market, the private sector had an  increasingly difficult time competing with the enterprises because their  charter provided them with certain advantages, such as pricing. The  authors of the first study and other stakeholders we interviewed stated  that the benefits conferred on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by their  status as government-sponsored entities created a competitive  advantage over other market participants, temporarily crowding them out  of the market.", "In February 2012, FHFA released a strategic plan for the enterprises\u2019  single- and multifamily operations during the next phase of  conservatorship. In the plan, FHFA asked Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac  to conduct a market analysis of the viability of their multifamily operations  without government guarantees. FHFA also released a draft strategic  plan for 2013 through 2017, which includes the strategic plan for  conservatorship. This plan noted that the enterprises would be working to   According to  further standardize the process for securitizing mortgages.

Securitization for single-family mortgages has been more standardized than for multifamily  mortgages, which also has employed a different process. For example, the typical  multifamily MBS that Fannie Mae issues is backed by a single multifamily loan, while its  single-family MBS are backed by numerous single-family loans.", "Currently, the enterprises compose the largest share of the multifamily  market as they and other federal entities compose most of the single- family market. While markets are expected to eventually recover from the  financial crisis, the future role of the enterprises is unknown due to a  number of factors. However, our analysis of multifamily funding activity  over time provides insight into the role the enterprises have played in the  marketplace during periods in which the markets were relatively stable.  For example, prior to the financial crisis, our analysis revealed that the  enterprises generally financed about 30 percent of multifamily mortgages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enterprises\u2019 Multifamily Activities Are Important to Meeting Affordable Housing Goal Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 2010, FHFA implemented the Housing and Economic  Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) by making significant changes to the  housing goal framework, including establishing separate goals for the  purchases of single- and multifamily mortgages.", "The Safety and Soundness Act required the enterprises to meet annual  numeric goals for the purchase of mortgages serving targeted groups.

In HUD\u2019s first  rulemaking on the affordable housing goals, it defined underserved areas  as census tracts with median income at or below 90 percent of AMI in  metropolitan areas and 95 percent of AMI in nonmetropolitan areas, or  high-minority areas (metropolitan census tracts in which at least 30  percent of households are minority and the tract median income does not  exceed 120 percent of AMI). The special affordable goal targeted  borrowers or renters earning no more than 60 percent of AMI or earning  no more than 80 percent of AMI and residing in census tracts with median  income at or below 80 percent of AMI.", "The Safety and Soundness Act required HUD to consider several factors  in establishing these housing goals, including: (1) national housing needs;  (2) economic, housing, and demographic conditions; (3) past  performance on each goal; (4) the size of the corresponding primary  mortgage market; (5) the ability of the enterprises to lead the industry,  and (6) the need to maintain the sound financial condition of the  enterprises. For the period 1993 through 2008, HUD considered past  performance and the size of the corresponding primary market as the two  primary factors when setting the goals.", "The enterprises could purchase both single- and multifamily mortgages to  satisfy these goals. Starting in 1996, HUD established a dollar-based  special affordable multifamily subgoal related to purchases of multifamily  mortgages for properties affordable to very low-income tenants (no more  than 60 percent of AMI) or in low-income neighborhoods and affordable to  low-income tenants.

In August 2009, FHFA issued a final rule that kept many of the existing  housing goals provisions, but revised the levels of the existing affordable  housing goals downward in light of current market conditions. in 2010, FHFA, implementing HERA, made significant changes to the  goals framework, such as separating the goals for multifamily and single- family mortgage purchases. In its final rule on the affordable housing  goals for 2010 and 2011, the agency also redefined the goal targets to  reach lower-income groups and required the enterprises to report on their  acquisition of mortgages involving low-income units in small (5 to 50 unit)  multifamily properties. Further, FHFA prohibited the enterprises from  crediting purchases of private-label securities, including CMBS, toward  housing goals.

FHFA determined that  the two goals both enterprises failed to meet in 2008 (the low- and  moderate-income and special affordable goals) were infeasible due to  structural changes in the market from 2006 through 2008, which were not  anticipated in 2004 when HUD established the goals. Specifically, FHFA  took into consideration such factors as tightened underwriting standards  in the mortgage industry, the decreased availability of private mortgage  insurance in the primary market, the increase in the share of single-family  mortgages insured by FHA, and the fall in the issuance of goals- qualifying, private-label securities. Freddie Mac also did not meet the  underserved areas goal in 2008. Although FHFA determined that the  market conditions that made the other two goals infeasible made meeting  the underserved areas goal more difficult for Freddie Mac, it did not  declare this goal to be infeasible for Freddie Mac.

In making this determination, FHFA  considered the same factors it took into account the previous year.  Freddie Mac also did not meet the special affordable goal in 2009. FHFA  determined that this goal was feasible for Freddie Mac, but in light of the  near achievement of the goal, did not require a housing plan.", "As noted previously, both enterprises also had to meet a special  affordable multifamily subgoal in 2001 through 2009. Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac exceeded this subgoal in each year except for 2009 (see  table 4).

We interviewed selected state and  local HFAs and in general, they viewed the enterprises as important  players in providing liquidity for affordable multifamily properties. For  example, officials from a large local HFA told us that the enterprises have  played a critical role in providing liquidity and long-term credit  enhancement to affordable and market-rate developments. According to  an official from a small state HFA, before 2008 Fannie Mae was an active  and highly valued buyer of their small tax-exempt private activity bonds.  The official added that the ability to sell bonds under $5 million on a direct  placement basis to Fannie Mae was extremely helpful and has been  missed. Allowing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reenter the bond  market with private placements would be a significant benefit, and would  allow the HFA to provide reliable and dependable financing options to  their multifamily affordable housing projects, according to this HFA  official. The enterprises have also participated in two temporary Treasury  HFA initiatives: (1) the Temporary Credit and Liquidity Facilities (TCLF)  program and (2) the New Issue Bond Program (NIBP). TCLF, which  provides replacement credit enhancement and liquidity support to  outstanding HFA variable-rate demand bonds, is set to expire in 2015.

FHFA  oversees the enterprises\u2019 credit risk management through on-site  examinations and off-site monitoring. As part of its annual on-site  examination of the safety and soundness of the enterprises, FHFA  assesses their enterprise risk, which includes credit, market, and  operational risk. The written report that FHFA submits to Congress by  June 15 of each year describes the financial safety and soundness of  each enterprise, including the results and conclusions from annual  examinations. FHFA also can conduct targeted examinations, which are  in-depth, focused evaluations of a specific risk or risk-management  system. Throughout the year, FHFA conducts ongoing supervision of the  enterprises that includes on-site and off-site monitoring and analyzing of  each enterprise\u2019s overall business profile, including trends or emerging  risks. FHFA\u2019s Division of Enterprise Regulation prepares quarterly risk  assessments that inform an Interim Supervisory Assessment Letter,  which provides FHFA\u2019s view of the condition of the enterprise midway  through the examination cycle. FHFA documents deficiencies identified in  examinations or ongoing supervision in a conclusion letter that  communicates findings, conclusions, and the assigned supervisory  rating. FHFA is to follow up on deficiencies to ensure that the  enterprise\u2019s response is appropriate, timely, and effective.", "Since 2006, OFHEO and FHFA have identified a number of deficiencies  with Fannie Mae\u2019s management of multifamily credit risk, including  several weaknesses in oversight of its DUS program. Specifically, in OFHEO\u2019s 2006 Annual Report to Congress, the agency reported that  Fannie Mae\u2019s underwriting standards needed updating because of the  volume of waivers granted to DUS lenders. According to OFHEO, the  high waiver rate was indicative of a policy that was too restrictive, lending  practices that were too liberal, or a policy that was not current relative to  market conditions. And while Fannie Mae authorized DUS lenders to  review and approve waivers, the enterprise had not established a strong  and comprehensive quality control process. In 2011, FHFA  communicated supervisory concerns related to Fannie Mae\u2019s DUS  program. Fannie Mae reported that it was taking several steps to address  these deficiencies, including training its credit underwriting staff,  conducting due diligence and credit analysis for DUS transactions, and  expanding its monitoring of multiple loans with the same entity. FHFA  noted that the steps Fannie Mae planned to take appeared reasonable  but indicated that the enterprise must show that it had implemented these  changes and that they could be sustained.", "In addition to deficiencies in the DUS program, OFHEO and FHFA  identified deficiencies with Fannie Mae\u2019s multifamily quality control  function, asset management (that is, how it manages loans it acquires),  underwriting practices, and information systems supporting credit risk  management:", "OFHEO reported in 2006 that Fannie Mae faced deficiencies with its  quality control function because Fannie Mae\u2019s oversight focused on  reviewing documents rather than analyzing and assessing credit  information. OFHEO noted that credit information was incomplete or  not readily available. In 2007, OFHEO reported that the multifamily  quality-control process was improved and expanded to provide better  coverage of multifamily loans.  In 2008, OFHEO reported that Fannie Mae had begun to address  deficiencies in asset management. Further, in 2010 FHFA reported  that Fannie Mae was identifying problem assets earlier, developing  workout strategies for problem loans, and managing delinquencies  and foreclosed properties to improve the amount recovered on sales  of property in markets and minimize losses.  In 2011, FHFA found that Fannie Mae needed to improve its risk- management practices for multifamily loans. To address this issue,  Fannie Mae stated that it planned to review its existing risk- management processes and controls.   In 2011, FHFA reviewed certain loans and advised Fannie Mae to  strengthen its underwriting and quality control practices related to  appraisals and verification of financial information. Fannie Mae stated  that it would review its procedures and consult with FHFA as it  proceeded.", "Additionally, in 2011 Fannie Mae agreed to respond to supervisory  concerns relating to waiver and exception monitoring and reporting.", "Fannie Mae stated that it would analyze the loans that had been  granted waivers or extensions to determine if there were correlations  between waivers and subsequent loan performance.", "OFHEO reported in 2008 that Fannie Mae\u2019s credit review function was  understaffed and that information system deficiencies or inefficiencies  compromised the enterprises\u2019 ability to manage risks. FHFA also  identified deficiencies with Fannie Mae\u2019s information systems in 2009  and 2010. According to FHFA, Fannie Mae has begun a  transformation initiative to centralize data sources and improve data  integrity.", "We reviewed OFHEO\u2019s annual reports to Congress from 1997 through  2008. During this 12-year period, OFHEO did not report any credit risk  deficiencies in Freddie Mac\u2019s multifamily housing activities. However,  since 2009 FHFA has identified deficiencies in Freddie Mac\u2019s multifamily  asset-management function. For example, FHFA reported in its 2009  Annual Report to Congress that a targeted examination of Freddie Mac\u2019s  asset-management function had found that the function needed to be  strengthened. FHFA noted that the multifamily business unit had begun to  address some of the issues identified. In its 2010 Annual Report to  Congress, FHFA continued to report on deficiencies with Freddie Mac\u2019s  asset-management function, including that it was poorly managed and  lacked the necessary process and controls to identify, evaluate, and  control problem assets. Additionally, the 2010 report noted problems with  the multifamily division\u2019s management of the problem loan watch list. In  this report, FHFA noted that while risk management for multifamily asset  management was unsatisfactory, management had corrected or was  addressing these issues.

Each enterprise provided data on the  characteristics (at acquisition) of the multifamily loans they purchased and  data on the performance of loans over time. We used the data to  determine how many loans each enterprise purchased each year from  1994 through 2011 and the unpaid principal balance of those loans at the  time of acquisition. Because certain Fannie Mae multifamily loan  products roll over periodically (which creates a new loan number but does  not represent a new acquisition), we used a new acquisition indicator  provided by Fannie Mae to identify its acquisitions each year. When  fluctuations in purchase volume were identified, we interviewed Fannie  Mae and Freddie Mac officials to determine the reasons for these  fluctuations. We also analyzed data on each enterprise\u2019s annual  purchases of multifamily loans to determine the unpaid principal balance  of (1) loans that the enterprise expected to hold in portfolio; (2) loans that  it expected to securitize (that is, packaging them into mortgage pools to  support mortgage-backed securities (MBS)); and (3) bond credit  enhancements. For Fannie Mae, securitized loans included MBS and  discount MBS. Freddie Mac\u2019s securitized portfolio included participation  certificates, tax-exempt bond securitization, and K-deals. Because we  were unable to use the loan-level data provided by the two enterprises to  determine how much of the multifamily MBS they issued were held in  portfolio or sold to investors, we asked both enterprises to provide  additional information on MBS held in portfolio. Both enterprises were  able to provide data on purchases of their own MBS in 2010 and 2011.", "In addition, we analyzed each enterprise\u2019s annual multifamily loan  purchases from 1994 through 2011 as follows:", "Size of properties financed\u2014We determined the number and unpaid  principal balance of loans purchased each year that financed  properties with 5 to 50 units and properties with 51 or more units.", "Loan size\u2014We determined the number and unpaid principal balance  of loans purchased each year that fell into the following four  categories: $0 to less than $5 million, $5 million to less than $50  million, $50 million to less than $100 million, and $100 million or  greater.", "Geography\u2014We determined the unpaid principal balance of loans  acquired each year in the 25 largest metropolitan statistical areas.

We  also compared selected enterprise data with information in public filings.  In addition, we conducted reasonableness checks on the data to identify  any missing, erroneous, or outlying figures. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine what information is available about the enterprises\u2019 role in  the multifamily housing financing marketplace, we analyzed data on  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac\u2019s share of the multifamily housing market  from 2005 through 2011. First, we analyzed Flow of Funds data (Table  L.219, published on June 7, 2012) from the Board of Governors of the  Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) on multifamily mortgage debt  outstanding to determine the enterprises\u2019 share of debt holdings.  Second, we analyzed data on the financing of multifamily loans originated  by large institutional lenders that the Mortgage Bankers Association  (MBA) published. MBA gathers these multifamily origination data through  a survey and publishes the data in its Annual Commercial/Multifamily  Mortgage Bankers Origination Summation. In 2011, 99 firms participated  in MBA\u2019s survey, including life insurance companies, commercial  mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) lenders, lenders that sell loans to  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, FHA lenders, and other lender groups. The  survey did not include small banks and savings and loan associations  (thrifts) because they tend to operate as a separate market, according to  MBA. Although not comprehensive, the survey data from MBA are the  data most often cited when discussing the enterprises\u2019 share of the  multifamily housing financing marketplace. We assessed the reliability of  both types of data\u2014mortgage debt outstanding and multifamily origination  data\u2014by interviewing Federal Reserve and MBA representatives,  respectively, about the methods they used to collect and help ensure the  integrity of the information. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. We also compared data from the enterprises  and two major participants in the multifamily housing financing  marketplace\u2014life insurance companies and CMBS lenders\u2014to illustrate  how these participants\u2019 multifamily activities have changed over time.  Specifically, we compared data obtained from the American Council of  Life Insurers (ACLI) and Trepp on loans originated from 2005 through  2011 with our analysis of data from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on  loans purchased during those years. We assessed the reliability of the  ACLI and Trepp data by sending them a set of standard data reliability  questions and obtaining their written responses. We followed up with  them when we had questions on the data or their responses to our data  reliability questions. Where possible, we also compared the data they  provided to us with published data. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To identify reports on the enterprises\u2019 role in the multifamily housing  financing marketplace, we conducted a search of literature published  since 1995 but found few studies that focused on the enterprises\u2019  multifamily activities. Ultimately, we identified seven studies that provided  varying viewpoints on the role that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have  played in multifamily housing finance. Although we found that these studies lacked empirical research, we determined that they were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes (identifying literature and authors\u2019  conclusions and the limitations of the studies). To obtain additional views  on the enterprises\u2019 role in multifamily housing financing, we met with the  authors of two of these studies and with researchers who have  knowledge about housing finance and the operations of the enterprises.  We also discussed the enterprises\u2019 role with representatives from the  Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA); Fannie Mae; Freddie Mac;  other participants in the multifamily housing financing marketplace such  as ACLI, the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council (CREFC), the  Federal Housing Administration (FHA), MBA, the National Association of  Affordable Housing Lenders (NAAHL), the National Council of State  Housing Agencies (NCSHA), and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Rural  Housing Service (RHS); the National Multi Housing Council; and the  Consumer Federation of America. To comment on the enterprises\u2019 role in  financing loans for small properties (5 to 50 units), we analyzed data from  the 2010 American Community Survey on the percentage of renters who  live in small multifamily structures and data from the enterprises\u2019 2011  Annual Housing Activity Reports on their purchases of loans for such  properties.
