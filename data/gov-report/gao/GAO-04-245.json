In 1999, GAO made four recommendations to the Executive Office for Weed and Seed (EOWS) to improve the program's management, including (1) developing adequate internal controls to fully document decisions, (2) improving program monitoring, (3) developing criteria for determining when sites have become self-sustaining and when to reduce or withdraw program funding, and (4) developing additional performance measures. GAO did this study to assess progress in implementing these recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Despite some progress toward addressing GAO's recommendations aimed at improving program management, GAO's review shows that EOWS has not fully implemented the management improvement recommendations GAO made in 1999. First, although EOWS has revised its internal controls to require that significant qualification and funding decisions be documented and readily available in the central grant files for review, EOWS has not always ensured that its policies and procedures were followed, for the grant files GAO reviewed. Second, EOWS reported taking a number of actions intended to improve program monitoring, such as mandating the timely submission of progress reports and adequate recording of site visits as GAO recommended. Nonetheless, GAO found that while EOWS was able to provide such documentation before its review ended, documentation was not available in some of the central grant files GAO reviewed. Thus, the documentation was not readily available for external reviewers, as required by OJP policies and GAO's internal control standards. Third, GAO found that EOWS still lacks fully developed criteria to determine when sites become self-sustaining and when to reduce or withdraw Weed and Seed funds because of the level of sustainability, even though sustainability is a central goal of the program. At the time of GAO's review, no site's funding had been reduced or withdrawn because of sustainability during the 13 years of the program's existence. Fourth, EOWS has not developed outcome performance measures that can be used to adequately track progress toward program outcomes of the Weed and Seed program. While EOWS has initiated studies on how to develop performance measures, at the time of GAO's review, none of these studies had been completed. Without requirements to monitor improvements and assign accountability, progress will be difficult to achieve."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Justice\u2019s (Justice) Weed and Seed program proposes to  \u201cweed\u201d out crime from targeted neighborhoods and \u201cseed\u201d them with a  variety of programs and resources to prevent crime from recurring. Weed  and Seed sites have sponsored activities such as police bike patrols,  community cleanups, youth and recreational activities, and computer  training. According to Justice, a central tenet of the Weed and Seed  program is for local Weed and Seed sites to develop partnerships with  other federal, state, and local governments and private sector agencies to  leverage federal Weed and Seed grant funds with additional resources  from these partners to promote weeding and seeding activities. These  additional resources are intended to help the sites achieve the goal of  becoming self-sustaining after Weed and Seed funding ends and to sustain  crime reduction and community revitalization activities to ensure stable  communities.", "This report responds to your request to assess the Executive Office for  Weed and Seed\u2019s (EOWS) efforts to implement the management  improvement recommendations we made in 1999. It is not intended to  evaluate the overall management or results of the program. In our  previous report on the Weed and Seed program, we recommended that  EOWS improve its management of the Weed and Seed program.  Specifically, we recommended that EOWS (1) develop adequate internal  controls to ensure that the basis and the rationale for new and existing site  qualification and funding decisions are always fully documented,   (2) improve program monitoring to ensure that sites meet the grant  requirement of submitting progress reports and that EOWS site visits are  documented, (3) develop criteria for determining when sites are self- sustaining and when to reduce or withdraw program funding, and   (4) develop additional performance measures that track program  outcomes.

We reviewed GAO,  Congressional Research Service, and Justice\u2019s Office of Inspector General  reports. In addition, we interviewed officials from EOWS, the Office of  Justice Programs, other entities in the Justice Department, and  researchers in performance measurement and evaluation at the Justice  Research and Statistics Association and the Urban Institute in Washington,  D.C. We visited and interviewed program staff at three Weed and Seed  sites. We reviewed 30 randomly selected Weed and Seed grant files to  identify the actions taken by EOWS for those grants to document its  qualification and funding decisions and the steps EOWS took to ensure  that grant documentation requirements were met. Since the files we  reviewed were not representative of all EOWS grant files, we cannot  project the results to the larger population. However, the information  helps to identify the level of implementation of our recommendations for  those grants.

The Assistant Attorney General for OJP sets policies, promotes  coordination among OJP bureaus and offices, and ensures that EOWS  follows its policies and procedures. EOWS provides funding to grantees to  help prevent and control crime and improve the quality of life in targeted  high-crime neighborhoods across the country. It is a joint federal, state,  and local program for coordinated law enforcement and neighborhood  reinvestment. Federal program funding is to support Weed and Seed sites  and to provide training and technical assistance.", "The Weed and Seed program has grown since it began in fiscal year   1991 with three pilot sites in Kansas City, Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; and  Trenton, New Jersey, and a relatively small investment of federal money.   From fiscal year 1999 through 2003, the number of Weed and Seed sites  increased from 163 to 221, while the total annual program budget generally  increased from about $45 million to $70 million. See table 1 for fiscal years  1999-2003 data on the Weed and Seed program, including EOWS\u2019s funding  history. In fiscal year 2003, with a budget of about $70 million, EOWS  awarded grants to 221 Weed and Seed sites.", "EOWS is responsible for the national management and administration of  the Weed and Seed program, including developing policy and providing  guidance and oversight. EOWS currently administers the Weed and Seed  program with a staff of 2 management officials, 10 grant monitors, 3  support staff, 3 detailees, and 6 contractors.", "Before a community can apply for Weed and Seed grant funding and  become an eligible site, it must first apply for and gain official recognition  from EOWS. In order to obtain official recognition, a potential Weed and  Seed site must show in its application that it has a strategy for weeding  and preventing crime. Once the application has been received, EOWS  creates and maintains the official recognition files that are intended to  include documentation such as the rationale for decisions to grant or deny  official recognition to an applicant. Official recognition requires the U.S.  Attorney in the area where the Weed and Seed site is to be located to  organize a local steering committee made up of various federal, state, and  local representatives, including residents, to be responsible for local  administration of the program. For official recognition, a site is also  required to develop a management plan, engage residents and other  partners in its activities, and develop a comprehensive program to weed  out crime and gang activity and seed the area with social services,  economic services, and economic revitalization.", "Weed and Seed program guidance requires that its sites show plans for  addressing four required elements: (1) law enforcement; (2) community  policing; (3) crime prevention and intervention, and substance abuse  prevention, intervention, and treatment; and (4) neighborhood restoration.  According to EOWS, law enforcement should attempt to eliminate the  most violent offenders by coordinating and integrating the efforts of  federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies in targeted high-crime  neighborhoods. The objective of community policing is to raise the level of  citizen and community involvement in crime prevention and intervention  activities. Crime and substance abuse prevention, intervention, and  treatment should include youth services, school programs, community and  social programs, and support groups. Finally, neighborhood restoration  should focus on assistance to distressed neighborhoods through economic  and housing development. Weed and Seed sites fund a variety of law  enforcement and community activities. For example, law enforcement- funded activities range from participation in a multijurisdictional task  force to conducting bike patrols in the community. See appendix II for  additional information on Weed and Seed activities at the sites GAO  visited.", "Applicants that are officially recognized are eligible to apply for funding  for up to 5 years. OJP\u2019s Office of the Comptroller creates and maintains  official grant files for sites that are awarded funding by EOWS. Applicants  are rated based on the strategy they developed in response to the four  required elements, as stated above.", "In our 1999 report, we made four recommendations to help EOWS  improve program monitoring and management. The first was to develop  adequate internal controls to fully document significant qualification and  funding decisions. We found that EOWS lacked internal controls requiring  significant program management decisions be documented. Therefore,  EOWS was not able to ensure that it was making the best decisions about  allocating available funds. Our second recommendation was to improve  program monitoring to ensure that sites met the grant requirement of  submitting progress reports and that EOWS site visits were documented.  We found that EOWS did not always ensure that local sites submitted  progress reports and that grant monitors documented the results of site  visits. Such documentation would help EOWS management and grant  monitors determine how sites are meeting program objectives and how  well sites are complying with grant requirements, and assist them in  making future grant qualification decisions. Our third recommendation  was to develop criteria for determining when sites have become self- sustaining and when to reduce or withdraw program funding. We found  that although self-sustainability is central to the program, no site\u2019s funding  had been reduced or withdrawn as a result of its efforts to become self- sustaining in the 9 years of the program\u2019s existence. Establishing such  criteria is important because the Weed Seed program was founded on the  premise that federal funding would continue for a finite period, after  which a Weed and Seed site would be self-sustaining. Our fourth  recommendation was to develop additional performance measures to  track program outcomes. We found that EOWS\u2019s performance indicators  generally tracked activities rather than program results; therefore, EOWS  was not able to measure the success of the program.", "EOWS generally agreed with three of the four recommendations presented  in the report and discussed future actions it planned to take. EOWS  officials disagreed with our recommendation on self-sustainability. They  stated that developing criteria to ascertain self-sustainment is redundant  since EOWS adopted a 5-year rule under which it could discontinue  awarding funding to qualifying sites unless the sites expanded to an  additional neighborhood site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Internal Controls Have Been Developed, but Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["Although EOWS has developed internal controls intended to require that  significant qualification and funding decisions be documented and readily  available for review as we recommended in 1999, these policies and  procedures are generally not being followed in the files we reviewed.

In addition, OJP requires that  qualification and funding decisions are to be documented in official  recognition and official grant files. Our review of 20 official recognition  and 10 official grant files showed that some of EOWS\u2019s official recognition  and official grant files were missing full documentation regarding the  qualification and funding decisions. However, before our file review  ended, EOWS officials produced further documentation, which they  acknowledged was not in the official recognition and official grant files as  required, but rather in the personal working files of grant monitors and  thus not readily available to EOWS management and external reviewers.

However, using the number of homicides as an outcome measure  indicative of program success is problematic for several reasons. First,  because homicides are relatively rare, even in high crime areas, homicide  trends may be too unstable (fluctuate too much from year to year) to  assess the success of the Weed and Seed program. Second, outcome  measures, such as homicides, can present some methodological challenges  because it is difficult to draw a direct causal link between the homicides  and a program\u2019s work. Economic trends and other law enforcement  initiatives could also be responsible for the observed outcomes. If  homicides are used as a performance measure, any analysis should  attempt to control for other factors influencing the outcomes. Third, given  the broad nature of this program goal -- to reduce violent crime, measuring  outcomes in relation to only one type of violent crime also seems  problematic because it is too narrowly focused.

While EOWS was eventually able to produce the  documentation we requested, failure to appropriately file the  documentation made the process of using it very inefficient and, in effect,  may have defeated the purpose of having it completed.", "While EOWS may have moved forward in addressing its self-sustainability  goals by recently developing an activity checklist for grantees to use to  document actions that are intended to achieve self-sustainability, the  activities do not constitute criteria for determining when sites should be  considered self-sustaining and consequently have federal funds reduced or  discontinued. One of the benefits of such criteria is to enable EOWS to  determine when current projects are likely to be able to self-sustain so that  available funding can be used to help reduce crime and achieve other  benefits in other deserving communities. Because no sites have had their  funding withdrawn because they were deemed self-sustaining during the  13-year life of this program, EOWS may be foregoing the opportunity to  use the funds in another location where the need for federal funding is  greater or EOWS may need less overall funding. Without criteria to  determine when federal funds are no longer needed, EOWS also runs the  risk of providing funds beyond what is needed to sustain some sites.", "EOWS also needs performance measures that focus on program outcomes,  and/or achievement of intermediate goals, so that it and those that provide  oversight, such as the Congress and OMB, will be able to adequately assess  the extent to which the program is achieving its goals.

In a March 11, 2004, letter, the Assistant  Attorney General (AAG) for OJP commented on the draft.  Her written  comments are summarized below and presented in their entirety in  appendix VII. Based on Justice\u2019s comments, we modified the text of our  report where appropriate and also incorporated Justice\u2019s technical  comments into this report where appropriate.", "In the AAG\u2019s response, the Justice Department generally agreed with our  recommendations on maintaining the documentation of the basis and  rationale for qualification and funding decisions in appropriate grant files  and retaining progress reports and site visit reports in official grant files.  Justice agreed in part with our recommendation on self-sustainability  criteria and fully agreed with our recommendation on outcome  performance measures, and offered additional information to show it had  moved forward in responding to our past recommendation.", "Justice agreed that controls should be strengthened to ensure that the  basis and rationale for qualification and funding decisions are documented  in the centrally maintained official recognition (OR) files. In Justice\u2019s  comments, the AAG explained that electronic documents maintained in its  grant management system (GMS) are considered a part of the official  recognition file and are readily available to EOWS, and that they should  have been, but were not, readily available to, and easily accessible by,  GAO. As of the current fiscal year, OJP will not only post all solicitations  and receive all grant applications via GMS, but also receive and maintain  all grant progress reports on GMS. In this way, there will be no  opportunity to misplace official grant documents. Justice stated that OJP\u2019s  Office of the Comptroller will implement procedures to ensure that  external reviewers have ready access to GMS information.", "Justice agreed with our second recommendation on retaining progress  reports and site visit reports in official grant files. Justice noted that EOWS  recently implemented a progress reporting module in GMS that now  enables recipients of grants awarded through GMS to submit semi annual  progress reports electronically. OJP is developing a monitoring module  that will enable program monitors to record and report on site visits  directly in GMS. In the interim, EOWS and the Office of the Comptroller  will take steps to strengthen controls to ensure that copies of completed  site visit reports are included in the official grant file.", "Justice agreed in part with our third recommendation on self-sustainability  and noted that EOWS will further define the criteria to assess when sites  are self-sustaining and apply the criteria when making funding decisions.  Further, Justice said it is promoting a \u201cgraduation\u201d process to bring sites  to sustainability and cease providing Weed and Seed funding to those  sites, thus making funding available to assist newer developing sites.    However, Justice does not agree that EOWS has never set criteria for self- sustainability. Justice said that EOWS set a criterion for self-sustainability  in the FY2003 Weed and Seed Competitive Application Kit, which asked if  the application provided for a full-time coordinator funded by reallocation  of existing resources other than the Weed and Seed grant. According to  Justice, applications were ranked against this criterion. According to  EOWS officials, in March 2004, EOWS will announce an additional  criterion specific to measuring self-sustainability. The new criterion will  require grant applicants to identify other funding sources at a level five  times the EOWS contribution. This criterion will be considered when  making funding decisions.", "We applaud EOWS\u2019s commitment to further develop criteria to assess  when sites are self-sustaining and apply the criteria to sites when making  further funding decisions.  However, Justice\u2019s comments did not provide  specific information about how the Application Kit criterion has been used  to determine self-sustainability. We added Justice\u2019s belief that this  criterion relates to self-sustainability to the text, but also note that over  the 13-year history of the program, funding has never been reduced or  withdrawn from a site because a site was deemed to be self-sustaining.", "Justice agrees that developing outcome performance measures is  important and states that EOWS has been working to develop measures  that track progress toward program outcomes in the Weed and Seed  Program. In a letter commenting on this draft report, Justice provided a  summary of results from JRSA\u2019s study to support EOWS\u2019s use of the  change in homicides as a measure of program success. According to  Justice\u2019s summary, this study concluded that measuring reductions of  homicides is an adequate performance measure of the Weed and Seed  program because of its reliability and explicit selection as a goal by over  30 percent of the Weed and Seed sites participating in the Crime Pattern  Study. In addition, Justice includes a 5 percent reduction in homicides in  Weed and Seed sites as part of its Strategic Plan. With its comments,  Justice included summaries of two recent research reports. One of these,  Analysis of Homicide in Weed and Seed Sites, showed positive results in  homicide trends in Weed and Seed sites when compared to host  jurisdictions. Another report, Crime Pattern Analysis (Three-Top Crime  Study), showed that after the third year of Weed and Seed program  implementation, sites encountered a significant decrease in reported  crimes.", "Because the Crime Pattern Analysis study was not completed at the time  of our review, we could not fully assess its methodological rigor and  whether it would result in effective outcome performance measures.   Although we believe that EOWS may be moving in the right direction  regarding developing additional performance measures and we mention  the studies in the report text, we also believe that homicides have  shortcomings as described in the text when used as the only measure of  the program\u2019s performance. In addition, our review of the Analysis of  Homicide in Local Weed and Seed Sites study generated several concerns.  First, the study used changes in the raw volume of homicides, instead of  changes in homicide rates, as its indicator of success or failure of program  sites. This method does not account for changes in the population as  would be accounted for were a homicide rate measured. Second, the study  used the larger host jurisdictions for specific Weed and Seed sites as the  comparison locations to which the Weed and Seed sites are compared. In  doing so, Weed and Seed sites\u2019 homicide data are included with host  jurisdictions\u2019 homicide data, thus making the differences between them  extremely difficult to interpret. It is also worth noting that this study  evaluates Weed and Seed sites only on the basis of decreases in homicides,  while Weed and Seed was intended to decrease crime more generally.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General, appropriate  congressional committees, and other interested parties.

We  selected these sites from the 221 sites funded by EOWS in fiscal year   2003. Based on our discussions with EOWS officials about the sites, we  selected three sites, which although not representative of all sites, had  received Weed and Seed grant funds since the early 1990s, which enabled  us to learn about their efforts to implement the Weed and Seed strategy  over time. We also reviewed selected monitoring visit reports prepared by  grant monitors for these sites and biannual progress reports submitted in  fiscal years 2002 and 2003. We interviewed EOWS officials and grant  coordinators at these 3 sites regarding procedures used for monitoring  Weed and Seed sites.
