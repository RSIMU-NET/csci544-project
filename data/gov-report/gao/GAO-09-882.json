According to IRS, about 90 percent of fraudulently claimed refunds were stopped in 2008 with about $15 million issued before IRS became aware of the fraud. IRS does not know the amount of refund or employment fraud that goes undetected. In 2008, IRS began implementing four new initiatives in an effort to better detect and resolve identity theft cases. These include an identity theft indicator that IRS places on victims' accounts so that IRS personnel can more easily recognize and assist the legitimate taxpayer in case of future account problems. The indicator further enables IRS to screen returns to prevent fraudulent refunds from being issued to identity thieves. IRS also decided to resolve legitimate taxpayers' identity theft problems using a decentralized process--the activity that discovers a problem has the responsibility to resolve it. For the 2010 filing season, IRS is considering whether to expand its screening; however, IRS does not know how well its current strategy is working. IRS said it will develop performance measures, but it is not known whether the measures will be suitable for determining the effectiveness of the new initiatives, such as the number of false positives and negatives in the screening process or the success of the decentralized resolution process. Nor is it known when the new measures will be implemented. Measuring effectiveness matters because there have been glitches in implementing the initiatives. IRS is working to correct some discrepancies in the screening process and a GAO analysis of IRS data showed that some fraudulent refunds were issued even though taxpayers had indicators on their accounts. IRS's coordination with other agencies is limited. Statutory Provisions protecting the privacy of tax data prohibit IRS from sharing taxpayer information with other agencies in many cases. Nor does IRS routinely receive identity theft case data because of concerns with substantiation. IRS has coordinated with other agencies on how to manage identity theft programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Identity theft is a serious and growing problem in the United States.  According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), millions of people  have been victims of the crime, some of whom may go years without  knowing it. The crime takes many forms; identity thieves may obtain a  credit card, rent an apartment, or establish a telephone account in the  theft victim\u2019s name. The victim may not find out about the theft until being  contacted by a debt collector, losing out on a job opportunity, or being  denied a loan. Identity theft creates two main problems for taxpayers and  IRS. A taxpayer may have his or her tax refund delayed if an identity thief  files a fraudulent tax return seeking a refund using the legitimate  taxpayer\u2019s name and Social Security number (SSN). In addition, a taxpayer  may become subject to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) enforcement  actions after someone else uses his or her identity to fraudulently obtain  employment and the identity thief\u2019s income is reported to IRS by an  employer on a Form W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement) or Form 1099  information returns in his or her name.", "In 2004, IRS developed a strategy to address the problem of identity theft- related tax administration issues. According to IRS, the strategy has  evolved and continues to serve as the foundation for all of IRS\u2019s efforts to  provide services to victims of identity theft and to reduce the effects of  identity theft on tax administration. The original strategy was revised in  July 2008 and renamed IRS\u2019s Identity Protection Strategy by the Office of  Privacy, Information Protection and Data Security (PIPDS), created by IRS  to reach across all IRS organizations on issues of privacy, identity theft,  and data security. The IRS strategy focuses on three priority areas that are  fundamental to addressing the identity theft challenge: victim assistance,  outreach, and prevention.", "In this context, you asked us to assess IRS\u2019s efforts to address the impact  of identity theft on taxpayers. The objectives of this report are to (1)  describe how much identity theft-related refund and employment fraud  IRS faces and whether incidents of identity theft go undetected by IRS, (2)  assess the actions IRS is taking to prevent and detect identity theft-related  tax problems and to assist affected taxpayers, and (3) describe what IRS is  doing to coordinate its identity theft-related efforts with those of other  government and nongovernment entities.", "To meet our objectives, we analyzed IRS data on identity theft cases,  reviewed documentation on IRS\u2019s identity theft strategy, and interviewed  responsible IRS executives. More specifically, we reviewed documents on  policies and procedures related to identity theft and relevant sections of  the Internal Revenue Manual and interviewed officials from PIPDS, Wage  and Investment Division (W&I), Small Business/Self-Employed Division  (SB/SE), and Criminal Investigation Division (CI) to determine the  processes and procedures used by IRS to prevent and detect identity theft- related tax issues and assist affected taxpayers. We also reviewed prior  GAO and Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA)  reports on these procedures. We also reviewed IRS\u2019s Identity Protection  Strategy. To assess whether IRS\u2019s initiatives were working as intended, we  obtained data from the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) and IRS to  identify (1) the frequency with which suspected identity theft-related  refund fraud reoccurred for taxpayers known to have had identity theft  issues in the past and (2) how often taxpayers took identity theft-related  tax problems to TAS after other IRS functions had determined that their  issues were identity theft-related. We determined that the IRS data that we  used for this analysis were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also  interviewed PIPDS officials and reviewed PIPDS documents to obtain  information on IRS\u2019s coordination efforts with law enforcement and other  government entities. Detailed information about our methodology can be  found in appendix I. We conducted this performance audit from October  2008 through August 2009 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Identity theft describes a wide range of types of theft and uses of stolen  information. According to the FTC, the most common form of identity  theft is the use of another person\u2019s information to obtain credit and then  acquire goods or services, not pay for them, and thus damage the credit  rating of the identity theft victim.", "As already noted, identity theft most commonly becomes a tax  administration problem for victims and IRS in two primary ways. First, an  identity thief may use a legitimate taxpayer\u2019s identity to fraudulently file a  tax return and claim a refund during the filing season. In these cases, the  identity thief typically uses a stolen SSN to file a forged tax return and  obtain a refund early in the filing season. The legitimate owner of the SSN  may not be aware that this has occurred until he or she files a tax return  later in the filing season and IRS discovers that two returns have been filed  using the same SSN. In this instance, the legitimate taxpayer\u2019s refund will  likely be frozen until IRS can determine the legitimate owner of the SSN.  The second way that identity theft becomes a problem for taxpayers and  for IRS is through employment fraud. This occurs when an identity thief  uses someone else\u2019s name and SSN to obtain a job. In this instance, IRS  would receive a Form W-2 or a Form 1099 reporting income on the  taxpayer\u2019s account, which the rightful owner of the SSN had not earned  and does not report as income to IRS. As a result, the taxpayer may be  subject to enforcement action when, during the filing process, IRS  matches what the employer and the taxpayer report and it appears that he  or she earned more income than was reported on his or her tax return. In a  related type of case, an identity thief uses just the SSN of a legitimate  taxpayer and the thief\u2019s own or a made up name. This also creates tax  administration problems (as well as problems for the Social Security  Administration) because the same SSN is now associated with multiple  names. The name and SSN information used by identity thieves to commit  refund or employment fraud are typically stolen from sources beyond the  control of IRS. In many cases, the source of the stolen information is  unknown. Someone who makes up an SSN that does not match a  legitimate SSN and uses it to gain employment has failed to comply with  legal requirements to supply a valid SSN but has not committed identity  theft because no person\u2019s identity was stolen.", "Identity theft can also involve IRS in other ways, such as when thieves  masquerade as IRS in order to steal information over the Internet through  phishing schemes\u2014using e-mail or Web sites to impersonate IRS and ask  for personal and financial information from unsuspecting victims.  According to IRS, there are a variety of online schemes that victimize  taxpayers. \u201cGet Your Refund\u201d phishing e-mails appear to be legitimate e- mails from IRS notifying a taxpayer that they are entitled to a refund and  can claim it quickly by clicking on a fraudulent link within the e-mail and  providing their personally identifiable information. Fraudulent free e-file  Web sites claim to be legitimate free e-file Web sites. Once a taxpayer  enters his or her tax information, the identity thief enters his or her own  bank account number and then steals the refund along with the taxpayer\u2019s  personal information, such as the SSN. Other schemes include surveys and  malware. Surveys are usually sent through e-mails, where the fraudulent  party masquerades as IRS asking taxpayers to rate their experience with  IRS. Malware is an executable file sent through an e-mail, which asks the  recipient to save and run a file. Once the file runs, information is pulled  from the victim\u2019s computer and sent to the fraudulent party. Identity theft  can also involve IRS when IRS loses taxpayer data in either electronic  form, such as information stored on a lost laptop computer, or on paper,  such as documents lost in transit when being sent from one IRS facility to  another. However, lost taxpayer data will not result in identity theft unless  the data were found by an identity thief who uses the data for personal  gain. Figure 1 describes the ways that identity theft issues come to light for  IRS and taxpayers.", "Federal and state legislatures have toughened laws that prohibit the theft  of identities. In October 1998, Congress passed the Identity Theft and  Assumption Deterrence Act, which expanded the criminalization of fraud  in connection with identification documents to cover the unlawful transfer  and use of identification documents. The law addresses identity theft by  including instances when someone \u201cknowingly transfers or uses, without  lawful authority, a means of identification of another person with the  intent to commit, or to aid or abet, any unlawful activity that constitutes a  violation of Federal law, or that constitutes a felony under any applicable  State or local law.\u201d According to the President\u2019s Identity Theft Task Force,  all 50 states and the District of Columbia have some form of legislation  that prohibits identity theft, and in all of those jurisdictions, except Maine,  identity theft can be prosecuted as a felony.", "In addition to congressional efforts to combat identity theft, there have  been administrative efforts as well. The President\u2019s Identity Theft Task  Force was established in May 2006 by Executive Order 13402. The task  force was created to coordinate federal agencies in their efforts against  identity theft and to create a strategic plan to combat (increase awareness  of, prevent, detect, and prosecute) identity theft.", "Victims of identity theft can file a complaint with the FTC. The FTC  maintains an Identity Theft Data Clearinghouse, which is the sole national  repository of consumer complaints on identity theft. In 2008, the FTC  received 313,982 identity theft complaints, a large increase over the  number reported in prior years, as shown in figure 2.", "Intending to strengthen IRS\u2019s enterprisewide approach to identity theft  and data security, IRS established PIPDS in July 2007.

A technical working group was formed to provide a forum for  developing recommendations on how processes and procedures can be  improved to address and reduce the burden on taxpayers who are victims  of identity theft. Additionally, IRS established two advisory committees to  oversee Identity Theft and Incident Management and Online Fraud  Detection and Prevention activities. The advisory committees include  executive management from Small Business/Self-Employed (SB/SE), Wage  and Investment (W&I), Criminal Investigation (CI), and the Taxpayer  Advocate Service (TAS)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Ability to Detect and Catalog Current Identity Theft Incidents Is Limited and the Amount That Goes Undetected Is Not Known", "paragraphs": ["IRS began systemically cataloging data on identity theft incidents in  January 2008, but limitations on the data mean that the data provides an  incomplete picture of the amount of identity theft-related fraud occurring  at IRS. IRS catalogs identity theft incidents after identifying a possible  case, validating that identity theft-related fraud occurred, and  substantiating the identity of the victim taxpayer. Because of the timing of  tax return filing, IRS is often unable to detect suspicious cases until well  after the fraud occurred. Validating the identity theft and substantiating  the victim\u2019s identity takes further time. For example, IRS may not be able  to detect potential employment fraud until after the following year\u2019s tax  filing deadline of April 15 when it matches Form W-2 information against  filed tax returns. It is only after IRS notifies a taxpayer of unreported  income that IRS may learn from the taxpayer that the income was not his  or hers and that someone else must have been using his or her identity. By  the time both the victim and IRS determine that an identity theft incident  occurred, well over a year may have passed since the employment fraud.", "Time lags are not the only issue obscuring a complete picture of identity  theft tax cases at IRS. Some cases go undetected altogether. One reason  for this is that IRS does not investigate every case of potential employment  fraud. Because of the large volume of mismatches between what is  reported on a Form W-2 or a Form 1099 information return and what is  reported on an income tax return, and also because of IRS\u2019s limited  resources, IRS does not pursue some mismatches. Consequently, IRS is  not in a position to detect any underlying identity theft in those cases.  Also, if an identity thief steals the identity of a person with no tax filing  obligation, such as a child, and files returns and pays taxes using the name  and SSN of that person, IRS may have no way of detecting the identity  theft.

CI may  ultimately refer refund schemes to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for  possible criminal prosecution. According to data from CI, the median  amount of suspected identity theft-related refunds identified during the  2009 filing season was about $3,400.", "Over the past 4 years, CI has investigated a number of tax-related identity  theft cases that DOJ successfully prosecuted. For example, a former Girl  Scout troop leader is now serving 10 years in federal prison for using  children\u2019s identities to defraud the government. The defendant pleaded  guilty to multiple counts of filing fictitious tax refund claims and identity  theft. The defendant created fake medical release forms for her troop  members and told their parents that she needed the girls\u2019 SSNs in case of  an emergency. The scheme helped her claim more than $87,000 in  fraudulent tax refunds.", "According to CI data, in 2008, IRS stopped about 90 percent of suspected  identity theft-related refunds it identified as shown in table 3. For the  other 10 percent, a majority of the refunds were issued to suspected  identity thieves before the legitimate taxpayer filed their return. It is only  when IRS finds a duplicate tax return (a second return filed using the same  name and SSN) that IRS has an indication of potential refund fraud.", "As shown in table 3, about $15 million in fraudulent refund payments were  issued in calendar year 2008. IRS officials said that they could not  determine how many of those refunds have been recovered. They said that  in instances where CI opens a criminal investigation and the government  successfully prosecutes the identity thief, upon conviction the perpetrator  may be ordered by the court to pay restitution. However, this process may  take a long time, and it is rarely possible to associate any restitution paid  with a specific refund fraud incident because these prosecutions generally  involve more than fraudulent refund schemes.

PIPDS also stated that it has contracted with a consultant to help develop  a suite of performance measures by the end of 2009. However, at the time  we concluded our work, it was not known whether the performance  measures will answer the types of questions we outlined above.  Furthermore, for the measures to be in place in time to assess the  initiatives performance during the 2010 filing season, timely action will be  required. The measures will need to be developed early enough to give IRS  time to develop a plan for capturing the data needed to implement the  measures.", "The answers to questions such as those listed above were not available  when IRS designed its identity theft initiatives. IRS did not have an  empirical basis for knowing what approach, such as having IRS activities  rather than IPSU resolve cases, would work best. Furthermore, there have  been some glitches with implementation. PIPDS officials told us that they  are aware that some IRS activities have not been consistent in how they  applied the identity theft indicators, causing some discrepancies in how  returns were run through the screening procedures. For example, some  activities would put the indicator on the taxpayer\u2019s account before  ensuring that the information by the identity thief was removed from the  taxpayer\u2019s account. Therefore, this resulted in legitimate taxpayer\u2019s  returns failing the business rule screening and may have delayed the  taxpayer\u2019s refund. In June 2009, PIPDS officials subsequently met with the  different IRS activities to revise their procedures for placing indicators on  taxpayer accounts before the 2010 filing season.", "Our own review of the effectiveness of the identity theft indicator and  screening process also uncovered some possible issues. We compared IRS  data from PIPDS and CI to test whether IRS issued refunds to suspected  identity thieves in cases where there was already a 501 or 506 identity theft  indicator on the account of the innocent taxpayer. We used the limited  data available for 2009 because we wanted to look at cases handled after  the new initiatives were put in place. As shown in table 5, we found that  IRS failed to prevent a fraudulent refund 15 times in early 2009 even  though the account had an identity theft indicator. During the same period,  CI stopped 3,281 refunds, 14 percent of which had an identity theft  indicator on the associated taxpayer account. Our analysis covers only  part of the year and the initiatives are still new, so it is not possible to  know whether this represents the long-term effectiveness of the initiative  or not.", "Further, according to TAS officials, the number of TAS cases that involved  identity theft issues in the first half of fiscal year 2009 was more than twice  as high as it was in the same period in fiscal year 2008. Based on analyzing  Taxpayer Advocate data, 8,880 taxpayers for whom TAS opened cases  with identity theft issues in the first half of fiscal year 2009, 943 (about 11  percent) contacted TAS on their own initiative after another IRS activity  had already placed a 501 or 506 indicator on their accounts. The presence  of the indicator means that IRS was already working to resolve the  taxpayer\u2019s tax problems before the taxpayer contacted TAS. As with our  analysis of the screening process, these results need to be interpreted with  caution. TAS policy is to always note identity theft problems in the TAS  database, even when the taxpayer contacted TAS about a different  problem. In addition, because the indicators were so new we cannot be  sure that the TAS data reflect their long-term effects. Also, some of the  communication with taxpayers about their identity theft issues included  TAS contact information, and PIPDS officials noted that some taxpayers  may have contacted TAS thinking that it was the IRS office to which they  should direct their questions.", "Our analysis of screening program results and TAS data suggests that IRS\u2019s  identity theft initiatives could be having a positive effect, but the evidence  is not at all conclusive. The results do show that the initiatives have had  some glitches; for example, some fraudulent refund payments were made  despite the presence of an indicator.

Finally,  according to officials, some institutions are reluctant to share specific  information about online fraud perpetrated against them. To help  overcome this, officials stated that they are working with organizations  such as the National Cyber Forensics and Training Alliance, Anti-Phishing  Working Group, and others, to facilitate and improve information sharing  about fraud schemes.", "IRS has considered additional steps to help combat phishing and similar  identity theft schemes such as providing a list of legitimate Web sites.

Specifically, in  January 2009 we reported that IRS did not consistently implement controls  that were intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to its  systems and information. We noted that IRS did not always (1) enforce  strong password management for properly identifying and authenticating  users and (2) authorize user access, including access to personally  identifiable information, to permit only the access needed to perform job  functions. For example, the agency allowed authenticated users on its  network access to shared drives containing taxpayer information as well  as performance appraisal information for IRS employees including their  SSNs.

In these cases IRS can make investigative disclosures, i.e.,  the sharing of specific, limited information necessary for receiving  information from other agencies that might support or further IRS\u2019s  investigation. Disclosure of taxpayer information to state and local law  enforcement agencies is even more limited. As mentioned previously,  officials stated that IRS is currently investigating processes to securely  transmit compromised credit card information to banks.", "IRS officials also noted that tax fraud is not one of the 11 felony offenses  enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a71028A, the Aggravated Identity Theft Statute.  This means that in federal identity theft prosecutions, identity thieves  would not be subject to the enhanced sentencing prescribed in the statute,  an additional 2-year term of imprisonment. They also stated that this may  be one factor that deters other federal law enforcement agencies and  federal prosecutors from referring identity theft cases to IRS to look for  possible tax fraud or making identity theft-related tax fraud a priority  when determining which cases to pursue.", "According to PIPDS officials, activities that place 501 and 504 indicators  on taxpayer accounts do not routinely accept information about identity  theft victims from other federal agencies or other external parties. IRS  does not routinely accept this information because it does not meet IRS\u2019s  substantiation requirements.", "Section 6103 does not limit IRS\u2019s ability to share more general information  about how to manage identity theft. PIPDS has coordinated with private  industry leaders, tax professionals, and other federal agencies on identity  theft prevention, detection, and taxpayer assistance about how to handle  tax-related identity theft issues and to share information about the  increase in online fraud threats. PIPDS officials also meet with officials  from other federal agencies such as SSA, FTC, and DHS and held a forum  in July 2008 to share information on the effects of identity theft on victims  and to identify best practices for preventing and resolving identity theft  issues. According to PIPDS, one result of the forum was that IRS co- sponsored, along with the FTC, DHS, US Postal Inspection Service,  Department of Commerce, DOJ, and the Securities and Exchange  Commission, an educational website, www.onguardonline.gov. IRS is also  coordinating with agencies to shut down phishing sites and online fraud  schemes. According to CI and PIPDS, they are members of the Identity  Theft Enforcement Interagency Working Group which shares information  about leading identity theft activities, groups, and offenders with federal  agencies that pursue identity theft cases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["While identity theft is known to cause tax problems for a relatively small  number of taxpayers, for those affected the problems can be severe and  include refunds frozen and time wasted. In an effort to more efficiently  identify refund fraud and employment fraud as well as to assist innocent  taxpayers, IRS put in place four new initiatives. Although IRS management  has begun to develop performance measures, it is not known how well the  measures will assess the effectiveness of the four initiatives.", "Furthermore, it would be desirable to have the new measures in place for  the 2010 filing season for at least two reasons. First, most refund fraud is  committed during the filing season and also most employment fraud is  detected as part of the filing process. Second, IRS is expanding the identity  theft initiatives for the 2010 filing season. Without performance measures  in place, neither Congress nor IRS management will know whether the  2010 changes are effective or if additional changes are needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ensure that  performance measures suitable for assessing the effectiveness of its  identity theft initiatives, and associated data collection procedures, are in  place at the beginning of the 2010 filing season."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Commissioner of Internal Revenue provided written comments on a  draft of this report in an August 31, 2009, letter, which is reprinted in  appendix IV.

We discussed the  processes and systems used to identify identity theft-related refund fraud  and IRS\u2019s use of the identity theft indicators. Additionally, we analyzed  information from PIPDS on the number and characteristics of identity  theft-related refund and employment fraud by cases and affected  taxpayers, including the activity reporting the incident and the type of  identity theft indicator placed on the taxpayer account. Based on the  information we collected on the identity theft-related incidents and  affected taxpayers, we also were able to discuss the outcomes of the  identity theft-related refund fraud cases and identify the reasons which  incidents of identity theft go undetected.", "To determine the reliability of the PIPDS data sets, we interviewed  knowledgeable officials to discuss processes followed to upload the  taxpayer data, collection methods, and the data reported on and for what  purpose. We also reviewed related documentation to determine the  accuracy of the 2008 year-end aggregate numbers of taxpayers affected  and identity indicators placed on accounts. PIPDS provided us with  monthly reports on the number of taxpayers affected and incidents  reported as well as an annual report totaling these numbers. We compared  the monthly reports to the aggregated data to identify any obvious errors  in accuracy and completeness. We determined that the PIPDS data we  used for this objective were sufficiently reliable for this assessment.", "To assess what actions IRS is taking to prevent and detect identity theft- related problems and to assist affected taxpayers, we interviewed officials  from PIPDS, W&I, SB/SE, CI, the Online Fraud Detection and Prevention  office (OFDP), and the Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS). We discussed  new initiatives IRS has implemented to detect and resolve identity theft as  well as assist affected taxpayers and educate taxpayers about identity  theft. We also reviewed prior GAO work to obtain information on identity  theft-related issues in the federal government and on systems used to  safeguard IRS data and to identify identity theft-related incidents, as well  as Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) reports to  obtain information on the identity theft-related processes and procedures  used by IRS. Additionally, we collected and analyzed IRS\u2019s Identity  Protection Strategy, policies and procedures related to identity theft  prevention and detection and assistance, relevant sections of the Internal  Revenue Manual and Internal Revenue Code, and governmentwide  guidance on performance measures. To understand how IRS implemented  some of the new initiatives, we visited the Andover, Massachusetts  campus and reviewed processes followed by the Identity Protection  Specialized Unit (IPSU) and the Baltimore call center to listen to calls  taken by customer service representatives on the identity theft hotline.  Additionally, we met with and reviewed the software used by the OFDP  staff when taking down a fraudulent Web site. For these new initiatives,  we collected data on the number of affected taxpayers whose records had  identity theft indicators, the number of cases worked by the IPSU,  information on calls received by the dedicated identity theft call-in  number, and the number of fraudulent Web sites taken down by OFDP. We  reviewed the data and documents provided by IRS in conjunction with  discussions with IRS officials in order to describe these new initiatives as  well as to understand the extent to which IRS had performance measures  to determine the effectiveness of the new initiatives. We used previous  GAO work and recommendations to describe systems and information  security weaknesses and assessed how these weaknesses may translate to  identity theft-related issues for IRS and taxpayers.", "To assess whether IRS\u2019s initiatives were working as intended, we  interviewed PIPDS and TAS officials and used IRS and TAS data to  identify (1) the frequency with which suspected identity theft-related  refund fraud reoccurred for taxpayers known to have had identity theft  issues in the past and (2) how often taxpayers took identity theft-related  tax problems to TAS after other IRS functions had determined that their  issues were related to identity theft. To assess whether the business rules  were working as intended, we tested suspected identity theft-related  refunds that were identified by CI to determine how many of the  corresponding taxpayers had indicators on their accounts before the  refunds were stopped or issued by IRS. To perform this assessment we  received from PIPDS taxpayer data on all taxpayer accounts that had  indicators on them. We also received from CI taxpayer data on all  suspected identity theft-related refunds that were identified, stopped, and  issued by IRS from January 1, 2009, through April 30, 2009. To assess how  often taxpayers took their issues to TAS after an identity theft indicator  had been placed on their accounts, we compared taxpayer data from TAS  with identity theft as a primary or secondary issue code to data from  PIPDS identifying all taxpayer accounts with identity theft indicators. We  compared the dates the identity theft indicator was placed on the accounts  to the dates when TAS received the cases. Additionally, we reviewed the  reason why the cases came to TAS based on each identity theft indicator.  We requested TAS cases received from October 1, 2008, through May 18,  2009, and PIPDS indicator data from calendar year 2008.", "We received taxpayer data from PIPDS, CI, and TAS. To ensure the  reliability of the data, we performed an analysis using Statistical Analysis  Software (SAS) to test for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness.  Additionally, we reviewed related reports to determine if there were any  discrepancies in the data we received. Any questions we had about the  data were answered by knowledgeable officials with whom we also  discussed the processes followed to upload the taxpayer data, collection  methods, and the data reported on and for what purpose.

We also reviewed  documentation provided by IRS officials, a recorded version of the IRS  identity protection forum held in July 2008, and previous GAO work. We  also reviewed an IRS general counsel analysis and discussion of Section  6103 of the Internal Revenue Code to determine the circumstances in  which IRS can share information with other federal agencies, law  enforcement employers, and the taxpayers for identity theft-related refund  and employment fraud issues.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2008 through August  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
