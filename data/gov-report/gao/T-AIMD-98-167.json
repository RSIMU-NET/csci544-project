Key economic sectors of the nation are also vulnerable. These include state and local governments; telecommunications; banking and finance; health, safety, and emergency services; transportation; utilities; and manufacturing and small business.

However, with this electronic dependence and massive exchanging of data comes increasing risk that uncorrected Year 2000 problems in other countries will adversely affect the United States.

This is cause for some concern, as replacement systems are often a high risk because federal agencies, and USDA in particular, have a long history of difficulty in delivering planned systems on time.

GIPSA and RMA reported 1 and 14 systems, respectively, as compliant, even though these systems were under development or were planned. The GIPSA Year 2000 Executive Sponsor stated that the GIPSA system was reported as compliant because the system is replacing a manual process. According to the RMA Year 2000 Program Manager, RMA systems were reported as compliant because they were being developed as compliant. We do not agree with GIPSA and RMA. It is misleading to list systems as compliant when work is still to be completed. USDA\u2019s Year 2000 Program Executive stated that he agreed that these systems should not be listed as compliant.", "At the same time that USDA is facing an enormous challenge to replace, repair, and retire its mission-critical systems, component agencies are beginning to report losses of information technology staff. While USDA has not performed a departmentwide assessment of its Year 2000 technology staffing needs and losses, several component agencies have recently expressed concern that the loss of staff will affect their ability to complete their Year 2000 programs. For example, FSA stated that it had lost 28 of 403 (7 percent) of its information technology staff between October 1997 and April 1998, and Forest Service officials said that they lost 12 information technology staff in the past 5 months. Moreover, in its May 1998 report, Forest Service reported losing contractors to better paying positions. The CIO has taken some action, such as obtaining a waiver from the Office of Personnel Management that allows USDA to rehire former federal personnel without financial penalty.

Although all of the component agencies we reviewed performed some form of project tracking, many of the component agencies\u2019 Year 2000 program offices did not track baseline to actual completion dates for project milestones, or track the percentage of milestone completion. Also, Forest Service currently performs detailed tracking for only its major applications but plans to perform such tracking for all of its applications in the future. Moreover, while three component agencies tracked actual costs, one did not, and others tracked some costs but not others, such as contractor costs but not staffing.", "As expressed in our Year 2000 readiness guide, the scope of a component agency\u2019s testing and validation requires careful planning; accordingly, overall testing and validation strategies should initially be developed during the assessment phase. However, eight of the ten component agencies in our review lacked such strategies; only FNS and FSA had them. Moreover, in some agencies\u2014such as NASS and FSIS\u2014only the programmers who made the changes or developed the systems determined the scope of the tests to be completed. In addition, while FNS had a testing strategy, it planned to implement this strategy only for about half of its mission-critical systems; it lacks a testing strategy for the other mission-critical systems. According to an FNS official, the other systems will be tested through a combination of the responsible contractor or FNS staff who made the change and user acceptance testing. One of these systems is vital to ensuring that schools and other entities are reimbursed for providing food services to children and adults.", "In reviewing the test documentation of systems that were repaired or replaced at FNS and FSA to determine whether their testing strategies were followed for the three systems that these agencies reported as Year 2000 compliant, we found mixed results.", "The FNS system, called the National Integrated Quality Control System\u2014used by state welfare agencies to perform federally-mandated quality control functions\u2014was not one of the systems covered by FNS\u2019 test strategy, and we were unable to verify whether the system was indeed Year 2000 compliant. The system was replaced by a contractor who conducted limited Year 2000 testing; neither FNS nor the contractor had developed test plans for the system. Further, while FNS utilized its regional offices and nine states for acceptance testing, it did not provide instructions on what to test, and had no documentation concerning exactly what was tested. As a result, FNS officials did not know whether the testing included any Year 2000 test scenarios.", "Two FSA mission-critical systems had more positive results. Written test plans existed, the testing was carried out by an independent organization, and test result documentation showed that sufficient testing had been performed to determine that the system was Year 2000 compliant.", "Turning to business continuity and contingency planning, most of the component agencies intended to develop contingency plans only for specific systems or only if the systems were likely to miss the USDA March 1999 deadline for compliance. Agencies that develop contingency plans only for systems currently behind schedule, however, are not addressing the need to ensure the continuity of a minimal level of core business operations in the event of unforeseen failures. As a result, when unpredicted failures occur, agencies will not have well-defined responses and may not have enough time to develop and test effective contingency plans. Contingency plans should be formulated to respond to two types of failures: those that can be predicted (e.g., system renovations that are already far behind schedule) and those that are unforeseen (e.g., a system that fails despite having been certified as Year 2000 compliant or a system that cannot be corrected by January 1, 2000, despite appearing to be on schedule today).", "Moreover, contingency plans that focus only on agency systems are inadequate. Federal agencies depend on data provided by their business partners as well as on services provided by the public infrastructure (e.g., power, water, transportation, and voice and data telecommunications). One weak link anywhere in the chain of critical dependencies can cause major disruptions to business operations. Given these interdependencies, it is imperative that contingency plans be developed for all critical core business processes and supporting systems, regardless of whether these systems are owned by the agency. NASS was the only component agency in our review that had drafted a plan to address the agency\u2019s options in the event that Year 2000-induced failures do not enable it to use its normal processes to develop and issue its January 2000 statistical reports.

Priority setting has, rather, been left to the individual component agencies, which determined which systems are mission-critical.", "The component agencies judged systems to be mission-critical in an inconsistent manner. For example, while Forest Service tells us that it has 17 mission-critical systems, it has reported to the department that it has 423 mission-critical systems. This is because Forest Service reported applications and not systems. Forest Service reports applications rather than systems because it tracks its system migration and Year 2000 project at the application level. Further, not all of these applications are critical.

This information was updated in February 1998.

As I stated earlier, business continuity and contingency plans should be formulated to respond to those types of failures that can be predicted (e.g., system renovations that are already far behind schedule) and those that are unforeseen (e.g., a system that fails despite having been certified as Year 2000 compliant or a system that cannot be corrected by January 1, 2000, despite appearing to be on schedule today). In response to our review, FCA officials stated that they would issue an information memorandum by the end of May requiring institutions to develop business continuity and contingency plans for all core business processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commodity Futures Trading Commission", "paragraphs": ["CFTC\u2019s mission is to protect market participants from manipulation, fraud, and abusive trade practices, related to the sale of commodity futures and options and to foster open, competitive, and financially sound commodity futures and options markets. CFTC works in conjunction with self-regulatory organizations (SRO), such as the commodity exchanges and independent clearinghouses to regulate these markets. All companies and individuals handling customer funds or providing trading advice must register with the Commission and be a member of at least one of these organizations. SROs audit their member institutions, and CFTC regularly reviews SROs\u2019 audit activities. The SROs and member institutions are, not surprisingly, very reliant on information technology, with many interdependencies among them; these include foreign firms and exchanges as well. Major Year 2000 failures could easily, then, have worldwide economic repercussions.", "CFTC reports having two mission-critical systems, which it states it repaired to be Year 2000 compliant in 1993 and 1994. It has also inventoried and assessed its external data exchanges, telecommunications, and personal computers; it plans to upgrade its personal computers and network servers next month and replace noncompliant equipment and a noncompliant network operating system by March 1999.", "Regarding CFTC\u2019s oversight of SROs, on March 18, 1998, CFTC sent a letter to all exchanges and independent clearinghouses requesting information on the Year 2000 readiness status of SRO, SRO\u2019s member firms, and floor brokers and floor traders. In particular, CFTC requested information on (1) contingency plans, both with regard to processes that cannot be made compliant in the necessary time frame and for instances in which, despite the best plans, procedures developed to address the Year 2000 problem do not work, (2) whether and how SRO can ensure full participation in the Year 2000 testing being planned by the Futures Industry Association, and (3) SRO\u2019s authority under its own rules to intervene and, if necessary, restrict or terminate the member\u2019s business, and what procedures would apply. CFTC asked SROs to provide the information by May 15, 1998. CFTC has a coordinator for external Year 2000 activities who will evaluate SRO responses with assistance from CFTC\u2019s Office of Information Resources Management, which is in charge of CFTC\u2019s internal systems, and CFTC\u2019s audit and evaluation group.", "Although CFTC has not yet reviewed the Year 2000 readiness of the SRO member institutions, it has worked with the SRO audit organization, the Joint Audit Committee. The members of this committee have requested that the registrants for which they are responsible fill out questionnaires on their Year 2000 progress. According to CFTC\u2019s Chief Accountant, CFTC\u2019s auditors will (1) confirm that the SRO auditors had sent the questionnaires to its members, (2) determine whether SRO auditors had reviewed the questionnaires for completeness and unusual items, and (3) determine whether SRO auditors had followed up on any exceptions found. However, because CFTC does not have any electronic data processing auditors, it may have difficulty assessing the SRO\u2019s Year 2000 audit activities.", "CFTC also issued advisory notices, in November 1997 and April 1998, and has participated in meetings with the Futures Industry Association. The advisory notices asked the SROs to report on their Year 2000 programs, asked the SRO auditors to include a Year 2000 readiness inquiry to their inspections, set disclosure requirements for institutions with Year 2000 problems, and strongly encouraged registrants to share information with SROs and membership organizations.", "While CFTC has taken some action to address the effect the year 2000 will have on the futures and options markets, the potential major disruption that the year 2000 could hold for these markets suggests that the commission should take a strong leadership role in providing reasonable assurance that the futures and options markets will be Year 2000 compliant in time.", "In conclusion, the change of century will present many difficult challenges in information technology and in ensuring the continuity of business operations, and has the potential to cause serious disruption to the nation and to government entities on which the public depends, including the Department of Agriculture. These risks can be mitigated and disruptions minimized with proper attention and management. However, much work remains at USDA and its agencies to address these risks and ensure continuity of mission-critical business operations. Continued congressional oversight through hearings such as this can help ensure that this attention is sustained and that appropriate actions are taken to address this crisis.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my statement.
