Federal law also requires the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to subsidize consumers' purchases of digital-to-analog converter boxes. After the transition, households with analog sets that rely on over-the-air broadcasts must take action or they will lose television service, but some households might not be aware of this potential disruption.

In fact, many stations are already broadcasting their full digital signal with the only remaining step being to turn off their analog signal. As of February 2008, 91 percent of broadcasters responding to our survey reported that they were already transmitting a digital signal. Nine percent of stations in our survey had yet to begin broadcasting a digital signal, but almost all of those stations expected to be broadcasting digitally by the transition date. In finalizing the transition to digital, some stations still must resolve technical, coordination, and construction issues. Technical issues include relocating either digital or analog antennas and, in some cases, constructing new broadcast towers. Some stations are bound by financial constraints related to the costs of resolving these issues. In addition, some stations have outstanding coordination issues, such as the U.S. government reaching agreements with the Canadian and Mexican governments regarding signal interference issues and coordinating with cable and satellite providers. Since most low-power stations will not transition to digital by February 2009, it is possible for viewers to receive programming in analog and digital after the transition. Potentially millions of viewers can receive low-power analog transmissions, including programming from the major networks, Spanish language broadcasting, and public television. To have access to both analog and digital television signals after the DTV transition, viewers could purchase a special kind of converter box that passes through an analog signal and a digital signal, or purchase other equipment. Public and private stakeholders have taken steps to educate the public about the low-power broadcasts potentially remaining in analog but some advocacy groups and others have expressed concerns that the messages intending to explain the low-power issue are instead confusing the public. Further complicating matters, many consumers do not know the difference between full-power and low-power stations or whether the signals they receive are full or low power. Most households will be unaffected by the DTV transition and a vast majority have heard of the transition. About 84 percent of people have heard of the transition, but fewer have more specific knowledge about the transition. Those at higher risk of being affected by the transition--households viewing over-the-air television signals--have higher levels of awareness than those who will be unaffected. Over half of the population has heard of the converter box subsidy program and those households at risk of losing television service who plan to take action are likely to utilize the program. However, only a third of those indicating plans to purchase boxes and utilize the coupons know how to obtain coupons. In addition, there are indications that some consumers are confused about the transition, as 45 percent of those households who are at risk plan inadequate or no action to prepare for the transition. Conversely, amongst those unaffected by the transition, 30 percent indicated they have plans to ready themselves for the transition--despite the fact that no action will be required to maintain television service."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our recently issued report on  technical issues arising from the digital television (DTV) transition \u2014  Digital Television Transition: Majority of Broadcasters Are Prepared for  the DTV Transition, but Some Technical and Coordination Issues  Remain\u2014and our work on the extent of consumer awareness about the  transition.

After that date, households who view television on analog sets solely  through the reception of over-the-air signals must take action to ensure  that they have the necessary equipment, such as a digital-to-analog  converter box, or subscription video service to be able to view the digital  broadcast signals. If they do not take such action, they will not be able to  watch television programs. The act also directed the National  Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to establish a  $1.5 billion program through which households can obtain coupons for the  purchase of digital-to-analog converter boxes. Beginning January 1, 2008,  households could request up to two $40 coupons toward the purchase of  eligible digital-to-analog converter boxes. While federal law mandates that  all full-power stations must cease to broadcast in analog on February 17,  2009, low-power television broadcast stations are not covered by the law.   Low-power stations provide opportunities for locally-oriented television  service in small communities and these stations may continue to broadcast  in analog after the DTV transition. Viewers who wish to continue watching  low-power analog programming might need to take action to continue  receiving analog signals after the transition. To help the public understand  the DTV transition and the various options they have, FCC, NTIA, and  industry stakeholders are conducting consumer education and awareness  programs.", "In my testimony today, I will discuss (1) the progress full-power broadcast  stations have made in transitioning to digital, as well as the technical and  coordination issues they face; (2) issues pertaining to low-power television  stations and how they affect consumers; and (3) the extent to which  American households are aware of the DTV transition and likely to utilize  the converter box subsidy program.", "To obtain information on the technical and coordination issues facing  broadcast stations, we conducted a Web-based survey of the full-power  commercial and noncommercial television broadcast stations. From a  total of 1,747 broadcasters, we surveyed 1,682 stations located in the 50  states and the District of Columbia for which we could obtain contact  information. To determine the extent of consumer awareness about the  transition, we commissioned a telephone survey of the U.S. adult  population. This survey followed a probability sampling procedure based  on random selections of households and individuals. A total of 1,010  completed interviews were collected during late March and early April  2008. All percentage estimates presented have margins of error of plus or  minus 6 percentage points or less. Further, we reviewed government  documents and data and interviewed officials with the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) and NTIA, as well as a wide variety  of industry and other private stakeholders, such as satellite and cable  television providers, manufacturers, national retailers, industry  associations, and consumer advocacy groups. See appendix I for more  detailed information on our scope and methodology. We conducted our  work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

There are numerous  benefits to transitioning to digital-only broadcast signals, such as enabling  better quality television picture and sound reception and using the  radiofrequency spectrum more efficiently than analog transmission. With  traditional analog technology, pictures and sounds are converted into  \u201cwaveform\u201d electrical signals for transmission through the radiofrequency  spectrum, while digital technology converts these pictures and sounds into  a stream of digits consisting of zeros and ones for transmission. A digital  receiver can make the digital picture and sound near perfect until  significant fading occurs, at which point no picture can be seen.", "To facilitate the digital transition, Congress and FCC temporarily provided  each eligible full-power television station (both commercial and  noncommercial educational stations, including public stations) with  additional spectrum so they could begin broadcasting a digital signal. This  companion, or paired, digital channel simulcasts the analog program  content in digital format. Assignment of the paired digital channel began in  1997 and FCC completed the digital channel assignment for most stations  in August 2007. A station\u2019s final digital channel could be (1) the same  channel as its paired digital channel, (2) the same channel that its analog  signal uses to broadcast, or (3) an entirely new channel.", "The DTV transition involves preparation on the part of American  households. This preparation will require citizens\u2019 understanding of the  transition and the actions that some might have to take to maintain  television service. The specific equipment needs for each household to  transition to DTV\u2014that is, to be able to view broadcast digital signals\u2014 depends on certain key factors. The method through which a household  watches television, and whether it has already upgraded its television  equipment to be compatible with digital television, will factor into the  equipment needs of the household. While many households may need to  take specific actions to ensure that they continue to receive television  signals, others may not need to take any action. As we have previously  reported, households with analog televisions that rely solely on over-the- air television signals received through a rooftop antenna or indoor antenna  must take action to be able to view digital broadcast signals after the  termination of analog broadcasting. Options available to these households  include (1) purchasing a digital television set that includes a tuner capable  of receiving, processing, and displaying a digital signal; (2) purchasing a  digital-to-analog converter box, which converts the digital broadcast  signals to analog so they can be viewed on an existing analog set; or (3)  subscribing to a cable, satellite, or other service that provides the  necessary signal to eliminate the need to acquire a digital-to-analog  converter box.", "The Digital Television Transition and Public Safety Act directed NTIA to  establish a $1.5 billion subsidy program through which households can  obtain coupons for the purchase of digital-to-analog converter boxes.  NTIA established that beginning January 1, 2008, households could request  up to two $40 coupons toward the purchase of eligible digital-to-analog  converter boxes. Households requesting coupons must submit the name of  the person requesting the coupon and a valid United States Postal Service  address. Initially, any household is eligible to request and receive the  coupons, but once $890 million worth of coupons have been redeemed,  and issued but not expired, NTIA must certify to Congress that the  program\u2019s initial allocation of funds is insufficient to fulfill coupon  requests. NTIA will then receive $510 million in additional program funds,  but any households requesting coupons during this second phase must  certify that they do not receive cable, satellite, or other pay television  service. Total possible program funding, which includes coupons  redeemed, and issued but not expired, is $1.5 billion. The last day for  consumers to request coupons is March 31, 2009, and coupons can be  redeemed through July 9, 2009. As required by law, all coupons expire 90  days after issuance. The fully funded program could provide 33.5 million  coupons.", "While all full-power broadcast stations must cease analog broadcasts, low- power stations may continue broadcasting in analog after February 17,  2009. FCC established low-power television service in 1982 to provide  opportunities for locally-oriented television service in small communities.  These communities may be in rural areas or may be individual  communities within larger urban areas. Low-power stations provide  programming from networks, syndicated programs, movies, and a wide  range of locally-produced programs. According to FCC, there are more  than 2,100 low-power stations in operation, some of which broadcast  syndicated content of major commercial networks and public television  and numerous other stations reaching a broad swath of the television  viewing public. Low-power broadcast stations are not required to cease  broadcasting in analog as of February 2009 and most will continue to  broadcast in analog after the conclusion of the full-power transition.

For example, over 13 percent of  stations responding to our survey indicated that they have to install or  relocate their digital or analog antennas in transitioning to digital. Some  stations still needed to order equipment, such as antennas, to build their  final digital facilities. According to an antenna manufacturer we contacted,  it can take from 6 weeks to 9 months to design, order, and install an  antenna, depending on the antenna\u2019s complexity. This manufacturer told  us that stations need to have their orders placed by June 2008 to be  assured of having the equipment installed prior to the transition date.  Furthermore, stations may have coordination issues to address in  completing their final digital facilities. For example, some stations are  awaiting agreements with the Canadian and Mexican governments  regarding their signals crossing the borders of these respective countries  before the stations can complete their digital facilities. Stations will also  need to coordinate with cable providers and satellite companies to ensure  that cable and satellite facilities can receive digital signals when the analog  signals are turned off; most of those responding to our survey indicated  that they are coordinating with or are planning to coordinate with cable  providers and satellite companies.

However, such a box could prevent the television  from receiving low-power analog signals. To have access to both analog  and digital television signals after the DTV transition, viewers could use a  special kind of converter box that passes through an analog signal and a  digital signal, often referred to as analog pass through. Absent a converter  box with analog pass through capability, viewers could obtain a small  device called a \u201csplitter.\u201d According to the National Association of  Broadcasters (NAB), installing the splitter and new wiring is similar to  connecting a television to a DVD player and VCR.", "Currently, converter boxes with analog pass through are available for  purchase online, and two national retailers indicated the boxes are  available in their stores now. The remaining national retailers we  contacted told us they would begin stocking such boxes in mid June  through early September.

The retailers we contacted said all of their stores will  be selling converter boxes with analog pass through, regardless of location  or prevalence of low-power stations. Some retailers said they are analyzing  market data to help them understand which markets will have increased  need for these boxes. For example, one retailer told us that it is analyzing  data to determine which markets will need and therefore initially receive  more boxes with analog pass through, with the goal of having boxes with  analog pass through in all stores later in the summer of 2008.", "Public and private stakeholders have taken steps to educate the public  about the low-power issue and the options available to consumers. For  example, FCC issued a consumer advisory which serves as a resource  guide on low-power television. Further, FCC is urging all low-power  broadcasters to immediately begin educating their viewers about this  issue. FCC noted that such stations could notify their viewers that they are  watching a low-power broadcast station that will continue to offer analog  service after the transition date and viewers that plan to purchase a  converter box should purchase a model with analog pass through. NTIA  also developed a resource guide. According to NTIA, it has provided  information to operators of low-power stations so they can inform their  viewers of the options they have regarding the DTV transition. NTIA said it  has encouraged converter box manufacturers to consider the needs of all  viewers, including viewers of low-power stations, in the development of  converter boxes. NAB and others have added information about low- power stations to their Web sites and clarified that only full-power stations  are transitioning in February 2009.

When looking specifically at awareness of the  transition date for age groups, 29 percent of 18- to 44-year-olds, 36 percent  of 45- to 64-year-olds, and 26 percent of those 65 and older knew the  month and date of the transition. As for the reason for the transition, 18- to  44-year-olds had the lowest percentage of those aware of why the  transition was taking place.", "Ethnicity: By ethnicity, those self-described as white or Caucasian had  higher general awareness (86 percent) than those nonwhite ethnic groups  (78 percent). This trend in awareness followed for the additional specific  questions about the transition and is more pronounced for the at-risk  groups. When high and medium risk households were asked about why the  transition was taking place, only 16 percent of nonwhite respondents were  knowledgeable compared with 45 percent in the white/Caucasian group.", "Income: Higher income was associated with greater awareness. For those  individuals with incomes from $15,000 to $34,000, 84 percent were aware;  for those with incomes ranging from $35,000 to $49,000, 90 percent were  aware; $50,000 to $99,000, 90 percent were aware; and for those making  over $100,000, 94 percent were aware. On the other hand, 69 percent of  those making less than $15,000 per year were aware of the transition.", "Disabilities: We found that 77 percent of those with disabilities were  aware of the transition.", "Community type: We found that awareness did not differ significantly in  different community types. In urban, suburban, and rural/small-town  groups, awareness was around 84 percent, similar to that of the  population. There was also little variance by region of the country: the  Northeast, Midwest, West, and South regions all showed similar  awareness.", "Our results indicate that, across all risk groups, television is the most  pervasive source of information about the transition. In particular, 82  percent of the population indicated they heard of the transition by  television. In addition, 45 percent said they had heard about the transition  by word-of-mouth and 30 percent from newspapers or magazines. Many  fewer (17 percent) had heard about the transition from the Internet and 11  percent heard about the transition from retail stores."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Households Planning to Take Action for the DTV Transition are Likely to Utilize the Converter Box Subsidy Program, but Many Household Plan to Take No Action to Prepare for the Transition", "paragraphs": ["Greater than half of the population is aware of the NTIA converter box  subsidy program, but more detailed knowledge of the program is much  weaker. Overall, awareness of the converter box subsidy program is at 55  percent. The high and medium risk groups have higher awareness, at 63  percent and 56 percent respectively, than the low risk group at 53 percent.  While general awareness of the subsidy program itself is relatively high, of  those households who intend to purchase a converter box and to request a  coupon from the NTIA program, only 33 percent were aware of how to  obtain a coupon.", "Those households who indicated that they were likely to purchase a  converter box reported very high rates of likelihood to request the  coupons. In the high risk group, of those who intend to purchase a  converter box, 100 percent of respondents said they were likely to request  a coupon. In the medium risk group, 89 percent of these households said  they were likely to request coupons. According to NTIA officials, the rate  of those requesting two coupons is approximately 89 percent.", "The intention of households to utilize the converter box subsidy program  if they plan on purchasing converter boxes is clear. However, the percent  of those who indicated they are likely to purchase a converter box in the  first place is much lower. In the high risk group, 49 percent, and in the  medium risk group, 32 percent of households are likely to purchase a  converter box. Additionally, 15 percent of households in the low risk  group said they would purchase a converter box when the transition takes  place. This indicates not only that some households may be confused or  unknowledgeable\u2014low risk households should not need converter  boxes\u2014but that households with no need for converter boxes may utilize  the subsidy program. Of the low risk households who plan to purchase a  converter box, 86 percent said they would utilize the NTIA subsidy  program. Based on an analysis of our survey, we estimate that households  will request roughly 30.6 million coupons. This estimate assumes that  households will follow through with their plans to request coupons.", "Despite high overall awareness of the DTV transition, many households  were unprepared for the transition. We describe as unprepared for the  DTV transition those in the medium or high risk groups who indicated that  for the transition, they will do nothing, they do not know what they will  do, or they specified some other action that will not prepare them for the  transition. Our analysis determined that 35 percent in the high risk group  were unprepared and 52 percent in the medium risk group were  unprepared. Overall, these unprepared groups make up 16 percent of the  total population. Amongst low risk households, 30 percent indicated they  have plans to ready themselves for the transition\u2014despite the fact that no  action is required to maintain television service.", "Thank you, Mr. Chairman, that concludes my statement.

We asked  the broadcasters questions related to their digital facilities, construction  plans, and issues affecting the digital transition. From a total of 1,747  broadcasters, we surveyed 1,682 stations located in the 50 states and the  District of Columbia for which we could obtain contact information. We  conducted our survey from December 2007 through February 2008 and  obtained completed questionnaires from 1,122 stations, for a response rate  of 66.7 percent. Of those completed questionnaires, 72 percent were from  commercial stations and 28 percent were from noncommercial stations.", "To obtain information on issues pertaining to low-power television  stations and how they affect consumers, we reviewed data from the  Federal Communications Commission and interviewed a wide variety of  industry and other private stakeholders, such as national retailers,  industry associations, and consumer advocacy groups.", "To determine the extent of consumer awareness about the transition, we  commissioned a telephone survey of the U.S. adult population. Our  objectives were to produce nationally representative estimates of (1)  knowledge and awareness of the DTV transition and sources of that  knowledge and awareness, (2) knowledge about the converter box coupon  program and likelihood to request one or two coupons, and (3) attitudes  about the impact of the conversion to digital television (e.g. level of  disruption) Although the survey was designed to measure these issues at  the population level, our intent was also to focus on several sub- populations, including (1) those most at risk of losing their television  signal, (2) those with lower household incomes, (3) older Americans, (4)  African Americans and Hispanics, and (5) those with disabilities. We  analyzed the comparisons between these sub-populations and report on  differences statistically significant at the 95 percent level. Percentage  estimates have margins of error of less than 6 percent.", "This survey of the American public was conducted from March 24, 2008 to  April 7, 2008 by a private research firm. A total of 1,010 completed  interviews were collected and calls were made to all 50 states.", "Telephone surveys require assumptions regarding the disposition of non-  contacted sample households that meet certain standards. For this survey  the response rates were calculated using American Association of Public  Opinion Research (AAPOR) Response Rate 3. Based on these  assumptions, the response rate for the survey is 38 percent. A random digit  dial (RDD) sampling frame was used that includes both listed and unlisted  numbers from working blocks of numbers in the United States.  Technically, it provides a near 100 percent coverage of all households with  landlines however; the RDD sampling frame approach cannot provide any  coverage of the increasing number of cell phone only households. The 30.6  million estimate for coupon requests (which ranges from 25.6 million to  35.5 million coupons) does not include 13.1 percent of the households that  are cell phone only households or 13.3 percent of the households for  which there was no telephone service or no reported telephone status.  While we could not substantiate an assumption that these households  would respond similarly to landline households, if they do, this could add  another 11 million coupon requests to the estimate. Additionally, the  number of households that decide to replace their television rather than  add the converter box could increase, which may decrease the demand for  converter boxes.", "Because many households contain more than one potential respondent,  obtaining an unbiased sample from an RDD frame requires the random  selection of the individual respondent from among all potential  respondents within the sampled household (as opposed to always  interviewing the individual who initially answers the phone). This was  accomplished using the most recent birthday method, in which the  interviewer requests to speak to the household member aged 18 or older  who had the most recent birthday. If the selected respondent was not  reachable after three call attempts, a substitute respondent was selected  from among household members 18 years of age or older who were  available at the time of the call, or an appointment was set for a household  member who was willing to participate at a later time.", "The results of this survey reflect an estimated awareness of the DTV  transition for the time frame of the survey only. Some questions in the  survey ask about the respondent\u2019s knowledge or awareness of the  transition and the coupon program. As consumer education about the  transition and the coupon program increases, the number of people aware  of the transition and the coupon program will probably increase.  Additionally, the respondent may not be the person in the household  responsible for obtaining a coupon or deciding how to handle the  transition. As a result, the individual response may indicate that the person  is unaware, but someone else in the household could be planning to take  care of the issue. As a result, we may overestimate the percentage of  unaware households.", "Finally, in the survey we asked respondents about likely behavior once the  transition occurred. Only those who said they were likely to purchase a  converter box were asked if they would request a coupon and then were  asked whether they would request one or two government coupons. In our  calculation of coupon demand we assume that those who do not say they  are likely to purchase a coupon box will not request a coupon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Digital Television Transition: Majority of Broadcasters Are Prepared for  the DTV Transition, but Some Technical and Coordination Issues  Remain.
