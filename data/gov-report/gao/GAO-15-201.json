Specifically, CBP has completed modernization projects in four of the nine sectors that compose the southwest border. Since rolling out upgrades\u2014which include replacing and updating equipment and expanding infrastructure\u2014CBP has not established an ongoing performance monitoring plan to determine whether the systems are working as intended. Without such a plan, CBP is not well positioned to assess whether its radio systems are functioning as intended in each location and are meeting user needs. In addition, ICE has taken some actions to modernize its tactical communications radio systems. However, ICE does not have a program plan to manage its portfolio of projects. By developing a program plan to guide ICE's overall tactical communications modernization program, ICE could better manage its program and achieve its program goals.", "Additional efforts are needed to ensure that CBP and ICE agents and officers receive necessary training. CBP provided training to its agents and officers on upgraded radio systems in each southwest border location that received upgrades; however, 8 of 14 CBP radio user groups GAO met with suggested that radio users be provided with additional radio training to enhance their proficiency in using radio systems. Further, CBP does not know how many radio users are in need of training. Developing and implementing a plan to address any skills gaps related to the upgraded radio systems would help ensure more CBP radio users are able to effectively use their radios to accomplish the agency's mission. Further, developing a mechanism to identify CBP radio users in need of training would help CBP improve its ability to monitor radio user training needs. ICE provided training on the upgraded radio systems in one location, but 3 of the 4 ICE radio user groups GAO met with in field locations stated that additional training would help address challenges experienced by radio users. Further, ICE officials stated that they did not track the training that the agency provided.

As we have previously reported, more than 10 years after the  bipartisan 9/11 Commission reported that improvements to interoperable  communications at all levels of government need to be addressed, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to face challenges in  achieving interoperable communications within and among federal, state,  and local agencies despite substantial investment by these agencies to  improve their radio communications systems. Within DHS, U.S. Customs  and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE) agents and officers responsible for securing the  southwest border depend on land mobile radio systems (radio systems)  for secure, reliable, and timely exchanges of critical information to  effectively carry out their mission. Since large areas of the U.S. southwest  border are remote and composed of rugged terrain, it is vital to the safety  and effectiveness of CBP and ICE agents and officers that their radio  systems enable them to communicate with whomever they need to, when  they need to, and when they are authorized to do so.

We selected the Tucson, Rio Grande Valley, and El  Paso Border Patrol sectors based on CBP\u2019s prioritization of these  modernization project sites. We selected the San Diego Border Patrol  sector because it has not yet received modernization upgrades, but has a  significant amount of local collaboration efforts that depend on  communications interoperability. These four locations also represent  geographic diversity along the border in terms of terrain, and state and  local governments. In each of these locations, we interviewed groups of  Office of Air and Marine (OAM) agents, Office of Border Patrol (Border  Patrol) agents, Office of Field Operations (OFO) officers, and ICE agents,  as well as representatives from state and local agencies. In San Diego  sector, we also met with the U.S. Coast Guard, attended a meeting of the  San Diego Regional Coordinating Mechanism, and observed the Joint  Harbor Operations Centers. We met with five to seven groups in each  location; each group comprised between 3 and 14 agents or officers that  were selected based on their availability during our visits. The information  we obtained from these visits cannot be generalized to other Border  Patrol sectors or ICE regions, but provided us with information on the  perspectives of various radio system users who operate along the U.S.  southwest border.

Further, to assess the extent to which CBP monitors radio system  performance, we reviewed daily, weekly, and quarterly reports on radio  system availability, which included information on system outages,  maintained by officials from CBP\u2019s National Law Enforcement  Communications Center (NLECC). We also reviewed internal ICE budget  documentation and ICE\u2019s integrated master schedule, which included  time frames and cost information for 58 ongoing, planned, and completed  ICE modernization projects. Additionally, we evaluated CBP\u2019s  performance monitoring efforts against standards in Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government to determine the extent to  which the agency has developed plans to monitor the performance of its  deployed radio systems to evaluate the effectiveness of these systems.

For both CBP and ICE, we analyzed samples of  training materials for content of training provided to CBP and ICE radio  users. In addition, for CBP, we analyzed training completion data for all  CBP locations along the U.S. southwest border to determine the  percentage of CBP radio users who received the training from 2009  through 2014. We assessed the reliability of the training data we used by  interviewing officials responsible for recording training completion records  in CBP\u2019s Training Records and Enrollment Network (TRAEN) about  applicable quality control procedures to ensure the accuracy and integrity  of the data. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.

In these 4 sectors,  Yuma, Tucson, Rio Grande Valley, and El Paso, CBP has upgraded outdated analog tactical communications equipment and  infrastructure to digital systems that meet the narrowband mandate  and are compliant with both P25 interoperability standards and AES  encryption capabilities, and expanded coverage and provided capacity enhancements by  procuring additional equipment and building out new tower sites in  areas where CBP agents operate that were not previously covered  with existing infrastructure.", "In 2009, CBP determined that the TACCOM modernization program was  not cost-effective and would take too long to complete. Accordingly, CBP  revised its modernization approach for all remaining sectors, halting the  addition of any new tower sites, and in conjunction with the approval of  TACNET in 2011, adding a project known as Digital in Place (DIP) as a  capstone to this program with the expectation that DIP would provide a  digital baseline for TACNET. The scope of the DIP project entails  upgrading the remaining analog radio sites to the P25 digital systems with  AES encryption capabilities and does not provide additional coverage or  capacity enhancements. This project provides one-for-one replacements  of analog systems with digital systems. CBP plans to implement DIP in  the remaining five sectors along the southwest border that did not receive  full modernization upgrades. As of September 2014, DIP projects have  been completed in three of the five remaining sectors along the southwest  border\u2014Big Bend, Laredo, and Del Rio\u2014and are currently under way in  other locations across the nation. According to CBP, because DIP does  not include new site build-outs or the need to obtain additional frequency  licenses, this approach will greatly reduce the costs associated with the  full modernization approach and will be completed in a relatively shorter  time period. For example, in 2009, CBP estimated that full modernization  of all CBP sites in the nation would cost $1.3 billion for development and  implementation, not including life cycle costs, and would take 20 years to  complete. In comparison, CBP estimated that the total cost, including life  cycle costs, to implement DIP in the remaining sectors would be about  $410 million in addition to the cost of the five original modernization  projects\u2014for a total life cycle cost of approximately $945 million, and  would be completed by 2016. However, according to CBP officials, the  agency currently anticipates that some of the infrastructure upgrades for  these projects will be completed in 2018, because of resource  constraints.", "CBP developed a Test and Evaluation Master Plan, dated June 2013, for  the Rio Grande Valley, El Paso, and DIP projects. The plan stated that  the conceptual design for all projects under the TACCOM modernization  program is based on commercial-off-the-shelf proven technology.  According to DHS\u2019s Acquisition Directive 102-01 and its associated  guidebook, operational testing results should be used to evaluate the  degree to which the system meets its requirements and can operate in  the real world with real users like CBP and ICE radio users. Moreover,  this guidance states that even for commercial-off-the-shelf systems,  operational test and evaluation should occur in the environmental  conditions in which a system will be used before a full production decision  for the system is made and the system is subsequently deployed. This  guidance also states that for commercial-off-the-shelf systems,  operational tests should be conducted to ensure that the systems satisfy  user-defined requirements.", "CBP initially had plans to conduct operational tests in multiple sectors;  however, it conducted the operational test in one sector, Rio Grande  Valley, and such testing was limited. CBP did not conduct operational  testing in Yuma, Tucson, or El Paso, although the agency did perform  some tests with users in real operational environments for each of these  sectors. According to DHS and CBP officials, formal test plans were not  executed in Tucson or Yuma because of resource constraints and  changing agency priorities. In Rio Grande Valley, CBP conducted a  limited user test, which served as the operational test and evaluation  event to determine whether TACCOM was operationally effective and  suitable for deployment and met user needs. According to the Rio Grande  Valley limited user test report, the radio system tested in Rio Grande  Valley was found to be operationally effective and met the coverage and  availability key performance requirements. However, the limited user test  report also noted that operational suitability\u2014which included  assessments of interoperability, reliability, availability, and  maintainability\u2014was undetermined because insufficient data were  collected to make a definitive determination. The Rio Grande Valley  limited user test report also noted that since testing was conducted only  at a singular focus area, system impacts and CBP agent and officer input  from untested sites remain unknown. CBP officials stated that a separate  operational test and evaluation event was not conducted for the El Paso  focus area because the Rio Grande Valley results were used to evaluate  both sectors, given that the same radio systems were deployed to El  Paso and Rio Grande Valley. Despite these limitations, an official from  the DHS Science and Technology Directorate who oversaw CBP\u2019s  operational testing stated that the operational testing conducted by CBP  in Rio Grande Valley provided reasonable assurance that CBP\u2019s radio  system met key performance requirements in accordance with DHS  acquisition guidance because the agency determined that Rio Grande  Valley best represented the weather and terrain features across all four  southwest border TACCOM project locations, which are the key variables  that could affect test results based on location.", "CBP has completed deployment of radio systems to four southwest  border sectors\u2014Rio Grande Valley, El Paso, Tucson, and Yuma\u2014and  has upgraded existing systems in three southwest border sectors\u2014Big  Bend, Laredo, and Del Rio\u2014and both CBP and DHS officials stated that  the agency does not plan to conduct additional testing on the deployed  systems or conduct any operational testing for the DIP projects because  the agency is replacing outdated equipment with commercial-off-the-shelf  technology on a one-for-one basis. Moreover, CBP has taken other  actions to assess the implementation of the systems deployed in those  sectors. For example, in 2012, CBP completed an operational analysis of  upgrades in Tucson and Yuma under the TACCOM modernization  program to determine if the investment in those sectors was meeting its  performance goals. According to the operational analysis report, the  modernization upgrades completed in Tucson and Yuma delivered  quantifiable benefits with the addition of 17 new radio sites, which  provided additional coverage, and the replacement of outdated equipment  with new digital equipment resulted in increased availability of radio  systems. The report also included the results of an end user survey that  was conducted as part of the operational readiness review process in  fiscal year 2011 to assess user satisfaction with the deployed system.  While the user satisfaction survey indicated an acceptable level of  satisfaction with the availability and usability of the system, the report also  noted several operational issues experienced by users during the  transition from the analog system to the digital system, including poor  radio coverage in specific locations, the perception that the old analog  system provided better coverage than the digital system because of  signals fading in a different manner, and users experiencing  communications bleed over between some sites, which occurs when  radio transmissions are overheard by radio users who are not the  intended recipients. However, CBP continued to move forward with the  current modernization approach given the need for immediate  improvements in communications capability and the lack of a viable  alternative technology that could be deployed. Moreover, since the  TACCOM investment would have a life cycle of at least 10 years, the  report concluded that this investment would support CBP radio users  through the transition period needed to establish a next-generation  broadband network. In addition, CBP officials stated that the agency  collects information on radio system availability and maintenance. For  example, CBP NLECC officials track daily system outages for sites that  have been upgraded and provide weekly reports to management on this  information, including how long outages lasted and how issues were  resolved. CBP also tracks and resolves radio hardware issues reported  by users in the field.", "While these are positive steps, CBP has not developed an agency-wide  plan to monitor the performance of its radio systems. In particular, CBP  has not yet collected sufficient data to determine how well the systems  are functioning within and across sectors, and has not obtained  perspectives from radio users since the systems were deployed in each  location. Such information could help CBP better identify any challenges  with use of the system and assess system performance. For example,  although CBP collects information on radio system availability and  maintenance, CBP officials stated that they have not used this information  to assess overall system performance to determine the extent to which  upgraded radio systems are meeting user needs or to identify areas in  need of corrective action. According to CBP officials, the agency has not  yet analyzed available data to determine the extent to which upgraded  radio systems are meeting user needs or to identify areas in need of  corrective action because complete operational data have not been  collected for all sites to which radio systems were deployed and because  these data are maintained across different repositories that are not  currently linked together. According to CBP officials, the agency  recognizes the need to collect sufficient data to monitor radio system  performance and is taking steps to address this need by collecting data in  recently modernized sites, including El Paso. Once the data have been  collected, the agency plans to consolidate these data in a central  repository. While this may be a useful practice, a performance monitoring  plan, including information on how data will be collected across all sites  and how these data will be used to monitor the performance of deployed  radio systems, could better position CBP to assess whether its radio  systems are functioning as intended in each location or whether they are  meeting user needs.", "Moreover, most of the groups of CBP radio users we met with reported  experiencing challenges relating to operational performance. For  example, 7 of the 10 groups of CBP radio users we met with in the  Tucson, Rio Grande Valley, and El Paso sectors stated that coverage  gaps continued to affect their ability to communicate, even after the  upgrades were completed. Specifically, 2 groups stated that coverage in  some areas seemed to be worse after the upgrades were completed, 4  groups stated that coverage gaps had been reduced but continued to  exist after the upgrades, and 1 group stated that while coverage had  improved in some areas, the group did not receive the coverage  enhancements it expected to receive, especially in critical areas. As  another example, 10 of 14 CBP radio users we met with reported  experiencing challenges related to frequency saturation\u2014whereby too  many users are operating simultaneously on one channel, blocking other  users from being able to access that channel.

For example, two of the three groups of ICE radio  users we met with in Tucson, Rio Grande Valley, and El Paso that  operate on CBP land mobile radio networks stated that coverage was  worse after the upgrades or did not meet ICE radio user needs because  the new system did not provide the capabilities the agency promised to  deliver. The third group stated that CBP\u2019s modernization project upgrades  enhanced coverage in a limited capacity but created new challenges for  ICE because of the increase in communication traffic.

The SAFECOM Interoperability  Continuum identifies five critical success elements that must be  addressed to achieve a sophisticated interoperability solution:  governance, standard operating procedures, technology, training and  exercises, and usage of interoperable communications. The  Interoperability Continuum states that usage refers to how often  interoperable communications technologies are used and identifies four  basic types of interoperability: planned events\u2014such as athletic events  that involve multiple responding agencies; localized emergency  incidents\u2014such as a vehicle collision on an interstate highway; regional  incident management\u2014such as routine coordination of responders across  a region that includes disaster response; and daily use throughout  region\u2014whereby interoperability systems are used every day for  managing routine as well as emergency incidents and users are familiar  with the operation of the system and routinely work in concert with one  another.

ICE  officials stated that while sharing is encouraged, local  management is responsible for deciding whether to request  access to specific radio keys. Because these decisions are made  at the local level, local relationships between CBP and ICE  management may affect decisions to request or provide access to  local radios keys.
