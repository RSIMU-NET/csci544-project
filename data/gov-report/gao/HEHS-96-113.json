Our report included observations on the accuracy of RCS\u2019 database, the need for RCS to better monitor Vet Center activities by making regional office site visits as required, and the need to better evaluate the quality of Vet Center care. This report recognizes RCS\u2019 efforts in these areas and identifies the need for further improvements.", "In performing this review, we visited RCS\u2019 central office in Washington, D.C., four of RCS\u2019 seven regional offices, and five Vet Centers. At these locations we reviewed documentation, discussed program activities with officials, and at three of the Vet Centers we met with veterans to obtain their views on the program. We also obtained workload activity data for fiscal years 1993 through 1995 from 39 randomly selected Vet Centers that helped to describe clients and services provided. We also met with officials of several veteran service organizations to obtain their views on the program. We performed our work between June 1995 and April 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

At that time it was recognized that a veteran suffering from a \u201creadjustment problem\u201d might exhibit \u201ca low-grade motivational or behavioral impairment\u201d that interfered with interpersonal relationships, job or educational performance, or overall ability to cope with daily life. This condition, in combination with other symptoms, was later termed post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At that time VA medical centers did not have special programs in place to treat these problems. Veterans who did go to VA medical centers for treatment were usually admitted to the general psychiatric service where these problems were not well understood.", "PTSD is caused by severely stressful or traumatic events such as military combat, seeing people die, or incarceration as a prisoner of war. PTSD symptoms include intense reliving of the event in memory or dreams, anxiety, sleep disturbance, depression, social isolation, and an incapacity for intimate relations with others. PTSD may not be curable and can be a chronic condition with symptoms that are stress-induced and effects that may increase with a person\u2019s age.", "The readjustment counseling program was authorized as a community-based program separate from VA medical centers at least partially on the premise that many Vietnam era veterans were so distrustful and suspicious of government institutions that they would not come to VA\u2019s inpatient hospitals to seek care. It was also believed that providing mental health services in outpatient facilities would help to remove the stigma often associated with so-called \u201cmental illness.\u201d The guiding principle was that readjustment services should be provided on an outpatient basis, regardless of the veteran\u2019s income, and that unnecessary barriers to care should be removed. In addition, requests for counseling should be speedily honored with a minimum of red tape. In passing the authorizing legislation, the Congress recognized that Vet Centers would provide services to address not only psychological problems, but also other aspects of readjustment. Over the intervening 17 years, the Congress has expanded the program to include veterans who participated in all post-Vietnam military conflicts. The Congress also made the Vet Center program permanent and specifically authorized VA, supported by Vet Centers, to provide counseling to veterans who experienced sexual trauma while on active duty.", "As currently configured, the Director of RCS reports to the Under Secretary for Health and is responsible for overall program oversight and direction. The Director is assisted in many management responsibilities by staff in seven regional offices. Each regional office is headed by a regional manager who is responsible for monitoring Vet Center services, hiring and training Vet Center staff, enhancing relations with other VA facilities, and assessing program performance.", "Two clinical field managers are responsible for monitoring the quality of clinical services provided by Vet Centers. One, based in Bay Pines, Florida, is responsible for all Vet Centers in the East and the other, in Denver, is responsible for western Vet Centers.", "To meet clients\u2019 needs, Vet Centers provide easy, \u201chassle free\u201d access to a variety of services, including individual, group, and family counseling; referrals to other VA and community resources; and outreach activities to identify veterans needing assistance. Vet Centers are also authorized to provide services to family members and significant others to the extent necessary to help veterans who are being treated by program staff. In assisting clients, counselors draw from an array of psychosocial services.", "Social services address problems such as basic needs, unemployment, and veterans benefits. Social services include coordinating with community providers for basic services, state representatives of Disabled Veteran Outreach Programs who work to match veterans with employment opportunities, and VA benefit offices who attempt to assist veterans with the benefits to which they are entitled. Psychological services address issues such as PTSD, drug and alcohol abuse, and sexual trauma. Vet Center staff may either directly provide the psychological care needed or refer the veterans to other sources of treatment. For example, veterans who need medications or inpatient care for PTSD are generally referred to VA medical centers.", "During the first 16 years of the program, approximately 1.2 million veterans had about 7.3 million visits with Vet Center counselors. RCS currently operates 205 Vet Centers at an estimated fiscal year 1996 cost of about $64 million. Vet Centers are generally located in community storefront facilities and staffed with counselors who are often veterans themselves. In general, each Vet Center has three to six staff members, including a team leader, counselor(s), and an office manager. Ten of the 205 Vet Centers are also known as Veterans Resource Centers and may be staffed with as many as six counselors. Some Vet Centers contract with private mental health professionals in locations that are distant from the Vet Center or other VA providers. These contractors provide therapeutic services to veterans with psychological problems, such as PTSD.", "Although located apart from established VA facilities, each Vet Center is administratively assigned to a VA support facility (usually a VA medical center) that provides services such as purchasing supplies, paying bills, and maintaining the payroll.", "Currently many medical centers have their own inpatient and outpatient programs specifically to address PTSD-related problems. In some cases, veterans need inpatient care to address debilitating symptoms while others may need medications to treat symptoms but only on an outpatient basis. Today there are 61 inpatient and 93 outpatient specialized medical center programs for veterans who are diagnosed as having PTSD.", "Over the life of the Vet Center program, questions have been raised about the continued need for readjustment counseling services, whether, organizationally, RCS should be more closely connected with VA medical centers, and what program management improvements could be made. A number of studies have addressed these questions, including our 1987 report on the readjustment counseling program. These studies have consistently recommended the continuation of readjustment counseling services and RCS\u2019 organizational independence within VHA.

Most veterans do not remain in contact with counselors over extended periods. Nevertheless, veterans who have more serious psychological problems, such as PTSD, represent a core group who visit with Vet Center staff, on average, more often than veterans with social concerns such as the need for employment or veterans\u2019 benefits.", "While RCS reports that a large number of veterans are seen each year, most do not establish long-term relationships with Vet Center counselors. RCS reported that nearly 283,000 new veteran clients visited Vet Centers during fiscal years 1993 through 1995. Of these veterans, we estimate based on our sample that 59 percent had only one visit with Vet Center staff, 80 percent had three or fewer visits, and 90 percent had seven or fewer staff visits during the 3-year period. The remaining 10 percent of Vet Center clients visited eight or more times. The 17 counselors and team leaders we met with at five Vet Centers each had an average clinical caseload of about 26 clients.", "New veterans with psychological problems such as PTSD and sub-PTSDwere seen more often by Vet Center counselors. For example, veterans with PTSD averaged 5 visits and those with sub-PTSD averaged 4.3 Vet Center staff visits during fiscal year 1995. Over a 3-year period, veterans with these problems averaged 9.4 and 6.4 Vet Center staff visits, respectively. Conversely, veterans who had social concerns, such as employment and VA benefit needs, averaged 1.9 and 1.5 visits during fiscal years 1993 through 1995.", "A relatively small percentage or core group of veterans are long-term users of the Vet Center program. For example, of the veterans who first visited with a Vet Center counselor before fiscal year 1993, 20 percent were seen 13 or more times through fiscal year 1995; 10 percent had 32 or more visits in that period. In addition, during our visits with 50 clients (veterans and family members) at three Vet Centers, some of the veterans and spouses commented that the Vet Center staff were responsible for saving these veterans\u2019 lives and they very much needed the Vet Center program. These veterans also stated that they preferred to obtain services at Vet Centers rather than VA medical centers. As a result, many of these veterans now, and in the foreseeable future, are likely to continue to use the counseling services provided by this community-based program.", "Family members and significant others constitute about 8 percent of the total number of visits. We found that these clients, on average, have fewer visits with Vet Center counselors than veterans in all areas, except for marriage and family problems, where significant other and family member visits with Vet Center staff exceeded those of veterans over our 3-year period of review. Table 1 shows the average and median number of visits by new veterans and family and significant others by problem areas addressed for fiscal year 1995. Table 2 shows data for the 3-year study period, fiscal years 1993 through 1995.", "We found two reasons that partially explain why most veterans do not continue to use Vet Centers after a few visits. First, many veterans have social concerns that can be addressed in three or fewer visits with staff. These visits might include helping clients with basic needs, legal problems, employment matters, and homelessness issues. Vet Center staff may draw on their own resources to assist with these problems or may refer clients to other VA and non-VA programs, thus limiting the number of visits needed.", "Second, RCS restricts veterans from World War II, the Korean War, and noncombat veterans from conflicts other than Vietnam to three visits with Vet Center counselors.

SARS, as currently designed, produces data that emphasize the quantitative rather than the qualitative aspects of the Vet Center program. For example, it does not accurately describe Vet Center operations or distinguish between client visits requiring minimal staff time and visits that require extended periods of staff effort.

Moreover, in three of the five Vet Centers, active duty personnel accounted for over two-thirds of the total number of outreach visits.", "While contacting military personnel who are about to be separated from active duty is a legitimate Vet Center outreach activity, recording group meetings as individual client visits makes them appear to be the same as visits that involve extended counseling. This method of counting and recording Vet Center visits inflates productivity data.", "Vet Center staff also told us that several services and activities they provide or participate in are not recorded in the workload reporting system. We were told, for example, that staff help clients through crisis situations, such as suicidal periods, provide assistance with support groups for family members of active duty personnel who have been deployed for an overseas mission, and participate in community events during holidays such as Veterans Day. These and similar types of actions are not recorded in the workload reporting system, which contributes to understating the activities performed by Vet Center staff.", "Furthermore, the workload reporting system does not collect information to determine how Vet Center staff resources are used. Through fiscal year 1992, time spent with clients was recorded by Vet Center staff; however, this information is no longer included in SARS. The time spent by counselors to help clients can vary dramatically. In some instances, counselors may spend 15 minutes and make only one or two phone calls to provide the assistance their clients need. In other situations, counselors may spend all day helping clients cope with serious situations and more complex issues.

Also, in May 1991, VA\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Program Coordination and Evaluation recommended, among other things, that RCS and the Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences Service establish a joint program evaluation and research component to include mechanisms for developing ongoing outcome data to measure the effectiveness of all PTSD programs.", "RCS officials acknowledge that outcome measures have not been developed for the Vet Center program but said they have relied on other ways of determining how well centers are serving their clients.

In 1991, it undertook a study with the National Center for PTSD of 1,006 Persian Gulf war zone veterans to evaluate the prevalence of PTSD over time. They found that veterans who obtained psychological treatment at Vet Centers upon their return from the Persian Gulf showed lower levels of PTSD after approximately 6 months than those who were not immediately treated. PTSD prevalence among veterans who sought psychological treatment from Vet Centers decreased from 26.9 to 19.4 percent. On the other hand, the prevalence of PTSD symptoms among veterans who used Vet Centers but did not seek psychological counseling increased from 7.8 to 9.8 percent.

First, VHA\u2019s top officials believed RCS had done a good job of serving its clients in the past, and they did not want to draw it into the difficulties of implementing a major medical program reorganization. Second, Vet Centers offer a unique approach to client care in that they are community-based, they act as access points for many veterans seeking VA services, and they perform outreach to the veteran population. Finally, these officials believed that in a number of locations, good interaction and coordination occurs between Vet Center and medical center staff and they did not want to interrupt it. The Deputy Under Secretary stated that as the VISN structure is implemented and as network services become more integrated, VHA may need to reassess RCS\u2019 organizational relationship within that structure.", "Once the VISN structure is in place, VA can reassess the role and relationship Vet Centers have with other VA health care providers and how Vet Centers can best be integrated into VA\u2019s continuum of care to serve the greatest number of veterans with the health care resources currently available.

Forty-one Vet Centers are more than 30 miles from a VA medical center or VA outpatient clinic and 27 of these are more than 50 miles from such facilities. For veterans in those communities, the Vet Centers not only provide psychosocial services but also act as access and referral points for needed medical center services. In other communities, Vet Centers are close to VA medical centers; 133 are within 10 miles of a VA medical center or an outpatient clinic. Future consideration of Vet Center locations and their relationship with other VA providers might best take place within the context of each VISN\u2019s geographic area.", "RCS\u2019 continued independence is consistent with recommendations made by past studies. In its January 1986 report, the Vet Center Planning Committee concluded that of the five options considered for RCS\u2019 future organizational structure, the one that would maintain RCS\u2019 organizational independence was the most appropriate. Two more recent studies\u2014the May 1991 VA program evaluation of PTSD programs and the April 1995 biannual report of the Advisory Committee on the Readjustment of Vietnam and Other War Veterans\u2014also concluded that RCS\u2019 current independent organizational structure should be maintained."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Vet Centers continue to provide a range of services to a large number of veterans and their significant others. We found three program areas, however, that need improvement. First, the workload reporting system, SARS, focuses only on quantitative, not qualitative, aspects of the Vet Center program. Hence, although SARS reports productivity data, it provides insufficient information about actual Vet Center activities and the resources used to perform them. Second, the documentation in client case files is not always sufficient to ensure that veterans are receiving the care they need and that an adequate assessment of the appropriateness and quality of services rendered can be made. And third, RCS lacks a method of demonstrating that its treatment services are effective in meeting the psychological needs of Vet Center clients.", "VA\u2019s current restructuring of medical services under the VISN concept maintains RCS\u2019 independence within VHA. We believe that continuing RCS\u2019 organizational independence is consistent with its mission of providing both social and psychological services to veterans and the developing nature of VHA\u2019s VISN structure. Once the VISN structure has been implemented, however, reconsideration of RCS\u2019 organizational position may be warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs direct RCS to make changes to the Service Activity Reporting System so that it will more accurately reflect Vet Center activity and staff resources used; require Vet Center counselors to properly document the care provided to veterans and that when documentation problems are identified, take corrective action; and develop a method for demonstrating, on a continuing basis, the effectiveness of the Vet Center program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In a letter dated May 28, 1996, VA\u2019s Under Secretary for Health expressed satisfaction with our generally positive conclusions about RCS\u2019 operations and concurred with our three recommendations, with qualifications. VHA agreed that limitations of the existing workload reporting system, SARS, are responsible for significant underreporting of actual RCS activities but did not agree that overreporting of activities is an issue since it assumed that our conclusions were based on evidence from only one Vet Center. It indicated that reporting group contacts made under the Transition Assistance Program as though they were individual visits is not a serious problem and stated that the generalization of our findings in this area to other centers was misleading.", "Our discussion of Vet Centers\u2019 overreporting as a result of the way TAP contacts are recorded was based on data obtained from a number of Vet Centers. We added information to the report to clarify the basis for our conclusions. We are encouraged by RCS\u2019 stated efforts to upgrade the SARS information collection capability to more fairly and accurately report Vet Center staff activity and believe that this may address the overreporting problem that we identified during our review.", "VHA stated that established processes are already in place to meet the intent of our recommendation that counselors be required to properly document the care provided to veterans and that when problems are identified, corrective action be taken. VHA cited the standards established by RCS for clinical record keeping and the processes in place for quality and chart reviews. Our report does not take issue with the standards and processes in place. Our concern rests with the high level of noncompliance identified during RCS regional office clinical site visits, the level of noncompliance identified in the sample of cases we reviewed, and similar file documentation problems we noted in our 1987 report on RCS.", "We believe that continued documentation problems of the magnitude we identified point to the need for stronger action than proposed in VHA\u2019s comments. VHA\u2019s statements that \u201cmonitoring of compliance with these policies and processes will continue to be an ongoing activity\u201d and \u201cThe RCS program office will . . . continue to stress the importance of complete documentation\u201d do not indicate a recognition of the need for compliance that we believe is called for in this area. We believe that RCS must initiate a concerted effort to educate counselors on the importance of full case documentation and to ensure that when documentation problems are identified, effective action is taken to correct deficiencies. Not doing so leaves in question the quality of care Vet Center clients are receiving.", "VHA also offered several technical comments on our draft report that we incorporated into the final report, as appropriate. The text of VHA\u2019s comments is in appendix IV.", "Copies of this report are being sent to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, other congressional committees, and interested parties. Copies will be made available to others upon request.", "Please call me at (202) 512-7101 if you have any questions or need additional assistance.

In Providence, we also met with RCS\u2019 National Data Coordinator to discuss the Service Activity Reporting System (SARS) and to collect program data from it. In Bay Pines and Denver we met with RCS\u2019 clinical field managers to discuss their role in monitoring and improving the quality of clinical services Vet Centers provide in their areas of responsibility.", "The five Vet Centers we visited were selected because they are geographically and operationally diverse. For example, the White River Junction Vet Center is in a rural area close to a medical center. The Vet Center in Norwich is about 50 miles from the closest VA medical center and has a military base in its catchment area. The Tampa and Chicago Vet Centers are in large urban areas and both are close to VA medical centers. Chicago is unique within the five in that it is a Veterans Resource Center\u2014a Vet Center with expanded employment and alcohol/drug abuse services and staffing. The Cheyenne Vet Center is close to a VA medical center and did not, at the time of our visit, have a full-time team leader. While the White River Junction and Norwich Vet Centers are geographically similar, the others serve distinctly different geographic areas. At each Vet Center we met with the team leader and counselors to get their views about the program. We reviewed activities, observed Vet Center operations, and in three Vet Centers we met with veterans and significant others to obtain their views. We also obtained workload data from each center and, in four centers, reviewed a sample of case files to evaluate case documentation and the accuracy of SARS data compared with data in case files.", "We met with officials of VA\u2019s National Center for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in White River Junction to discuss the treatment of PTSD in VA medical centers and Vet Centers and the current methods of evaluating treatment outcomes. We also met with officials of four veteran service organizations\u2014The American Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America, Inc., Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Disabled American Veterans\u2014to obtain their views on the program.", "We reviewed a number of studies and reports on readjustment counseling services and the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD in VA programs, prepared by several organizations, advisory councils, and committees, including our 1987 report on the readjustment counseling program.", "As part of our review of RCS\u2019 workload reporting system\u2014SARS\u2014we requested activity data for 40 randomly selected Vet Centers for fiscal years 1993 through 1995. The 40 were selected from the universe of 205 Vet Centers, minus three that were new in 1995 and did not have many cases in their data system and five that are not located in the continental United States and, according to an RCS official, are not typical of other Vet Centers. This resulted in a sample universe of 197 Vet Centers. We obtained data from 39 of the 40 Vet Centers. One center was unable to provide information as a result of a computer problem. The data include information on all clients who visited the 39 Vet Centers during fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995. We analyzed the data from the 39 Vet Centers to describe the clients served, the number of visits clients made, and the type of problems addressed.", "The statistics we cite are estimates relating to all 197 Vet Centers contained in our sampling universe.
