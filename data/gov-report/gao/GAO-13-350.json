During fiscal year 2012, IRS management devoted attention and resources to addressing information security controls, and resolved a significant number of the information security control deficiencies that GAO previously reported. Notable among these efforts were the (1) formation of cross-functional working groups tasked with the identification and remediation of specific at-risk control areas, (2) improvement in controls over the encryption of data transferred between accounting systems, and (3) upgrades to critical network devices on the agency's internal network system. However, serious weaknesses remain that could affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer data. For example, the agency had not always (1) implemented effective controls for identifying and authenticating users, such as enforcing password complexity on certain servers; (2) appropriately restricted access to its mainframe environment; (3) effectively monitored the mainframe environment; or (4) ensured that current patches had been installed on systems to protect against known vulnerabilities.", "An underlying reason for these weaknesses is that IRS has not effectively implemented portions of its information security program. The agency has established a comprehensive framework for the program, and continued to make strides with various initiatives designed to improve its controls; however, certain components of the program did not always function as intended. For example, IRS's testing procedures over a financial reporting system that GAO reviewed did not always determine whether required controls were operating effectively and consequently, GAO identified control weaknesses that had not been detected by IRS. In addition, the agency had not updated an important policy concerning security standards for IRS's main tax processing environment to include current software versions and control capabilities. Further, although IRS indicated that it had addressed 58 of the previous information system security-related recommendations GAO made, 13 (about 22 percent) of the 58 had actually not yet been fully resolved. Continued and consistent management commitment and attention to an effective information security program will be essential to the maintenance of, and continued improvements in, its information system controls. Until IRS takes additional steps to (1) more effectively implement its testing and monitoring capabilities, (2) ensure that policies and procedures are updated, and (3) address unresolved and newly identified control deficiencies, its financial and taxpayer data will remain vulnerable to inappropriate use, modification, or disclosure, possibly without being detected. These deficiencies, along with shortcomings in the information security program, were the basis of GAO's determination that IRS had a significant deficiency in its internal control over financial reporting systems for fiscal year 2012."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that IRS take four actions to more effectively implement portions of its information security program.

Cyber-based threats to information systems and cyber-related  critical infrastructure can come from sources internal and external to the  organization. Internal threats include errors or mistakes, as well as  fraudulent or malevolent acts by employees or contractors working within  an organization. External threats include the ever-growing number of  cyber-based attacks that can come from a variety of sources such as  hackers, criminals, and foreign nations. Our previous reports, and those  by federal inspectors general, describe persistent information security  weaknesses that place federal agencies, including IRS, at risk of  disruption, fraud, or inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information.  Accordingly, we have designated information security as a  governmentwide high-risk area since 1997, a designation that remains in  force today.", "Information security is essential to creating and maintaining effective  internal controls. The Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982  requires the Comptroller General to prescribe standards for internal  control in federal agencies. The standards provide the overall framework  for establishing and maintaining internal control and for identifying and  addressing major performance and management challenges and areas at  greatest risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. The term  internal control is synonymous with the term management control, which  covers all aspects of an agency\u2019s operations (programmatic, financial,  and compliance). The attitude and philosophy of management toward  information systems can have a profound effect on internal control.  Information system controls consist of those internal controls that are  dependent on information systems processing and include general  controls (security management, access controls, configuration  management, segregation of duties, and contingency planning) at the  entity, system, and business process application levels; business process  application controls (input, processing, output, master file, interface, and  data management system controls); and user controls (controls  performed by people interacting with information systems).", "Recognizing the importance of securing federal agencies\u2019 information  systems, Congress enacted the Federal Information Security  Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) to strengthen the security of  information and systems within federal agencies. FISMA requires each  agency to develop, document, and implement an agencywide information  security program for the information and information systems that support  the operations and assets of the agency, using a risk-based approach to  information security management. Such a program includes assessing  risk; developing and implementing cost-effective security plans, policies,  and procedures; providing security awareness and specialized training;  testing and evaluating the effectiveness of controls; planning,  implementing, evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to address  information security deficiencies; and ensuring continuity of operations.

Further, the size  and complexity of IRS add unique operational challenges. IRS employs  more than 100,000 people in its Washington, D.C., headquarters and  more than 650 offices in all 50 states and U.S. territories and in some  U.S. embassies and consulates. IRS relies extensively on computerized  systems to support its financial and mission-related operations. To  manage its data and information, the agency operates three enterprise  computing centers located in Detroit, Michigan; Martinsburg, West  Virginia; and Memphis, Tennessee.

In addition, authorized individuals may be able to intentionally or  unintentionally view, add, modify, or delete data they should not have  been given access to.", "A computer system needs to be able to identify and authenticate each  user or system so that activities can be linked and traced to a specific  individual or system. An organization does this by assigning a unique  account to each user or process, and in so doing, the system is able to  distinguish one user or process from another\u2014a process called  identification. The system also needs to establish the validity of a claimed  identity by requesting some kind of information, such as a password\u2014a  process known as authentication. NIST also recommends using  multifactor authentication to access user accounts via a network.  Multifactor authentication involves using two or more factors to achieve  authentication. Factors include something you know (e.g., password or  personal identification number), something you have (e.g., cryptographic  identification device or token), or something you are (e.g., biometric). The  combination of identification and authentication\u2014such as user account- password combinations\u2014provides the basis for establishing  accountability and for controlling access to the system. IRS\u2019s Internal  Revenue Manual specifies security configurations for its database  systems and network support systems that cover how authentications are  to be performed and how passwords are to be configured. The manual  also requires the use of a strong password for authentication (defined as  a minimum of eight characters, containing at least one numeric or special  character, and a mixture of at least one uppercase and one lowercase  letter), and that passwords be set to expire every 90 days.", "IRS improved identification and authentication controls for certain  databases, one of their major operating systems, and network  infrastructure systems. Specifically:  some database configurations were more securely configured such  that the source of user logins was more restrictive and password  controls were strengthened;  improved password controls were implemented for servers using the  UNIX operating system; and  important data transmissions used to operate their network  infrastructure were authenticated.", "However, a number of identification and authentication control  weaknesses continued to reduce IRS\u2019s ability to effectively control access  to systems and data. For example: authentication controls for certain databases were not set to prevent passwords were stored without adequate controls to prevent them  from being disclosed; and  controls over complexity and age of passwords for some databases  were not adequate.", "Further, the agency sometimes used passwords that could be easily  guessed and had not changed some passwords in nearly 2 years. In  addition, the username and password for a database was stored in clear  text in a file that was named so that its contents were easy to guess.  Unauthorized use of this username and password would expose system  information and render sensitive data vulnerable to unauthorized access.  The vulnerability was compounded by the fact that the unauthorized  access would be virtually undetectable since no unusual system activity  would be involved\u2014the unauthorized access would be via a valid  username and password. As a result of these weaknesses, IRS had  reduced ability to control who was accessing its systems and data.", "Authorization is the process of granting or denying access rights and  permissions to a protected resource, such as a network, a system, an  application, a function, or a file. A key component of granting or denying  an access right is the concept of least privilege. Least privilege is a basic  principle for securing computer resources and data. It means that users  are granted only those access rights and permissions that they need to  perform their official duties. According to NIST, access control policies  and access enforcement mechanisms are employed by organizations to  control access between users (or processes acting on behalf of users)  and objects in the information system. Furthermore, it notes that access  enforcement mechanisms are employed at the application level, when  necessary, to provide increased information security for the organization.  According to the Internal Revenue Manual, the agency should implement  access control measures that provide protection from unauthorized  alteration, loss, unavailability, or disclosure of information.

A basic  element of cryptography is encryption, which is used to transform plain  text into cipher text using a special value known as a key and a  mathematical process known as an algorithm. According to IRS policy,  the confidentiality of transmitted data must be protected by encrypting the  data to prevent unauthorized disclosure. In addition, the policy states that  the use of insecure protocols should be restricted because their  widespread use can allow passwords, taxpayer information, and other  sensitive data to be transmitted unencrypted across its internal network.", "IRS has made progress in its implementation of data encryption controls,  particularly in protecting sensitive information transmitted across its  internal network. However, user IDs, passwords, and data continued to  be transmitted frequently without encryption. Further, many of IRS\u2019s  servers were configured to weakly encrypt passwords in a manner that  did not effectively prevent the passwords from being disclosed during  transmission. IRS officials advised us that the weak server password  encryption configuration was the result of incompatibilities between some  systems that had to decrypt passwords and was expected to be resolved  soon after the conclusion of our audit. Until the existing weaknesses and  the newly-identified weakness are corrected, IRS\u2019s ability to reliably  control access to some systems and data is undermined.", "To establish individual accountability, monitor compliance with security  and configuration management policies, and investigate security  violations, it is crucial to determine what, when, and by whom specific  actions have been taken on a system. Agencies accomplish this by  implementing system or security software that provides an audit trail\u2014a  log of system activity\u2014that it can use to determine the source of a  transaction or attempted transaction and to monitor user activity. The way  in which organizations configure system or security software determines  the nature and extent of information that can be provided by the audit  trail. To be effective, agencies should configure their software to collect  and maintain audit trails that are sufficient to track security-relevant  events. The Internal Revenue Manual requires that audit logging be  enabled and configured on all systems to aid in the detection of security  violations, performance problems, and flaws in applications. Additionally,  the manual states that security controls in information systems shall be  monitored on an ongoing basis.", "To enhance its auditing and monitoring capabilities, IRS established  several activities designed to support detection of questionable or  unauthorized access to financial applications and data and to support its  response. The Enterprise Security Audit Trails (ESAT) Project  Management Office is designed to assist in audit and monitoring activities  by detecting questionable or unauthorized access to financial applications  and data. For fiscal year 2012, this office continued to implement new  procedures building on its initiatives. For example, at the time of our  review, the office had enabled and configured audit logging in place for 23  systems.

Data stored  on disks in these systems could be accessed by a user who had been  allowed access to one or more processing environments, such as  development, test, or production. In addition, two of IRS\u2019s testing  environments that share disk storage with the tax and financial  management processing environments did not have routine monitoring  oversight. The agency had also not enabled logging for a database  supporting an important tax-processing application. IRS had detected this  shortcoming; however, corrective actions are not scheduled to be  completed for more than 2 years. Further, IRS was not consistently  logging administrator activity, and certain production files on the  mainframe could be changed without these changes being logged.", "Without effective audit and monitoring, IRS\u2019s ability to establish individual  accountability, monitor compliance with security and configuration  management policies, and investigate security violations is limited.", "Physical security controls are important for protecting computer facilities  and resources from sabotage, theft, accidental or deliberate damage, and  unauthorized access. These controls involve restricting physical access to  computer resources, usually by limiting access to the buildings and rooms  in which they are housed and periodically reviewing the access granted in  order to ensure that access continues to be appropriate. At IRS, physical  access control measures, such as physical access cards that are used to  permit or deny access to certain areas of a facility, are vital to  safeguarding facilities, computing resources, and information from  internal and external threats. The Internal Revenue Manual requires an  inventory of nonphoto ID cards at least once every 24 hours, including a  signature on the inventory form to verify that the inventory has been  completed. In addition, it requires access controls that safeguard assets  against possible theft and malicious actions and requires department  managers of restricted areas to review, validate, sign, and date the  authorized access list for restricted areas on a monthly basis and then  forward the list to the physical security office for review.", "IRS implemented numerous physical security controls at its enterprise  computing centers to safeguard assets against possible theft and  malicious actions.

In addition, the agency sufficiently restricted  access to unattended consoles within the computing centers.", "However, physical security controls were not always effectively  implemented. For example, visitor physical access cards to restricted  areas at one computing center provided unauthorized access to other  restricted areas within the center, and regular reviews of individuals with  an ongoing need to access restricted areas at one of the three computing  centers were not being conducted monthly to ensure that such access  was still appropriate.

As described by NIST, the information  security continuous monitoring process for developing a continuous  monitoring strategy and implementing a continuous monitoring program  consists of the following steps: define a continuous monitoring strategy; establish a continuous monitoring program that determines metrics analyze security-related information and report findings; and the frequency of monitoring and assessments;  implement the monitoring program;  respond with mitigation actions or reject, avoid, transfer, or accept  risk; and  review and update the monitoring strategy and program.", "According to NIST, effective continuous monitoring begins with  development of a strategy that addresses requirements and activities at  each organizational tier. Each tier monitors security metrics and assesses  security control effectiveness with established monitoring and  assessment frequencies and status reports customized to support tier- specific decision making. The Internal Revenue Manual states that the  agency should document its continuous monitoring strategy as defined by  NIST guidance.", "IRS had implemented a comprehensive information security program, as  illustrated by the following examples:  IRS had developed and documented an IT security risk management  policy that required all sensitive applications to be periodically  assessed for the risk and magnitude of harm that could result from  vulnerabilities and potential threats.", "The agency had developed policies and procedures that considered  risk, appropriately addressed purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities,  and compliance, and were approved by management.  IRS had developed and documented security plans for all of the major  systems we reviewed that addressed policies and procedures for  providing management, operational, and technical controls.  IRS had processes in place for providing employees with security  awareness and specialized training. All employees with specific  security-related roles and newly-hired employees that we reviewed  met or exceeded the required minimum security awareness and  specialized training hours.", "The agency had implemented numerous processes for testing and  evaluating the effectiveness of controls, and told us that it had  previously identified many of the issues we raised in this report. IRS  also tested its general ledger system for tax transactions in its current  operating environment.  IRS had completed actions to address 61 of the 118  recommendations we reported in fiscal year 2011 that were still  unresolved at the time of our last review.  IRS had a process in place to ensure that Computer Security Incident  Response Center incident tickets were opened, managed, and closed  in accordance with IRS\u2019s policies and procedures governing incident  detection, handling, and response.", "IRS had also started numerous initiatives that covered various control  areas, such as addressing weak passwords, restricting network access,  improving security for shared services, and ensuring regular penetration  testing and vulnerability scans.", "However, not all elements of IRS\u2019s information security program had been  effectively implemented, as illustrated in the following examples:", "Although IRS had developed and documented information security  policies and procedures covering key topics such as risk  assessments, security awareness training, testing and evaluation of  security controls, configuration management, continuity of operations,  and incident response, shortcomings existed with policies and  procedures.", "Although IRS has a specific policy limiting global access privilege  assignments in a manner that allows all users to access specific  files on their mainframe systems, that policy only covered one of  the two methods available for granting all users access.  IRS\u2019s audit and monitoring policies and procedures did not  comprehensively address users accessing files used by one  processing environment from a different environment.  IRS\u2019s policies and procedures for installing Oracle databases  allowed for all of the databases operating on a single server to be  configured such that they all run under the same system account,  potentially allowing users more access than needed to perform  their jobs.  IRS\u2019s policies did not cover situations where data storage is  shared between systems, which creates potential for changes  made in one system to affect other systems.  IRS\u2019s security standards for systems that support tax processing  and financial management contained information that was several  years out of date, which had resulted in less secure system  configurations.", "The agency did not have a procedure in place to reconcile certain  access privileges.", "Although IRS had processes in place for providing employees with  security awareness and specialized training, the agency did not  always ensure that contractors received security awareness training.  The Internal Revenue Manual requires that all new employees and  contractors receive security awareness training within the first 10  working days. For fiscal year 2012, more than half of the contractors  we evaluated were not in compliance with IRS\u2019 security awareness  training requirement. In addition, the agency allowed contractors to  complete the required training within 6 months of their start date  rather than within the first 10 working days, as required. We have  previously made a recommendation to address contractor security  awareness training.IRS\u2019s procedures for testing and evaluating controls were not always  effective. A key element of an information security program is  conducting tests and evaluations of policies, procedures, and controls  to determine whether they are effective and operating as intended.  However, for one financial reporting system that we reviewed, the  testing methodology did not always determine whether required  authentication controls were operating effectively. Testers did not  verify that controls required by policy were actually implemented on  the system. Consequently, we identified control weaknesses that had  not been detected by IRS. Also, IRS had not identified some of the  other issues raised in this report, including weaknesses involving  passwords and excessive access privileges, although they were  readily detectable. Additionally, IRS\u2019s mainframe security monitoring  had not detected several instances of noncompliance with its policies.", "Although IRS had a process in place for evaluating and tracking  remedial actions, it did not always effectively validate that corrective  actions had been taken, or whether the actions addressed the  weakness. The Internal Revenue Manual requires that IRS track the  status of resolution of all weaknesses and verify that each weakness  has been corrected before closing it. During the audit period, IRS  informed us that it had addressed 58 of the 118 previous information  system security-related recommendations we had made that  remained unresolved at the end of our prior audit. However, we  determined that 13 (about 22 percent) of the 58 had actually not yet  been fully resolved. We previously made a recommendation to  address this issue.  IRS has not fully documented its continuous monitoring strategy. The  agency created a diagram that logically depicts certain information  security continuous monitoring data flows and activities, had  developed various standard operating procedures, and is collecting,  analyzing, and reporting on certain data. However, it does not have a  strategy that defines requirements and activities at each  organizational tier, mission/business processes, and information  systems, nor does it define monitoring and assessment metrics and  frequencies.", "Until IRS effectively implements all key elements of its information  security program, the agency will not have reasonable assurance that  computing resources are consistently and effectively protected from  inadvertent or deliberate misuse, including fraud or destruction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["IRS has continued to make important progress in addressing information  security control weaknesses, and in improving its internal control over  financial reporting. During fiscal year 2012, IRS management devoted  attention and resources to addressing information security controls, and  resolved a significant number of the information security control  deficiencies that we have previously reported. Nevertheless, information  security weaknesses remain in access and other information system  controls over IRS\u2019s financial and tax-processing systems, affecting the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer  data. The financial and taxpayer information on IRS systems will remain  particularly vulnerable to internal threats until the agency (1) addresses  weaknesses pertaining to identification and authentication, authorization,  cryptography, audit and monitoring, physical security, and configuration  management and (2) effectively implements key components of its  comprehensive information security program that ensure processes  intended to test, monitor, and evaluate internal controls are appropriately  detecting vulnerabilities, including developing and implementing a  strategy for continuous monitoring efforts and improving validation of  corrective actions; and policies are up-to-date, and reflect the current  operating environment. These deficiencies are the basis of our  determination that IRS had a significant deficiency in internal control over  financial reporting related to information security in fiscal year 2012.
