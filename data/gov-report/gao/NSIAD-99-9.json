Their role has also evolved from the traditional concentration in medical and administrative occupations; women are now eligible to serve in over 80 percent of all military jobs, including many air, sea, and other combat-related positions. The growing role of women has also resulted in debate within and outside of the Department of Defense (DOD) over fundamental and sometimes contentious issues, including whether physical fitness standards are fair and appropriate to both men and women. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services reported that men and women at military installations across the country are confused about the need for differing standards among the services, particularly those regulating body fat, and lack confidence in the fairness of the standards. In addition, the Rand Corporation recently reported that some military men believe that fitness standards have been adjusted to the point of being too easy for women.", "Physical fitness is a fundamentally important part of military life for all military personnel. DOD guidance requires that servicemembers pass physical fitness tests at least annually regardless of age and gender. Personnel who fail to meet fitness standards can be denied promotions, schooling, and other activities and may be forced to leave the military.

However, the guidance does not identify requirements for specific activities or levels of difficulty. In addition, the guidance states that maintaining desirable body composition is an integral part of physical fitness, general health, and military appearance. The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy is responsible for oversight of the program and coordinating with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, who is responsible for establishing a health promotion program to be implemented in conjunction with the fitness and body fat program.", "DOD guidance states that each service must develop its own program according to its particular needs, placing primary emphasis on maintaining general health and physical fitness. Evaluation of individual fitness is an integral component of the program.

If a servicemember exceeds the weight parameters for his or her height in a screening table or the member\u2019s immediate commander determines that his or her appearance suggests an excess of body fat, then the servicemember\u2019s percent of body fat is to be estimated. To standardize as much as possible, DOD requires the services to use similar validated circumferential equations for the prediction of body composition. The men\u2019s equation involves measurements of the neck and waist or abdomen. The women\u2019s equation requires measurement of the hips, waist, and neck, but allows for optional measurements of the abdomen and wrist, and/or forearm.", "For both the fitness and body fat components of the program, servicemembers who fail to perform successfully against the established standards are to be given at least 3 months to improve.

In other words, job-specific physical performance standards would identify the absolute minimum level needed for successful performance in those occupations. Anyone in that occupation, regardless of gender, would be required to meet the same standard.", "In 1996, we reported on the development and use of gender-neutral occupationally specific performance standards in the military. Neither the Navy nor the Marine Corps had adopted occupational strength standards. Although the Army categorized each enlisted occupational specialty into one of five categories based on physical demand, it discontinued testing recruits\u2019 physical capabilities to perform such activities in 1990 and had previously used the results of that testing only for counseling recruits about serving in certain occupations. The Air Force had categorized each of its enlisted occupations into one of eight physical demand categories. It used a strength aptitude test administered to recruits to screen out those who would be likely to have difficulty performing physically demanding jobs, but it did not incorporate the strength test into the required annual fitness evaluation for personnel in those jobs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Physical Fitness Requirements Linked to Health but Not to the Ability to Perform Military Tasks", "paragraphs": ["The DOD physical fitness program involves more than just periodic testing against standards. Passing an annual fitness test is not synonymous with maintaining a high level of health and physical fitness. The research literature provides a large body of information linking physical activity to health and a variety of recommendations for the amount and intensity of exercise needed to achieve fitness. For example, organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine and the Department of Health and Human Services recommend 20 to 60 minutes of cardiovascular exercises most days of the week at a moderate level of intensity\u2014for example over 50 percent of the maximum heart rate\u2014as well as resistance exercises to condition the major muscle groups for strength and endurance. Some groups also recommend exercises to maintain flexibility. Although these recommendations were directed at the general U.S. population, a 1998 National Academy of Sciences report recommended that DOD personnel follow a similar regimen. DOD guidance recommends that servicemembers engage in regular physical fitness training of about 1-1/2 hours, three times a week. Duty time can be authorized for such training.", "Research literature also supports linking body fat percentages, cardiovascular endurance, and muscular endurance to the overall health objective. For example, the 1998 report by the National Academy of Sciences indicates that increases in the percentage of body fat are associated with health problems and a decrease in some aspects of fitness. Individuals with excess accumulation of abdominal fat appear to be at increased risk for a number of diseases.", "Research has identified little correlation between performance on timed runs, push-ups, sit-ups, and other fitness tests and specific military task performance. According to the 1998 National Academy of Sciences report, the majority of the military\u2019s physically demanding occupations involve occasional to frequent lifting and load carrying. However, the report found little association between performance on push-up, sit-up, and unloaded distance running tests, and lifting and load carrying ability. Researchers concluded that tasks, such as unloaded distance running, were rarely a part of a soldier\u2019s military duties and that the larger body type required to excel at lifting, for example, was different from the leaner body type required to excel at distance running.", "The relationship between the percentage of body fat and task performance is more complex. Some research has found that the higher the percentage of body fat the lower the performance in running tests. However, research also shows that women recruits who failed body fat standards were stronger than their counterparts who passed. This situation presents a dilemma for the military: setting a high body fat limit favors selection of women who are strong but may lack optimum endurance, and vice versa. The Academy\u2019s report pointed out that, to some degree, current body fat standards may discriminate against women who would be the most capable of performing jobs requiring strength, which might be the most critical for survival in a combat situation.", "In addition, the 1998 report by the National Academy of Sciences, as well as an earlier report in 1992, concluded that the \u201cappearance\u201d objective does not seem to be linked to performance, fitness, nutrition, or health. Research conducted in 1990 explored this relationship by having a panel of military officers and enlisted personnel rate the military appearance of 1,075 male and 251 female Army personnel in uniform, and then comparing these judgments to measures of the percent of body fat for each participant. The results were only a \u201cmodest\u201d correlation (0.53 for males, and 0.46 for females), and the report concluded that factors other than body composition, notably subjective judgment, influence appearance ratings.

According to a 1997 study of the Air Force fitness program and DOD\u2019s 1981 report on physical fitness in the military, muscular endurance exercises were included in the Air Force program as late as the early 1960s, but had been dropped by the early 1980s. The Air Force study, as well as a panel of experts, concluded that muscle strength and endurance training, such as sit-ups and bench and leg presses, should be added to the Air Force fitness program.

Service officials told us that the inclusion of multiple objectives in the guidance created confusion regarding the main purpose of the program and that emphasis given to one or the other of these objectives differed by service, with the difficulty of the standards raised or lowered accordingly.", "The Navy and the Air Force focused mostly on health as the program objective. Consequently, they tended to have relatively less vigorous standards than the Army and the Marine Corps, who placed additional emphasis on fitness and appearance. For example, Navy officials told us that they saw health as the appropriate objective of fitness programs, and their standards are set with that in mind. According to these officials, their maximum body fat standard of 22 percent for men is set at the clinical definition of obesity established by a National Institutes of Health panel in 1985, since obesity is clearly related to health problems such as diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer. However, Navy officials stressed that the standard is an upper limit, and they encourage Navy personnel to remain well below this level. In comparison, according to Marine Corps regulations and officials, the Marine Corps relies on maximum physical fitness more than any other service. Accordingly, the Marine Corps established its male body fat standard at 18 percent, the lowest level of all the services.", "Despite the apparent confusion, none of the services based its general fitness standards on specific combat mission or job requirements. However, at one time the Marine Corps administered a physical readiness test of combat skills, such as simulated marches uphill at a rapid pace, rope climbing to resemble entering and leaving a hovering helicopter, and evacuation of a wounded comrade by sprinting 50 yards, lifting another Marine onto the shoulders, and returning to the starting point. That test has been discontinued as an evaluated test for individuals, but units such as the Marine Corps Officer Candidates School continue to conduct the test as a training tool. Marine Corps officials were unsure as to when and why the individual test was discontinued. Officials at the Army Physical Fitness School also told us that they have been studying development of a combat fitness test for infantry soldiers. The test could include exercises such as a 3-mile march carrying a 40-pound pack, a weapons qualification test, and an obstacle course. The specific tasks would be linked to a unit\u2019s mission-essential task list. If these kinds of job-specific physical standards are developed, DOD guidance calls for them to be incorporated into the service\u2019s physical fitness program.

However, DOD requires that all personnel, regardless of age, be tested against cardiovascular and muscular endurance standards at least annually. This policy dates back at least to the 1981 DOD report assessing military fitness programs. The report stated that exempting personnel from fitness testing at a certain age implied that fitness was not important after that point and diluted the involvement and support of senior leaders. Mandatory testing was viewed as a potential catalyst for change and more leader involvement and support of physical fitness.

The officials also told us that the prohibition against inferring one gender\u2019s standard from the other\u2019s, while contradictory to the requirement for an 8 to 10 percentage point difference, is in place because simply inferring differences is not an adequate approach to setting standards.

Effective September 1998, the maximum time allowed for women under  30 to complete the 1-1/2 mile run was lowered by as much as 1 minute 15 seconds. The new female standards were derived by multiplying the men\u2019s standards by a factor to reflect the mean 18-percent difference between male and female aerobic capabilities, as calculated by Navy researchers, rather than using actual performance data. According to Navy documents and discussions with officials, this change was made because officials believed that the existing 4-minute difference between male and female standards in certain categories was not appropriate and that female standards needed to be more stringent. According to Navy officials, this change is temporary pending completion of an ongoing study of fitness scores throughout the Navy. The standards for males and for females ages 30 and older were not changed.", "Marine Corps officials believed that their male standards dated back to studies conducted in 1967 showing actual male times for the 3-mile run, with minimums set at the 10th percentile and maximums at the 90th. In January 1997, the Marine Corps raised the female run distance from 1-1/2 to 3 miles to match the male requirement. According to Marine Corps officials, studies conducted in 1993 and 1996 revealed an approximate 3-minute difference, on average, between the male and female run times. The resultant female standards were then established by adding the 3-minute average difference to the existing male standards. Marine Corps officials stated that, although the data needed to provide actual performance times was developed to ensure a solid basis for the new female standards, the process described above was used.", "A 1995 study by the Army concluded that its current physical fitness program contained gender disparities, with some women\u2019s standards being less demanding than they should be, and not based on scientific research. For example, according to the report, research indicates that women\u2019s world record times for events similar to the 2-mile run are 8 to 12 percent slower than men\u2019s, but Army standards allow women to run 19 percent slower than men and still get the same score. Similarly, research found that women performed sit-ups at 95 to 110 percent of the male rate, but Army standards required women to perform at only 93 percent of the men\u2019s standards. Officials at the Army Physical Fitness School could not fully document the rationale behind the standards. They believed that the minimum requirements were based on actual data collected in the early 1980s, but the incremental steps up to the maximum scores were based on simple numerical progressions, not actual performance data. For example, according to Army officials, the difference between the minimum and maximum requirement in the 2-mile run was set at exactly 4 minutes, regardless of gender or age group. Additional points above the minimum were awarded for every 6 seconds shaved off the minimum requirement. In the two youngest age groups, women\u2019s requirements were exactly  3 minutes slower than men\u2019s.", "Beginning in October 1998, the Army was scheduled to implement new standards based on a more scientifically based approach, with a gender neutral \u201cequal points for equal effort\u201d policy. The new minimum requirements are generally based on the 8th percentile of a sample of actual scores collected by the Army\u2019s 1995 study, the maximums on performances at the 90th percentile, and both requirements are gradually reduced in 5-year increments as age increases. The new standards generally toughen the requirements for both sexes, requiring women to perform the same number of sit-ups as men, female run times to be set about 14 to 16 percent slower than male times, and female push-up requirements to increase from 44 to about 50 percent of the male standards. According to the Army study, these changes are consistent with a narrowing physical performance gap between the genders in recent years. The Army now plans to implement these new standards in January 1999.", "Air Force officials could provide no studies or other records to document the rationale for their cardiovascular endurance or body fat standards. However, according to Air Force officials, an oral history of the standards was developed through discussions with officers previously responsible for the program. According to the oral history, the cardiovascular standard was based on performance statistics from a population of Air Force men and women in the early 1990s. Researchers recommended that the minimum standard be set at the 20th percentile of performance because that was the point with the largest incremental gain in health benefits between percentile groups. However, Air Force officials wanted a higher standard for readiness reasons: as a result the next percentile grouping up, the 40th percentile, was selected as the minimum standard. Female standards were set the same way and at the same level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gender Adjustments to Body Fat Standards Vary and Are Not Based on Scientific Rationales", "paragraphs": ["Experts indicate that it is appropriate to base gender-specific body fat standards on studies of the level of fat found in populations of physically fit men and women or on life insurance actuarial studies of the weights for heights associated with long life and good health. However, at least two services, the Army and the Navy, based their female body fat standards on different rationales than the male standards. Officials from DOD and the other services could not clearly document the basis for the standards.", "DOD\u2019s original body fat standards were established in 1981 based on the recommendations of the study panel chartered to report on physical fitness in the military. According to the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 1998 report, the study panel recommended that both the male and female body fat standards be based on scientific texts indicating that the average body fat of physically fit young men was 20 percent and about 30 percent for fit young women, including a 5-percent margin for statistical error. DOD\u2019s guidance incorporated the 20-percent goal for men but lowered the female goal to 26 percent. According to the Academy\u2019s report, DOD decreased the female goal \u201cin the belief that it was desirable to recruit women whose body fat was closer to that of the average man, as such women, possessing a higher than average proportion of fat free mass, might also be more similar to men in strength and endurance.\u201d", "DOD\u2019s original body fat standards were in effect until 1995, when they were changed to the current level of 18 to 26 percent for men and 26 to 36 percent for women. DOD officials had no documentation of the rationale for the change. However, service officials told us that the change was based simply on the desire to cover the full range of standards in effect in the services at the time and that no scientific research was conducted. Similarly, the weights listed in DOD\u2019s screening tables for body fat (see table 2.3) are based on the National Institutes of Health 1985 definition of obesity, or 120 percent of certain weights-for-height identified in actuarial tables produced by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1983. However, we could find little agreement between DOD\u2019s tables and the Metropolitan Life tables they are supposed to match.", "Until September 1998, Navy regulations based male and female body fat standards on different rationales. The male standard is based on the 1985 National Institutes of Health definition of obesity. Navy scientists converted the 1983 Metropolitan Life weight-for-height values into mean body fat percentages of about 22 percent for males and 33 percent for females, and recommended these percentages be adopted as maximum Navy body fat standards. The recommendation for males was adopted without change. However, according to discussions with Navy officials, command concerns about appearance resulted in lowering the female standard to 30 percent. The Navy revised its regulations in September 1998 to raise the female standard back to the 33 percent originally recommended.", "Marine Corps officials could not document a clear, scientific basis for either its male or female standards. However, based on our discussions with Marine Corps officials and review of regulations, the Marine Corps body fat standards appear to be based on command judgments regarding fitness and appearance, rather than health based actuarial studies or other scientific bases, although some limited research appears to have been considered. For example, Marine Corps regulations state that, more than any other service, the Marine Corps relies on the maximum fitness of its personnel. As a result, according to the regulation, the maximum allowable percentage of body fat for male Marines was set at 18 percent. This equates to just below the midpoint of the interval between the 10-percent body fat level said by the regulation to be exhibited by marathon runners and the 30-percent level said by the regulation to represent gross obesity. Similarly, the regulation sets the female standard at 26 percent, or about 80 percent of the way up the interval between the 11-percent body fat level said by the regulation to be exhibited by average gymnasts and the 30-percent level said by the regulation to represent gross obesity in women.", "The Army\u2019s current body fat standards of 20 to 26 percent for men and 30 to 36 percent for women, according to research cited in the 1998 National Academy of Sciences report and our discussions with Army officials, are based on different rationales. The 20-percent male minimum is based on Army data on young male soldiers dating back to the 1980s. The 26-percent male maximum was a result of increasing the 20-percent minimum figure by 2 percentage points roughly for every 10 years of age to accommodate increases associated with aging. The Army\u2019s current female standards were established in 1991. Prior to that year, the female standards were 28 to 34 percent, which Army officials told us were determined simply by adding 8 percentage points to the male minimum for each age category. The female standard was also viewed as unfairly restrictive compared with the men\u2019s standard. For example, an Army study found that the standard provided young women only a 1-to-3 percentage point margin over the mean body fat for young female recruits, while the men\u2019s standard provided a 4-to-6 percentage point margin over the mean for young male recruits. In 1991, the women\u2019s standard was increased by 2 percentage points for each age grouping, raising it to the current level of 30 to 36 percent.", "Air Force officials could not determine the basis for their body fat standards. Consequently, they were also unable to tell us the basis for adjustments to the standards for gender."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Procedures for Determining Body Fat May Not Accurately Account for Gender and Racial Differences", "paragraphs": ["The basic approach used by each service to determine the percentage of body fat has been to first develop a set of measures of the circumference of various body sites, such as the waist and neck for men, and the neck, waist, and hips for women. Next, these measures are entered into gender-specific equations developed by each service to estimate the percentage of body fat. These equations were developed through analysis of population samples for relationships between measures of various body sites and the percentage of body fat, as validated against underwater weighing techniques.", "Researchers found, however, that this approach yields consistent results across the services for men, but not women. According to service researchers, men have basically one body type, whereas women have a variety of body types. The female body fat equations do not adjust well for the variety of female body types and thus do not consistently provide accurate predictions of the percentage of body fat. The three different body fat equations used by the services can result in different percentages of body fat when applied to the same woman. For example, a test we conducted found that the estimates for percentage of body fat for the same woman was 42 percent using the Army equation, 29 percent using the Navy and Air Force equations, and 27 percent using the Marine equation. The use of different equations producing such wide variation in estimates can result not only in inequities, but also in outcomes that are inconsistent with the intended objective. For example, even though the Marine Corps set its body fat standards at the most stringent level of any service, the equation it uses resulted in the lowest estimate of body fat of all the services.", "Researchers also report that the populations of active-duty soldiers used to validate the equations have, over time, become less representative of the ethnic and age diversity of the current military population. The Army\u2019s female equation, for example, was validated largely on a Caucasian population because of problems in underwater weighing of African American and Hispanic subjects, many of whom withdrew from the testing because they could not swim. According to the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 1998 report, because the percentage of female and non-Caucasian soldiers is increasing, and the average age of female soldiers is also increasing, the subject population used to develop and validate the equations is becoming increasingly less representative. Table 3.1 shows the ethnicity of U.S. servicemembers as of the end of fiscal year 1997.", "The National Academy of Sciences\u2019 1998 report also concluded that the service equations are outdated because they fail to adjust for heavier bone densities in minorities. In the past, all services compared the results of their body fat equations with underwater weighing methods as a reference to check for accuracy and standardization. These techniques were based on so-called two-compartment models, which partition body weight into two basic components: fat and fat free mass (defined as the difference between body weight and fat mass). However, two-compartment models do not account for racial differences in bone density, thus potentially overstating the weight of minorities. In contrast, newer four-compartment models measure bone mass, total body water, body weight, and body volume, in part based on underwater weighing techniques. The Academy\u2019s report concluded that agreement now exists that four compartment models have been developed over the past decade that are superior to the earlier two-compartment models. The Marine Corps was the first to base its equations on the newer four compartment models, beginning in October 1997. Navy researchers are currently developing equations based on four-compartment models for the remaining services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policy Requiring Testing at All Ages Not Followed", "paragraphs": ["DOD guidance states that all servicemembers regardless of age will be tested for cardiovascular and muscular endurance. However, the Navy has exempted personnel age 50 and older, and the Marine Corps personnel age 46 and older, from such testing for years due to concerns about retaining senior leaders. In contrast, members of the Army and the Air Force are tested throughout their careers, in accordance with DOD policy. These inconsistencies can create significant inequities. For example, a 50-year-old, 70-inch tall Army male needed to weigh 192 pounds and complete sit-ups, push-ups, and a 2-mile run within specified timeframes to stay in that service. However, until recently, a Marine Corps male of the same age and height would have had to maintain a similar weight, but would not have to pass any cardiovascular endurance or strength tests to remain in the Marine Corps. The Marine Corps recognized that its fitness testing policy did not comply with DOD guidance and therefore changed the policy in July 1998, requiring that Marines of all ages pass tests in distance running, sit-ups, pull-ups, and the flexed arm hang. Navy officials believed that their fitness testing policy would also be changed, pending the results of an ongoing review.", "There is also disagreement over whether to relax body fat standards as servicemembers age. All services relaxed their cardiovascular and muscular endurance standards as service personnel age. However, the Navy and the Marine Corps did not carry this policy over to body fat standards. Older members of those services must meet the same body fat standards as the youngest members of their respective services. In contrast, the Army allows a 6-percentage point increase, and the Air Force a 4-percent increase, as their men and women age. This difference can be significant. For example, a 20-year-old female weighing 130 pounds would be allowed to gain about 8 pounds of fat by the age of 40 in the Army, while in the Navy and the Marine Corps no increase would be allowed. For a 20-year-old male weighing 200 pounds the difference would amount to about 12 pounds. DOD guidance allows relaxation of the cardiovascular and muscular endurance standards with age, but do not address this issue in the case of body fat standards.", "Army officials argued that it is realistic to reduce body fat standards as personnel age, but Navy officials argued that relaxing the standards implies that health is less important as men and women age. Researchers acknowledge that weight becomes progressively more difficult to maintain with age. There is a gradual loss of muscle mass as one ages, which may be replaced with fat over time.

For example, Army research traces confusion between health and military performance objectives to the 1981 DOD Study of the Military Services Physical Fitness. This study acknowledged the benefits of designing programs with a health objective, but concluded that the goal of military physical fitness programs should be to make military personnel as fit for combat as possible. DOD\u2019s 1981 Physical Fitness and Weight Control directive stated that physical fitness is essential to the general health of military personnel and that primary emphasis should be placed on programs that maintain physical fitness. However, the guidance also stated that ideally, physical training should be designed to develop physical skills needed in combat. Similarly, DOD\u2019s requirement that all personnel, regardless of age, be tested for physical fitness is clearly spelled out in DOD\u2019s 1981 directive, and DOD\u2019s 1981 report on fitness in the military notes that the Navy and the Marine Corps were already exempting older personnel from fitness testing at that time. The requirements for each service to evaluate both cardiovascular and muscular endurance and provide annual reports that assess the program can be traced back at least to the 1995 version of the fitness guidance. However, the Air Force had stopped testing for muscular endurance by the early 1980s, and at the time of our fieldwork, none of the services had ever provided the required annual program reports.", "Officials from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy said that they were aware of the problems with the physical fitness and body fat instructions and directives as well as noncompliance with DOD policies. According to these officials, a joint service working group has been examining these problems since the summer of 1996. However, the officials cited two factors delaying corrective action. First, there was little consensus among the working group on the usefulness of existing research for resolving DOD fitness policy issues. As a result, it was deemed prudent to wait until the National Academy of Sciences completed its study on body fat policies before revising DOD policy. Second, the office that monitors the services\u2019 fitness programs has multiple responsibilities and frequent personnel turnover, and has no resident technical expert in exercise physiology, all of which limit the office\u2019s capability to quickly resolve such complex issues.", "Similar problems, however, were identified in DOD\u2019s 1981 report on fitness programs. For example, the report found that, compared with other programs, physical fitness received little emphasis or resource commitment in DOD, and there was a lack of fitness-related research and qualified professional leadership and personnel with professional degrees in physical fitness. The report provided a number of recommendations to improve DOD management of physical fitness, including one for the Office of the Secretary of Defense to establish a DOD Committee for Physical Fitness to provide coordinated and continuing review and evaluation of the services\u2019 physical fitness programs and research. In 1985, DOD established a Joint Committee on Fitness to establish internal operating objectives for service fitness programs and function as a focal point for the exchange of policy, program, and research information. However, according to DOD officials, this committee stopped meeting and has been inactive for some time. These officials were unsure of the specific time or reasons the Committee stopped meeting.", "DOD officials told us that action to correct some of these problems has begun. For example, according to DOD, initial agreement has been reached to continue to study implementing one body fat equation for men and one for women across all services. Additional recommendations contained in the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 report are still being reviewed, but drafting of policy revisions is planned for the fall of 1998. DOD officials also acknowledged that enforcement of the annual reporting requirement could have provided a useful monitoring mechanism.

However, the services could not consistently provide this information. Similarly, the 1981 DOD report on fitness in the military also reported that the services could not accurately assess the fitness of their personnel and called for systems to be established to monitor and measure program effectiveness.", "DOD and the services maintain a variety of statistics to describe various aspects of the physical fitness programs. However, this information is difficult to compare across services and time periods to provide meaningful conclusions about the level of fitness in the military. Differences in comprehensiveness, in the way in which data is aggregated, or other problems create comparison problems. For example, according to officials, the Army does not maintain a servicewide data base on physical fitness test results. The responsibility for maintaining this information is decentralized to the unit level. Further, Navy officials told us that they do not separate their data by gender, so comparisons of male and female performance against the standards are not available. Other problems included unreliable information due to unit underreporting, results not separated to identify other key characteristics such as rank, or data on recent years not available due to system changes. As a result of these problems, we were unable to determine and compare fitness and body fat failure rates over time, separation rates due to repeated failures of the fitness standards, and other such key information.", "According to service officials, most fitness-related separations result from failure to achieve the body fat standards. For example, as shown in  table 4.1, an average of about 4,600 enlisted personnel were separated during 1996 and 1997 for failing body fat standards. Data on officers was not consistently available. The number of personnel separated due to failures of the cardiovascular and muscular endurance standards was generally not available, but service officials believed that the number was relatively small.", "Although available data cannot be directly compared across services, our comparisons of limited available data raised questions about the effectiveness of the fitness programs. For example, data provided to us by the services indicates that failure rates in cardiovascular and muscular endurance tests are markedly different. A 1995 study by the Army Physical Fitness School found overall officer and enlisted failure rates at 12.5 percent. In comparison, failure rates in the Air Force totaled about 4.6 percent during 1997 and failure rates in the Marine Corps totaled about 1 percent, based on 1997 data. The reason for the large differences is unclear. For example, the Marine Corps appears to have the most difficult standards, but its failure rate appears to be the lowest. Available data on body fat failures showed somewhat less pronounced differences. For example, during 1997 nearly 5 percent of Army officers and enlisted personnel had their personnel records flagged for being overweight. In contrast, as of March 1998, about 2 percent of Air Force personnel were in weight management programs.", "Service data also indicated that women consistently fail the fitness standards at slightly higher rates than men. For example, the data cited above indicates that Army women failed the cardiovascular and muscular endurance standards at a 13-percent rate in 1995, while men failed at an 11-percent rate. Air Force data indicates that in 1997, women in that service failed in 9 percent of the cases, while men failed in 4 percent. Based on 1997 data, Marine women failed at a rate of 1.1 percent, while male Marines failed at a rate of 0.8 percent. Available data on the results of the body fat test was consistent with this trend. For example, Army data for 1997 showed that female Army personnel failed in about 6 percent of the cases, while Army men failed in about 5 percent of the cases. As of March 1998, about 4 percent of Air Force women were in weight management programs versus 2 percent of men.", "Officials also raised concerns about the lack of fitness of recruits and younger servicemembers in recent years. For example, the fitness of career soldiers was viewed as satisfactory, but the 1995 Army Physical Fitness School study found that 32 percent of women and 27 percent of men aged 17 to 21 failed the fitness test. By 1997, according to Army Physical Fitness School officials, a similar study found the failure rate was 55 percent of women and 38 percent of the men. Similarly, data provided by the Marine Corps showed that physical fitness test scores for incoming male and female recruits at one location were between 10 and 7 percentage points, respectively, lower in 1996 than in 1992. Officials in both services believed the trends were due to the increasing lack of fitness in our society. In the early 1960s, national health surveys found that about 24 percent of Americans ages 20 to 74 were overweight. However, according to a recent report by the National Institutes of Health, about 55 percent of the U.S. population is now considered overweight or obese. The reasons for the increase are unclear. Some have pointed to an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, with more focus on computers and electronic games, and less time spent exercising or playing sports. Others have pointed to social or cultural changes. Officials in both the Army and the Marine Corps, however, believe that training was able to improve the fitness of these personnel as they progressed through military life.
