Since enactment of PAEA, USPS has received approval from PRC to offer eight experimental postal products, which are products that differ significantly from other offered products, such as the sale of gift cards loaded with a specified sum of money. Lastly, USPS performs at least four discretionary services (i.e., services it chooses, rather than is required, to perform) for other federal agencies, such as accepting passport applications for the State Department.", "USPS is currently pursuing 55 new initiatives that it identified based on outreach to postal stakeholders. USPS chose to pursue these initiatives because of their potential to increase revenue and add value to the mail, among other reasons. Forty-eight initiatives are extensions of existing lines of postal products and services, such as offering Post Office Box customers a suite of service enhancements (e.g., expanded lobby hours and earlier pickup times) at selected locations and increasing public awareness of the availability of postal services at retail stores. Three initiatives are extensions of existing nonpostal services, including allowing customers to forward their mail to a new address using mobile devices. Finally, four of the initiatives involve experimental postal products, such as prepaid postage on the sale of greeting cards. These four experimental products are among the total of eight experimental products that have received PRC approval since enactment of PAEA. Forty-five of the 55 initiatives are ongoing; the remaining are under development.", "USPS considered but decided not to pursue 25 other stakeholder-identified initiatives, primarily because of financial reasons. Twelve initiatives were abandoned because USPS determined they were not likely to be profitable or the initial investment was too high. Reasons for not pursuing other initiatives included insufficient stakeholder interest or lack of statutory authority. USPS would like to pursue revenue-generating opportunities in three areas--nonpostal services, shipments of alcoholic beverages, and services performed for state and local governments--if it is provided with statutory authority to do so. USPS officials said opportunities in these areas could improve USPS's financial position, but they emphasized that additional innovations will not be sufficient to return USPS to financial solvency.

The PRC  defined, for the purposes of its review, a service to be an ongoing  commercial activity that USPS offered to the public for financial gain.

The PRC, as a matter of practice, considers whether  these conditions have been met before USPS can begin a market test.  PAEA authorized market tests for products that are not anticipated to  exceed $10 million in annual revenue and authorized the PRC to exempt  products from this threshold if the annual revenue will not (or is not  expected to) exceed $50 million.

In the summer and fall of 2010, USPS held a series of  discussions, including an innovation symposium with stakeholders  including business leaders, partners, customers, suppliers, and  academics, to gather insights on potential innovations and revenue  opportunities. According to USPS, the outreach generated over 1,500  potential initiatives, which were evaluated and winnowed down based on  a variety of factors, such as time to implement, return on investment, and  strategic fit. According to USPS, its decisions to pursue certain initiatives  have been guided by several recurring themes, including: making it easier and more convenient for businesses and consumers promoting mailing best practices, such as those that incorporate  barcode technology into advertising campaigns; and  innovating and leading in e-commerce delivery to meet the needs of  the mobile generation.", "In addition to these recurring themes, each initiative is aligned to support  one of USPS\u2019s three primary marketing strategies.
