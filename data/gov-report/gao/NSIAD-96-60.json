Separate processes are a product of separate commands. Much of DOD cargo today moves intermodally, by air, land, and sea transport. However, USTRANSCOM retains an outdated and inefficient, modally oriented, organizational structure, with many collocated facilities. In fiscal year 1994, USTRANSCOM\u2019s total expenses for defense transportation services were $5.6 billion. Neither USTRANSCOM nor the component commands, however, collect financial information in a manner that allows actual and total cost of the organizational structure to be developed.

Fragmentation refers to the fact that no one organization has responsibility for all aspects of traffic management or is able to meet customers\u2019 needs regardless of transportation mode. This situation reflects the fact that management processes were developed independently of each other. Although USTRANSCOM was established to consolidate functions within one organization, because various component commands retain modal responsibilities, fragmentation remains, particularly with such areas as negotiating rates to move cargo, shipment routing, documenting shipments for control and payment, and customer billing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Rate Negotiation Process Divided Among Multiple Units", "paragraphs": ["The rate negotiation process is inefficient and not designed to facilitate customer services. USTRANSCOM employs five separate systems and strategies for negotiating rates, and each system reflects a particular service\u2019s approach to procurement. Accordingly, it can take as many as five separate USTRANSCOM units to negotiate the rates for a single shipment. Thus, a customer may need to contact five separate units to get all the rates needed to move a single shipment. As a result, the customer often experiences delays in getting needed services and may become interested in circumventing the system. Circumvention may be to the customer\u2019s immediate advantage but not advantageous to DOD overall. Moreover, separate negotiation units add more people and costs to the system.", "The following are various types of shipments and the units used for negotiating the rates. \u2022 For domestic continental United States (CONUS) freight shipments, and the CONUS portion of international shipments not moving as part of a through-intermodal move, MTMC\u2019s Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations, which has a staff of about 20 traffic management specialists, negotiates for land transportation, inland waterway transportation, and less-than-plane load air transportation with U.S. motor carriers, railroads, freight forwarders, barge carriers, and air cargo companies. \u2022 For international freight shipments, MSC\u2019s Central Technical Activity, Contracts and Business Directorate and its staff of 36, who are primarily contracting specialists, negotiate for ocean transportation with ocean carriers. \u2022 For foreign transportation, MTMC\u2019s overseas commands, such as MTMC-Europe, Directorate of Inland Theater Transportation, negotiate for land, inland waterway, and air rates, as required, in their areas of responsibilities. \u2022 For stevedore and terminal services, MTMC\u2019s Office of the Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting, with a staff of seven contracting specialists, negotiates contracts with port interests.

Moreover, the fragmentation adds more people to the organizational structure than needed.", "First, for domestic CONUS shipments, MTMC is responsible for providing information to customers requiring routing advice. Generally, this information is provided to installation transportation offices and others, through the CONUS Freight Management system. This system is intended to be a comprehensive freight management information system to standardize and automate freight traffic management by providing the capability to perform cost evaluations, select the best value carrier, and perform prepayment audits of government bills of lading.", "Second, for international shipments, MTMC provides the routing in consultation with MSC that has negotiated the movement contract. The sealift cargo routing/booking and contract administration functions were performed by MSC, but in October 1981, following the Harbridge House, Inc., study, these functions were transferred to MTMC. MSC still retains oversight over contractual provisions requiring certain minimum allocation of cargo to other than the low-cost carriers on certain ocean liner trade routes and over the statutory regulations governing the use or nonuse of U.S.-flag ocean carriers.", "Third, for personal property shipments, MTMC has routing systems separate from its cargo routing systems to route shipments within CONUS and to and from overseas locations.", "AMC Aerial Port Operations also handles airlift shipment routing/carrier selection.

In fiscal year 1994, DOD moved more than 1.2 million shipments, at a cost of nearly $600 million, under the government bill of lading system.", "The documentation system used for international shipments is a combination of Military Standard Transportation and Movement Procedures and the government bill of lading system. Most international cargo shipments move under the Military Standard Transportation and Movement Procedures system that uses DOD-unique documents, such as the Transportation Control and Movement Documents and ocean cargo manifests. Because this system is unique to DOD, commercial carriers must set up a system only for DOD if they want its business. A portion of the international cargo program, shipments moving to and from Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico, and shipments by foreign-flag carriers, uses the government bill of lading system. In fiscal year 1994, DOD moved 7.5 million measurement tons of freight, at a cost of $735 million, using the Military Standard Transportation and Movement Procedures system, and about 0.9 million measurement tons of cargo, at a cost of $106 million, using the government bill of lading system.", "For personal property shipments, both domestic and international, DOD uses the government bill of lading system.

Customers receive a bill from each component command for each mode of transportation, rather than a single intermodal bill from only one component. Consequently, when a noncontainerized freight shipment moves from some interior point in the United States to an interior point overseas, a customer pays for the services USTRANSCOM has provided in five parts. For example, for one shipment, a customer may have one charge related to shipping cargo to the port of embarkation, a second charge for MTMC\u2019s port handling, a third charge for MSC\u2019s ocean service, a fourth charge for MTMC\u2019s custom clearance and receipt of cargo overseas, and a fifth charge for line-haul transportation overseas to final point of destination.

MTMC\u2019s administrative expenses related to these shipments are paid to MTMC in lump sum, not shipment-by-shipment. \u2022 For international shipments, customers reimburse MTMC and MSC for the services.

When cargo moves intermodally, containers are packed at the point of origin, moved by truck to the port of embarkation, loaded on a ship, unloaded at the port of debarkation, moved by truck to the point of destination, and unpacked. With intermodal movements on land and sea, fewer personnel are needed at the ports for warehousing, packaging, and loading than were required for modal movements. For example, according to transportation studies, a container port requires about 85 percent less labor than a noncontainerized (breakbulk) port. The loading and unloading of containers on ships, rail cars, and trucks are now achieved with large cranes that require much less manpower than what was required to pack and unpack crates for shipment.", "MTMC still maintains a heavily staffed worldwide port infrastructure. The work performed at the ports has changed from cargo handling activities to various traffic management activities. The principal missions of MTMC units at ports are to accomplish the expeditious movement and documentation of DOD-sponsored cargo and privately owned vehicles through the military and commercial terminals and piers in the command\u2019s or unit\u2019s area of responsibility and, as assigned, cargo booking functions. Generally, these units are organized substantially the same as they were more than a decade ago and reflect an era prior to containerization. Each has an office of the commander, an administration division, and a combination of divisions for cargo operations, cargo documentation, and traffic management. This is little different from December 1979 when MTMC began setting up its terminals in a standardized organization of no more than four divisions to provide a more streamlined, better understood structure while still preserving sufficient latitude to provide flexibility to meet local conditions.", "Staff are dispersed as follows: \u2022 461 located in U.S. East Coast facilities, \u2022 88 located in U.S. Gulf Coast facilities, \u2022 176 located in U.S. West Coast facilities, \u2022 42 located in Caribbean/Central America facilities, \u2022 244 located in European facilities, and \u2022 282 located in Far East facilities.", "The facilities include 4 major port commands, 14 medium port commands, 6 port detachments, 1 outport, and 1 river terminal.", "\u201cThe Bayonne and Oakland terminals have been outmoded by transportation distribution technology and are increasingly underutilized. The advent of containerization has had a tremendous impact on DOD and commercial cargo transportation, with many commercial facilities converting to or adding container handling equipment. In 1970, MTMC elected to move DOD container cargo through commercial container facilities on the east and west coasts, rather than install duplicate facilities at the Bayonne and Oakland terminals. The commercial facilities can meet DOD contingency and support requirements.\u201d", "The 1995 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission justified a recommendation to close two MTMC terminal facilities\u2014Military Ocean Terminal, Bayonne, New Jersey; and the Oakland Army Base, California\u2014because the normal workload at these terminals did not justify continued military operation of the facilities and commercial ports could handle military cargo requirements.", "Table 3.3 shows the current number of MTMC port and terminal staff by unit and location."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Personnel at MSC Port Sites Adds More to Infrastructure Costs", "paragraphs": ["MSC, as part of its DBOF-T mission, also maintains personnel at ports around the world.

Air Mobility Command (AMC). Airlift flying hours and associated costs are based on the requirement to maintain the capability of the airlift system, including crew training (and concurrent mobilization) requirement. The airlift system training generated capacity is used by DOD to move air eligible cargo and passengers. In order to extend air eligibility and increase capacity utilization, rates are generally established to be competitive with commercial carriers. However, resulting contributed revenue does not cover the costs of operations due to the mobilization requirement. This requirement will be recorded/ budgeted as follows: (1) . . . Military personnel within the Air Mobility Command will be direct funded by a Military Personnel appropriation. Although the cost shall be recorded as a DBOF cost, it shall be recorded so that it is not required to be recovered in customer rates.

Studies dating back to 1949 also concluded that an integrated transportation system was a critical element of an efficient and effective transportation system. In 1986, a Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management (the Packard Commission) recommended establishing a single unified command to integrate global air, land, and sea transportation. This recommendation was acted upon with passage of the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986, which ordered the Secretary of Defense to consider creation of a unified transportation command, to include MTMC, MSC, and AMC.

The study found that the defense transportation system continued to be replete with redundant organizational structure and inefficient and costly processes. As a result, USTRANSCOM and the Office of Secretary of Defense are taking steps to reengineer the defense transportation system.
