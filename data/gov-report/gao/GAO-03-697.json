The full amount these programs spend on transportation is unknown because transportation is not always tracked separately from other spending. However, available information (i.e., estimated or actual outlays or obligations) on 29 of the programs shows that federal agencies spent at least an estimated $2.4 billion on these services in fiscal year 2001. Additional spending by states and localities is also not fully known but is at least in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Efforts to improve services and achieve cost savings through coordination of transportation activities (through sharing resources or information or consolidating services under a single agency) among federal agencies vary. The Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility--a body with representation from the Departments of Transportation and Health and Human Services--has undertaken some activities to improve coordination. However, other agencies that administer a substantial number of programs for the transportation-disadvantaged, such as the Departments of Labor and Education, are not part of the Council. In addition, the Coordinating Council's strategic plan is not linked to its action plan and contains few measurable performance goals. The strategic and annual performance plans of the Departments of Transportation and Health and Human Services contain few references to coordination relating to their subagencies and programs that fund transportation services for the transportation disadvantaged, and the plans of the Departments of Labor and Education do not mention coordinating these services. Obstacles impeding coordination include concern among administrators that their own participants might be negatively affected, program rules that limit use by others, and limited guidance and information on coordination. To mitigate these obstacles, officials and experts suggested making federal standards more consistent, creating a clearinghouse or better Web site to facilitate interagency communication and provide better guidance on coordination, and providing financial incentives or instituting mandates to coordinate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The ability to access personal or public transportation is fundamental for  people to connect with employment opportunities, health and medical  services, educational services, and the community at large.

These \u201ctransportation- disadvantaged\u201d persons may have an age-related condition, a disability, or  income constraints. This is potentially a sizeable group. For example,  according to the 2000 U.S. Census, 35.1 million people were over age 65,  44.5 million people were over age 21 and disabled, and 33.9 million people  were living below the poverty line. Many within these populations face  significant problems in accessing transportation.", "Many federal programs authorize use of funds to provide transportation  for transportation-disadvantaged people so they can access government  programs. Programs that provide incidental transportation include health  and medical programs, job-training programs, or programs for the aging.  The coordination of these transportation services\u2014through pooling  resources, consolidating trips provided by various agencies under a single  agency, or sharing information between programs\u2014has been found to  improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of service. At the federal level,  the Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility\u2014a body consisting of  representatives from the Departments of Health and Human Services and  Transportation\u2014is charged with coordinating transportation services  provided by federal programs and promoting the maximum feasible  coordination at the state and local levels.

Elderly people are  also more likely to have difficulty accessing traditional public  transportation due to physical ailments.", "Thirty percent of respondents with disabilities reported difficulty in  accessing transportation, compared to 10 percent of respondents without  a disability, according to a 2000 survey by the National Organization on  Disabilities.", "Low-income households are less likely to own a car than other households  due to the prohibitive cost of purchasing, insuring, and maintaining a car,  and public transportation may not provide sufficient options for their  needs. Over 90 percent of public assistance recipients do not own a car.", "The importance of coordinating transportation services for transportation- disadvantaged populations has been evident since the 1970s. In 1977, we  issued a report on transportation coordination, which concluded that the  most significant hindrance to the coordination of transportation services  under these programs was confusion at all levels of government as to how  much coordination federally funded projects could engage in. Since 1986,  responsibility for coordinating transportation programs at the federal level  has rested in the Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility, which was  created under a memorandum of understanding between the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of  Transportation (DOT). This body is composed of representatives from  program offices within these departments, and employees of the two  departments meet its staffing needs, on a part-time basis.", "More recent reviews have continued to identify a need for stronger efforts  in this area. In a 1999 report on transportation coordination, we found  that coordination efforts of the Coordinating Council, DOT, and HHS were  ongoing but still needed strengthening. This report also noted that the  Congress had endorsed increased coordination as evidenced by several  provisions in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA- 21), and significant financial benefits had been realized through  coordination.

This includes contracting for services with  private transportation providers or providing bus tokens, transit passes,  taxi vouchers, mileage reimbursement to volunteers or program  participants, or some combination of these methods. For example,  recipients of funds from DOL\u2019s Workforce Investment Act Adult Services  Program typically provide bus tokens or mileage reimbursement for  participants to access training, while recipients of HHS\u2019s Grants for  Supportive Services and Senior Centers most often contract with local  transportation providers to provide client transportation. The funding  recipients of several programs, however, typically purchase and operate  vehicles, or modify existing vehicles for use by individuals with  disabilities. These programs include Head Start and the Program for  American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Hawaiian Elders in HHS; the  Vocational Rehabilitation Grants Program in the Department of Education;  and the six programs within DOT.", "Several of these programs have requirements for grantees to coordinate  their services with other agencies providing similar services, which would  include transportation, among other services.

Similarly, DOT\u2019s Capital Assistance  Program for Elderly Persons and Persons with Disabilities, Job Access and  Reverse Commute, and Nonurbanized Area Formula Program have  requirements for grantees to coordinate their transportation services. In  addition, some programs have provisions designed to avoid duplication of  effort and encourage the use of existing community resources. For  example, Workforce Investment Act programs may use funds to support  those who are participating in the program only if those individuals are  unable to obtain services through other programs, according to program  officials.

Matching requirements, which represent the nonfederal contributions to  the program\u2019s costs that come from state, local, or private funds, provide  some information on state and local spending on transportation for the  transportation-disadvantaged. About half of the 62 programs have  matching requirements that generally require states and localities to  contribute between 5 and 50 percent of total costs. Additionally, limited  information from officials in the five states we visited indicates that total  state and local spending on transportation runs into the hundreds of  millions of dollars. For example:    Nonfederal contributions for Medicaid nonemergency transportation  ranged from 32 to 50 percent of the total spending on this service in the  five states that we visited. In New York, 50 percent, or an estimated  $139.4 million, of the state\u2019s total spending on Medicaid funded  transportation in 2001 was from nonfederal sources. In Florida and  Wisconsin approximately 40 percent of the total amount spent on  nonemergency medical transportation in the state was from nonfederal  sources; state contributions in those states were $28.6 million and $13.4  million, respectively, in 2001.

Fifteen of these  states reported deficits in excess of 5 percent of the state budget, and four  states are facing deficits greater than 10 percent of the state budget.  Because 49 states have balanced budget requirements, such large deficits  could lead to a decrease in the amount of funds available to states for  programmatic spending, including transportation programs. For example,  according to the National Conference of State Legislatures report, 29  states have imposed across-the-board cuts in response to budget deficits.", "State budget deficits have affected state transportation spending  differently in the five states that we visited. For example:    Two of the states have cut their state programs that local grantees used to  fund services for the transportation-disadvantaged, according to  transportation officials in those states. In one state, the state legislature  eliminated the state\u2019s transportation assistance program to help deal with  the state\u2019s budget deficit; as a result, the state official and the director of a  senior center in the state said that some of the projects funded through the  program will likely be discontinued because grantees cannot find  replacement funds. In the other state, the state legislature cut a state fund  that grantees used to supplement federal transportation funding.  According to an official, the loss of this fund, combined with the  increasing costs of fuel and insurance, may lead providers to cut service to  transportation-disadvantaged populations by as much as 40 percent.", "In another state, the Governor\u2019s plan for closing the state\u2019s budget gap  includes reducing spending on Medicaid nonemergency medical  transportation by $5 million, or 7.6 percent; however, the state\u2019s fund  dedicated to providing other services for the transportation-disadvantaged  was not recommended for cuts.", "Transportation officials in two states told us that they had not yet  experienced cuts in state funding for services for the transportation- disadvantaged. In one of the states, local grantees rely on a state  transportation fund and a large set-aside of TANF funds to provide  services to transportation-disadvantaged populations. Without these two  funds, local grantees would have difficulty financing services for the  transportation-disadvantaged, according to an official. The other state is  not currently anticipating cuts in state funding for services for  transportation-disadvantaged populations, however, according to an  official, the full impact of the fiscal situation in that state will not be  known until local governments develop program budgets for 2004 because  the local governments\u2014which are also facing budget constraints\u2014play a  key role in determining what services will be provided.", "While some states are not currently experiencing reductions in their  transportation programs, many states are anticipating that budget deficits  will continue into 2004.

Even in states without such a coordinating body,  however, some state and local agencies are engaged in coordination  efforts. This variation also occurred in the nation as a whole, according to  data from a preliminary report by the National Academy of Sciences\u2019  Transportation Research Board, which found that roughly half of U.S.  states have a state transportation coordinating body.  (See appendix III  for information on the type of coordination in the five states we visited  and the state agencies involved.)", "Within each state, local efforts also varied. Examples of coordination  activities include the following:  Coordinated planning: In this type of coordination, some combination of  human service and transportation agencies and providers work together to  plan transportation services for their clients. For example, in northwestern  Wisconsin, at the initiative of staff from a center for independent living,  the Area Consortium on Transportation was formed in 2001 to improve the  planning and provision of transportation for the disabled and others who  are transit-dependent. The council\u2014which consists of consumers, transit  providers, county and city officials, disability organizations, and aging  groups\u2014is instituting several pilot programs to test various methods of  coordination.", "Brokerage:  In this type of coordination, one agency or provider serves as  the central point of contact for providing ride and eligibility information or  actually arranging transportation services for clients of multiple programs.  For example, officials in several New York counties wanted to maximize  residents\u2019 mobility by coordinating transportation services offered by  various federal and state programs, but lacked the expertise or start-up  costs to do so. With a grant from the state Departments of Transportation  and Health, the counties instituted a coordination demonstration project  whereby one agency arranges an average of 2,500 daily trips for clients  from a number of populations\u2014such as the disabled, senior citizens,  former welfare recipients, and others\u2014served by different federal and  state programs.", "Shared use of vehicles among multiple programs: In this type of  coordination, one agency may provide transportation for clients of  multiple programs, or each program may own its own vehicles but allow  them to be used by other programs. For example, in Arizona, vans from  one county\u2019s vocational rehabilitation center travel to a neighboring  county to pick up program clients.

In our visits with state and local transportation and human service  agencies and providers, officials we interviewed identified several  examples of overlapping services in areas or programs that were not  coordinating. A for-profit transportation provider in one state told us that  he often has two vehicles overlap on the same route at the same time, one  for medical trips and one for paratransit, because it is too difficult to mix  clients due to complicated fee structures and paperwork requirements  imposed by the state for the two programs. An official from a workforce  development program in another state told us that many programs in his  county use their own vans to deliver clients to the job center, but because  the programs do not coordinate, only a few people ride in each van. In  another locality that state and local officials said has had difficulty  coordinating, several human service providers hired a consultant to study  the extent to which various agencies provide similar transportation  services within a geographic region. This research showed substantial  overlap in local services for the transportation-disadvantaged, as shown in  figure 2. The consultant identified ways in which the number of routes  could be substantially reduced through better coordination, which are  being considered by the agencies involved.", "State and local officials also provided examples of fragmented services  and confusion in localities without coordinated programs. One official in  an uncoordinated area said that a lack of coordination results in  fragmented services, placing a burden on people who receive  transportation through many different programs, depending on trip  purpose, because they must be familiar with multiple systems, rules, and  requirements. Fragmentation also occurs when adjoining counties do not  coordinate their public transportation routes, leaving riders stranded due  to unconnected transit systems. In one state, local officials told us that  paratransit services do not extend beyond county lines, so people have to  schedule two separate trips to get from their homes in one county to  medical services in an adjoining county. When the first paratransit ride is  behind schedule, a passenger sometimes has to wait for hours for the  connecting ride. A provider in another state has contracts to provide  transportation services for clients in multiple human service programs.  Because of a lack of coordination among those programs, the  transportation provider said that his company has to maintain two  separate dispatching and reservation systems for its vehicles to comply  with differing reporting and eligibility requirements. Vehicles can only  operate under one dispatching system at a time, so the drivers cannot  provide rides to more than one type of client at a time. The provider also  said that clients who call for rides are confused by the sheer number of  programs, and the agents who make their reservations do not know for  which programs the clients are eligible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Progress toward Improved Coordination Varies", "paragraphs": ["Although the Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility and various  federal agencies have taken a number of steps to improve coordination,  these efforts have had mixed results."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Some Prior Recommendations to the Coordinating Council Have Been Implemented", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 4, the Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility\u2014a  body consisting of representatives from DOT and HHS\u2014has responded to  three of the recommendations we made in our 1999 report by adopting a  strategic plan, developing an action plan, and helping to ensure that  planned coordination efforts reinforce one another by issuing guidelines  for coordinating transportation services.

For example,  program administrators reported being concerned about a loss of control  over the quality and convenience of transportation services for their  clients and wanted to maintain their discretion over how to serve their  clients and which transportation resources to purchase. Program  administrators also expressed concern over mixing vulnerable  populations, such as the developmentally disabled and children, or frail,  sick, and healthy populations, in one coordinated system. According to a  report on coordinated transportation systems, this reluctance among  providers to cooperate can lead to an underutilization of vehicles.", "Likewise, some human service clients may be apprehensive about using  coordinated transportation because they may be uncomfortable mixing  with members of other populations with whom they are unfamiliar or they  may fear a loss of accommodation or convenience, such as having to  switch from door-to-door service to curb-to-curb service or public transit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Low Priority Given to Funding Coordination Activities", "paragraphs": ["The overall costs of coordination, which can include additional staff  members and staff time needed for maintaining and overseeing  coordination efforts, can be significant.

However, some officials stated that the low priority given to funding  coordination activities could impede coordination efforts. For example,  according to officials in one state, although recipients of funds from DOT\u2019s  Capital Assistance Program for Elderly Persons and Persons with  Disabilities are required to coordinate with other local transportation  services provided from federal sources, the program\u2019s current allotment  for administrative expenses would not support any staff to work on  coordination activities.

In these areas, coordination may not be a workable or cost- effective option."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Differing Program Requirements Can Impede Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Coordinating multiple programs administered at various levels of  government is complicated because the programs have different  requirements with respect to eligibility, funding, reporting, and safety; and  they differ in their programmatic goals and missions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Different Eligibility Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Federal program rules that specify the eligible populations that each  program can serve may limit opportunities for collaboration. For example,  DOT officials in one region stated that they were unable to combine DOL  and DOT funds for a DOT transportation program for migrant farm  workers because DOL funds are designated for U.S. citizens, while there is  no such restriction on the use of DOT funds. In addition, some liability  insurance policies specify that a program\u2019s vehicles may serve only a  certain population, thus those programs face additional insurance costs to  transport individuals other than program clients. Such restrictions may  lead to inefficient transportation services within a community. For  example, an official in one state we visited commented that one agency\u2019s  vehicle provided medically related trips three times per week to that  agency\u2019s clients, but would not transport other individuals seeking similar  medical services provided under other federal programs due, in part, to  liability insurance restrictions. Safety requirements may also vary by  program and jurisdiction, thus complicating efforts to transport multiple  client groups. Some programs, such as Head Start, have specific vehicle  standards that are often more stringent than those of other programs,  making it difficult to share vehicles. For instance, different standards for  roof strength, types of seat belts, and driver qualifications pose problems  for schools, human service agencies, and public transit providers  interested in sharing vehicles. Some areas have been able to overcome  specific program rules to share vehicles.

There is also complexity in working  with different funding time frames and cycles under multiple federal  programs. For example, although DOT\u2019s JARC program allows grantees to  use other federal funds to provide the local \u201cmatch\u201d required to obtain  JARC funds, the funding time frames and cycles of these other funding  sources are different, complicating efforts to combine financial resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Uniform Data Collection and Reporting Requirements among Programs", "paragraphs": ["Different reporting requirements among programs can create excessive  paperwork in a coordinated system and may make it difficult for agencies  to determine their true transportation costs and the benefits that may be  realized from coordination. For example, one report commented that a  transit provider was required to give each of several human service  agencies a separate bill for services provided, which reflected the unique  requirements imposed by each of those agencies. Furthermore, according  to officials, Medicaid requires the state Medicaid agency to demonstrate  that individuals receiving transportation under Medicaid are not receiving  transportation from any other source and that the transportation is  medically necessary, complicating the determination of how to fund  transportation services for each Medicaid recipient in a coordinated  system in which costs are shared among agencies. In addition, human  service agencies and providers may not be required or accustomed to  collecting complete and uniform transportation data for their programs. A  recent report concluded that such information was beneficial because it  enabled administrators to re-evaluate how best to provide transportation  services and the savings they could achieve through coordination. For  example, when Florida\u2019s statewide coordination program was established,  state and local agencies in Florida reported their total estimated annual  transportation-related expenditures at $8 million. However, once reporting  requirements were in place for all agencies providing services for the  transportation-disadvantaged, actual expenditures were estimated to total  $224.9 million statewide\u2014much higher than the initial estimate.

In addition, human  service, transportation, medical, and workforce agencies all have distinct  technical languages and cultures, which may inhibit collaboration among  these agencies. In one state we visited, the labor and transportation  departments experienced difficulty collaborating because some common  terms have completely different meanings within each agency.

One clear need, given the sheer  number of programs involved, is active and sustained leadership at the  federal level.

The first is limited membership: only two departments\u2014DOT  and HHS\u2014are members. While these departments administer nearly 30  programs that can be used for transportation, the Departments of  Education and Labor administer almost as many. The absence of  Education and Labor lessens the ability to muster a collective effort for  greater coordination. The second constraint is a limited ability to translate  a strategic vision into a set of actions. At present, there are no clear links  between the long-term goals in the Council\u2019s strategic plan and the  individual tasks in its action plan. Without such links, the Council risks  judging its progress on the basis of activities undertaken rather than on  the outcomes of those activities and their contribution toward achieving  long-term goals.

The third  option, expanding forums and disseminating guidance, can be done in the  context of existing laws, regulations, and procedures, and may, therefore,  be the most expeditious starting point. In this regard, clarification from  federal agencies about how funds can be used for coordination could help  state and local agencies overcome some of the obstacles identified.  Similarly, state and local agencies may be in a better position to  coordinate efforts if they have more knowledge about what has worked  elsewhere.
