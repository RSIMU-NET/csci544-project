In this requested report, GAO examined (1) how program participation and support payments have changed over the last 5 years (2005-2009), and factors that may have affected participation; (2) the extent to which goals and measures are used to manage the program; and (3) the extent to which mechanisms are in place to evaluate program risks and monitor controls over compliance with program rules. GAO surveyed state public utility commissions; reviewed key policies, procedures, and rules; and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Low-Income Program participation and support payments have increased since 2005 due to many factors. Program participation was stable from 2005 to 2008, from 6.9 million to 7.1 million participants, but increased to 8.6 million in 2009. Likewise, support payments were relatively stable from 2005 to 2008, from $802 million to $823 million annually, before increasing to approximately $1 billion in 2009. The increases in 2009 were primarily due to the addition of a prepaid wireless service option in certain states, which allows program participants to obtain a free wireless handset and an allotment of free minutes each month. The Low-Income Program has no funding cap and USAC officials project its support payments to reach $1.4 billion in 2010. They said participation and payments will likely continue to increase beyond 2010 as prepaid wireless service options become available in additional states. FCC has taken limited steps to develop performance goals and measures for the Low-Income Program, however, these steps do not fully align with useful practices for developing successful goals and measures. While performance goals and measures specific to the Low-Income Program would enable FCC to more effectively manage the program and determine its success, FCC has not made developing such measures a priority and, as a result, has limited insight on the intent of the program and what it is accomplishing. FCC might conduct pilot programs as it considers expanding the Low-Income Program to include broadband service (high-speed Internet access), as proposed by the National Broadband Plan. For the broadband pilot programs, if conducted, it is important that FCC develop a needs assessment and implementation and evaluation plans to increase confidence in the results. If implemented properly, the pilot programs would enable FCC to improve its data collection for low-income households and could help facilitate program and policy decisions for the Low-Income Program in the future. Although FCC and USAC have some mechanisms in place to identify and evaluate risks and monitor compliance with program rules, the Low-Income Program lacks key features of effective internal controls. FCC and USAC primarily use audit findings to monitor compliance with program rules. However, the number and scope of USAC's audits have been limited and there is no systematic process in place to review the findings of those audits that are conducted. Further, FCC and USAC have not conducted a risk assessment specific to the Low-Income Program that includes consideration of all program vulnerabilities, such as the possibility that multiple carriers may claim support for the same telephone line and that households may receive more than one discount, contrary to program rules. According to GAO standards, FCC should identify all risks to meeting the program's goals and objectives and have a process to systematically consider audit findings when assessing the effectiveness of its internal controls. Without these mechanisms, FCC and USAC may not be capturing and addressing programmatic risks and collecting information that could be leveraged to assess compliance with program rules and strengthen internal controls. FCC should (1) clearly define performance goals and develop quantifiable measures that can be used to determine the program's success, (2) conduct a needs assessment and develop implementation and evaluation plans for the proposed low-income pilot programs, (3) conduct a robust risk assessment, and (4) implement a systematic process to consider audit results. FCC agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For many decades, federal policy has called for making affordable  residential telephone service available to the greatest possible number of  Americans\u2014a policy known as \u201cuniversal service.\u201d This policy is carried  out through the Federal Communication Commission\u2019s (FCC or the  Commission) universal service programs which are funded through the  Universal Service Fund (USF), and include the Low-Income Program.  This program was created in the mid-1980s to promote telephone  subscribership among low-income households. In 2009, the Low-Income  Program provided approximately $1 billion in support payments.", "Traditionally, universal service policy and access to telecommunications  services for low-income subscribers has centered on landline residential  telephone service throughout the United States. However,  telecommunications technology has advanced and new ways to access  telecommunications services have been developed. For example,  consumers today have more options to access telephone service than in  the past, including cable, wireless, and broadband. To expand the  availability of Lifeline, which discounts local service, and to provide  additional consumer choice, FCC has allowed certain prepaid wireless  providers, to be granted limited designation as eligible  telecommunications carriers (ETC) for the Low-Income Program in their  licensed service areas. As new technologies continue to develop, the  universal service policy will be challenged to define \u201caccess\u201d to  telecommunications services for low-income consumers. In particular, in  2009, FCC was mandated to develop a broadband plan that would \u201censure  that all people of the United States have access to broadband  capability\u2026\u201d An FCC task force issued the plan in March 2010, with  recommendations, among many other things, on how to reform the USF  and modify the Low-Income Program to support broadband service.

For example, in  our reviews of the USF E-rate program, we found weaknesses in the  administration and operational framework and have recommended  corrective actions to reduce fraud, waste, and abuse in the program. To  begin addressing these and other concerns, FCC has taken preliminary  steps, such as initiating a Universal Service Working Group, to assist in  FCC\u2019s efforts to modernize and reform all universal service programs.", "Given the importance of the USF to the nation\u2019s telecommunications  policy, significant advances in telecommunications technology, and  potential USF reform efforts, you asked us to review issues surrounding all  the USF programs. This report focuses on the Low-Income Program and  our objectives were to review (1) how program participation and support  payments have changed in the last 5 calendar years (2005-2009) and what  factors may have affected program participation, (2) the extent to which  FCC uses performance goals and measures to manage the program, and  (3) the extent to which the program has mechanisms in place to evaluate  program risks and monitor controls over compliance with program rules.", "To respond to these objectives, we reviewed key orders, reports, and  program assessments from FCC and the Universal Service Administrative  Company (USAC), the not-for-profit corporation that administers the Low- Income Program under a Memorandum of Understanding with FCC, and  interviewed officials from both organizations and other stakeholders with  knowledge of the program. The stakeholders were identified from a  variety of sources and include academicians and think tanks,  telecommunications providers, third parties contracted to administer the  program and related committees, and trade and industry groups. To  develop an understanding of how the program works in specific locations,  we conducted site visits in California, the District of Columbia, Florida,  and Iowa. We chose these locations based on criteria such as the  telephone subscribership rate of low-income households and the  participation rate of eligible low-income households. During the visits, we  interviewed officials from state public utility commissions, ETCs (wireline  and wireless), consumer advocates, and other entities as applicable, as  well as obtained pertinent documentation. In addition, we analyzed  participation and disbursement data from USAC and identified key trends.  We conducted testing to ensure the reliability of the data and reviewed the  methodology used by USAC to estimate program participation rates. As a  result, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. We also conducted a Web-based survey to gather  information from state public utility commissions on how, if at all, roles  and responsibilities vary by state; barriers to program participation, if any;  advertising and outreach activities by state public utility commissions and  ETCs; and internal control procedures. The survey was available online to  officials in the 50 states and the District of Columbia on a secure Web site  and our response rate was 100 percent. This report does not contain all the  results from the survey. The survey and a more complete tabulation of the  results can be viewed at GAO-11-13SP.", "Finally, we reviewed the program\u2019s performance goals and measures and  the mechanisms used by FCC and USAC to evaluate risk and monitor  compliance with program rules. We compared this information against our  guidance on useful practices for developing successful goals and measures  and our standards for internal controls in the federal government, as well  as Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on internal  controls.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 through October  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Efforts by FCC, state regulators, and  industry to promote universal service generally began in the 1950s.  Traditionally, universal service has meant providing residential customers  with affordable access nationwide to basic telephone service.", "In the mid-1980s, FCC changed the way local telephone companies  recovered fixed costs and implemented a federal fee for telephone service  paid by the subscriber. Though FCC found no evidence this fee would  cause low-income consumers to cancel telephone service, it was  nevertheless concerned about the below-average telephone subscribership  rates of low-income households\u201480 percent compared to 92 percent for  all households in 1984\u2014and their ability to afford telephone service. As a  result, FCC initiated two programs to make telephone service affordable  for low-income households: Lifeline, which discounts monthly service, and  Link Up, which discounts the connection charges associated with  telephone service installation.", "Congress codified the nation\u2019s commitment to universal service and made  significant changes to universal service policy through the  telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act). The 1996 Act provided  explicit statutory support for federal universal service policy and directed  FCC to establish a Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service (Joint  Board) to make recommendations to FCC on implementing universal  service provisions of the 1996 Act. The 1996 Act also described universal  service as an evolving level of telecommunications services the  Commission should periodically review, taking into account advances in  telecommunications and information technologies and services. In  accordance with its definition of universal service, FCC found that basic  telephone service must include, among other things, local usage, access to  emergency service such as 911, access to operator services, access to long  distance service, access to directory assistance, and toll limitation for  qualifying low-income consumers.", "Further, the 1996 Act stated that every telecommunications carrier  providing interstate telecommunications services was required to  contribute to federal universal service, unless exempted by FCC. The  contributions were to be equitable, nondiscriminatory, and explicit. In  addition, FCC was authorized to require any other providers of interstate  telecommunications to contribute if the public interest so required.  Contributions are deposited into the USF, which was established by FCC  in 1997 to meet the specific objectives and principles contained in the 1996  Act. Each quarter, FCC calculates a contribution rate for all contributors  based on the needs of the universal service programs and assesses it as a  percentage of the carriers\u2019 interstate revenue. In the second quarter of  2010, the contribution rate was a historically high 15.3 percent of  carriers\u2019 interstate end user revenue. Carriers generally pass the cost of  the USF contribution on to their customers, typically in the form of a line  item on the monthly telephone bill. The Low-Income Program is one of  two significant parts of the USF that remains uncapped, meaning that  there is no limit to its growth.", "Specific to the Low-Income Program, the 1996 Act expressed the principle  that telephone rates should be affordable and that access should be  provided to \u201clow-income consumers\u201d in all regions of the nation. As a  result, in its 1997 Universal Service Order, FCC made Lifeline and Link Up  available in all states regardless of whether the states provided matching  funds, required all ETCs to offer Lifeline service, and included toll  limitation service.", "Since the passage of the 1996 Act, FCC has taken actions aimed at  increasing participation in the Low-Income Program.", "In June 2000, FCC released the Tribal Order, which enhanced the federal  Lifeline and Link Up programs to better serve residents living on or near  federally recognized tribal lands and reservations.", "With its April 2004 order, and consistent with the Joint Board\u2019s  recommendations, FCC aimed to increase participation in the Low-Income  Program by expanding the federal default eligibility to include an income- based criterion of 135 percent of the federal poverty guidelines and  additional means tested programs. According to FCC, at that time only  one-third of eligible households were enrolled in Lifeline. In a staff  analysis, included as an appendix to the order, FCC estimated that adding  the income-based criterion could increase participation in Lifeline by  approximately 1.2 million to 1.3 million households. The order also  included outreach guidelines and revised verification and certification  procedures.", "In 2005, FCC granted TracFone forbearance from the facilities requirement  for ETC designation for Lifeline support only. TracFone is a nonfacilities  based, commercial mobile radio services (wireless) provider offering  prepaid service. While FCC found that TracFone\u2019s universal service  Lifeline offering (known as SafeLink Wireless) would provide a variety of  benefits to Lifeline-eligible consumers including increased consumer  choice, program participation, high-quality service offerings, and mobility,  FCC did not quantify or estimate potential increases in participation and  support payments for the Low-Income Program.", "The Commission required TracFone to meet several conditions regarding  access to 911 and enhanced 911 (E911). In addition, TracFone had to  require its customers to self-certify at the time of service activation and  annually thereafter that they are the head of household and receive  Lifeline-supported service only from TracFone; establish safeguards to  prevent its customers from receiving multiple TracFone Lifeline subsidies  at the same address; and file with the Commission a plan outlining the  measures TracFone would take to implement these conditions.", "In 2008, TracFone submitted its plan to meet the conditions for ETC  designation status and was approved by FCC as an ETC in its licensed  service areas for the purpose of receiving Lifeline support. FCC later  modified a condition imposed on TracFone regarding certification  requirements to confirm that it provides customers with access to basic  and E911 service.", "In a May 2010 order, the Commission asked the Joint Board to review the  Commission\u2019s eligibility, verification, and outreach rules for the Lifeline  and Link Up universal service programs, given among other things, the potential expansion of the Low-Income Program to broadband, as  recommended in the National Broadband Plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Low-Income Program is Implemented Through Three Mechanisms", "paragraphs": ["The Low-Income Program provides support for low-income consumers  through three mechanisms: (1) Lifeline, (2) Link Up, and (3) Toll  Limitation Service.", "Lifeline reimburses ETCs for discounting eligible customers\u2019 monthly bill  for basic telephone service.

Through our survey, nine states reported  using automatic enrollment for their Lifeline programs and two reported  that plans were under way to develop an automatic enrollment system.  According to Florida officials, implementation of the automatic enrollment  process has had a significant impact on increased enrollment and provides  the potential to reach greater numbers of eligible customers. In its 2004  order, FCC declined to require states to adopt automatic enrollment, in  part, because of potential administrative, technological, and financial  burdens on states and ETCs. FCC is revisiting this issue and has asked  the Joint Board whether automatic enrollment should be required in all  states. Further, the National Broadband Plan recommends FCC should  encourage state agencies responsible for Lifeline and Link Up programs to  coordinate with other low-income support programs to streamline  enrollment for benefits using processes such as automatic enrollment.", "Further, expanded eligibility criteria for Lifeline can potentially increase  participation. For example, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act expands Medicaid in 2014 to a new nationwide eligibility threshold of  133 percent of the poverty level. This is likely to expand the number of  eligible consumers in some states, such as Montana, that have more  restrictive criteria and use Medicaid as a qualifying program.

In 2008, during a  Low-Income Program-related performance audit of a wireless company,  USAC for the first time compared the wireless carrier\u2019s subscriber list to  the major wireline ETCs serving the area. USAC found several hundred  instances of consumers receiving Lifeline support for both wireless and  wireline accounts. USAC has sought guidance from FCC regarding how to  recover the related disbursements and handle these findings. However, as  of September 2010, FCC has not provided guidance on this issue. To  determine the extent to which this is occurring on an ongoing basis, USAC  would have to audit the records of the two companies because the ETCs  do not have such information. According to our survey, 8 states have  access to information that could help ensure that the household is  receiving only one Lifeline subsidy. Representatives from 21 states  indicated that they were somewhat or very concerned about consumer  fraud in the Lifeline program.

Five of the 8 states in which the entity that verifies  consumers\u2019 continued eligibility have access to information to help ensure  that the household is only receiving one Lifeline discount use a database.", "In comments to the FCC, the Florida Public Service Commission reported  that the inclusion of prepaid wireless options in the Lifeline program  presents the risk that these companies, which do not bill their customers  monthly, can claim support for all subscribers without confirming that the  person is still in possession of and is using the phone. For example, in  June 2010, there were several postings on Craigslist, the electronic bulletin  board known for free local classified listings, advertising the sale of  SafeLink products\u2014the Lifeline service offered by TracFone. One state we  visited is attempting to address this risk. In Florida, the state commission  instituted a 60-day inactivity policy in which the prepaid wireless carrier in  the state must contact the customer, via text message, voicemail, or letter,  to confirm that the customer is still active and eligible for Lifeline support.  If no response is received, the account must be deactivated. In the third  quarter of 2009, one year after the prepaid wireless company was certified  as an ETC in the state, approximately 8 percent or 33,000 customer  accounts were deactivated due to 60-day inactivity. While a good first step,  this mechanism still does not prevent the phone or minute allotment from  being sold to ineligible consumers. As previously mentioned, FCC has  asked the Joint Board to recommend changes regarding effective and  efficient verification of customer eligibility.", "Another risk is that the results of ETC audits may not be adequately  considered in assessing internal controls. FCC officials told us that  completion in 2008 of the initial OMB Circular A-123 based internal control  review of USAC\u2019s controls of the USF\u2019s four programs, including the Low- Income Program, was the equivalent to a comprehensive risk assessment.  The 2008 review was focused primarily on financial reporting controls, and  considered some aspects of programmatic operations and regulatory  reporting and compliance of the four USF programs. However, the initial  review was not specific to the Low-Income Program and was not designed  to identify all risks to meeting the program\u2019s objectives. The update that is  expected to be reported on in the fall of 2010 was also not designed to  consider all aspects of the program\u2019s internal controls. For example, the  report on the results of the 2008 review acknowledged that there are  program risks associated with ETCs\u2019 self-certification of key information,  such as subscriber eligibility and the accuracy of amounts claimed for  reimbursement that were not addressed in the internal control review. The  report also stated that ETC audits were the mechanism used by the USF  programs, including the Low-Income Program, to mitigate these risks.  Further, USAC\u2019s update of the 2008 review did not, among other things,  consider the nature, scope, and extent of ETC audits or the results from  these audits in assessing internal control.", "According to our standards for internal control, FCC should identify all  risks to meeting the program\u2019s objectives and should consider all  significant interactions between itself and other parties as well as internal  factors at both the entity and activity level. Without a risk assessment  specific to the Low-Income Program that considers all vulnerabilities and  consequences, some programmatic risks may not be identified, analyzed,  and addressed. Moreover, managing risks can help target limited  resources. We have previously described the purpose of risk management  as identifying potential problems before they occur to mitigate adverse  impacts. Figure 4 depicts a risk management cycle representing a series  of analytical and managerial steps, which are sequential, that can be used  to assess risk, assess alternatives for reducing risks, choose among those  alternatives, implement the alternatives, monitor their implementation,  and continually use new information to adjust and revise the assessments  and actions, as needed. The approach is dynamic and can be applied at  various organizational levels.", "The limitations identified above increase the importance of the periodic  audits of ETCs to provide after-the-fact detection information on ETC  compliance with program rules and the effectiveness of USAC\u2019s internal  controls. Audits conducted on ETCs have identified instances of  noncompliance with program rules, including improper payments when  ETCs sought reimbursement for discounts that were either calculated  incorrectly, could not be adequately supported, or were provided to  potentially ineligible subscribers. For example, we found that 76 percent  of the 41 performance audits reported findings of more than one claim for  low-income support per household, which is contrary to program rules.", "We analyzed reported audit findings and identified instances of repeat  audit findings at ETCs that had been audited more than once from 2003  through 2008. According to USAC officials, each audit report is reviewed  and the extent and causes of audit findings are analyzed. However, USAC  officials stated that they do not have a systematic process for considering  the results of ETC audits when assessing the program\u2019s internal controls.  As described above, each of the internal control reviews performed have,  by design, excluded consideration of ETC audits in assessing internal  control. A systematic process that considers ETC audits could help  identify opportunities for improving internal controls. For example,  improvements to controls could include modifications to the process used  to identify questionable support claims; modifications to the nature,  extent, or scope of ETC audits; and changes to the information required  from ETCs for review prior to payment of claims.", "We also analyzed payment data by state/territory and ETC to determine  the scope of audit coverage accomplished by the audits performed (see  Figure 5).

We found that, considering the reliance placed on ETC  audits and the results of those audits conducted to date, the number and  scope of the ETC audits has been limited. For example, the 97 ETCs that  have been audited represent approximately 5 percent of the more than  1,800 ETCs that participated in the Low-Income Program from 2002 to  2007. Further, the payments that were audited represented about 10  percent of the $4.6 billion in payments during this 6-year period. In fact,  more than 90 percent of the payments audited were made to only 14 of the  97 ETCs audited. Moreover, 19 states and territories with approximatel 220 ETCs have never been audited.", "According to our internal control standards, audit findings should be  considered when assessing the effectiveness of internal controls,  including: determining the extent to which the continued effectiveness of  the internal control is being monitored; assessing if appropriate policies  and procedures exist; and assessing if they are properly maintained and  periodically updated. Further, consideration should be given to potential  program risks when establishing the scope and frequency of audits.  Without a systematic process to analyze findings from audits that are of  sufficient quantity and scope and appropriately targeted based on risk,  FCC and USAC may not have information that could be leveraged to  adequately assess compliance with program rules and strengthen the  program\u2019s internal controls. As described in this report, there are  vulnerabilities at the ETC, state, and program level for which a sys process for conducting audits and considering audit results could help to  identify.  tematic  As of July 2010, USAC was in the process of implementing a new audit and improper payment assessment approach for all of the USF programs. The  new approach is designed to include separate programs for compliance  audits and improper payment assessments. According to USAC officials,  the compliance audits will be designed solely to evaluate USF beneficiary  compliance with FCC rules and a separate process will be implemented  for improper payment assessments to estimate the rate of improper  payment associated with each of the USF programs. While we have not  assessed the new approach, according to FCC officials, it will continue to  enable FCC and USAC to identify program risks based on random  selections of beneficiaries and payments stratified based on the amount  payments. However, it will be important for USAC to have a process for  considering the results of these audits and assessments to identify  opportunities for modifying the program\u2019s internal controls, including  modifying the nature, extent, and scope of audits and improper payment  assessments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["anagement tools to effectively manage any program, including the Low- istent program goals and performance measures, risk  Clear and cons assessments, and the systemic consideration of audit results are key  m Income Program.

We  conducted site visits, as described above, to obtain opinions regarding  program elements associated with participation and barriers to  participation, if any. We also obtained opinions regarding the effect, if any,  of prepaid wireless options on program participation. In addition, we  conducted a Web-based survey of state public utility commissions, as  described above, to gather information about barriers to program  participation, if any, and advertising and marketing activities by state  commissions and ETCs. Finally, we compared FCC\u2019s guidelines for  advertising the program and assessed them against our key practices for  consumer education planning.", "To determine FCC\u2019s performance goals and measures used to manage the  program, we reviewed the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other  relevant legislation as well as FCC documentation, including rules, orders,  strategic plans, performance and accountability reports, and FCC\u2019s  Memorandum of Understanding with USAC. In addition, we interviewed  FCC and USAC officials to determine how these goals and measures were  developed. Finally, we reviewed FCC\u2019s performance goals and measures  for the program and compared them with our guidance on key attributes  of successful performance goals and measures.", "To identify the mechanisms FCC and USAC used to identify and evaluate  risk and monitor compliance with program rules, we reviewed relevant  FCC and USAC documents, including comments for the record, fraud risk  assessments, and audit reports, and interviewed officials from both  entities.
