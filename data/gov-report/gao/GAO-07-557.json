The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), enacted in 2002, encourages the manufacturers, or sponsors, of drugs that still have marketing exclusivity--that is, are on-patent--to conduct pediatric drug studies, as requested by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If they do so, FDA may extend for 6 months the period during which no equivalent generic drugs can be marketed. This is referred to as pediatric exclusivity. BPCA required that GAO assess the effect of BPCA on pediatric drug studies and labeling. As discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, GAO (1) assessed the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted under BPCA for on-patent drugs, including when drug sponsors declined to conduct the studies; (2) evaluated the impact of BPCA on labeling drugs for pediatric use and the process by which the labeling was changed; and (3) illustrated the range of diseases treated by the drugs studied under BPCA. GAO examined data about the drugs for which FDA requested studies under BPCA from 2002 through 2005. GAO also interviewed officials from relevant federal agencies, pharmaceutical industry representatives, and health advocates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Drug sponsors have initiated pediatric drug studies for most of the on-patent drugs for which FDA has requested studies, but no drugs were being studied when drug sponsors declined these requests. Sponsors agreed to 173 of the 214 written requests for pediatric studies of on-patent drugs. In cases where drug sponsors decline to study the drugs, BPCA provides for FDA to refer the study of these drugs to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), a nonprofit corporation. FNIH had not funded studies for any of the nine drugs that FDA referred as of December 2005. Most drugs (about 87 percent) granted pediatric exclusivity under BPCA had labeling changes--often because the pediatric drug studies found that children may have been exposed to ineffective drugs, ineffective dosing, overdosing, or previously unknown side effects. However the process for approving labeling changes was often lengthy. It took from 238 to 1,055 days for information to be reviewed and labeling changes to be approved for 18 drugs (about 40 percent), and 7 of those took more than 1 year. Drugs were studied under BPCA for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, including those that are common, serious, or life threatening to children. These drugs represented more than 17 broad categories of disease, such as cancer. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that the report provides a significant amount of data and analysis and generally explains the BPCA process, but expressed concern that it did not sufficiently acknowledge the success of BPCA or clearly describe some elements of FDA's process. GAO incorporated comments as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although children suffer from many of the same diseases as adults and are  often treated with the same drugs, only about one-third of the drugs that  are prescribed for children have been studied and labeled for pediatric  use. This has placed children taking drugs for which there have not been  adequate pediatric drug studies at risk of being exposed to ineffective  treatment or receiving incorrect dosing. In order to encourage the study of  more drugs for pediatric use, Congress passed the Best Pharmaceuticals  for Children Act (BPCA) in 2002 to provide marketing incentives to drug  sponsors for conducting pediatric drug studies. Drug sponsors (typically  drug manufacturers) may obtain 6 months of additional market exclusivity  for drugs on which they have conducted pediatric studies in accordance  with pertinent law and regulations. This market exclusivity is known as  pediatric exclusivity. When a drug has market exclusivity, it is protected  from competition for a limited period, for example by prohibition on Food  and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a generic copy for marketing.  Generally, pediatric exclusivity can only be granted to those drugs that are  on-patent\u2014that is, those that still have market exclusivity\u2014and for which  FDA has issued a written request for pediatric drug studies. Once a drug\u2019s  patent or market exclusivity has expired, however, FDA can still request  pediatric drug studies for off-patent drugs. BPCA also included provisions  designed to provide for the study of both on-patent and off-patent drugs  that drug sponsors have declined to study.", "When FDA determines that a drug may provide health benefits to children,  it may issue a written request to the drug sponsor to conduct pediatric  drug studies. Under BPCA, drug sponsors of on-patent drugs must accept  or decline a written request. Drug sponsors of off-patent drugs are not  required to respond to a written request. However, if FDA does not receive  a response within 30 days, the written request is assumed to be declined.  When a drug sponsor accepts a written request for an on-patent drug and  subsequently submits a study report in response, FDA generally has   90 days to complete its review of the reports to determine whether to  grant pediatric exclusivity to the drug. If FDA is satisfied that the studies  have been conducted and the report submitted as required, the drug in  question may receive additional market exclusivity. FDA also reviews  these pediatric drug study reports to see if the drug requires labeling  changes. The agency refers to this review as its scientific review, which it  has a goal of completing within 180 days.", "BPCA provides for pediatric drug studies even if the drug sponsor declined  the written request. First, if a drug sponsor declines a written request by  FDA to study an on-patent drug, BPCA provides for FDA to refer the drug  to the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), which can  fund the study if funds are available. When a sponsor declines a written  request for an on-patent drug, the sponsor cannot receive pediatric  exclusivity in response to that written request. Second, BPCA provides for  the funding of the study of off-patent drugs by the Department of Health  and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) National Institutes of Health (NIH).", "BPCA required that we assess, among other things, the effect of provisions  regarding pediatric drug studies on the study and proper labeling of drugs  for pediatric use. As discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, we   (1) assessed the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being  conducted under BPCA for on-patent drugs, including when drug sponsors  declined to conduct the studies; (2) evaluated the impact of BPCA on  labeling of drugs for pediatric use and the process by which the labeling  was changed; and (3) illustrated the range of diseases treated by the drugs  studied under BPCA.", "To assess the extent to which pediatric drug studies were being conducted  under BPCA for on-patent drugs, including when drug sponsors declined  to do the studies, we examined data about the drugs for which FDA issued  written requests from January 2002 through December 2005. Our work  focused on actions regarding these drugs prior to 2006. Specifically, we  examined data on the numbers of written requests, drugs studied, written  requests that were declined, and drugs granted pediatric exclusivity during  this 4-year period. We reviewed data from FNIH on the funding status of  on-patent drugs that drug sponsors declined to study. To evaluate the  impact of BPCA on the labeling of drugs for pediatric use and the process  by which labeling was changed, we reviewed summaries of the labeling  changes for drugs studied from the enactment of BPCA through 2005. We  reviewed the dates the labeling changes were agreed to and the reasons  why some drugs did not have labeling changes. To illustrate the range of  diseases treated by the drugs studied under BPCA, we identified the  diseases the drugs were studied to treat, as well as the therapeutic areas  addressed by the drugs. We also examined data from national surveys on  the extent to which these drugs are prescribed for children. In addition, to  assist with our review in general, we interviewed officials from FDA, NIH,  and FNIH as well as representatives of the pharmaceutical industry and  health advocates\u2014such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the  Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the Generic  Pharmaceutical Association, the National Organization for Rare Disorders,  Public Citizen, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the  Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development.

As a result, there was a lack of  information on optimal dosage, possible side effects, and the effectiveness  of drugs for pediatric use. For example, while physicians typically had  determined drug dosing for children based on their weight, pediatric drug  studies conducted under FDAMA showed that in many cases this was not  the best approach. To continue to encourage pediatric drug studies,  BPCA was enacted on January 4, 2002, just after the pediatric exclusivity  provisions of FDAMA expired on January 1, 2002. BPCA reauthorized and  enhanced the pediatric exclusivity provisions of FDAMA. Like FDAMA,  BPCA allows FDA to grant drug sponsors pediatric exclusivity\u20146 months  of additional market exclusivity\u2014in exchange for conducting and  submitting reports on pediatric drug studies. The goal of the program is to  develop additional health information on the use of such drugs in pediatric  populations so they can be administered safely and effectively to children.  This incentive is similar to that provided by FDAMA; however, BPCA  provides additional mechanisms to provide for pediatric studies of drugs  that drug sponsors decline to study."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "BPCA Process", "paragraphs": ["The process for initiating pediatric studies under BPCA formally begins  when FDA issues a written request to a drug sponsor to conduct pediatric  drug studies for a particular drug. FDA may issue a written request after it  has reviewed a proposed pediatric study request from a drug sponsor, in  which the drug sponsor describes the pediatric drug study or studies it  proposes doing in return for pediatric exclusivity. In deciding whether to  approve the proposed pediatric study request and issue a written request,  FDA must determine if the proposed studies will produce information that  may result in health benefits for children. Alternatively, FDA may  determine on its own that there is a need for more research on a drug for  pediatric use and issue a written request without having received a  proposed pediatric study request from the drug sponsor. A written request  outlines, among other things, the nature of the pediatric drug studies that  the drug sponsor must conduct in order to qualify for pediatric exclusivity  and a time frame by which those studies should be completed. When a  drug sponsor accepts the written request and completes the pediatric drug  studies, it submits reports to FDA describing the studies and the study  results. BPCA specifies that FDA generally has 90 days to review the study   reports to determine whether the pediatric drug studies met the conditions  outlined in the written request. If FDA determines that the pediatric drug  studies conducted by the drug sponsor were responsive to the written  request, it will grant a drug pediatric exclusivity regardless of the study  findings. Figure 1 illustrates the process under BPCA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "BPCA Provisions for Pediatric Drug Studies Declined by Drug Sponsors", "paragraphs": ["To further the study of drugs when drug sponsors decline a written  request, BPCA includes two provisions that did not exist under FDAMA.  First, if a drug sponsor declines to conduct the pediatric drug studies  requested by FDA for an on-patent drug, BPCA provides for FDA to refer  the study of that drug to FNIH, which might then agree to fund the studies.  Second, if a drug sponsor declines a request to study an off-patent drug,  BPCA provides for referral of the study to NIH for funding. FDA cannot  extend pediatric exclusivity in response to written requests for any drugs  for which the drug sponsor declined to conduct the requested pediatric  drug studies.", "When drug sponsors decline written requests for studies of on-patent  drugs, BPCA provides for FDA to refer the study of those drugs to FNIH  for funding, when FDA believes that the pediatric drug studies are still  warranted. FNIH, which was authorized by Congress to be established in  1990, is guided by a board of directors and began formal operations in  1996 to support the mission of NIH and advance research by linking  private sector donors and partners to NIH programs. Although FNIH is a  nonprofit corporation that is independent of NIH, FNIH and NIH  collaborate to fund certain projects. FNIH has raised approximately   $300 million from the private sector over the past 10 years to support four  general types of projects: (1) research partnerships; (2) educational  programs and projects for fellows, interns, and postdoctoral students;   (3) events, lectures, conferences, and communication initiatives; and   (4) special projects. Included in these funds is $4.13 million that FNIH  raised as of December 2005 to fund pediatric drug studies under BPCA.  The majority of FNIH\u2019s funds are restricted by donors for specific projects  and cannot be reallocated. In recent years, appropriations of $500,000  were authorized to FNIH annually.", "To further the study of off-patent drugs, NIH\u2014in consultation with FDA  and other experts\u2014develops a list of drugs, including off-patent drugs,  which the agency believes are in need of study in children. NIH lists these  drugs annually in the Federal Register. FDA may issue written requests for  those drugs on the list that it determines to be most in need of study. If the  drug sponsor declines or fails to respond to the written request, NIH can  contract for, and fund the conduct of, the pediatric drug studies. These  pediatric drug studies could then be conducted by qualified universities,  hospitals, laboratories, contract research organizations, federally funded  programs such as pediatric pharmacology research units, other public or  private institutions or individuals. Drug sponsors generally decline written  requests for off-patent drugs because the financial incentives are  considerably limited.

Generally, the labeling includes important information for health  care providers, including proper uses of the drug, proper dosing, and  possible adverse effects that could result from taking the drug. FDA may  determine that the drug is not approved for use by children, which would  be reflected in any labeling changes.", "According to FDA officials, in order to be considered for pediatric  exclusivity, a drug sponsor typically submits results from pediatric drug  studies in the form of a \u201csupplemental new drug application.\u201d BPCA  specifies that study results, when submitted as part of a supplemental new  drug application, are subject to FDA\u2019s performance goals for a scientific  review, which in this case is 180 days. FDA\u2019s processes for reviewing  study results submitted under BPCA for consideration of labeling changes  are not unique to BPCA. These are the same processes the agency would  use to review any drug study results in consideration of labeling changes.  FDA\u2019s action on the application can include approving the application,  determining that the application is approvable (pending the submission of  additional information from the sponsor), or determining that the  application is not approvable. If studies demonstrate that an approved  drug is not safe or effective for pediatric use, this information would be  reflected in the drug\u2019s labeling.", "With a determination that the application is approvable, FDA  communicates to the drug sponsor that some issues need to be resolved  before the application can be approved and describes what additional  work is necessary to resolve the issues. This might require that drug  sponsors conduct additional analyses. However, this communication  would complete the scientific review cycle. When a drug sponsor  resubmits the application with the additional analyses, a new scientific  review cycle begins. As a result, multiple scientific review cycles might be  necessary, increasing the time between initial submission of the  application, which includes the pediatric study reports, and approval of a  labeling change.", "If, during FDA\u2019s review of the study report submitted as part of the  application, the agency determines that the application is approvable and  the only unresolved issue is labeling, FDA and the drug sponsor must  attempt to reach agreement on labeling changes within 180 days after the  application is submitted to FDA. If FDA and the drug sponsor cannot  reach agreement, FDA must refer the matter to its Pediatric Advisory  Committee, which would convene and provide recommendations to the  Commissioner on the appropriate changes to the drug\u2019s labeling.

HHS noted that BPCA provides additional incentives for the study of on- patent drugs, a process for the study of off-patent drugs, a safety review of  all drugs granted pediatric exclusivity, and the public dissemination of  information from pediatric studies conducted. HHS concluded that BPCA  has generated more clinical information for the pediatric population than  any other legislative or regulatory effort to date. Second, HHS commented  that the report confuses FDA\u2019s process for reviewing reports of drug  studies conducted under BPCA with time frames for the labeling dispute  resolution process outlined in BPCA. HHS suggested that we did not  sufficiently acknowledge that some of the time it takes for FDA to approve  labeling changes includes time spent by sponsors collecting and  submitting additional information. Third, in commenting on our finding  that few written requests included neonates, HHS pointed out that written  requests for 9 drugs required the inclusion of \u201cnewborns\u201d and written  requests for 13 drugs required the inclusion of infants (children under 4  months of age).

We also acknowledged that FDA completed its initial review of  applications within its 180-day goal.

By the time BPCA was enacted, written requests  for the study of these drugs had already been issued. Second, FDA officials  said there was a surge of written requests prior to the sunset of FDAMA.  Agency officials expect the same surge to occur prior to the sunset of the  pediatric exclusivity provisions of BPCA in 2007.", "FDA officials also offered a number of reasons that the proportion of  written requests issued under BPCA that were declined was greater than  that for those issued under FDAMA. While FDA does not track the reasons  that drug sponsors decline specific written requests, FDA officials expect  that a major reason that the written requests were declined is that the  agency sometimes requests more extensive pediatric drug studies, and  therefore more costly studies, than the sponsors would like to do. This  may be the case even when the drug sponsors initiated the written request  process. FDA officials said that upon consideration of FDA\u2019s written  requests, drug sponsors may make a business decision not to conduct the  requested pediatric drug studies because they may be too costly for the  expected return associated with pediatric exclusivity. Agency officials  reported that since the drugs studied under FDAMA were more likely to be  those with the greatest expected financial return or the easiest to study,  they are not surprised at the higher proportion of pediatric drug studies  declined under BPCA. Further, under BPCA drug sponsors are required to  pay user fees\u2014as high as $767,400 in fiscal year 2006\u2014when study results  are submitted for pediatric exclusivity consideration. As a result, the  process of gaining pediatric exclusivity has become more expensive than  it was under FDAMA when drug sponsors were exempt from such fees for  pediatric drug studies.", "FDA officials said they are not discouraged by the increase in the number  of written requests that have been declined. In 2001, FDA reported to  Congress that the agency expected drug sponsors to conduct pediatric  drug studies for 80 percent of written requests. The rate at which written  requests for studies of on-patent drugs were accepted under BPCA\u2014  71 percent\u2014is close to the target of 80 percent, and it is substantially  larger than the 15 to 30 percent of drugs that FDA officials have reported  were labeled for pediatric use prior to the authorization of pediatric  exclusivity under FDAMA and BPCA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Complexity of Completed Pediatric Drug Studies", "paragraphs": ["The pediatric drug studies conducted under BPCA were complex and  sizable, involving a large number of study sites and children.

BPCA allows FDA to issue written  requests for pediatric drug studies for the treatment of any disease,  regardless of whether the drug in question is currently indicated to treat  that disease in adults. For example, FDA issued a written request for the  study of a drug currently indicated to treat prostate cancer. The drug is  being tested in children to see if it is effective in treating early puberty in  boys.", "Use of dispute resolution as a negotiating tool in ensuring labeling  changes.

FDA officials indicated that when the agency  has expressed its intention to use the process, the issues that had been  raised in labeling negotiations were effectively resolved.", "Improved safety through focused pediatric safety reviews. BPCA\u2019s  requirement that FDA conduct additional monitoring of adverse event  reports for 1 year after a drug is granted pediatric exclusivity has been  useful to FDA in prioritizing safety issues for children. For example, an  analysis of a drug 1 year after pediatric exclusivity was granted showed  that there were deaths among children as a result of overuse or misuse of  the drug. This led the agency to amend the labeling regarding the  appropriate population for the drug.  NIH officials said they have found the process of developing the list of  drugs important for study in children to be extremely helpful. NIH officials  told us that since the inception of BPCA, they have learned a great deal  about existing gaps in the drug development process for children,  including a lack of data about which drugs are used by children and how  frequently. To gather additional information, NIH has contracted for  literature reviews to decrease the possibility that unnecessary pediatric  drug studies are conducted.

FDA\u2019s ability to assess the overall quality of the pediatric drug studies in  the 90 days currently allotted for the review was questioned. Some forum  participants also stated that a longer review period could result in  different determinations in some cases. For example, FDA\u2019s scientific  review of data related to the study of one drug showed that the children  participating in the pediatric drug studies had not received the treatments  as the drug sponsors had suggested in their description of the study  results. While the agency had granted the drug sponsor pediatric  exclusivity based on its 90-day review to determine pediatric exclusivity, it  might not have done so based on what was learned during the longer,   180-day scientific review.", "In addition, it was suggested that drug sponsors be required to submit  their study results for pediatric exclusivity determination at least 1 year  prior to patent expiration. This would allow the generic drug industry time  to better plan its release of drugs. We were told that sometimes generic  drugs have had to be destroyed because pediatric exclusivity  determinations were made after the generic version of the drug had been  manufactured and the drug\u2019s expiration date would not allow the product  to be sold.", "Representatives from interest groups would like the written requests to be  public information and would also like FDA to publicly announce when it  receives study results that have been submitted in response to a written  request.

According to forum participants, under new  legislation in Europe, companies that study off-patent drugs will be offered  a variety of incentives, such as 10 years of data protection (meaning that  the data generated to support the marketing of the drug cannot be used to  support another drug, in an effort to delay competition), the right to use  the existing brand name (to enable the drug sponsor to capitalize on  existing brand recognition), and the ability to add a symbol to the drug  labeling indicating the drug has been studied in children.", "Another suggestion was that current fees paid by drug sponsors for review  of their drug applications could be used to fund the study of off-patent  drugs (as well as on-patent drugs that drug sponsors decline to study).
