Nevertheless, RRB continues to do them. RRB does not routinely compile and analyze data for all of the CDRs it conducts, which limits its ability to identify potential gaps in oversight and to monitor program performance. For example, RRB lacks data that would help it determine how many medical CDRs it should expect to conduct. RRB officials said compiling data can be challenging because it uses multiple data systems.

RRB\u2019s continued reliance on  outdated earnings information to identify beneficiaries who, at the time a  CDR is conducted, may no longer be eligible for benefits, increases the  likelihood of making improper benefit payments and having to try to  recover the money in the future. In addition, even for those overpayments  that RRB identifies, it lacks a standard for processing them in a timely  manner, which increases the potential loss of federal dollars.  Furthermore, despite a RRB report that high-risk medical CDRs have not  been effective, the agency expends resources on these reviews that  could be used for other purposes that are more effective in identifying  ineligible beneficiaries.", "RRB\u2019s lack of routine data collection and analysis hampers its ability to  monitor program performance and determine what changes, if any,  should be made to improve the CDR program, including determining the  number of beneficiaries in each medical improvement category and the  costs and benefits of conducting the various types of reviews. While  paper files and disparate data systems present challenges to collecting  and analyzing program data and may hinder oversight efforts, RRB could  be doing more with the data it has to identify potential gaps in oversight."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To improve RRB\u2019s ability to make accurate disability benefit eligibility  determinations, including CDRs, and to decrease the potential for making  improper payments, Congress should consider granting RRB access to  the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 quarterly earnings  information from the National Directory of New Hires database.

(Recommendation 2)", "RRB should routinely compile and analyze CDR program data, such as  the number of cases selected for review, the number of beneficiaries in  each medical improvement category, outcomes, and the costs and  benefits of conducting CDRs, to improve program oversight.

RRB\u2019s budget in fiscal year 2016, the most recent year for  which data are available, was $12.4 billion. (See table 1.)", "Railroad retirement, survivor, disability, unemployment, and sickness  benefit payroll taxes are the primary funding source for RRB and totaled  $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal years 2007-2016, these taxes  averaged $5.2 billion annually. Railroad employers and employees pay  Tier I taxes, which are the same as taxes levied on Social Security- covered employers and workers. The taxes fund benefits similar to Social  Security retirement and disability. Employers and employees also pay  Tier II taxes to finance additional railroad retirement benefits. According to  RRB data, Tier I and Tier II taxes for fiscal year 2016 amounted to $2.8  billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. Railroad employers also paid  approximately $117.2 million in unemployment insurance taxes in fiscal  year 2016.", "The second major source of RRB funding consists of transfers from the  Social Security trust funds under a financial interchange between the two  systems. The financial interchange is intended to place the Social  Security Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the federal  Hospital Insurance Trust Fund in the same condition they would have  been in had railroad employees been covered by the Social Security Act  and Federal Insurance Contributions Act, and the Railroad Retirement Act  had not been enacted. The financial interchange calculation involves  computing the amount of Social Security taxes that would have been  collected on railroad employment and computing the amount of benefits  which Social Security would have paid to railroad retirement beneficiaries  during the same fiscal year. When benefit reimbursements exceed payroll  taxes, the difference, with an allowance for interest and administrative  expenses, is transferred from the Social Security Trust Funds to RRB. If  taxes exceed benefit reimbursements, which has not happened since  1951, a transfer would be made in favor of the Social Security Trust  Funds. According to RRB data, the net financial transfer to the Social  Security Equivalent Benefit Account during fiscal year 2016 amounted to  about $4.1 billion; in fiscal years 2007-2016, these transfers averaged  $4.0 billion annually.", "The third major source of RRB funding is transfers from the National  Railroad Retirement Investment Trust, the trust fund that holds assets to  help pay a portion of RRB benefits. The Trust was established pursuant  to Section 105 of the Railroad Retirement and Survivors\u2019 Improvement  Act of 2001, and is the vehicle for investing RRB retirement benefit  assets in non-government securities. Under the Trust\u2019s investment  guidelines, assets are invested in both government securities and private  equities, unlike the Social Security Trust Funds, which are only invested  in government securities. The Trust also provided for the transfer of  excess RRB retirement, survivor, and disability benefit payroll taxes that  are not needed to pay benefits to the Trust for investment, and for  transfers from the Trust to the Treasury to assist the RRB in meeting its  benefit obligations. The Trust has not received transfers from the RRB  since the end of fiscal year 2004. During fiscal year 2016, however, the  Trust transferred a total of $1.4 billion to the Treasury for payment of RRB  benefit obligations; for fiscal years 2007-2016, these transfers averaged  $1.6 billion annually. According to RRB data, the value of Trust-managed  assets at the end of fiscal year 2016 was $25.1 billion.", "The fourth major source of RRB funding is appropriations. According to  RRB officials, most of these appropriations are derived from the taxation  of railroad retiree benefits and primarily fund benefit payments. These  appropriations also fund specific efforts such as administrative costs. In  fiscal year 2016, RRB received $790.6 million in federal appropriations;  for fiscal years 2007-2016, RRB\u2019s annual appropriation averaged $655.4  million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Railroad Retirement Board Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2007-2016, RRB expended, on average, approximately  $11.6 billion annually to fund its programs.
