Since its first audit of IRS's financial statements in fiscal year 1992, GAO has identified a number of weaknesses in IRS's financial management operations. In related reports, GAO has recommended corrective actions to address those weaknesses. Each year, as part of the annual audit of IRS's financial statements, GAO makes recommendations to address any new weaknesses identified and follows up on the status of IRS's efforts to address the weaknesses GAO identified in previous years' audits. The purpose of this report is to (1) provide an overview of the financial management challenges still facing IRS, (2) provide the status of financial audit and financial management-related recommendations and the actions needed to address them, and (3) highlight the relationship between GAO's recommendations and internal control activities central to IRS's mission and goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS has made progress in improving its internal controls and financial management since its first financial statement audit in 1992, as evidenced by 11 consecutive years of clean audit opinions on its financial statements, the resolution of several material internal control weaknesses, and actions resulting in the closure of nearly 300 financial management recommendations. This progress has been the result of hard work throughout IRS and sustained commitment at the top levels of the agency. However, IRS still faces significant financial management challenges in (1) resolving its remaining material weaknesses and significant deficiency in internal control, (2) developing outcome-oriented performance metrics, and (3) correcting numerous other internal control issues, especially those relating to safeguarding tax receipts and taxpayer information. At the beginning of GAO's audit of IRS's fiscal year 2010 financial statements, 85 financial management-related recommendations from prior audits remained open because IRS had not fully addressed the underlying issues. During the fiscal year 2010 financial audit, IRS took actions that GAO considered sufficient to close 37 recommendations. At the same time, GAO identified additional internal control issues resulting in 29 new recommendations. In total, 77 recommendations remain open. To assist IRS in evaluating and improving internal controls, GAO categorized the 77 open recommendations by various internal control activities, which, in turn, were grouped into three broad control categories. The continued existence of internal control weaknesses that gave rise to these recommendations represents a serious obstacle for IRS. Effective implementation of GAO's recommendations can greatly assist IRS in improving its internal controls and achieving sound financial management, which are integral to effectively carrying out its tax administration responsibilities. Most recommendations can be addressed within the next year or two. However, a few recommendations, particularly those concerning the functionality of IRS's automated systems, are complex and will require several more years to effectively address."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any recommendations in this report.

Because of its role and overall mission, IRS\u2019s activities affect virtually all  of the nation\u2019s citizens. It is therefore critical that the agency strive to  maintain sound internal control and financial management practices.", "IRS has made much progress in improving its financial management since  it was first required to prepare a set of financial statements nearly two  decades ago. This progress is reflected in IRS\u2019s 11-year record of clean  audit opinions on its financial statements and correcting several material  weaknesses and significant deficiencies in internal controls over the  years. At the same time, IRS continues to face significant financial  management challenges in achieving the overarching goals of effective  federal financial management\u2014accountability and useful management  information. To enable more effective financial and operational  management, IRS needs to (1) address its remaining material weaknesses  and its significant deficiency in internal control, (2) develop performance  metrics that will enhance its ability to manage for outcomes, and   (3) implement corrective actions to address other identified internal  control issues.", "An agency\u2019s internal control serves as the first line of defense in  safeguarding its assets and in preventing and detecting errors and fraud, as  well as in helping to effectively manage its stewardship over public  resources. For many years, IRS has had weaknesses in internal controls  over fundamental elements of its operations that leave it vulnerable to a  greater risk of fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. During our audit  of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 financial statements, we found that IRS  continued to be challenged with two long-standing material weaknesses i internal control that are at the heart of its operations\u2014weaknesses in   and over information  internal controls over unpaid tax assessments systems security. We also found that IRS had a new significant defici in internal control over tax refund disbursements. In addition, as in pas years, IRS management faces a challenge in enhancing and using its  financial management capabilities to develop and use outcome-oriented  performance metrics critical to providing the foundation upon which an  agency can manage its operations for outcomes. Finally, we identified  other internal control issues that need management attention, in particular  several that relate to safeguarding tax receipts and taxpayer information.", "To assist IRS in strengthening its internal controls and improving its  operations, over the years we have made numerous recommendations as  part of our annual financial statement audits and other financial  management\u2013related work at IRS.

The agency  head must annually evaluate and report on the control and financial  systems that protect the integrity of its federal programs. The  requirements of FMFIA serve as an umbrella under which other reviews,  evaluations, and audits should be coordinated and considered to support  management\u2019s assertion about the effectiveness of internal control over  operations, financial reporting, and compliance with laws and regulations.", "Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123,  Management\u2019s Responsibility for Internal Control, provides the  implementing guidance for FMFIA, and prescribes the specific  requirements for assessing and reporting on internal controls consistent  with the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  (internal control standards) issued by the Comptroller General of the  United States. The circular defines management\u2019s responsibilities related  to internal control and the process for assessing internal control  effectiveness, and provides specific requirements for conducting  management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over  financial reporting. The circular requires management to annually provide  assurances on internal control and emphasizes the need for integrated and  coordinated internal control assessments that synchronize all internal  control\u2013related activities.", "FMFIA requires GAO to issue standards for internal control in the federal  government.

While we use all five elements of  internal control as a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of IRS\u2019s internal  controls, our ongoing evaluations and tests have focused heavily on  control activities, where we have identified numerous internal control  weaknesses and have provided recommendations for corrective action.  Control activities are the policies, procedures, techniques, and  mechanisms that enforce management\u2019s directives. In other words, they  are the activities conducted in the everyday course of business that are  intended to accomplish a control objective, such as ensuring IRS  employees successfully complete background checks prior to being  granted access to taxpayer information and receipts.

These control  deficiencies are caused primarily by IRS\u2019s continued reliance on software  applications that were not designed to provide the accurate, complete, and  timely transaction-level financial information that management needs to  make well-informed decisions or to accumulate and report financial  information in accordance with federal accounting standards. These  problems are likely to continue to exist until these software applications  are either significantly enhanced or replaced. Successfully addressing  these issues is vital and is one of the goals of IRS\u2019s ongoing   systems-modernization effort.", "IRS\u2019s continuing challenge in addressing its material weakness in internal  control over the management of information systems security is primarily  due to IRS not having fully implemented key components of its  information security program. Although IRS has processes in place  intended to monitor and assess its internal controls, these processes were  not always effective. For example, (1) IRS\u2019s testing did not detect many of  the vulnerabilities we identified and did not assess a key application in its  current environment, and (2) IRS had not effectively validated corrective  actions reported to resolve previously identified weaknesses. As we  reported in our audit of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 financial statements, IRS  has made progress in addressing numerous weaknesses in information  security internal control. However, many of the weaknesses we reported  in previous years remain unresolved and continue to place IRS systems at  risk. For example, IRS (1) continued to allow individuals more access to  sensitive information contained on its network than needed to perform  their assigned duties, (2) had not completed actions to address a  vulnerability in its procurement system that allowed users to enter  commands that bypassed normal application security controls, and   (3) continued to allow visitors unnecessary access to secured areas at one  data center. In addition to unresolved issues, we identified additional  internal control deficiencies, that, along with the unresolved deficiencies,  continued to jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of  information processed by IRS\u2019s key systems, and increased the risk of  material misstatement for financial reporting. For example, IRS had not  (1) appropriately secured the database associated with the online system  IRS used to support and manage its computer access request, approval,  and review process; (2) appropriately restricted permissions on the  database that supported an application used for cost allocation of   rent-related data, allowing database users to run operating system  commands; (3) tested the Redesigned Revenue Accounting Control System  (RRACS) application security in its current production environment,  which would have enabled IRS to identify weaknesses compromising IRS\u2019s  ability to segregate incompatible duties and jeopardize the integrity of the  application\u2019s data, and (4) used encrypted protocols on a server  supporting the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System and several  internal routers, potentially exposing user IDs and passwords transmitted  in clear text across the network to inappropriate disclosure and  unauthorized use. Until IRS takes additional steps to implement more  comprehensive testing and effective validation processes, its facilities,  computing resources, and information will remain vulnerable to  inappropriate use, modification, or disclosure, and agency management  will have limited assurance of the integrity and reliability of its financial  and taxpayer information.", "In addition to the continuing challenges posed by the two long-standing  material weaknesses concerning unpaid tax assessments and information  security, our audit of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 financial statements also  identified a significant deficiency in IRS\u2019s internal control over tax refund  disbursements. This significant deficiency, which is the collective result of  (1) a multiyear pattern of our identifying and reporting deficiencies in  IRS\u2019s internal control over the processing of manual refunds; (2) the  increasing magnitude of manual refunds disbursed; and (3) new  deficiencies associated with the internal controls over the First-Time  Home Buyer Credit (FTHBC), increases the risk that IRS may pay out  duplicate or otherwise erroneous tax refunds to which individuals or  businesses are not entitled and for which IRS must use resources  attempting to recover. This new significant deficiency is an example of the  danger of not effectively addressing control deficiencies as soon as they  are identified so that they do not become a more serious problem. We  have reported numerous control deficiencies associated with manual  refund processing since 1999. Nine of those deficiencies and their  associated recommendations remain open, two of which have been open  since 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Developing and Implementing Performance Metrics to Assist in Managing for Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in our audit of IRS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 financial statements,  IRS continues to face challenges in developing and instutionalizing the use  of financial management information to assist it in making operational  decisions and in measuring the effectiveness of its programs. IRS has not  developed cost-based (and when appropriate, revenue-based) outcome- oriented performance measures that would enhance its ability to manage  for outcomes and integrated them into its routine management and  decision-making processes or its externally reported performance  metrics. Although IRS has developed projected direct tax return on  investment estimates for new enforcement (tax collection) initiatives in  its annual budget submissions, it has not developed similar direct tax  return on investment outcome-oriented performance metrics to determine  whether funded initiatives achieve their originally projected outcomes.  Lacking such performance metrics inhibits IRS\u2019s ability to more fully  assess and monitor the relative merits of its existing programs, to evaluate  new initiatives, or to consider alternatives and adjust its strategies as  needed. Outcome-oriented performance metrics based on specific  enforcement programs\u2019 costs and revenues would assist IRS in improving  its ability to (1) establish measurable outcome goals, (2) evaluate the  relative merits of various program options, and (3) highlight opportunities  for optimizing the allocation of resources. They could also assist IRS in  more credibly demonstrating to Congress and the public that it is using its  appropriations wisely.", "IRS\u2019s existing metrics focus on process-oriented workload measures of  program outputs rather than on measuring program outcomes. For  example, for its enforcement programs, IRS focuses on measuring discrete  activities within its overall tax collection efforts, such as the percentage of  various types of tax returns examined, criminal investigations completed,  and the number of tax returns examined and closed. While such output  measures can be useful elements in assessing performance, they are not  designed to measure the contribution each of these activities makes to the  collection of unpaid taxes, nor do they compare the cost of collection  activities to the tax revenue generated. IRS\u2019s enforcement metrics do not  include revenue collected\u2014a measure of outcome\u2014compared to the cost  of collection, which could provide useful information on the benefits of  the enforcement programs. In addition, IRS\u2019s publicly available  performance metrics do not measure the internal cost of IRS\u2019s programs  either in the aggregate or per service or activity performed.", "As we report in the \u201cStatus per IRS\u201d section of appendix I in this report,  IRS has reported that it considers our recommendation to develop  outcome-oriented performance measures and related performance goals  for IRS\u2019s enforcement programs and activities to be closed. We do not  agree. Part of IRS\u2019s justification for closing the recommendation is that it  uses estimates of the cost-benefit direct tax return on investment analysis  to evaluate future scenarios and to support funding requests for new  initiatives in its annual budget submissions. Using such estimates of  prospective return on investment information is useful for budgetary  decision making, but our recommendation is for IRS to develop outcome  data on the actual results of its programs and activities. We have also  previously recommended that IRS  extend the use of return on investment in future budget proposals to  include major enforcement programs,    develop return on investment data for its enforcement programs using  actual revenue and full cost data and compare actual results to the  projected return on investment data included in its budget request, and    provide Congress with information comparing projected savings to  actual savings in the year following the budget\u2019s implementation.", "The intent of our recommendations is to encourage IRS to develop  outcome-oriented performance metrics and to use them, along with other  metrics, in resource-allocation decisions. While IRS has not developed or  deployed such metrics for either funded initiatives or for ongoing  enforcement programs and activities, IRS officials informed us they are  considering options to collect direct tax return on investment data for  newly funded enforcement initiatives.", "IRS officials also contended that it is not prudent to rely exclusively on  direct tax return on investment as the sole determinant of resource  allocation. As we have reported previously, we acknowledge that IRS  must consider other factors besides maximizing revenue collection and  least-cost operations. The fairness of IRS\u2019s implementation of the tax code  and treatment of all taxpayers are important and we are cognizant of the  many factors, such as coverage, that are important considerations when  making resource-allocation decisions. These factors, and the decisions IRS  makes about how to respond to them, have a significant effect on  taxpayers, as well as on tax collections. We also acknowledge that IRS  faces challenges in developing outcome-oriented performance metrics,  such as return on investment, and integrating them into its resource  allocation decision-making process. Furthermore, developing such an  approach is important in order for IRS to make optimum use of its  available resources and to be able to credibly demonstrate it is doing so to  Congress and the public.", "IRS\u2019s lack of outcome-oriented performance metrics is inconsistent with  federal financial management concepts as embodied in the Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board\u2019s Statement of Federal Financial  Accounting Concepts No. 1, Objectives of Federal Financial Reporting.  In its discussion of financial reporting concepts, FASAB notes that federal  financial data should provide accountability and decision-useful  information on the costs of programs and the outputs and outcomes  achieved, and it should provide data for evaluating service efforts, costs,  and accomplishments.", "The absence of outcome metrics is also inconsistent with the objectives of  the CFO Act of 1990. A key objective of the act was for agencies to  routinely develop and use appropriate financial management information  to evaluate program effectiveness, make fully informed operational  decisions, and ensure accountability. While obtaining a clean audit opinion  on its financial statements is important in itself, it is not the CFO Act\u2019s end  goal. Rather, the act\u2019s end goal is modern financial management systems  that provide reliable, timely, and useful financial information to support  day-to-day decision making and oversight. Such systems and practices  should also provide for the systematic measurement of both outputs and  outcomes.", "We have made several recommendations to IRS over the years to address  its financial management challenges in developing internal full cost data  for its programs and activities and for outcome-oriented performance  measures.

Although IRS has made substantial improvements in safeguarding  taxpayer receipts and information since our financial audits first began  identifying serious internal control issues in this area, the task of ensuring  ongoing control over such critical responsibilities for IRS is a difficult one  and requires constant vigilance. Each year, we continue to identify control  issues related to IRS\u2019s safeguarding of taxpayer receipts and information.  For example, our fiscal year 2010 audit identified new internal control  issues and made 18 additional recommendations that related either  directly or indirectly to physically safeguarding taxpayer receipts and  information. The internal control issues encompassed in our open  recommendations cover critical physical security functions, such as  transporting taxpayer receipts and sensitive taxpayer information  among IRS facilities and lockbox banks and maintaining physical  security at IRS facilities to prevent loss, theft, or the potential for fraud  regarding tax receipts and taxpayer information;  conducting inspections and audits of the design and operation of IRS\u2019s  physical security processes and controls designed to safeguard tax  receipts and taxpayer information;  conducting appropriate background investigations and screening of  personnel, including contractors, with access to taxpayer information;  and  ensuring the proper destruction of documents and equipment to  prevent the inappropriate release of sensitive taxpayer information.", "In light of the volume of taxpayer receipts and sensitive taxpayer files that  IRS is responsible for safeguarding, and the implications for IRS\u2019s mission  if they are lost, stolen, or the subject of fraud or misuse, it is critical that  IRS fully and effectively resolve the internal control issues we have  identified and work toward continually improving its internal controls to  prevent new issues from arising."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Status of Recommendations Based on the Fiscal Year 2010 Financial Statement Audit", "paragraphs": ["In June 2010, we issued a report on the status of IRS\u2019s efforts to implement  corrective actions to address financial management recommendations  stemming from our fiscal year 2009 and prior year financial audits and  other financial management\u2013related work. In that report, we identified   85 audit recommendations that remained open and thus required  corrective action by IRS.

For the control activities element, the internal control  standards explain that an agency\u2019s system of internal control should  provide for an assessment of the risks the agency faces from both external  and internal sources and that internal control activities should help ensure  that management\u2019s directives are carried out. The control activities should  be effective and efficient in accomplishing the agency\u2019s control objectives.  The control activities element defines 11 specific control activities, which  we have grouped into three categories, as shown in table 1. Each of the  unresolved recommendations from our financial audits and financial  management\u2013related work, and the underlying issues that gave rise to  them, can be traced to one of the 11 specific control activities as shown in  table 1.", "As table 1 indicates, 29 (38 percent) of the unresolved recommendations  relate to IRS\u2019s controls over safeguarding of assets and security activities,  30 (39 percent) relate to issues associated with IRS\u2019s ability to properly  record and document transactions, and 18 (23 percent) relate to issues  associated with IRS\u2019s management review and oversight.", "In the following section, we group the 77 open recommendations under  the specific control activity to which the condition that gave rise to them  most appropriately fits.

Although not  comprehensive, the descriptions are intended to help explain why actions  to strengthen these control activities are important for IRS to efficiently  and effectively carry out its overall mission. Each control activity  description includes a table of the related open recommendations. The  tables list the recommendations by the year in which we made them   (ID no.). For each recommendation, we also indicate whether it is a   short-term or long-term recommendation.

Internal  control in this important area should be designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding prevention or prompt detection of unauthorized  acquisition, use, or disposition of an agency\u2019s assets. IRS has outstanding  recommendations in the following three control activities in the internal  control standards that relate to safeguarding of assets (including buildings  and equipment as well as tax receipts) and security activities (such as  limiting access to only authorized personnel): (1) physical control over  vulnerable assets, (2) segregation of duties, and (3) access restrictions to,  and accountability for, resources and records."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Physical Control over Vulnerable Assets", "paragraphs": ["Internal control standard: An agency must establish physical control to  secure and safeguard vulnerable assets. Examples include security for  and limited access to assets such as cash, securities, inventories, and  equipment which might be vulnerable to risk of loss or unauthorized  use. Such assets should be periodically counted and compared to  control records.", "Of the trillions of dollars in taxes that IRS collects each year, hundreds of  billions is collected in the form of checks and cash accompanied by tax  returns and related information. IRS collects taxes both at its own  facilities as well as at lockbox banks. IRS acts as custodian for (1) the tax  payments it receives until they are deposited in the General Fund of the  U.S. Treasury and (2) the tax returns and related information it receives  until they are either sent to the Federal Records Center or destroyed. IRS  is also charged with controlling many other assets, such as computers and  other equipment, but it is IRS\u2019s legal responsibility to safeguard tax returns  and the confidential information taxpayers provide on those returns that  makes the effectiveness of IRS\u2019s internal controls over physical security  essential to accomplishing its mission.", "While effective physical safeguards over receipts should exist throughout  the year, such safeguards are especially important during the peak tax  filing season. Each year during the weeks preceding and shortly after   April 15, an IRS service center or lockbox bank may receive and process  daily over 100,000 pieces of mail containing returns, receipts, or both. The  dollar value of receipts each service center and lockbox bank processes  increases to hundreds of millions of dollars a day during the April 15 time  frame.", "The following 22 open recommendations in table 2 are designed to  improve IRS\u2019s physical controls over vulnerable assets. They include  recommendations for IRS to improve controls over (1) physical security at  its Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TAC), (2) courier activities, (3) lockbox  banks\u2019 handling of unprocessable items, (4) the handling of hardcopy  cash receipts, and (5) property and equipment disposal procedures. We  consider all of these recommendations to be correctable on a short-term  basis.", "Internal control standard: Key duties and responsibilities need to be  divided or segregated among different people to reduce the risk of error  or fraud. This should include separating the responsibilities for  authorizing transactions, processing and recording them, reviewing the  transactions, and handling any related assets. No one individual should  control all key aspects of a transaction or event.", "As noted in the previous section, IRS employees process hundreds of  billions of dollars in tax receipts in the form of cash and checks.  Consequently, it is critical that IRS maintain appropriate separation of  duties to allow for adequate oversight of staff and protection of these  vulnerable resources so that no single individual would be in a position of  causing an error or irregularity, or potentially converting the asset to  personal use, and then concealing it. For example, when an IRS field office  receives taxpayer receipts and returns, it is responsible for depositing the  cash and checks in a depository institution and forwarding the related  taxpayer information received, such as tax returns, to an IRS service  center for further processing. In order to adequately safeguard receipts  from theft, the person responsible for recording the information from the  taxpayer receipts on a voucher should be different from the individual  who prepares those receipts for transmittal to the service center for  further processing.", "Implementing the following recommendation in table 3 would help IRS  improve its separation of duties, which will in turn strengthen controls  over tax receipts. This recommendation is short-term in nature.", "Internal control standard: Access to resources and records should be  limited to authorized individuals, and accountability for their custody  and use should be assigned and maintained. Periodic comparison of  resources with the recorded accountability should be made to help  reduce the risk of errors, fraud, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.", "Because IRS is responsible for maintaining accountability over a large  volume of cash and checks, it is imperative that it maintain strong controls  to appropriately restrict access to those assets, the records relied on to  track those assets, and sensitive taxpayer information. Although IRS has a  number of both physical and information systems controls in place, some  of the issues we have identified in our financial audits over the years  pertain to ensuring that (1) those individuals who have direct access to  cash and checks are appropriately vetted, such as through appropriate  background investigations, before being granted access to taxpayer  receipts and information and (2) IRS maintains effective access security  control.

Therefore, it is important  that IRS maintain effective controls to ensure that all documents and  records are properly and timely recorded, managed, and maintained both  at its facilities and at the lockbox banks. In this regard, it is critical that  IRS adequately document and disseminate its procedures to ensure that  they are available for IRS employees. IRS must also document its  management reviews of controls, such as those regarding refunds and  returned checks, document transmittals, and reviews of TAC operations.  To ensure future availability of adequate documentation, IRS must ensure  that (1) its systems, particularly those now being developed and  implemented, have appropriate capability to identify and trace individual  transactions and (2) all critical steps in its accounting processes are  adequately documented.
