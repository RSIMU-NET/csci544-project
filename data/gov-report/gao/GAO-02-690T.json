Faced with persistent pressures to cut their costs,  hospitals over the past two decades have increasingly relied on specialized  private firms\u2014GPOs\u2014to keep the cost of supplies in check.  Hospitals buy  everything from sophisticated medical devices\u2014for example, cardiac  defibrillators\u2014to commodities such as saline solution through GPO- negotiated contracts.  By pooling the purchases of their member hospitals,  these specialized firms are intended to negotiate lower prices from vendors  (manufacturers and distributors), which can benefit hospitals and,  ultimately, consumers and payers of hospital care (such as insurers and  employers).  The price advantages of a GPO are expected to be greater for  large GPOs, which negotiate on behalf of nearly 2,000 hospitals.  To  increase its leverage with vendors, a GPO often selects only certain  manufacturers and vendors of a product to include in its catalog.   According to GPOs, this selection of some vendors and exclusion of others  reflects judgments about both product quality and price.", "Some manufacturers\u2014especially small manufacturers of medical  devices\u2014allege that contracting practices of some large GPOs have  blocked their access to hospitals\u2019 purchasing decisionmakers.  The  manufacturers contend that these practices ultimately deny patients access  to innovative or superior medical devices.  These concerns have spurred  calls for reexamining federal antitrust guidelines regarding GPOs.  Issued  in 1993, these guidelines articulate an antitrust enforcement policy that  affords GPOs considerable latitude to merge and grow.  The policy has  permitted the creation and growth of the largest GPOs, formed in the 1990s.", "To assist the Subcommittee as it considers GPOs\u2019 effects on medical device  purchasing, this statement provides an overview of the GPOs and their  operations and summarizes results from our pilot study, which the  Subcommittee requested, of a selected metropolitan area\u2019s hospital  purchasing.  This study was exploratory, testing the feasibility of collecting  price and purchase data for medical devices, and will be followed by a  broader study covering more areas, devices, GPOs, and hospitals.   Specifically, this statement details (1) the extent to which, in one market,  hospitals buying pacemakers and safety needles saved money by using a  GPO contract and (2) the extent to which these hospitals purchased  pacemakers and needles from small manufacturers.  To learn about GPO  operations, we interviewed officials of 11 hospitals, four GPOs, nine  medical device manufacturers, two industry associations, and the  Department of Justice (DOJ).  We established the feasibility of collecting  price and purchase data on medical devices by obtaining such data on  pacemakers and safety needles for 2000 from 18 hospitals in one greater  metropolitan area.  We chose to study pacemakers and safety needles  because they are two types of medical devices that are commonly  purchased by hospitals.  Hospitals in our sample purchased 121 models of  pacemakers and 196 models of safety needles. We compared GPO- negotiated prices to prices obtained by hospitals purchasing on their own.   Because all these hospitals did not purchase each model, price  comparisons were only possible for subsets of models. Taken together,  comparisons involved contracts of eight GPOs, 23 models of safety needles,  and 42 models of pacemakers.  In many cases, more than one hospital  purchased a particular device; in those cases, the price refers to the median  price.  We also used the purchase data to determine the extent to which  these hospitals purchased these devices from small manufacturers.  We did  not independently verify the information in appendix I.  Our work was  conducted from October 2001 through April 2002 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing principles.", "In summary, for the hospitals that we studied, a hospital\u2019s use of a GPO  contract did not guarantee that the hospital saved money: GPOs\u2019 prices  were not always lower and were often higher than prices paid by hospitals  negotiating with vendors directly.  Specifically, we examined price savings  with respect to three factors:  Whether hospitals using GPO contracts got better prices than hospitals  that did their own contracting varied widely by product model.  For  some pacemaker models, the hospitals using GPO contracts got  considerably better prices\u2014up to 26 percent lower than the hospitals  not using a GPO contract. But for other models, hospitals using a GPO  contract got prices that were much worse\u2013up to 39 percent higher than  hospitals not using a GPO contract. Similar results held for hospitals  using large GPOs\u2014those whose members purchase more than $6 billion  per year with their contracts\u2014compared to hospitals buying on their  own.", "Price savings differed by size of hospital.  Large hospitals\u2014those with  more than 500 beds\u2014often obtained lower prices on their own than by  using a GPO.  By contrast, small and medium-sized hospitals were more  likely to obtain price savings using a GPO contract. But these hospitals\u2019  experiences also ranged widely:  Some hospitals\u2019 GPO contract prices  were much lower\u2014and others much higher\u2014than prices negotiated by  hospitals on their own.", "Price savings had little relationship to the size of the GPO.  Hospitals  using contracts of large GPOs\u2014those whose members purchase over  $6 billion per year with their contracts\u2014did not necessarily obtain  better prices than hospitals using smaller GPOs\u2019 contracts.   This lack of  consistent price savings is contrary to what would be expected for large  GPOs.", "In the metropolitan market we studied, hospitals bought pacemakers and  safety needles predominantly from large manufacturers.  We could not  determine the extent to which hospitals\u2019 reliance on large manufacturers of  these two devices reflected hospitals\u2019 independent preferences for large  manufacturers\u2019 products or the effect of GPOs\u2019 contracting practices on  hospitals\u2019 purchasing decisions, since almost all hospitals in our sample  belonged to GPOs.", "The data on hospital purchases in our study market raise questions about  whether GPOs\u2014and especially large GPOs\u2014achieve price savings  consistently, as expected.  In addition, the limited number of purchases  from small manufacturers in our study market suggests the need to  examine data from additional markets, given small manufacturers\u2019  concerns that GPOs\u2019 practices inappropriately limit their access to  potential purchasers.  This additional information on price savings and  GPO practices could inform an examination of GPOs\u2019 treatment under  federal antitrust policy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Hospitals\u2019 budgets for medical devices and other goods are substantial.   Many hospitals buy medical devices and other supplies through GPOs,  which are generally owned by member hospitals and vary in size and scope  of services.  GPOs are expected to use volume purchasing as leverage in  negotiating prices with vendors.  In exchange for administrative services  and the ability to sell through a GPO to its member hospitals, vendors pay  administrative fees to a GPO based on the hospitals\u2019 purchases made using  that GPO\u2019s contract.  These fees, sanctioned under Medicare law, cover the  GPO\u2019s costs; GPOs often distribute surplus fees to their owners.  Federal  antitrust guidelines help a GPO determine whether its business practices  and market share are likely to be questioned as anticompetitive by  enforcement agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Hospitals and Medical Devices", "paragraphs": ["According to an American Hospital Association (AHA) survey, roughly  4,900 nonfederal community hospitals spent an estimated $173 billion on  nonlabor supplies, services, and capital in 2000.  A significant share of  hospitals\u2019 nonlabor costs include such goods as pharmaceuticals and  medical devices.  Hospitals buy these goods through their own purchasing  departments, and many hospitals\u2014in addition to contracting on their own  with vendors\u2014use GPO-negotiated contracts for at least some of their  purchasing.  Some hospitals have large or more sophisticated purchasing  operations, but even hospitals belonging to large chains or health systems  often do at least some purchasing through a GPO.  The proportion of  hospitals belonging to at least one GPO is substantial: estimates range from  68 percent to 98 percent.", "Medical devices that hospitals buy span a wide array of products, such as  pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and infusion pumps.  Some device  manufacturers are small companies that offer one product or a few closely  related products while others are large firms that offer many, often  unrelated, products.  The Medical Device Manufacturers Association  estimates that some devices become obsolete within 2 to 3 years\u2014when  the next generation of a particular device becomes available.   Manufacturers market medical devices in medical journals and trade shows  but place considerable value on having access to clinicians in hospitals as  well as to hospital purchasing departments, which make the final buying  decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GPOs\u2019 Size, Structure, and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["According to the Health Industry Group Purchasing Association, hundreds  of GPOs operate today, but only about 30 negotiate sizeable contracts on  behalf of their members.  The emergence of these large GPOs in part stems  from GPO mergers in the mid-1990s.  Joint ventures and mergers created  the two largest GPOs, Novation and Premier, which have annual purchases  by member facilities using their contracts of $17.6 billion and $14 billion,  respectively.  Other GPOs in our pilot study have less than $6 billion in  annual purchases by member facilities.  (See appendix I for purchasing  volumes of GPOs in our pilot study.)  In addition to differences in size,  GPOs differ in scope. Some negotiate national contracts and offer many  services beyond purchasing, such as programs emphasizing the gains in  safety and economic value resulting from standardization, or specialized  software to help ensure that hospitals are not overcharged. Others serve  regional or local hospital markets and provide fewer additional services.", "GPOs differ in their corporate structures and their relationships with  member hospitals.  All large GPOs and many smaller GPOs are for-profit  entities, some of which are owned by not-for-profit hospitals.  Other GPOs  have shareholders independent of the member hospitals, which themselves  do not necessarily hold an ownership stake.  An example of a for-profit  GPO owned by not-for-profit hospitals is Premier.  Premier is owned by 203  not-for-profit health care organizations that operate approximately 900  hospitals.  Other for-profit GPOs are owned by investors that are not  member hospitals; for example, InSource is owned by MedAssets, a private  purchasing and contract services company.  Broadlane\u2019s owners consist of  individual investors as well as for-profit and not-for-profit organizations  including Tenet Healthcare, a nationwide provider of health care services.    Some GPOs are jointly owned.  For example, both Novation and Healthcare  Purchasing Partners International (HPPI) are owned by the same two  networks of hospitals and physicians.  Network members purchase using  Novation contracts.  However, non-network members purchase using HPPI  contracts, which are negotiated by Novation.  Some GPOs, such as  HealthTrust, require that members do not belong to other GPOs.  In  addition, some GPOs, such as Novation and Amerinet, contract with  manufacturers to supply products sold under the GPO\u2019s own \u201cprivate-label\u201d  brand name.  (See appendix I for a summary of characteristics of GPOs in  our pilot.)", "According to officials of GPOs and a GPO trade organization, benefits that  GPOs provide to member hospitals include, in addition to lower prices,  reduced costs due to hospitals being able to reduce the size of purchasing  departments, as well as assistance with product-comparison analysis and  standardization of products.  Benefits that GPOs say they provide to  manufacturers with which they contract include, in addition to access to  hospital decisionmakers, cost savings due to reducing manufacturers\u2019  contracting, marketing, and sales activities.  According to representatives  of some manufacturers, many GPOs act as gatekeepers to hospital  purchasing decisionmakers and charge the manufacturers administrative  fees as the price of access to their member hospitals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GPO Price Negotiation and Administrative Fees", "paragraphs": ["In order to sell to hospitals through GPO contracts, vendors generally  submit proposals to a GPO\u2014in response to Requests for Proposals  (RFP)\u2014that are then evaluated.  Based on these evaluations, the GPO  enters into negotiations with select vendors to determine prices and, in  some cases, administrative fees that vendors pay to the GPO.  Hospitals  then buy directly from the manufacturer for a price specified in a GPO  contract. Often prices through a GPO-negotiated contract vary based on  each hospital\u2019s volume of purchases and the extent to which the member  hospital delivers on its \u201ccommitment\u201d to buy an agreed-upon share of its  purchases of a certain product from a particular manufacturer.  The more  of a product that a hospital purchases, the lower the price per unit it may  pay the manufacturer.  A hospital\u2019s price may also vary depending upon the  share of a product it purchases from a manufacturer.  For example, a  hospital that buys only 25 percent of its cardiac stents from one  manufacturer may pay nearly three times more per stent than one that  purchases all its stents from that manufacturer.   Member hospitals may  have an additional financial incentive to use the GPO contract.  The extent  to which a hospital buys using the GPO\u2019s contracts may affect the share of  the administrative fees that the GPO returns to the hospital.", "Although GPOs provide services to hospitals and are often organized by  hospitals, many finance their operations primarily through the  administrative fees paid by manufacturers and other vendors.  These fees  are typically calculated as a percentage of each hospital\u2019s purchases from a  vendor.  The Social Security Act, as amended in 1986, allows these fees,  which would otherwise be considered \u2018kickbacks\u2019 or other illegal payments  to the GPO.  Regulations establishing appropriate administrative fees,  enforced by the Office of Inspector General in the Department of Health  and Human Services, state that the fee structure must be disclosed in an  agreement between the GPO and each participating member.  The  agreement must state that fees are to be 3 percent or less of the purchase  price, or if not fixed at 3 percent or less, the amount or maximum amount  that each vendor will pay.  The GPO must also disclose in writing to each  member, at least annually, the amount received from each vendor with  respect to purchases made by or on behalf of the member. The fees tend to  be higher on purchases by hospitals that buy most or all of an item from  one vendor.  In addition to covering their operating expenses with these  fees, GPOs, with the approval of their boards of directors, often distribute  surplus fees to member hospitals but may also use administrative fees to  finance new ventures, such as electronic commerce, that are outside their  core business.  (See fig. 1.)", "The complex financial flows among vendors, GPOs, and hospitals have  raised concerns that GPOs\u2019 interests may diverge from those of hospitals.   According to some small manufacturers, GPOs have an incentive not to  seek the lowest price because higher prices yield higher administrative  fees. These manufacturers further suggest that GPOs, by relying on  vendors\u2019 fees, become agents of manufacturers and assist them in limiting  competition.  By contrast, according to some GPOs, they act as an  extension of hospitals and GPO members have input into the GPOs\u2019  product selections.  GPOs acknowledge that a manufacturer dominant in a  product line may contract with a GPO, or agree to a favorable contract, to  preserve its market share and exclude competitors.  However, GPOs assert  that this selective contracting is part of a competitive process allowing the  GPO to negotiate lower prices.  GPOs also emphasize that participation in a  GPO is voluntary, so the GPO must reflect what the hospitals want if it is to  retain their business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Antitrust", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing that joint purchasing arrangements among hospitals may  enable members to achieve efficiencies that will benefit consumers but  may, in some cases, pose risks of harming consumers by reducing  competition, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued in 1993  a guideline to help GPOs and others gauge whether a particular GPO  arrangement is likely to raise antitrust problems.  This guideline sets forth  an \u201cantitrust safety zone\u201d for GPOs that meet a two-part test, under which  the agencies, absent extraordinary circumstances, will not challenge the  arrangement as anticompetitive.  Essentially, the two-part test is as follows:  1. Purchases through a GPO must account for less than 35 percent of the  total sales of the product or service in question (such as pacemakers)  in the relevant market.  This part of the test addresses whether the  GPO accounts for such a large share of the purchases of the product or  service that it can effectively exercise increased market power as a  buyer.  If the GPO\u2019s buying power drives the price of the product or  service below competitive levels, consumers could be harmed if  suppliers respond by reducing output, quality, or innovation.  2. The cost of purchases through a GPO by each member hospital that  competes with other members must amount to less than 20 percent of  each hospital\u2019s total revenues.  This second part of the test looks at  whether the GPO purchases constitute such a large share of the  revenues of competing member hospitals that they could result in  standardizing the hospitals\u2019 costs enough to make it easier to fix or  coordinate prices.", "However, the guideline states that a purchasing arrangement is not  necessarily in violation of the antitrust laws simply because it falls outside  the safety zone.  Likewise, the guideline suggests that even a purchasing  arrangement that falls within the safety zone might still raise antitrust  concerns under \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d  Each arrangement has to  be examined according to its particular facts.
