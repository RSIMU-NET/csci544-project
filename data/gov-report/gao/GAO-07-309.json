SBI and SBInet senior officials told us all SBInet activities link back to the  overall goal of controlling the border and that the linkage between  program goals and activities is intuitive.

For  example, about $790 million is allocated for the Tucson Border Patrol  sector and $260 million for the Yuma sector in Arizona. However, the plan  did not include costs incurred to date mainly because SBInet activities are  in the early stages of implementation and costs had not yet been captured  by DHS\u2019s accounting system (e.g., the SBInet systems integration contract  was awarded in September 2006 and the first two task orders were  awarded in September and October 2006). Moreover, the expenditure plan  did not include a baseline measure of miles under control of the border.  While the plan did not discuss progress made to date by the program to  obtain control of the border, related program documents, such as the  bimonthly SBI reports to Congress, included information on the number of  miles under control in the southwest border.

Also, on  November 30, 2006, DHS\u2019s Deputy CIO certified that the SBInet program  had contracted with a private company as the interim independent  verification and validation (IV&V) agent. However, this company is also  responsible for performing program activities, including requirements  management and test and evaluation activities and thus is not independent  of all the program\u2019s products and processes that it could review.

The extent to which these practices are in use varies, and outcomes are  dependent on successful implementation. However, one acquisition  requirement not followed was that the SBInet systems integration contract  did not contain a specific number of units that may be ordered or a  maximum dollar value. According to the Federal Acquisition Regulation  (FAR), indefinite quantity contracts must specify the maximum quantity  of supplies or services the agency will acquire. This may be stated as a  number of units or as a dollar value. SBI and SBInet officials told us that  the contract already contains a maximum quantity of \u201c6,000 miles of  secure U.S. border\u201d and that this was sufficient to satisfy the FAR  requirement. We disagree because the statement in the contract about the  6,000 miles of secure border merely reflects the agency\u2019s overall outcome  to be achieved with the supplies or services provided but does not specify  the maximum quantity of supplies or services the agency may acquire. We  believe that a maximum quantity or dollar value limit should be included  in the contract in order to ensure that it is consistent with the FAR  requirement.", "SBInet\u2019s acquisition approach calls for considerable concurrency among  related planned tasks and activities.

SBI and  SBInet officials told us that they understand the risks inherent in  concurrency and are addressing these risks. However, they have yet to  provide evidence that shows they have identified the dependencies among  their concurrent activities and that they are proactively managing the  associated risk.", "Further, the program office did not fully define and implement key  acquisition management processes, such as project planning, requirements  management, and risk management. According to the SBInet Program  Manager, this is due to the priority being given to meeting an accelerated  program implementation schedule.

DHS\u2019s written comments are reproduced in   appendix II.", "With respect to our recommendations, DHS concurred with two of our  recommendations and disagreed with one. Specifically, DHS concurred  with our recommendation for future expenditure plans to include explicit  and measurable commitments relative to capabilities, schedule, costs, and  benefits associated with individual SBInet program activities.  According  to DHS, future SBInet expenditure plans will include actual and planned  progress, report against commitments contained in prior expenditure  plans, and include a section that addresses and tracks milestones.  DHS  also concurred with our recommendation to re-examine the level of  concurrency and appropriately adjust the acquisition strategy. In its  written comments, DHS stated that CBP is constantly assessing the overall  program as it unfolds, and adjusting it to reflect progress, resource  constraints, refinements and changes in requirements, and insight gained  from ongoing system engineering activities. DHS also stated that CBP  recognizes the risk inherent in concurrency and has added this to the  program\u2019s risk management database.", "DHS did not agree with our recommendation to modify the SBInet  integration contract to include a maximum quantity or dollar value.   According to DHS, the quantity stated in the contract, \u201c6,000 miles of   secure U.S. border,\u201d is measurable and is therefore the most appropriate  approach to defining the contract ceiling.  We do not agree. Under the  FAR, an agency may use an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract,  such as that used for SBInet, when it is not possible to determine in  advance the precise quantities of goods or services that may be required  during performance of the contract.  Though these types of contracts are  indefinite, they are not open-ended.  The FAR requires that indefinite  quantity contracts contain a limit on the supplies or services that may be  ordered, stated in terms of either units or dollars.  This limit serves a  variety of purposes, including establishing the maximum financial  obligation of the parties.  In our view, the purported maximum used in the  SBInet contract, \u201cthe full panoply of supplies and services to provide 6,000  miles of secure U.S. border,\u201d does not allow anyone to calculate with any  degree of certainty what the maximum financial obligation of the parties  might turn out to be since the contract does not make clear the total  amount of supplies or services that would be required to secure even 1  mile of U.S. border.  In order to ensure that the SBInet contract is  consistent with the FAR, we continue to believe that it should be modified  to include a maximum quantity, either units or a dollar value, rather than  the total amount of miles to be secured.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking  Minority Members of other Senate and House committees that have  authorization and oversight responsibilities for homeland security.
