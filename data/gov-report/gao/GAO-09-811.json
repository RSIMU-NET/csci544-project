Because of the many stakeholders involved in recovery, including all levels of government, it is critical to build collaborative relationships. Building on GAO's September 2008 report which provided several key recovery practices from past catastrophic disasters, this report presents examples of how federal, state, and local governments have effectively collaborated in the past. GAO reviewed five catastrophic disasters--the Loma Prieta earthquake (California, 1989), Hurricane Andrew (Florida, 1992), the Northridge earthquake (California, 1994), the Kobe earthquake (Japan, 1995), and the Grand Forks/Red River flood (North Dakota and Minnesota, 1997)--to identify recovery lessons. GAO interviewed officials involved in the recovery from these disasters and experts on disaster recovery. GAO also reviewed relevant legislation, policies, and the disaster recovery literature."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Effective collaboration among stakeholders can play a key role in facilitating long-term recovery after a catastrophic event. Toward that end, GAO has identified four collaborative practices that may help communities rebuild from the Gulf Coast hurricanes as well as future catastrophic events: (1) Develop and communicate common goals to guide recovery. Defining common recovery goals can enhance collaboration by helping stakeholders overcome differences in missions and cultures. After the Grand Forks/Red River flood, federally-funded consultants convened various stakeholders to develop recovery goals and priorities for the city of Grand Forks. The city used these goals as a basis to create a detailed recovery action plan that helped it to implement its recovery goals. (2) Leverage resources to facilitate recovery. Collaborating groups bring different resources and capacities to the task at hand. After the Northridge earthquake, officials from the Federal Highway Administration and California's state transportation agency worked together to review highway rebuilding contracts, discuss changes, and then approve projects all in one location. This co-located, collaborative approach enabled the awarding of rebuilding contracts in 3 to 5 days--instead of the 26 to 40 weeks it could take using normal contracting procedures. This helped to restore damaged highways within a few months of the earthquake. (3) Use recovery plans to agree on roles and responsibilities. Organizations can collectively agree on who will do what by identifying roles and responsibilities in recovery plans developed either before or after a disaster takes place. Learning from its experiences from the Loma Prieta earthquake, San Francisco Bay Area officials created a plan that clearly identifies roles for all participants in order to facilitate regional recovery in the event of a future disaster. (4) Monitor, evaluate, and report on progress made toward recovery. After the 1995 earthquake, the city of Kobe and the surrounding region established processes to assess and report on recovery progress. These jurisdictions required periodic external reviews over 10 years on the progress made toward achieving recovery goals. As a result of one of these reviews, the city of Kobe gained insight into unintended consequences of how it relocated elderly earthquake victims, which subsequently led to a change in policy. Past recovery experiences--including practices that promote effective collaboration--offer potentially valuable lessons for future catastrophic events. FEMA has taken some steps to facilitate the sharing of such experiences among communities involved in disaster recovery. However, the agency can do more to build on and systematize the sharing of this information so that recovery lessons are better captured and disseminated for use in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Successful recovery from catastrophic disasters requires a partnership  involving federal, state, and local governments, as well as the nonprofit  and private sectors. An extensive group of participants\u2014both  governmental and nongovernmental\u2014were involved in recovery efforts  after the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Stakeholders included virtually all  cabinet-level federal agencies, several Gulf Coast states, almost 600 local  jurisdictions in Louisiana and Mississippi including municipalities,  parishes, school and utility districts, and housing authorities as well as  community groups and other nongovernmental organizations. In the wake  of the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, numerous reports have identified  coordination and collaboration as a key challenge during the government\u2019s  response. Our more recent work on Gulf Coast recovery efforts also  identified collaboration and coordination as an obstacle to the recovery  process as well.", "Experiences from past disasters can provide valuable insights to help  communities overcome recovery challenges. At your request, last  September we identified several key practices from past catastrophic  disasters to help other communities when recovering from such events.   In that report, we described actions taken by state and local governments  during past disasters that facilitated recovery. Specifically, localities   (1) created a clear, implementable, and timely recovery plan; (2) built state  and local capacity for recovery; (3) implemented strategies for business  recovery; and (4) adopted a comprehensive approach to combat fraud,  waste, and abuse. Taken together, these actions provide state and local  officials with a set of tools and approaches to consider when recovering  from a catastrophic event.", "In this report, we focus on a key element involved in developing and  carrying out many of these practices\u2014collaboration. Because of the  numerous partners and stakeholders involved after a disaster, effective  collaboration is critical in order to accomplish many recovery-related  tasks. As agreed with your offices, this report (1) presents examples of  how federal, state, and local governments have collaborated in the past,  identifying selected practices that may be helpful for communities  recovering from the Gulf Coast hurricanes as well as future catastrophic  events and (2) describes ways in which the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) supports collaboration among recovery  stakeholders and the extent to which it facilitates the sharing of lessons  and experiences from past recovery efforts.", "To conduct our review, we selected five catastrophic disasters: the 1989  Loma Prieta earthquake in northern California; Hurricane Andrew, which  struck southern Florida in 1992; the 1994 Northridge earthquake in Los  Angeles, California; the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan; and the 1997  Grand Forks/Red River flood in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East  Grand Forks, Minnesota. We visited four of these communities to meet  with federal, state, and local officials and make observations of the  conditions today. Although we did not visit communities affected by the  Grand Forks/Red River flood, we were able to gather the necessary  information through telephone interviews with key officials involved in the  recovery as well as experts knowledgeable about the disaster. Further, we  also obtained and reviewed relevant legislation, ordinances, policies, and  program documents that describe steps taken to facilitate long-term  recovery following each of our selected disasters.", "We interviewed officials at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),  FEMA, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) in the  Department of Commerce, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), nongovernmental organizations, as well as academic  experts who were knowledgeable about the recovery following each of  our selected disasters and issues relating to coordination. To understand  how FEMA supports collaboration among recovery stakeholders and the  extent to which it facilitates the sharing of experiences from past recovery  efforts, we interviewed FEMA staff and gained access to some of its online  systems. For more information on our scope and methodology see  appendix I. For detailed descriptions of the impact of the five disasters we  reviewed as well as selected recovery strategies taken in the wake of each  of these events, see appendix II to VI.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2007 through July 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments generally have the primary responsibility for  disaster recovery while the federal government provides support when  requested. Because there are many parties involved in this process\u2014 including all levels of government as well as victims and businesses within  the affected communities\u2014effective collaboration is a key factor for  successful recovery. In addition, collaboration among recovery  stakeholders can continue for an extended period of time. Short-term  recovery is immediate and an extension of the response phase in which  basic services are restored. Long-term recovery can include some of these  short-term activities, but typically continues them for a number of months  or years, depending on the severity and extent of the damage sustained. It  also involves restoration of both individuals and the community, including  the redevelopment of damaged areas.", "To provide recovery assistance after a disaster, many federal agencies and  program components are called upon to administer disaster supplemental  programs and funding, re-program funds, or expedite normal procedures.  For example, grants, loans, loan guarantees, temporary housing, and  counseling are among the forms of disaster assistance available from  federal agencies including FEMA; the departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, HUD, Treasury, and Transportation; and the Small Business  Administration (SBA).", "Some of these federal programs provide financial resources to state and  local governments following disasters, while others provide technical  assistance. For example, FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance grant program  provides funding to repair or replace public infrastructure; HUD\u2019s  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program provides formula  grants for long-term recovery needs such as rehabilitating and building  housing, EDA\u2019s economic adjustment grant responds to the short- and  long-term effects of severe economic dislocation events on communities;  and DHS\u2019s Flood Insurance Program enables individuals to purchase  insurance against losses from physical damage from floods. Other  agencies directly carry out rebuilding or recovery projects such as the  reconstruction of levees by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the  repair of federal roads by the Federal Highway Administration. Federal  recovery assistance is also provided directly to disaster victims. For  example, FEMA\u2019s Individual Households Program provides housing,  financial assistance, and other direct services while the Internal Revenue  Service provides information about how to claim casualty loss  deductions.", "The federal government also provides technical assistance for  communities to engage in long-term community recovery activities,  through the Emergency Support Function #14 (ESF #14), as part of the  National Response Framework. ESF #14 coordinates federal and state  long-term community recovery support and helps communities plan for  and identify the necessary resources for recovery. Developed shortly  before the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, ESF #14 was not in place at the  time of the five past disasters we studied. ESF #14 and FEMA\u2019s Long-Term  Community Recovery Branch in its Disaster Assistance Directorate, which  supports this annex, provide assistance in coordinating federal, state, and  local recovery efforts and developing community recovery plans. The   Long-Term Community Recovery Branch also works with other federal  agencies to help identify program gaps and the potential need for  flexibilities and new authorities during the recovery process.", "Our previous work defines collaboration broadly as any joint activity that  is intended to provide more public value than could be produced when the  organizations act alone. Because of the large number and wide variety of  stakeholders involved in the recovery from a catastrophic event,  collaboration is a critical element of this process. We have previously  reported that agencies can enhance and sustain their collaborative efforts  by engaging in eight practices: defining and articulating a common  outcome; establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies; identifying  and addressing needs by leveraging resources; agreeing on roles and  responsibilities; establishing compatible policies, procedures, and other  means to operate across agency boundaries; developing mechanisms to  monitor, evaluate, and report on results; reinforcing agency accountability  for collaborative efforts through agency plans and reports; and reinforcing  individual accountability for collaborative efforts through performance  management systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Collaboration Has Facilitated Recovery in Past Disasters", "paragraphs": ["Effective collaboration among recovery stakeholders can play a key role in  facilitating disaster recovery.

We  found four of these collaborative practices in the past disasters we  reviewed.

In either case, collaborative efforts  require staff working across organizational lines to define and articulate a  common outcome or purpose they are seeking to achieve that is consistent  with respective organizational goals and mission. In our September 2008  report on disaster recovery, we discussed the importance of recovery  plans and how clearly identified goals in such plans can provide direction  and specific objectives for communities to focus on. Building on this, we  identify two approaches of how stakeholders involved in the recovery  process following the Kobe earthquake in Japan and the Grand Forks/Red  River flood in Grand Forks, North Dakota, worked collectively to define  and articulate common outcomes.", "A month after the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the national Japanese  government formed a \u201creconstruction committee\u201d to organize recovery  efforts. The Japanese government created this body through national  legislation that required the participation of numerous national,  prefectural, and local agencies as well as nongovernmental organizations,  such as the Kobe Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Prime Minister  personally managed the committee, and the Chief Cabinet Secretary and  Minister of the National Land Agency served as deputy managers. The  reconstruction committee also included representation from other high- ranking government officials\u2014including cabinet ministers, the governor of  Hyogo prefecture, and the mayor of the city of Kobe\u2014as well as  participants from academia. According to an official who participated in  this committee, the involvement of these prominent leaders not only  encouraged stakeholders involved in the reconstruction committee to  collaborate in order to come to agreement on recovery goals, it brought  national attention to recovery issues.", "Working together through this committee, these officials and stakeholders  collaborated to create a national plan of action for recovery. This plan  included broad proposals that provided insight for how the national  government would assist in recovery, such as recommending that a long- term recovery plan be developed quickly as well as making housing  reconstruction, debris removal, port reconstruction, and job creation a  national priority. It also included more specific details to guide Hyogo  prefecture and the city of Kobe\u2019s recovery, such as promptly demolishing  unsound structures and using excess concrete from the earthquake rubble  for construction and repairs in the port area.", "In addition to providing an action plan, this committee also reviewed  Hyogo prefecture\u2019s and the city of Kobe\u2019s recovery plans to help localities  align their recovery proposals with the funding priorities of the national  government. According to an evaluation of the recovery conducted by the  city as well as outside recovery experts, the specific feedback provided by  the reconstruction committee, along with the recovery goals previously  clarified by the national government helped local officials to come to  consensus on their recovery goals. Within 6 months of the earthquake,  Hyogo prefecture and the city of Kobe completed recovery plans, which  included specific recovery goals for their regions, such as rebuilding  damaged housing units in 3 years and completing physical recovery in   10 years. According to this evaluation, the delineation of these goals at a  local level played a critical role in helping to coordinate the wide range of  participants involved in implementing recovery projects.", "After the Grand Forks/Red River flood in 1997, federal, state, and local  officials worked together to define common goals when planning for the  recovery of Grand Forks, North Dakota. Technical consultants, funded by  a HUD grant, brought together federal and city officials as well as  members of the community to discuss Grand Forks\u2019s rebuilding priorities.  According to a local official, because the city had no experience with the  process of developing common goals for the city prior to the flood, this  external facilitation helped the Grand Forks community and city officials  come to agreement on a set of common recovery goals. The recovery goals  resulting from these meetings were included in a comprehensive recovery  plan for Grand Forks. A subsequent city evaluation found that the process  of specifying goals within the recovery plan\u2014which identified five broad  goals and a number of supporting objectives and tasks to achieve those  goals\u2014helped the city to conceive and formulate projects in coordination  with the city council and representatives from state and local  governments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leverage Resources to Facilitate Recovery", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported that to effectively collaborate requires the  identification of the human and financial resources needed to initiate or  sustain collaborative effort.

In our  September 2008 report, we discussed the importance of helping state and  local governments take advantage of all available disaster assistance by  enhancing their financial and technical capacity when needed. Following  the Kobe and Northridge earthquakes, we found examples of how  governments leveraged the knowledge and expertise of diverse  stakeholders to produce effective collaboration and, in turn, facilitate the  recovery process.", "In the wake of the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the Japanese government  created a formal organization through which human capital resources  from all levels of the government were leveraged to plan for and  implement recovery strategies. A committee comprised of high ranking  officials\u2014including members of the Japanese House of Representatives  and leaders of affected jurisdictions and their staff\u2014developed  intergovernmental recovery strategies. In addition to those high-ranking  officials, the committee also included working-level staff from national  ministries to provide expertise for developing specific details to be  included in the recovery plan. For example, staff from the Ministry of  Transportation brought expertise on infrastructure replacement while  those from the Kobe Chamber of Commerce and Industry contributed  knowledge regarding economic recovery matters. According to a Japanese  official involved in the recovery, this committee combined the political  know-how from the top-level officials and interdisciplinary expertise from  line-level bureaucrats to propose many recovery proposals which laid a  foundation for the national government\u2019s approach to recovery. The  Japanese government also leveraged human capital expertise through this  committee to facilitate the implementation of recovery strategies. Upon  the approval of certain recovery policies, working staff associated with the  committee returned to their respective organizations to guide their home  departments on how best to implement the strategies. A Japanese official  involved in the committee said that this collaboration helped to ensure  that disparate ministries understood and properly implemented the  recovery strategies they helped to develop.", "After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, the city of Los Angeles, California,  also leveraged human capital resources to accelerate the rebuilding of its  freeway system. Using the technical expertise of staff from the Federal  Highway Administration (FHWA) and the California Department of  Transportation (CalTrans), the city of Los Angeles developed an expedited  contracting process. To review construction proposals more efficiently,  FHWA and CalTrans staff collaborated to review documents, discuss  needed changes, and then approve projects together in one location.  According to CalTrans officials, state and federal offices normally conduct  separate reviews. This joint process helped to expedite the approval of  projects while still meeting oversight requirements for both levels of  government. Under standard contracting procedures, the contracting  process could take 26 to 40 weeks to complete. However, this  collaborative, co-located process enabled state highway officials to  advertise and award construction contracts in just 3 to 5 days. By  leveraging the knowledge and resources of state and federal staff in this  way, Los Angeles successfully restored its highways within a few months  after the Northridge earthquake.", "In addition to leveraging human capital expertise, Los Angeles also found  ways to take advantage of resources from different federal programs to  facilitate housing recovery for certain disaster victims. The city faced  challenges in helping owners of housing units that had suffered extensive  damage in the earthquake. When Los Angeles learned that some of these  dwellings were not eligible for SBA disaster assistance because they had  negative cash flows, the city identified resources available from a HUD  program to help these property owners. Using these funds, the city  allocated $322 million to an Earthquake Supplemental Disaster Relief fund  which assisted property owners who were declined by SBA. To obtain  information on owners who might benefit from this program, the city  entered into a cooperative agreement with SBA to obtain direct referrals  of individuals who were denied loans so that the city could inform them of  this additional source of assistance. A city evaluation of this program  found that Los Angeles received over 5,000 referrals, which represented  more than 22,000 housing units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use Recovery Plans to Identify Roles and Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Collaborating organizations can work together to define and agree on their  respective roles and responsibilities. In doing so, they can collectively  agree on who will do what, organize joint and individual efforts, and  facilitate decision making. One way to delineate roles and responsibilities  for disasters is through planning. For the emergency response phase, the  National Response Framework sets out the roles and responsibilities of  key partners at the local, tribal, state, and federal levels. Responsibilities  for recovery stakeholders are detailed in ESF #14, the Long-Term  Recovery Annex. The annex mostly addresses the responsibilities of  federal agencies involved in recovery.", "Because state and local governments play a lead role in disaster recovery,  it is also important for their roles and responsibilities to be clearly  delineated. After past disasters, this information has been delineated  through long-term community recovery plans. Communities can develop  such plans either before or after a disaster occurs. Post-disaster recovery  plans typically include detailed projects and approaches to rebuild a  community based on the damage and impacts of the specific disasters.  Some communities have supplemented post-disaster plans by conducting  planning efforts prior to a disaster.", "Pre-disaster planning does not involve actually developing rebuilding  programs in advance of a disaster because the patterns of damage from  natural disasters are impossible to predict with sufficient accuracy to  support detailed pre-planning. However, these plans can be helpful in  other ways that foster collaboration, specifically in defining the roles and  responsibilities of recovery stakeholders prior to a disaster. We have  previously reported how effective recovery plans identify specific roles  and responsibilities among various stakeholders. While these plans are  often developed after a disaster takes place, we have identified some  instances where this information was clarified beforehand.", "Los Angeles\u2019s Recovery and Reconstruction Plan clearly identified the  roles and responsibilities of key officials involved in recovery. In the  aftermath of the Northridge earthquake in southern California, the city  revised the plan for the purposes of recovery from that event. Specifically,  the plan identified which city departments have responsibility for  implementing pre-determined activities before and after a disaster in  several functional categories, including residential, commercial, industrial  rehabilitation, and economic recovery. An evaluation of the plan funded by  the National Science Foundation found that the assignment of general  responsibilities to the departments was useful because it helped the  various components of city government to understand their post-disaster  roles and responsibilities. Further, the process of developing the plan also  improved collaboration among stakeholders. Specifically, representatives  from many departments\u2014including public safety, planning, public works,  building, and community redevelopment\u2014met several times to develop  and revise the plan.", "A good plan is not simply a paper-driven exercise, but rather the result of a  dynamic and inclusive process wherein key stakeholders are consulted  and involved in the identification of priorities and the formation of  strategies. Collaboration among recovery stakeholders was further  enhanced through long-term recovery planning exercises held by the city  of Los Angeles. In these exercises, police and fire officials engaged in role  playing exercises in which they assumed the responsibilities of recovery  officials. For example, a public safety officer played the role of a building  inspector responsible for issuing building permits after an earthquake. A  city official at the time of the earthquake told us that the process of  developing the plan and conducting exercises was an important part of  developing relationships among stakeholders which facilitated  collaboration among city officials after the Northridge earthquake.  According to a federally-funded evaluation of this plan, the contacts  established during the planning process facilitated the recovery after the  Northridge earthquake. Another city official stated a positive outcome of  the planning effort was that participants knew of others who worked on  similar issues with whom they can initiate conversations. In addition, the  process of preparing and testing the plan educated city staff on their post- disaster roles and responsibilities.", "More recently, two other communities have taken action to develop  recovery plans prior to a disaster that identify roles and responsibilities for  recovery. In the San Francisco Bay Area, state and local governments used  pre-disaster planning to reinforce a regional approach to recovery as well  as to assign regional roles and responsibilities for recovery. Learning from  past experiences with natural disasters in California including the Loma  Prieta earthquake, the Bay Area recognized the value of planning for  recovery in anticipation of future disasters. Toward that end, Bay Area  officials initiated a regional disaster response planning effort in 2004  culminating with the Regional Emergency Coordination Plan in March  2008, which included a subsidiary plan focused specifically on recovery.", "Specifically for recovery, the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Emergency  Coordination Plan summarizes in a table organizations involved at each  level of government and the primary role of each. For example, the table  specifies that local governments will resume government functions and  request state and federal assistance, that state agencies will implement  state-funded recovery programs, and that regional infrastructure owners  will initiate planning for and implementation of permanent repairs. We  have previously reported on the challenges that state and local  jurisdictions sometimes face with understanding the extent to which the  federal government will pay for disaster-related costs. Pre-disaster  recovery plans that clearly identify the roles and responsibilities of various  stakeholders may prove useful in clarifying the specific types of costs  federal programs are likely to cover as well as some of the requirements of  these programs before a disaster strikes.", "Partly as a result of experiences following Hurricane Andrew, Florida\u2019s  Palm Beach County developed the Palm Beach Countywide Post-Disaster  Redevelopment Plan for guiding decision making and action during the  disaster period as well as detailing actions that can be taken before a  disaster strikes to speed the recovery process. Palm Beach County  delineates roles and responsibilities for recovery by creating working  groups who will be responsible for implementing different sections of the  plan, including infrastructure, economic development, and government  operations. Each working group is assigned several issues to cover along  with a chairperson to spearhead those activities for the county.  Additionally, city departments and agencies are represented in each of  these working groups.", "As an outgrowth of this plan, a Business and Industry program was  created that formally integrated business interests into the recovery  process. Additionally, the program also created a private-public  partnership comprising local, state, regional, and national businesses as  well as governmental and nongovernmental organizations. According to a  Palm Beach County official, partners in this program are fully engaged in  the development and implementation of recovery initiatives. These  collaboration efforts have resulted in improved relationships among the  governmental, nongovernmental, and business entities involved in the  program.", "Post-disaster recovery plans can also provide a vehicle to designate roles  and responsibilities for recovery, among other things. We have previously  reported that well-crafted post-disaster recovery plans can clarify roles  and responsibilities and help jurisdictions make progress with recovery.", "For example, the city of Grand Forks\u2019s recovery plan developed in the  wake of the 1997 Grand Forks/Red River flood clearly identified which  personnel\u2014drawn from city, state, and federal agencies\u2014would be  needed to carry out each task. Specifically, the plan called for  collaboration of staff from the city\u2019s urban development and  engineering/building inspection departments, FEMA, and the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers to create an inventory of substantially damaged  buildings in the downtown area.

Both governments designed a two-phase approach to evaluating the  progress they have made toward recovery, the first taking place about   5 years after the earthquake and the second about 10 years afterward. This  design allowed for both a short- and long-term assessment of the recovery.  Although the Hyogo and Kobe governments funded these evaluations,  neither prefecture nor city employees were directly involved in conducting  these assessments; rather, they used external staff to perform the reviews.  Hyogo prefecture invited domestic and international disaster recovery  experts to serve on its evaluation panels, while the city of Kobe staffed its  reviews with members of local community groups.", "These evaluations focused on the goals established in the recovery plans  approved by the national government 6 months after the earthquake. They  enabled policy makers to measure the progress made by various  stakeholders in achieving recovery goals, and identify needed changes to  existing policies, and learned lessons for future disasters. The panels  examined six broad recovery topics\u2014including health, industry,  employment, and urban development\u2014which resulted in many  recommendations to improve recovery from the Kobe earthquake.", "For example, as a result of its 10-year evaluation Hyogo prefecture gained  insight into the unintended consequences of how it relocated elderly  earthquake victims, which subsequently led to a change in policy. After the  earthquake, the prefecture gave priority to the relocation of elderly victims  and grouped them together in special care residences located outside the  city. While this policy ensured that this vulnerable population received  housing quickly, it also had the unintended effect of isolating the relocated  seniors, who were removed from their communities. In fact, the  verification committee attributed this housing arrangement as leading to  untimely deaths for some seniors. After learning of this finding, the  prefecture built new types of residential housing that offer comprehensive  lifestyle support for seniors. In addition, for future disasters the prefecture  plans to develop a system to track displaced populations as they move  from temporary to permanent housing to help maintain better contact with  victims."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Taken Steps to Facilitate Collaboration among Stakeholders, but Could Do More to Share Recovery Experiences", "paragraphs": ["Recovery experiences from past catastrophes\u2014including good  collaboration practices\u2014can offer lessons for such events in the future.

FEMA has assisted state and local  governments in developing post-disaster recovery plans in various ways,  which in turn can help facilitate collaboration among stakeholders.   First, FEMA, along with other federal agencies such as HUD and EDA,  provided technical assistance for post-disaster recovery plans for several  of the disasters we reviewed. Second, FEMA developed guidance for  conducting the long-term recovery planning process. More specifically, the  agency created a Long-Term Community Recovery Self Help Guide that  offers communities step-by-step guidance for implementing a recovery  program and planning process. Third, FEMA created the Long-Term  Recovery Assessment Tool to help communities analyze the impacts of a  disaster while taking into consideration the local government\u2019s capacity to  assist in promoting its own long-term recovery. The assessment tool helps  federal and other decision makers identity the type and level of  supplemental long-term community recovery assistance that may be  needed for full recovery from a disaster. The tool also includes processes  and procedures for assessing long-term recovery needs, community  evaluation protocols, standard planning templates, staffing strategies, and  timetables for various levels of effort.", "FEMA has also taken actions to encourage collaboration among state and  local officials to share experiences and expertise related to disaster  recovery. For example, FEMA\u2019s Long-Term Community Recovery Branch,  working through ESF #14, hosted a teleconference linking officials in  Florida, Mississippi, Colorado, and Iowa with experience recovering from  previous disasters to provide information to officials in Texas recovering  from Hurricane Ike. In this way, officials with direct experience in the  recovery process were able to share good practices related to recovery  planning, disaster funds administration, and coordinating regional efforts  with the participants from Texas. According to FEMA officials, this  collaboration helped the Texas officials identify recovery projects and  develop a community recovery plan. In addition, FEMA is considering  ways to further facilitate the sharing of lessons learned for disaster  recovery, including creating a peer-to-peer mentoring program where  experienced local officials can provide technical assistance, advice, and  support to communities impacted by the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes.  However, these officials told us that this idea is still at an early stage and  additional specifics are not yet available.", "FEMA\u2019s information sharing Web sites do not include a focus on  recovery. FEMA has systematic approaches for sharing lessons regarding  three of the four phases of a disaster\u2014preparedness, response, and  mitigation; however, as of June 2009, the agency does not have an  information sharing system focused on recovery. Officials involved in the  preparedness and response phases of a disaster can share lessons through  FEMA\u2019s Lessons Learned Information Sharing (LLIS) Web site. LLIS is a  national online network of lessons learned and best practices for the  emergency preparedness, response, and homeland security communities.  Online since April 2004, LLIS provides users access to over 12,000  documents including state and local plans, after-action reports, best  practices, and lessons learned that are culled from real-world experiences  and exercises. Because the Web site includes some sensitive information,  its registration process is limited to domestic users with \u201ca need to  know.\u201d Information on LLIS is organized through a number of \u201cfeatured  topics,\u201d such as critical infrastructure, exercise planning and program  management, and wild-land fires. Materials are also organized by  numerous \u201cdisciplines\u201d that have an emergency management focus such as  emergency communications, mass care and human services, mortuary  services, as well as search and rescue.", "While LLIS does contain materials relating to recovery, the issue is neither  a featured topic nor a discipline, making it challenging to access recovery- related information in an easy or intuitive way. Additionally, the message  boards that allow LLIS users to discuss a variety of homeland security  topics are rarely used to exchange information about recovery. For  example, while almost 600 messages have been exchanged on forums  discussing preparedness and response issues as of June 2009, only two  messages have been posted to the message board focused on disaster  recovery (and they were both from the same individual). A FEMA official  with responsibility for LLIS told us that there is an increasing recognition  that recovery is an underserved area of disaster management, and the  agency can see benefits of potentially including more information about  recovery in LLIS.", "To share lessons related to the mitigation phase, FEMA has created a  searchable online portfolio of case studies and best practices submitted by  individuals and communities describing the measures they have taken to  reduce the loss of life or property from future disasters. Communities that  have taken creative steps in implementing good mitigation practices can  submit those stories to FEMA where officials will review and possibly  include them in the online best practices portfolio.", "Unlike the information sharing mechanisms it has in place for the  preparedness, response, and mitigation phases of a disaster, FEMA does  not have a similar approach for sharing lessons focused on recovery.  Recovery lessons from specific disasters are sometimes available through  the FEMA Web site under the listings for specific disasters, although the  amount and nature of recovery information available this way varies  greatly. In addition, the Long-Term Community Recovery and ESF #14  Web site contains considerable information on recovery, but this site is  mostly dedicated to providing technical guidance for planning and does  not permit recovery officials to share lessons or learn about recovery best  practices. FEMA officials told us that that they plan to develop a document  compiling community-based best practices for disaster recovery, but they  do not know when it will be available.", "Perhaps more useful than the sharing of reports and other written  accounts of recovery lessons and experiences is the ability to directly  network with other recovery officials who can answer questions and relate  insights first-hand. In the course of our work, we learned of instances  where this type of personal connection was particularly valuable. For  example, a Watsonville, California, official told us of his efforts  immediately after the Loma Prieta earthquake to contact a local official in  southern California because he had read that the official had experienced  an earthquake a few years earlier and he wanted to solicit his guidance.  The official from southern California agreed to help and traveled to  Watsonville the next day to share his experiences and provide insights on  potential recovery strategies. In another example, when Hurricane Katrina  hit the Gulf Coast in 2005, officials from Grand Forks, North Dakota,  offered to help city leaders in Biloxi, Mississippi, based on their  experiences with the 1997 Grand Forks/Red River flood.", "Through one-on-one exchanges like these, state and local officials  involved in recovery can obtain tailored advice from individuals who have  addressed similar challenges themselves. For emergency managers  involved in the disaster preparedness and response phases, FEMA\u2019s LLIS  Web site has a network-building feature that can be used to foster this type  of exchange. LLIS provides its users with access to a directory of other  registered users that can be searched for a number of variables including  name, affiliation, and emergency management function (primarily  disciplines such as mass care and human services or public health). The  online directory mostly consists of officials and researchers involved in  various aspects of emergency management. Such a directory, or one  similar to it, might be very useful to recovery officials seeking to network  with, and learn from, others with experiences or expertise in disaster  recovery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Collaboration is essential for an effective partnership between the wide  range of participants involved in the disaster recovery process.

The city of Kobe completed its port restoration by March  1997 (see fig. 13). However, port activity stalled at around 80 percent of  pre-earthquake levels. In October 1998, exports from the port of Kobe to  Asian countries declined by 24.3 percent from the previous year. The  negative impact of damage to the local economy and regional exports, in  addition to the relocation of many container cargos to other ports during  the port of Kobe\u2019s closure contributed to its decline. Further, changing  trends in the international trade industry introduced increased  competition from other Asian ports. As a result of these factors, the port of  Kobe has not fully recovered. For example, while the port ranked 6th in  the world for volume in 1994, it dropped to the 24th position in 1995 and  the 33rd in 2006.", "Local industries, such as chemical and steel manufacturers as well as  small businesses, were also affected by the earthquake. Chemical and manufacturers did not operate for several months after the event. Large  companies, such as Kobe Steel and Mitsubishi Industries, were able to  map out effective recovery strategies and were less affected by the  earthquake. On the other hand, smaller industries, also severely damaged  by the earthquake, were unable to recover as easily as the larger  manufacturers. For example, smaller businesses such as shoe  manufacturers, sake breweries, and roof-tile makers never fully recovered  from the earthquake.", "The city of Kobe took several actions to stimulate the local economy w mixed success. For example, Kobe established support systems for  affected businesses such as special no-interest loans and subsidies for th construction of temporary stores and factories. The city also created the  \u201cLuminaire,\u201d a festival of illuminated lights which began in the winter  following the earthquake to boost morale of local residents and to attract  tourists. In 2003, the event drew 28.1 million visitors, which increased the  number of tourists by 115 percent from pre-earthquake levels. However, ot have  not all of its efforts were successful. For example, the city did n e  enough funds to help all the small businesses that needed financial  assistance. Some small businesses could not recover from the earthquake  and closed.", "Recognizing the need to diversify Kobe\u2019s economy from its traditional port  and manufacturing businesses, the city took steps to attract and develop  several new industries. Kobe recognized that it could benefit from new  infrastructure projects to change the industrial base of the city. Soon after  the disaster occurred, the city conducted a study to assess economic  conditions in Kobe. This study showed that although some of the  economic challenges the city faced were a result of the earthquake, a more  fundamental problem was Kobe\u2019s continued reliance on \u201cold economy\u201d  industries, such as shipbuilding, steel, and shoe manufacturing. With this  information, the city, in coordination with Hyogo prefecture, targeted new  industries\u2014such as medical, pharmaceutical, robotics, and information  technology companies\u2014to establish businesses in the region.", "To attract companies from these targeted industries, the city of Kobe and  Hyogo prefecture offered loans, subsidies, tax incentives, and inexpensive  office space. Further, these jurisdictions proposed reductions in existing  government regulations for the medical and information technology  sectors. These plans allowed foreign researchers to work in Kobe without  overly rigorous visa regulations. Additionally, the city sought to remove  regulations that prevented foreign firms from participating in the medical  industry and thereby encourage the entry of foreign researchers and  business persons. Overall, Kobe and Hyogo achieved success in  diversifying its economy. About 10 years after the earthquake, over 285  new companies moved to the city, 40 of which were foreign firms.  Additionally, six public facilities\u2014including centers for business,  developmental biology, and heath care\u2014had relocated to the city  as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Infrastructure", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Grand Forks/Red River Flood", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disaster Impacts", "paragraphs": ["The 1997 Grand Forks/Red River flood devastated Grand Fo Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota.

The city also developed several projects which  incorporated mitigation techniques so those structures would be better  prepared for a future flood. For example, the city changed the design of a  convention center by raising the main event arena space of a convention  center to ground level to mitigate against future flooding.
