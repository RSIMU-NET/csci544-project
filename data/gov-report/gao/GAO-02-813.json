The 16 percent of children who are enrolled in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program public insurance programs generally have coverage for a wide range of mental health benefits, and those enrolled in Medicaid are not subject to day or visit restrictions. Beyond providing insurance that can give children access to mental health services, a range of federal programs can help children who have experienced trauma obtain needed services.

If children who  have experienced trauma do not receive the care they need, these problems  can continue into adulthood.", "Large numbers of children are at risk for trauma-related mental health  problems. The Department of Justice reported in 1997 that almost 9 million  children aged 12 to 17 had witnessed serious violence during their  lifetimes; Justice has also reported that during the period of 1993 through  1998, children under the age of 12 resided in 43 percent of households  where intimate partner violence was known to have occurred. Further, the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that about  826,000 children and adolescents were found to be victims of abuse and  neglect in 1999.", "In response to your request for information on the ability of children who  have experienced trauma to obtain mental health services, this report  addresses (1) the extent to which private health insurance and the primary  public programs that insure children\u2013-Medicaid and the State Children\u2019s  Health Insurance Program (SCHIP)\u2013-cover mental health services needed  by children exposed to traumatic events and (2) other federal programs  that help children who have experienced trauma receive needed mental  health services. As requested, we are also providing national data that are  available through federal agency sources on the incidence of child abuse  and neglect, sexual assault, rape, intimate partner violence, and children\u2019s  witnessing such violence. (See app. II.)", "To determine the extent of private and public insurance coverage of mental  health services for children, we reviewed available employer survey data;  reviewed the benefit design of health plans provided by 13 insurers in the  individual market as well as state Medicaid programs and SCHIP programs;  and interviewed representatives of private insurers and public officials in  California, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Utah. We  selected these states on the basis of variation in the number of  beneficiaries covered, in geographic location, in the extent to which the  insurance market is regulated, and in the design of the SCHIP program. To  describe other federal programs that can help pay for mental health  services for children who have experienced trauma or that try to ensure  that these children receive needed services, we reviewed grant program  documents obtained from officials of federal agencies, such as HHS,  Justice, the Department of Education, and the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), and interviewed agency officials and  representatives of national health care and child advocacy organizations.  To gather information on services provided to children and on problems in  obtaining needed services, we reviewed the relevant literature and  contacted state and local mental health agencies, state crime victim  compensation and assistance agencies, child welfare and protective service  agencies, and other organizations receiving federal grants in California and  Massachusetts, as well as additional service providers with federal grants  in Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and Oregon. The programs and efforts we  discuss in this report do not represent an exhaustive list of all federally  funded programs that can address the mental health needs of children  exposed to traumatic events; they highlight a range of programs that target  varied populations, services, and systems that come into contact with this  population. In addition, we obtained data on child abuse and neglect,  intimate partner violence, and sexual assault that were collected and  analyzed by HHS\u2019s Administration for Children and Families (ACF) and  Justice\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics, National Institute of Justice, and  Federal Bureau of Investigation. We did not verify the accuracy of these  data.

In 1999, according to the  most recent edition of a joint Justice and Education report, students aged  12 through 18 were victims of about 186,000 violent crimes at school and  about 476,000 violent crimes away from school. In addition, thousands of  children have been exposed to natural disasters or terrorist acts such as  those that occurred on September 11, 2001, placing them at risk for mental  health problems. While many children respond to these situations with  resilience, others suffer acute and chronic effects. Children\u2019s reactions to  trauma may appear immediately after the traumatic event or may appear  days, weeks, months, or even years later. Researchers report that children  who experience traumatic events show a wide range of reactions, and their  nature and intensity vary on the basis of factors such as the type and  frequency of trauma, whether a child knew the offender or victim, the  strength of the family support system, and a child\u2019s sex and age. For  example, children age 5 and younger typically react to traumatic events  with crying, screaming, and fear of being separated from a parent, while  adolescents tend to have reactions similar to adults, such as flashbacks,  nightmares, and suicidal thoughts. A child\u2019s reactions to traumatic events,  including disasters, may also vary based on how well their parents cope  with the situation and on whether a child or parent has a preexisting mental  disorder. Some children have a special vulnerability to the impact of  traumatic events. Studies indicate that the impact is likely to be greatest for  a child who had previously been victimized or already had a mental health  problem.", "Certain psychiatric diagnoses are associated with exposure to traumatic  events, including acute stress disorder, PTSD, depression, and conduct  disorder. Children with acute stress disorder can display multiple  symptoms, including reexperiencing of the event, avoidance of situations  that remind them of the traumatic event, sleep disturbances, poor  concentration, and regressive behavior. The disorder is of short duration,  with symptoms beginning within 4 weeks of a traumatic experience and  lasting from 2 days to 4 weeks. If symptoms continue, the diagnosis may be  reevaluated and changed to PTSD. PTSD is similar to acute stress disorder  and shares many of the same symptoms, but lasts longer. It is diagnosed  when symptoms persist more than a month, although the disorder may  develop either immediately after a traumatic event or several months later.  Exposure to traumatic events may also result in depression, which is  generally characterized by changes in appetite, sleep disturbances,  constant sadness, and irritability. Conduct disorder may also develop after  experiencing a traumatic event. The disorder is identified by a persistent  pattern of behavior that violates major age-appropriate societal norms,  such as aggression toward people and animals or destruction of property.", "The prevalence of different diagnoses varies based on factors such as age  and sex. For example, a preliminary report on how the September 11, 2001,  attack affected New York City public school students found that children in  grades 4 and 5 were more likely than children in grades 6 to 12 to  experience PTSD and other disorders involving intense fear and avoidance  of usual activities, while the older children were more likely to have  conduct disorder or depression. Similarly, girls had higher rates of PTSD,  depression, and generalized anxiety than boys, who had higher rates of  conduct disorder.", "Depending on the nature and severity of a traumatized child\u2019s condition, a  variety of mental health treatment options and service settings may be  recommended. These include outpatient individual, family, or group  therapy; inpatient hospital care; and residential care. A range of service  providers, including psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses,  counselors, and clinical social workers, may treat children who have  experienced trauma. Optimal care of these children often requires  participation by a variety of service systems, such as mental health and  social services.", "The Surgeon General has reported that there are not enough mental health  professionals trained to work with children. Moreover, trauma experts  report that even professionals who are trained to work with children may  not have specialized training or experience in working with children who  have experienced trauma. Children whose families do not speak English  can have a particularly difficult time finding providers who can assist them.", "Because the types of trauma that children experience vary considerably,  numerous pathways can lead to the identification, referral, assessment, and  treatment of traumatized children needing mental health services. These  pathways include families; schools; day care; primary health care; and the  law enforcement, juvenile justice, and child protective services systems.  However, the professionals working in these systems may not be trained to  identify children with trauma-related mental health problems. For example,  a recent report by the Surgeon General noted that primary care providers  often have little training on mental health services and vary in their  capacity to recognize and diagnose disorders and to coordinate with  mental health providers. In addition, the Institute of Medicine recently  concluded that health professionals are not sufficiently educated about  family violence. Further, not all teachers are aware of the connection  between academic or behavioral problems and the possibility that they are  related to a child\u2019s exposure to violence. Justice has also reported that law  enforcement personnel are generally not sufficiently aware of the  psychological effects that witnessing violence can have on children.", "At the national level, few data are available on the number of children who  need mental health services as a result of exposure to trauma and the  number who receive services. For example, there are no nationwide data  on the number of children in foster care and the juvenile justice system\u2014 populations likely to have been exposed to trauma\u2014who need mental  health care, or on the number who have received treatment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private and Public Health Insurance Coverage for Children", "paragraphs": ["Access to health care services, including mental health services, is highly  correlated to having health insurance coverage. According to March 2001  Current Population Survey data, over 67 million children nationwide have  health insurance coverage. More than two-thirds of children under age 19\u2014 almost 54 million\u2014obtain health insurance privately, either as a dependent  under a parent\u2019s or guardian\u2019s employer-sponsored health plan or through  the individual insurance market. In addition, almost 14 million children are  enrolled in public programs such as Medicaid, SCHIP, or other federal  insurance programs. Although most children have insurance coverage, over  9 million remain uninsured. (See table 1.)", "Despite widespread health insurance coverage of children, private health  insurance plans historically included greater restrictions on mental health  benefits than on benefits for other health services. Consequently, federal  and state laws have attempted to partially equalize benefit levels. The  federal Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 (MHPA) prohibits certain group  health plans sponsored by employers with more than 50 employees from  imposing annual or lifetime dollar limits on mental health benefits that are  more restrictive than those imposed on other benefits. As of March 2000,  more than half of the states had also passed laws that exceeded the federal  law by requiring that certain health insurers not only have parity in dollar  limits, but also in service limits and cost-sharing provisions. However,  these state mental health parity provisions do not affect employers who  pay their employees\u2019 health expenses directly rather than by purchasing  insurance. Federal law permits states to regulate insurance, but employers\u2019  self-funded health plans, which covered almost half of all employees  enrolled in employer-sponsored plans in 1999, are not affected by such  state insurance regulations.", "Medicaid operates as a joint federal-state program to finance health care  coverage for certain categories of low-income individuals. Within  guidelines established by federal law, states have considerable flexibility in  how they structure their programs, including determining eligibility levels  and what benefits to cover. For example, federal law requires states to offer  Medicaid coverage to children age 5 and under if their family incomes are  at or below 133 percent of the federal poverty level and to children ages 6  to 18 if their family incomes are at or below the federal poverty level. To  offer coverage to additional children, many states have set family income  eligibility thresholds beyond these minimum federal levels.", "Benefits covered by state Medicaid programs are either mandatory or  optional. For example, states are required to cover EPSDT services, which  include comprehensive, periodic health and developmental evaluations or  screenings. A state must cover any services necessary to treat physical and  mental conditions detected through these screenings, regardless of  whether the services are covered by the state\u2019s Medicaid program. We  have previously reported that the extent to which children actually receive  EPSDT services is not fully known, largely because no reliable, national  utilization data exist for these services. States also have the option to  provide beneficiaries with a number of other services, such as inpatient  psychiatric and psychological services. HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that oversees Medicaid and  SCHIP programs, does not have current data that comprehensively  summarize the extent to which states cover mental health services;  however, other available sources suggest that the majority of states provide  some level of mental health coverage as an optional benefit.", "In 1997, the Congress enacted SCHIP to provide health care coverage to  low-income children living in families whose incomes exceed the eligibility  limits for Medicaid. Although SCHIP is generally targeted to families with  incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, each state  may set its own income eligibility limits within certain guidelines. As a  result, SCHIP maximum income eligibility levels vary considerably among  states, ranging from 100 to 350 percent of the federal poverty level. States  have three options in designing SCHIP: expand their Medicaid programs,  develop separate child health programs that function independently of the  Medicaid programs, or do a combination of both. States that implement  SCHIP by expanding Medicaid must use Medicaid\u2019s enrollment structures  and benefit packages (including EPSDT services); in contrast, separate  SCHIP programs may depart from Medicaid requirements for benefits and  for the plans, providers, and delivery systems available.

In addition to CMS, these agencies include ACF, the  Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Indian Health  Service, and SAMHSA. In addition, the National Institutes of Health, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Agency for Health  Care Research and Quality fund research on a range of topics related to  child victims and trauma, including the effects of trauma on children and  interventions to assist children who have experienced trauma.

While children enrolled in private insurance plans often face  limitations in their mental health coverage, such as the exclusion of certain  diagnoses from coverage or limits on the number of covered visits for  outpatient therapy, children in Medicaid and SCHIP programs generally  have coverage for a wide range of mental health services. The typically  broader coverage of Medicaid programs and SCHIP programs that are  Medicaid expansions is largely due to these programs being required to  cover all necessary health care for problems detected through an EPSDT  screening.

For example, in a prior survey of  nearly 900 employers, we found that 87 percent of employer plans  complied with the dollar parity requirements of the MHPA but set other  limits that were not prohibited by MHPA, such as the number of allowable  outpatient visits or inpatient days for mental health treatment. In contrast,  few plans imposed limits on hospital days or office visits for health  conditions not related to mental health. In addition, a survey conducted by  Mercer/Foster Higgins of 2,813 employers that sponsor health plans found  that at least 73 percent of preferred provider organization (PPO), point of  service (POS), and health maintenance organization (HMO) health plans  offered by employers with more than 500 employees imposed annual limits  on mental health services. These plans most commonly imposed day and  visit limits on mental health services, with median limits of 30 inpatient  days and 30 outpatient visits per year. (See table 2.) Although for some  children these service levels are sufficient, these limits may not provide  adequate coverage for some traumatized children who require long-term  mental health treatment.", "Limitations in mental health coverage are more pronounced for the over  3 million children covered by individual insurance plans. Unless precluded  by state law, mental health benefits in the individual market can be more  restrictive than other benefits in such areas as annual or lifetime dollar  limits on what the plan will pay and service limits, such as fewer covered  hospital days or outpatient office visits. The individual market may also  have higher cost-sharing, such as deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance.  We found such limitations among individual health plans we reviewed. For  example, one insurer imposed a lifetime limit of $10,000 on mental health  benefits, while another insurer that sells individual health plans in nearly 40  states includes mental health coverage only if required by state law.  Another insurer limited annual mental health coverage to $1,500 for each  member. (See app. IV for a summary of differences in individual market  health plan coverage for certain mental health treatments available to  children in six states.) In addition, few states require insurers in the  individual market to guarantee access to health insurance coverage for  people with mental disorders, leaving some children unable to obtain any  health insurance.

For example, all six states provided children with coverage for diagnostic  assessments, outpatient therapy, medication management, and mental  health treatment in residential care facilities, and did not impose day or  visit limits or cost-sharing requirements. In addition to specified mental  health services, Medicaid requires states to cover all necessary health  treatment services when a health problem that could affect a child\u2019s  development is detected during an EPSDT screening, regardless of whether  the condition or treatment is explicitly covered by the state\u2019s Medicaid  program.  A required element of an EPSDT screening is a comprehensive  history, which is supposed to include an assessment of a child\u2019s mental  health needs. Although many states have developed recommended  screening protocols for health care providers to complete on specified  schedules, CMS defines screenings very broadly and considers any  encounter with a health care provider to be a screening sufficient to  identify and require the provision of needed services.", "One mental health service that can be important to families of children who  have experienced trauma is respite care. Although respite care is not a  mandatory Medicaid service, states may use flexibility available under the  Medicaid statute to cover respite services, such as child care and weekend  group home services, in order to provide some relief for an eligible child\u2019s  parent, guardian, or primary caregiver. By providing a temporary period  of time apart for parents and their children, respite care services can  decrease stress in the family and increase the likelihood that a child with a  mental illness can continue to live at home and avoid placement in an  institution. However, only one of the six state Medicaid programs we  reviewed\u2014Minnesota\u2014explicitly covered respite services for some  children with mental illness.", "Despite having mental health coverage, children enrolled in Medicaid may  face constraints when they attempt to obtain covered services. For  example, children may have difficulty finding providers to treat their  mental health needs. Officials in the six states we reviewed said that their  states had shortages of mental health providers, especially child  psychiatrists, and that these shortages were particularly acute in rural  areas. In addition, some providers said that low Medicaid reimbursement  rates, coupled with delayed payments from states, discourage providers  from participating in Medicaid. Although not specifically focused on mental  health services, studies have compared Medicaid fee-for-service  reimbursement rates to Medicare and have shown that Medicaid rates are  significantly lower.

For example, SCHIP  beneficiaries in Minnesota have coverage for the same unlimited mental  health benefits as Medicaid beneficiaries and are not responsible for any  out-of-pocket costs. Similarly, the SCHIP benefits of Illinois, Georgia, and  Massachusetts generally mirror the benefits available under their state  Medicaid programs, albeit with limited cost-sharing that Medicaid does not  require. For example, Georgia families must pay a premium of $7.50 per  month for each child over age six, with a monthly limit of $15 per family.  Similarly, families in Illinois with incomes over 150 percent of the federal  poverty level must pay $5 for each outpatient or inpatient mental health  visit and a monthly premium of $15 for one child, $25 for two children, and  $30 for three children.", "SCHIP children in California diagnosed with severe emotional disturbance are eligible for  these services through the county mental health departments.", "Unlike California and Utah, whose SCHIP programs are largely modeled after private  insurance plans, states that elect to expand their Medicaid programs, such as Minnesota,  must offer the same comprehensive benefit package, including EPSDT services, to SCHIP  beneficiaries as they do to Medicaid beneficiaries.

State-reported data are often  untimely or inaccurate, particularly in states where children receive  services through managed care plans that are prospectively paid on a  capitated basis, meaning the plans receive a flat payment per member,  regardless of the cost of treating the patient. Moreover, states are not  required to report mental health services provided under the EPSDT  program. Limitations in other CMS data reporting requirements also make  it difficult for the agency to determine the extent to which children are  receiving mental health services.

These experts told us, for  example, that in the case of the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah  Federal Building in Oklahoma City, the time frame was not sufficient to  find, assess the mental health needs of, and provide assistance to the large  number of children and adults who needed help. Although FEMA extended  total grant funding to about 33 months, crisis counseling services were still  needed after the funds had finally expired. As a result, Justice provided an  additional $264,000 to Oklahoma\u2019s Project Heartland to fund crisis  counseling services needed by individuals with problems stemming from  the bombing. Because there was a resurgence of mental health problems  during the federal bombing trials, Justice also provided about $235,000 to  help provide victims and other family members with needed crisis  counseling services.

Furthermore, in  most states when there are multiple victims of a crime, they typically must  share the available overall maximum benefits. However, each family  member or secondary victim is typically eligible for mental health  counseling benefits up to specified caps, which generally apply to  individuals and do not have to be shared. For example, the total maximum  compensation in California for all victims of a crime is $70,000, with a  $10,000 cap on mental health services for all direct victims, and Minnesota\u2019s  total maximum award limit is $50,000, with a $7,500 cap on mental health  services.

Nonetheless, California and Illinois victim  compensation officials said that based on their analyses of claimant rolls  and crime victim statistics in their states, they believe that many potentially  eligible victims who could benefit from the assistance their programs offer  had not applied for compensation.

However, victims of some crimes, such as sexual  assault or domestic violence, may not report the crimes immediately and  may be apprehensive about cooperating with authorities due to fear of  retaliation by the offender. Other program barriers identified by state  program managers surveyed for the report included (1) limited outreach  and education, especially to racially and ethnically diverse populations and  to rural communities, (2) lengthy and complex compensation award  determination and payment processes, and (3) insufficient coordination  between state victim compensation and victim assistance programs and  with other agencies that work with these victims to eliminate gaps in  assistance or duplicative services.", "Efforts to address some of these problems are under way in the states we  contacted.

Others, however, require mental health services to help them  cope and minimize long-term psychological, emotional, or developmental  difficulties. While most children have health insurance that covers mental  health services to varying degrees, coverage limitations are common and  may constrain children\u2019s ability to obtain care. Numerous federal grant  programs could expand the number of children whose mental health  services may be reimbursed or help increase the available services in a  community, but some children who need services may not benefit from  such programs. For example, some grants are awarded to a relatively small  number of communities and expire after a defined period, and evidence  suggests that families of some children who are eligible to benefit from  Justice\u2019s victim compensation and assistance programs may not be aware  of the programs.", "The effectiveness of federal programs that could help children who have  experienced trauma remains largely unknown. Some programs with  planned evaluations, such as the Greenbook Project, have lagged in  establishing their evaluation frameworks. SAMHSA\u2019s recent National Child  Traumatic Stress Initiative, which focuses specifically on the mental health  needs of these children, intends to evaluate the results of grantee projects  and the overall program. This effort could develop information on ways to  effectively provide mental health services to traumatized children, but  because the initiative is new, it is too early to gauge its success. Justice\u2019s  current evaluation of its Crime Victim Compensation and Crime Victim  Assistance programs should provide some information on the experience  of child victims in using the victim compensation program to obtain needed  mental health services, but may provide less information on children\u2019s  ability to obtain mental health services through the victim assistance  program. FEMA and SAMHSA have not evaluated the effectiveness of the  long-standing disaster crisis counseling program and have no immediate  plans to conduct a programwide evaluation. Without evaluations of the  effectiveness of federal programs that have a clear goal of helping children  who experienced trauma to obtain mental health services, federal  managers and policymakers lack information that would help them assess  which federal efforts are successful; determine which programs could be  improved, expanded, or replicated; and effectively allocate resources to  identify and meet additional service needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that, to provide federal policymakers and program  managers with additional information on federal grant programs serving  children who have experienced disaster-related trauma, the Director of  FEMA work with the Administrator of SAMHSA to evaluate the  effectiveness of the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program,  including its assistance to children who need mental health services as the  result of a disaster."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to four federal departments and agencies  for their review.

We have  modified the report, as appropriate, in response to written general and  technical comments.", "In general, HHS stated that the report will be a useful tool for policymakers  and brings important attention to the needs of children exposed to  traumatic events. HHS and FEMA both agreed with our description of the  Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program and with our  conclusions on the importance of evaluating the program\u2019s effectiveness.  HHS stated that it strongly agreed that evaluation activities are critical for  this program and other child trauma programs to ensure program  effectiveness and the appropriate use of resources. Both agencies said they  have begun, or plan to take steps, to engage in additional evaluation  activities, and HHS commented that it plans to continue ongoing evaluation  efforts to assure that services are appropriate, efficient, and responsive to  the needs of disaster victims. At their request, we modified the report to  reflect additional information the agencies provided on current evaluation  activities. However, neither the FEMA and HHS activities that we described  nor those that they cited in their comments constitute the programwide  evaluation of the program\u2019s effectiveness that we are recommending.  Furthermore, FEMA did not indicate in its response whether it intends to  implement our recommendation to coordinate with SAMHSA to conduct  such an evaluation, which is needed to help federal policymakers and  program managers assess whether the Crisis Counseling Assistance and  Training Program is effectively assisting children who have experienced  disaster-related trauma.", "HHS said that the draft report emphasized the lack of data on the  prevalence of children exposed to trauma and their mental health needs  but did not discuss National Institutes of Health and National Institute of  Mental Health research data, including data from nationally representative  surveys. The types of research studies HHS referred to in its comments  generally focus on specific communities or certain defined populations,  and existing nationwide surveys have limitations such as not covering  certain age ranges or addressing the full range of traumatic situations that  children may experience.  Appendix II of our draft report included ACF\u2019s  nationwide data on children who have been abused and neglected and the  number of those who received mental health services. However, for other  kinds of trauma, there are few nationwide data estimating the number of  children who need mental health services due to these traumas and the  number who receive services.", "HHS suggested that the report should more fully discuss the availability of  providers trained to help children who have experienced trauma. The  department said the country does not have a child mental health workforce  with the capacity to meet the needs of children and that responding to  PTSD in children requires even more specific training. The draft report did  refer to workforce issues that could affect children\u2019s access to needed  mental health services, and we have included additional information in  response to HHS\u2019s comments. A detailed discussion of workforce issues,  however, was not within the scope of this report. HHS also expressed  concern that the report did not discuss the need for more research on  specific mental disorders and effective treatments, the stigma often  associated with mental health problems and its effect on the delivery of  mental health services to children who have experienced trauma, or  problems in the public mental health system. We agree that these are  important issues and modified the report to acknowledge the potential role  of stigma. However, a detailed discussion of these issues was also outside  the scope of this report.", "HHS further commented that the report should contain a more thorough  discussion of HRSA\u2019s grants to help meet the mental health needs of  children. Appendix VI of the draft report described several HRSA grants,  including the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant. Based on the  department\u2019s comments, we modified the appendix to describe additional  HRSA grants.", "HHS acknowledged that the report provides information on the limits  insurance plans often place on mental health coverage, but said that the  draft report did not address the ramifications of mental health parity. We  added clarification that the federal mental health parity law does not  require group health plans to offer mental health benefits, but otherwise  believe the report provides ample information on the limits of federal and  state mental health parity laws.", "Education concurred with the information discussed in the report.

These states were  selected on the basis of variation in the number of beneficiaries covered, in  geographic location, in the extent to which the insurance market is  regulated, and in the design of the SCHIP program. For information on the  extent to which employers offer mental health benefits to employees, as  well as the conditions under which coverage is made available, we relied  on private employer benefit surveys conducted in 2001, specifically those  of (1) William M. Mercer, Incorporated (formerly produced by Foster  Higgins) and (2) the Health Research and Educational Trust, sponsored by  the Kaiser Family Foundation. These surveys are distinguished from a  number of other private ones largely because of their random samples,  which allow their results to be generalized to a larger population of  employers.", "For the mental health services covered by private individual market  insurers, we interviewed state insurance regulators in each of the six states  to learn about state laws related to the provision of mental health benefits  and to identify the insurers in the individual market in the state. We then  reviewed the benefit designs of popular health plans sold in the individual  market. To obtain information about the mental health coverage of the  public insurance programs in these states, we reviewed state Medicaid and  SCHIP plans, which specified program characteristics, including covered  benefits and limitations, and we interviewed program officials to obtain  information on income eligibility and service delivery models. In several of  the states, we also interviewed Mental Health Department officials,  providers, and consumer advocates.", "To identify federal programs that help children who have experienced  trauma receive mental health services, we reviewed the Catalog of Federal  Domestic Assistance. After identifying programs, we interviewed and  collected information from federal program officials to confirm whether  these programs can support activities, such as mental health treatment,  screening and referral services, educational outreach, training for medical  and other professionals on the needs of children exposed to trauma, and  research and evaluation of mental health services. The federal program  officials also identified other programs and efforts that can address the  mental health needs of children exposed to trauma and provided  perspectives on barriers to these children receiving mental health services.  We obtained additional information on grants that appeared to be most  relevant to the population discussed in this report. The programs and  efforts we discuss in this report do not represent an exhaustive list of all  federally funded programs that can address the mental health needs of  children exposed to trauma; they highlight a range of programs that target  varied populations, services, and systems that come into contact with this  population. We report that these programs can provide mental health  services to this population because funds may be used for this purpose. We  were not generally able to obtain information on the nature of the services  provided or the level of service used by children exposed to trauma  because some programs we identified do not collect information  specifically on mental health services provided to children exposed to  trauma.", "We obtained additional information on selected federally supported  programs and problems children face in obtaining needed mental health  services through site visits in California and Massachusetts. In these states,  we interviewed officials or obtained data from state and local mental health  agencies, state crime victim compensation and assistance programs, child  welfare and protective service agencies, and other organizations receiving  federal grants. We also contacted service providers with federal grants  located in Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and Oregon.
