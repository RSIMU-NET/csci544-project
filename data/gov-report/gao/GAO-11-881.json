Most notably, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began operations in 2003 with key missions that included preventing terrorist attacks from occurring in the United States, and minimizing the damages from any attacks that may occur. DHS is now the third-largest federal department, with more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $50 billion. Since 2003, GAO has issued over 1,000 products on DHS's operations in such areas as border and transportation security and emergency management, among others. As requested, this report addresses DHS's progress in implementing its homeland security missions since it began operations, work remaining, and issues affecting implementation efforts. This report is based on GAO's past and ongoing work, supplemented with DHS Office of Inspector General reports, with an emphasis on reports issued since 2008. GAO also analyzed information provided by DHS in July and August 2011 on recent actions taken in response to prior work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since it began operations in 2003, DHS has implemented key homeland security operations and achieved important goals and milestones in many areas to create and strengthen a foundation to reach its potential. As it continues to mature, however, more work remains for DHS to address gaps and weaknesses in its current operational and implementation efforts, and to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of those efforts to achieve its full potential. DHS's accomplishments include developing strategic and operational plans; deploying workforces; and establishing new, or expanding existing, offices and programs. For example, DHS (1) issued plans to guide its efforts, such as the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, which provides a framework for homeland security, and the National Response Framework, which outlines disaster response guiding principles; (2) successfully hired, trained, and deployed workforces, such as a federal screening workforce to assume security screening responsibilities at airports nationwide; and (3) created new programs and offices to implement its homeland security responsibilities, such as establishing the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team to help coordinate efforts to address cybersecurity threats. Such accomplishments are noteworthy given that DHS has had to work to transform itself into a fully functioning department while implementing its missions--a difficult undertaking that can take years to achieve. While DHS has made progress, its transformation remains high risk due to its management challenges. Examples of progress made and work remaining include: Border security. DHS implemented the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology program to verify the identities of foreign visitors entering and exiting the country by processing biometric and biographic information. However, DHS has not yet determined how to implement a biometric exit capability and has taken action to address a small portion of the estimated overstay population in the United States (individuals who legally entered the country but then overstayed their authorized periods of admission). Aviation security. DHS developed and implemented Secure Flight, a program for screening airline passengers against terrorist watchlist records. DHS also developed new programs and technologies to screen passengers, checked baggage, and air cargo. However, DHS does not yet have a plan for deploying checked baggage screening technologies to meet recently enhanced explosive detection requirements, a mechanism to verify the accuracy of data to help ensure that air cargo screening is being conducted at reported levels, or approved technology to screen cargo once it is loaded onto a pallet or container. Emergency preparedness and response. DHS issued the National Preparedness Guidelines that describe a national framework for capabilities-based preparedness, and a Target Capabilities List to provide a national-level generic model of capabilities defining all-hazards preparedness. DHS is also finalizing a National Disaster Recovery Framework, and awards preparedness grants based on a reasonable risk methodology. However, DHS needs to strengthen its efforts to assess capabilities for all-hazards preparedness, and develop a long-term recovery structure to better align timing and involvement with state and local governments' capacity. Chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats. DHS assessed risks posed by CBRN threats and deployed capabilities to detect CBRN threats. However, DHS should work to improve its coordination of CBRN risk assessments, and identify monitoring mechanisms for determining progress made in implementing the global nuclear detection strategy. GAO's work identified three themes at the foundation of DHS's challenges. This report contains no new recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nation is about to pass the 10-year anniversary of the September 11,  2001, terrorist attacks. The events of that day led to profound changes in  government agendas, policies, and structures to confront homeland  security threats facing the nation. Most notably, in the aftermath of the  attacks, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created with  key missions that include preventing terrorist attacks from occurring within  the United States, reducing U.S. vulnerability to terrorism, minimizing  resulting damages, and helping the nation recover from any attacks that  may occur. The 10-year anniversary of 9/11 provides an opportunity to  reflect on the progress DHS has made since its establishment and  challenges it has faced in implementing its missions, as well as to identify  issues that will be important for the department to address as it moves  forward, based on work we have completed on DHS programs and  operations in key areas.", "The creation of DHS was an enormous management challenge,  representing the fusion of 22 agencies, and the size, complexity, and  importance of the effort made the challenge especially daunting and  critical to the nation\u2019s security. DHS is now the third-largest federal  department, with more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget of  more than $50 billion. Since DHS began operations in March 2003, the  department developed and refined the implementation of various policies  and programs to address its homeland security missions as well as its  nonhomeland security functions. In particular, DHS implemented  programs to secure the border and administer the immigration system;  strengthen the security of the transportation sector; and prepare for and  respond to terrorist threats and natural disasters. DHS also took actions  to strengthen and better integrate its management functions and to  transform its component agencies into a unified cabinet-level department.", "We have evaluated numerous departmental programs and activities since  DHS began its operations in 2003 and issued over 1,000 reports and  congressional testimony in such areas as border security and  immigration; transportation security; and emergency management,  among others. We have made approximately 1,500 recommendations to  DHS designed to improve its operations, such as to improve performance  measurement efforts; strengthen management processes, including  acquisition processes; enhance coordination and information sharing; and  increase the use of risk information in planning and resource allocation  decisions, as well as to address other key themes that have affected  DHS\u2019s implementation efforts. DHS has implemented about half of these  recommendations, has actions underway to address others, and has  taken additional steps to strengthen its mission activities. However, we  reported that the department has much to do to ensure that it conducts its  missions efficiently and effectively while simultaneously preparing to  address future challenges that face the department and the nation.  Addressing these challenges will likely become increasingly complex as  domestic and world events unfold, and will be particularly challenging in  light of the current fiscal environment and constrained budgets.", "In 2003, we designated the implementation and transformation of DHS as  high risk because it represented an enormous undertaking that would  require time to achieve in an effective and efficient manner. Additionally,  the components that merged to form DHS already faced a wide array of  existing challenges, and any DHS failure to effectively carry out its  mission could expose the nation to potentially serious consequences. The  area has remained on our high-risk list since 2003. Our prior work on  mergers and organizational transformations, undertaken before the  creation of DHS, found that successful transformations of large  organizations, even those faced with less strenuous reorganizations than  DHS, can take years to achieve. Most recently, in our 2011 high-risk  update, we reported that DHS took action to implement, transform, and  integrate its management functions, actions that directly affect its ability to  meet its homeland security and other missions. For example, senior  leaders at the department, including the Secretary and Deputy Secretary  of Homeland Security, demonstrated strong commitment and support to  addressing this high-risk area by, among other things, designating the  Under Secretary for Management to be responsible for coordinating  DHS\u2019s efforts to address this high-risk area, as well as other senior  officials to be responsible for implementing corrective actions within each  management function. Moreover, in January 2011 DHS developed a  strategy for addressing existing integration and management issues and  is in the early stages of its implementation. DHS provided an update to  the strategy in June 2011 that detailed plans and status updates designed  to integrate and strengthen its management functions. We plan to provide  the department with feedback on this update later this year. Moving  forward, we reported that DHS will need to continue to implement its high- risk strategy and efforts to identify and acquire resources needed to  address its risks, monitor and validate its corrective actions, and show  measurable, sustainable progress in achieving key outcomes.  Demonstrated, sustainable progress will be critical to helping DHS  strengthen and integrate management functions within and across the  department and its components.", "In February 2010, DHS issued its first Quadrennial Homeland Security  Review (QHSR) report, outlining a strategic framework for homeland  security to guide the activities of the department and its homeland  security partners, including federal, state, local, and tribal government  agencies; the private sector; and nongovernmental organizations. The  report identified five homeland security missions\u2014Preventing Terrorism  and Enhancing Security; Securing and Managing Our Borders; Enforcing  and Administering Our Immigration Laws; Safeguarding and Securing  Cyberspace; and Ensuring Resilience to Disasters\u2014and goals and  objectives to be achieved within each mission. In addition to the QHSR  report, in July 2010 DHS issued a report on the results of its Bottom-Up  Review (BUR), a departmentwide assessment to align DHS\u2019s  programmatic activities, such as investigating drug smuggling and  inspecting cargo at ports of entry, and its organizational structure to the  missions and goals identified in the QHSR.", "In 2007, we reported on progress made by DHS in implementing its  mission and management functions by assessing actions DHS took to  achieve performance expectations within each function. We reported  that DHS made progress in implementing all of its mission and  management areas since it began operations, but progress among the  areas varied significantly. For example, we reported that DHS made more  progress in implementing its mission functions than its management  functions. Further, among its mission functions, we reported that in  implementing expectations, DHS made substantial progress in maritime  security; moderate progress in aviation and surface transportation  security, critical infrastructure protection, and immigration enforcement;  modest progress in border security and immigration services; and limited  progress in emergency preparedness and response missions. We also  reported on various crosscutting issues related to areas such as risk  management, partnerships and coordination, and performance  measurement, that had impeded DHS\u2019s implementation efforts. We  further noted that DHS generally had not established quantitative goals  and measures for assessing its performance and as a result, we could not  assess where along a spectrum of progress DHS stood in achieving its  missions. Subsequent to the issuance of this report, DHS continued to  take action to strengthen its operations and the management of the  department, including enhancing its performance measurement efforts.  Further, at the request of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs following the issuance of our report, we  provided DHS with feedback on the department\u2019s performance goals and  measures as DHS worked to better position itself to assess its results.  Our feedback ranged from pointing out components\u2019 limited use of  outcome-oriented performance measures to assess the results or  effectiveness of programs, to raising questions about the steps taken by  DHS or its components to ensure the reliability and verification of  performance data. Based on its internal review efforts and our feedback,  DHS took action to develop and revise its performance goals and  measures in an effort to strengthen its ability to assess its outcomes and  progress in key mission areas. For fiscal year 2011, DHS identified 85  strategic measures for assessing its progress in achieving its QHSR  missions and goals. The department plans to report on its results in  meeting established targets for these new measures at the end of the  fiscal year.", "You asked us to review the progress made by DHS in implementing its  homeland security missions since its creation after the September 11,  2001, terrorist attacks. This report addresses the following question: What  progress has DHS made in implementing its mission functions since it  began operations; what work, if any, remains; and what crosscutting and  management issues have affected DHS\u2019s implementation efforts?", "This report is based on our work on DHS since it began operations, and  supplemented with work completed by the DHS Office of Inspector  General (IG), with an emphasis on work completed since 2008, and  updated information and documentation provided by the department in  July and August 2011. It is also based on our ongoing work on key DHS  programs for various congressional committees, as noted throughout the  report. For this ongoing work, we examined program documentation and  interviewed agency officials, among other things. Our work and the work  of the DHS IG addressed many of DHS\u2019s programs, operations, and  activities. This report highlights our key work in these areas, but does not  address all products we and the DHS IG issued related to DHS, nor does  it address all of DHS\u2019s homeland security-related activities and efforts.", "To determine what progress DHS has made in implementing its mission  functions and what work, if any, remains, we identified 10 DHS functional  areas, which we define as categories or areas of DHS\u2019s homeland  security responsibilities. These functional areas are based on those areas  we identified for DHS in our August 2007 report on DHS\u2019s progress in  implementing its mission and management functions, and our analysis of  DHS\u2019s QHSR and budget documents, such as its congressional budget  justifications. These areas include: (1) aviation security; (2) chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats; (3) critical  infrastructure protection\u2014physical assets; (4) surface transportation  security; (5) border security; (6) maritime security; (7) immigration  enforcement; (8) immigration services; (9); critical infrastructure  protection\u2014cyber assets; and (10) emergency preparedness and  response. To identify sub-areas within these functional areas, we  identified performance expectations, which we define as composites of  the responsibilities or functions that the department is to achieve or  satisfy based on our analysis of requirements, responsibilities, and goals  set for the department by Congress, the administration, and DHS and its  components. In particular, we used expectations identified in our August  2007 report as a baseline, and updated or added to these expectations by  analyzing requirements and plans set forth in homeland security-related  laws, presidential directives and executive orders, national strategies  related to homeland security, and DHS\u2019s and components\u2019 strategic plans  and documents. We then grouped these expectations within each  functional area into broader sub-areas, as shown in appendix I. For  example, we identified administering grant programs for surface  transportation security as a performance expectation for DHS within the  grants sub-area of the surface transportation functional area. Further, we  then aligned our functional areas to the five QHSR missions based on our  review of the QHSR and BUR reports and DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget  documents, as shown in appendix II.", "To identify key areas of progress and work that remains in each functional  area, as well as crosscutting and management issues that have affected  DHS\u2019s implementation efforts, we examined our and the DHS IG\u2019s past  reports. We selected, in consultation with GAO subject matter experts,  key work we and the DHS IG have completed related to the functional  areas, sub-areas, and crosscutting issues. We examined the  methodologies used by the DHS IG in its reports, including reviewing the  scope, methodological steps, and limitations. We determined that the  DHS IG reports were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report to  provide examples, and to supplement our work, of DHS\u2019s progress and  work remaining. We identified crosscutting issues based on analysis of  our work in each functional mission area to determine common issues  that have affected DHS\u2019s implementation efforts across the various  mission areas.", "We obtained and incorporated feedback on our assessments from our  subject matter experts. In addition, we provided DHS with drafts of our  assessments of DHS progress and work remaining in each functional  area and crosscutting issue and obtained and analyzed updated  information provided by DHS on these areas. In some cases, DHS  provided us with updated data on its efforts, such as statistics on  technology deployments or program activities. We assessed the reliability  of these data by reviewing available documentation from DHS. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  report. We included updated information in our assessments, based on  our review of this information and our prior work. In some cases, we could  not make an assessment of the updated information DHS provided  because we did not have prior work upon which to base an assessment.  We noted these instances in our report.", "Our assessments of the progress made by DHS in functional areas and  sub-areas, as well as our analyses of crosscutting issues, are based  primarily on our reports, supplemented by reports of the DHS IG. As  such, the assessments of progress do not reflect, nor are they intended to  reflect, the extent to which DHS\u2019s actions have made the nation more  secure in each area. Further, we do not intend to imply that our  discussion of progress and work remaining in the functional areas and  sub-areas, considered separately or together, reflect DHS\u2019s progress in  implementing its missions. Instead, our assessments provide information  on progress made and work that remains in key functional areas on which  we have reported, as indicated by findings from our work, supplemented  by that of the DHS IG. In addition, because we and the DHS IG have  completed varying degrees of work (in terms of the amount and scope of  reviews completed) for each functional area, and because different DHS  components and offices provided us with different amounts and types of  information, our assessments of DHS\u2019s progress in each area reflect the  information available for our review and analysis and are not necessarily  equally comprehensive across all 10 areas. Further, for some sub-areas,  we were unable to make an assessment of DHS\u2019s progress because we  and the DHS IG have not conducted recent work in that area or have  conducted limited work. Additionally, DHS developed other performance  measures against which to gauge its progress in fiscal year 2011, but has  not yet reported on these measures. As such, the department did not  have data available across a consistent baseline against which to assess  its progress from fiscal years 2004 through 2011. Therefore, we were not  able to assess DHS\u2019s progress against a baseline for each functional  area and sub-area, we did not assign a qualitative rating of progress for  each area, and we did not apply a weight to the expectations or sub- areas. More detailed information on those sub-areas for which we did not  make an assessment is included in appendices III through XII.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2011 through September  2011, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives. A more detailed  discussion of our scope and methodology is contained in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In November 2002, the Homeland Security Act was enacted into law,  creating DHS. This act defined the department\u2019s missions to include  preventing terrorist attacks within the United States; reducing U.S.  vulnerability to terrorism; and minimizing the damages, and assisting in  the recovery from, attacks that occur within the United States. The act  also specified major responsibilities for the department, including to  analyze information and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure;  coordinate efforts to develop countermeasures against chemical,  biological, radiological, nuclear, and other emerging terrorist threats;  secure U.S. borders and transportation systems; and manage the federal  government\u2019s response to terrorist attacks and major disasters. Various  laws have been enacted and presidential directives have been issued  that, among other things, expand, modify, or clarify DHS\u2019s missions and  responsibilities. For example, these laws and directives have reorganized  departmental offices and functions; clarified DHS\u2019s roles and  responsibilities, such as for emergency preparedness and response; and  directed DHS to complete various strategic documents or implement  specific programs within certain time frames. For example, the Aviation  and Transportation Security Act, enacted in November 2001, established  the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and, among other  things, included requirements for deploying a federal screening workforce  at airports and screening all checked baggage transported on passenger  aircraft using explosive detection systems. The Maritime Transportation  Security Act of 2002 and the Security and Accountability For Every Port  Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act), among other things, established and  modified a maritime security framework to include U.S. vessel and port  facility security requirements, an international port security assessment  program, and programs for scanning cargo containers. The Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 included provisions related  to intelligence, immigration enforcement, border security, and aviation  security, such as those calling for an increase in the number of Border  Patrol agents and full-time investigators for violations of immigration law,  subject to the availability of appropriations, and requiring DHS to develop  a national strategy for transportation security. The Post-Katrina  Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 required changes to the  Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) organizational and  management structure, and addressed other emergency management  areas, such as emergency communications, and national planning and  preparedness. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11  Commission Act of 2007 includes provisions related to critical  infrastructure protection, transportation security, and chemical, biological,  radiological, and nuclear threats, among other areas. The law  references the recommendations made by the National Commission on  Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (known as the 9/11  Commission).", "DHS began operations in March 2003, and its establishment represented  a fusion of 22 federal agencies to coordinate and centralize the  leadership of many homeland security activities under a single  department. The department\u2019s total budget authority has increased from  about $39 billion in fiscal year 2004 to about $55 billion in fiscal year  2011. The department\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget request is about $57  billion in total funding. Table 1 provides information on DHS\u2019s budget  authority for each fiscal year from 2004 though 2011, as reported by  DHS.", "A variety of factors have affected DHS\u2019s efforts to implement its mission  functions since its establishment, including several departmental  reorganizations. Most notably, in 2005 DHS announced the outcome of its  Second Stage Review, a systematic evaluation of DHS\u2019s operations,  policies, and structures. As a result of this review, the department  realigned existing directorates. The Post-Katrina Emergency  Management Reform Act provided for the further reorganization of  functions within the department by, in particular, realigning DHS\u2019s  emergency preparedness and response responsibilities. Further, as a  result of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act  of 2007, DHS reorganized its intelligence-related operations. In addition  to these reorganizations, domestic and international events have affected  DHS\u2019s implementation efforts. For example, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita,  the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the attempted airline attack on December 25,  2009, and the 2010 Gulf oil spill required rapid responses from the  department and impacted DHS\u2019s plans and operations for mitigating  vulnerabilities and addressing threats, and its progress in implementing  its missions.

The department\u2019s accomplishments include developing strategic  and operational plans across its range of missions; hiring, deploying and  training workforces; establishing new, or expanding existing, offices and  programs; and developing and issuing policies, procedures, and  regulations to govern its homeland security operations. Specifically:  \uf0b7  DHS issued strategic and operational plans to guide its homeland  security efforts, such as the QHSR, which provided a strategic  framework for homeland security, and the National Response  Framework, which is built upon coordinating structures to align key  roles and responsibilities across the nation, linking all levels of  government, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector.   \uf0b7  DHS successfully hired, trained, and deployed workforces, such as a  federal screening workforce at airports nationwide. DHS also has  about 20,000 agents to patrol the U.S. land borders and about 20,600  officers to conduct screening at air, land, and sea ports of entry.   \uf0b7  DHS created new programs and offices, or expanded existing ones, to  implement key homeland security responsibilities, such as  establishing the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team to,  among other things, coordinate the nation\u2019s efforts to prepare for,  prevent, and respond to cyber threats to systems and  communications networks. DHS also expanded programs for  identifying and removing aliens subject to removal from the United  States and for preventing unauthorized aliens from entering the  country.   \uf0b7  DHS issued policies and procedures addressing, among other things,  the screening of passengers at airport checkpoints, inspecting  travelers seeking entry into the United States, and assessing  immigration benefit applications and processes for detecting possible  fraud.", "Establishing these elements and others are important accomplishments  and have been critical for the department to position and equip itself for  fulfilling its homeland security missions and functions.", "However, our work has shown that more work remains for DHS to  address weaknesses in its current operational and implementation efforts  and to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of those efforts to  achieve its full potential. For example, we have reported that many DHS  programs and investments have experienced cost overruns, schedule  delays, and performance problems, including, for instance, DHS\u2019s  recently canceled technology program for securing U.S. borders, known  as the Secure Border Initiative Network, and some technologies for  screening passengers at airport checkpoints. DHS also has not yet fully  implemented its roles and responsibilities for developing and  implementing key homeland security programs and initiatives. For  example, FEMA has not yet developed a set of target capabilities for  disaster preparedness or established metrics for assessing those  capabilities to provide a framework for evaluating preparedness, as  required by the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of  2006. Further, DHS has not yet fully deployed technologies to meet key  missions for border, aviation, and maritime security. Our work has also  shown that DHS should take additional action to improve the efficiency  and effectiveness of a number of its programs and activities by, for  example, improving program management and oversight, and better  assessing homeland security requirements, needs, costs, and benefits,  such as for key acquisition and technology programs.", "Table 2 provides additional information on key progress and work  remaining in each of DHS\u2019s functional mission areas, as identified by our  work and supplemented by that of the DHS IG, with an emphasis on work  completed since 2008. We have made approximately 1,500  recommendations to DHS to help address these issues, and DHS has  addressed about half of them and has actions underway to address  others.

As we have previously reported, while it is  important that DHS continue to work to strengthen each of its functional  areas, it is equally important that these areas be addressed from a  comprehensive, departmentwide perspective to help mitigate  longstanding issues that have impacted the department\u2019s progress.", "Table 3 provides examples of crosscutting issues that have impacted the  department\u2019s progress, as identified by our work. Appendixes XIII through  XVIII provide more detailed information on our assessment of progress  made and work remaining in each crosscutting area, including  recommendations we have made and DHS\u2019s efforts to implement them.", "Our work on the functional mission areas and crosscutting issues  discussed in this report has identified several key themes\u2014leading and  coordinating the homeland security enterprise, implementing and  integrating management functions for results, and strategically managing  risks and assessing homeland security efforts\u2014that have impacted the  department\u2019s progress since it began operations. These themes provide  insights that can inform DHS\u2019s efforts, moving forward, as it works to  implement its missions within a dynamic and evolving homeland security  environment, one in which a broad range of threats face the nation\u2014from  terrorists\u2019 possible use of a chemical or biological agent to carry out an  attack to cyber threats and intrusions to natural disasters and infectious  diseases. DHS made progress and had successes in all of these areas,  but our work found that these themes have been at the foundation of  DHS\u2019s implementation challenges, and need to be addressed from a  departmentwide perspective to position DHS for the future and enable it  to satisfy the expectations set for it by the Congress, the administration,  and the country.", "Leading and coordinating the homeland security enterprise. While  DHS is one of a number of entities with a role in securing the homeland, it  has significant leadership and coordination responsibilities for managing  efforts across the homeland security enterprise. To satisfy these  responsibilities, it is critically important that DHS develop, maintain and  leverage effective partnerships with its stakeholders, while at the same  time addressing DHS-specific responsibilities in satisfying its missions.  Before DHS began operations, we reported that the quality and continuity  of the new department\u2019s leadership would be critical to building and  sustaining the long-term effectiveness of DHS and achieving homeland  security goals and objectives. In particular, we reported that top  leadership involvement and clear lines of accountability for making  improvements would be critical to marshalling the needed resources and  building and maintaining organizationwide commitment to new ways of  doing business. We further reported that to secure the nation, DHS must  form effective and sustained partnerships between components and also  with a range of other entities, including federal agencies; state, local, and  tribal governments; the private and nonprofit sectors; and international  partners. Critical aspects of DHS\u2019s success depend on well-functioning  relationships with third parties, and DHS needs to continue to create and  maintain a structure that can leverage partnerships to effectively  implement homeland security efforts. Eight years after its establishment,  DHS has made important strides in providing leadership and coordinating  efforts across the enterprise as it continues to work to implement and  strengthen its effectiveness across its range of missions. For example,  DHS strengthened its partnerships and collaboration with foreign  governments to coordinate and standardize security practices for aviation  security. It has also improved coordination and clarified roles and  responsibilities with state, local, and tribal governments for emergency  management. In addition, DHS operates the Protective Security Advisor  Program, which deploys critical infrastructure protection and security  specialists to local communities to help foster effective information  sharing with the private sector and local communities.", "However, our work has found that DHS made limited progress in forging  effective partnerships and sharing information throughout the enterprise  early in its existence and as it matured, and although DHS continues to  make improvements in this area, it faces challenges in building and  leveraging these partnerships and information. These challenges have  impeded the department\u2019s progress, affecting its ability to effectively and  efficiently satisfy its missions. For example, we found that DHS has not  effectively overseen key interagency forums its components have  established with other federal, state, local, tribal, and foreign law  enforcement agencies to secure the border, raising the risk of duplication,  overlap, and an inefficient use of resources.", "In 2005 we designated information sharing for homeland security, for  which DHS has key responsibilities, as high risk because the federal  government faced serious challenges in analyzing information and  sharing it among partners in a timely, accurate, and useful way to protect  against terrorist threats. We reported that DHS must effectively share  terrorism-related information with state and local law enforcement  agencies because they depend on it to maintain awareness of emerging  threats and to allocate homeland security resources, among other things.  Further, gaps in sharing, such as agencies' failure to link information  about the individual who attempted to conduct the December 25, 2009,  airline bombing, prevented the individual from being included on the  federal government\u2019s consolidated terrorist watchlist, a tool used by DHS  to screen for persons who pose a security risk.", "The federal government and DHS have made progress in this area, but  more work remains to strengthen and streamline existing information  sharing mechanisms and better address partners\u2019 information needs.  These gaps have contributed to, among other things, DHS not realizing  the full potential and contributions that its partners can provide, and not  maximizing its effectiveness in achieving its missions. For example, with  regard to cybersecurity, private sector stakeholders reported that they  expect their federal partners, including DHS, to provide usable, timely,  and actionable cyber threat information and alerts and a secure  mechanism for sharing information, among other things. However,  according to private sector stakeholders, federal partners are not  consistently meeting these expectations. Without improvements in  meeting private and public sector expectations for sharing cyber threat  information, private-public partnerships will remain less than optimal, and  there is a risk that owners of critical infrastructure will not have the  information and mechanisms needed to thwart sophisticated cyber  attacks that could have catastrophic effects on our nation\u2019s cyber-reliant  critical infrastructure. Moreover, we have identified the potential for  overlap between various mechanisms DHS uses for sharing security- related information with public transit agencies. DHS needs to continue to  streamline its mechanisms for sharing information with public transit  agencies to reduce the volume of similar information these agencies  receive from DHS, making it easier for them to discern relevant  information and take appropriate actions to enhance security. Moving  forward, it will be important that DHS continue to enhance its focus and  efforts to strengthen and leverage the broader homeland security  enterprise, and build off the important progress that it has made thus far.  In addressing ever changing and complex threats, and with the vast array  of partners with which DHS must coordinate, continued leadership and  stewardship will be critical in achieving this end.", "Implementing and integrating management functions for results.  Following its establishment, the department focused its efforts primarily  on implementing its various missions to meet pressing homeland security  needs and threats, and less on creating and integrating a fully and  effectively functioning department from 22 disparate agencies. This initial  focus on mission implementation was understandable given the critical  homeland security needs facing the nation after the department\u2019s  establishment, and the enormous challenge posed by creating,  integrating, and transforming a department as large and complex as DHS.  As the department matured, it has put into place management policies  and processes and made a range of other enhancements to its  management functions\u2014acquisition, information technology, financial,  and human capital management. However, the department has not  effectively executed these processes in a number of instances, across the  range of its management functions, and has not fully integrated these  functions across components and among departmental missions. These  issues have contributed to performance problems in programs aimed at  delivering important mission capabilities. For example, DHS did not  sufficiently define what capabilities and benefits would be delivered, by  when, and at what cost for US-VISIT\u2014which is to verify the identities of  foreign visitors entering and exiting the United States by storing and  processing biometric and biographic information\u2014and has not yet  reached a decision on deploying an exit capability. Not defining these  capabilities and benefits contributed to development and deployment  delays. In another example, with respect to the cargo advanced  automated radiography system to detect certain nuclear materials in  vehicles and containers at ports, DHS pursued the acquisition and  deployment of the system without fully understanding that it would not fit  within existing inspection lanes at ports of entry. DHS subsequently  canceled this program.", "In 2003, GAO designated the transformation and implementation of DHS  as high risk because the department had to transform 22 agencies\u2014 several with major management challenges\u2014into one department, and  failure to effectively address DHS\u2019s management and mission risks could  have serious consequences for U.S. national and economic security.  Eight years later, DHS remains on our high-risk list. DHS has made  important strides in working to strengthen its management functions, has  established plans to strengthen and integrate these functions, and in  recent years has demonstrated strong leadership support to address  these long-standing issues. In particular, DHS developed various  management policies, directives, and governance structures, such as  acquisition and information technology management policies and  controls, to provide enhanced guidance on investment decision-making.  DHS also reduced its financial management material weaknesses in  internal control over financial reporting and developed strategies to  strengthen human capital management, such as its Workforce Strategy  for Fiscal Years 2011-2016. However, more work remains to position  these management areas for success. For example, DHS does not yet  have enough skilled personnel to carry out activities in some key  programmatic and management areas, such as for acquisition  management, and was ranked 28 out of 32 agencies in the 2010  Partnership for Public Service\u2019s Best Places to Work in the Federal  Government rankings. DHS also has not yet implemented an integrated  financial management system, impeding its ability to have ready access  to information to inform decision-making, and has been unable to obtain a  clean audit opinion on the audit of its consolidated financial statements  since its establishment. Moving forward, addressing these management  challenges will be critical for DHS\u2019s success, as will the integration of  these functions across the department to achieve efficiencies and  effectiveness.", "Strategically managing risks and assessing homeland security  efforts. Forming a new department while working to implement statutorily  mandated and department-initiated programs and initiatives, and  responding to adapting adversaries and evolving threats was and is a  significant challenge facing DHS. Key threats and incidents that have  emerged, both domestically and internationally, such as the anthrax  attacks, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and a number of attempted attacks  against the aviation sector, have impacted and altered the department\u2019s  approaches and investments. For example, DHS made key changes to its  processes and technology investments for screening passengers and  baggage at airports in part as a result of threats facing commercial  aviation. DHS also changed its processes and clarified roles and  responsibilities for emergency management in the aftermath of  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.", "It is understandable that these events and threats had to be addressed as  they arose. However, our work has shown, throughout the department,  that limited strategic and program planning, as well as assessment and  evaluation to inform approaches and investment decisions, have  contributed to programs not meeting strategic needs or doing so  effectively and efficiently. For example, as we reported in July 2011, the  Coast Guard\u2019s planned acquisitions through its Deepwater Program,  which began before DHS\u2019s creation and includes efforts to build or  modernize ships and aircraft and supporting capabilities that are critical to  meeting the Coast Guard\u2019s core missions in the future, is unachievable  due to cost growth, schedule delays, and affordability issues. In addition,  because FEMA has not yet developed a set of target disaster  preparedness capabilities and a systematic means of assessing those  capabilities, as required by the Post-Katrina Emergency Management  Reform Act of 2006 and Presidential Policy Directive 8: National  Preparedness, it cannot effectively evaluate and identify key capability  gaps and target limited resources to fill those gaps. We have also  reported that while DHS has made important progress in assessing and  analyzing risk across sectors, it has more work to do in using this  information to inform planning and resource allocation decisions. Risk  management has been widely supported by Congress and DHS as a  management approach for homeland security, enhancing the  department\u2019s ability to make informed decisions and prioritize resource  investments. Since DHS does not have unlimited resources and cannot  protect the nation from every conceivable threat, it must make risk- informed decisions regarding its homeland security approaches and  strategies.", "Moreover, we have reported on the need for enhanced performance  assessment, that is, evaluating existing programs and operations to  determine whether they are operating as intended or are in need of  change, across DHS\u2019s missions. Information on the performance of  programs is critical for helping the department, the Congress, and other  stakeholders more systematically assess strengths and weaknesses and  inform decision-making. In recent years, DHS has placed an increased  emphasis on strengthening its mechanisms for assessing the  performance and effectiveness of its homeland security programs. For  example, DHS established new performance measures, and modified  existing ones, to better assess many of its programs and efforts.  Enhanced assessment of programs\u2019 performance and the use of that  information to inform decisions will provide the department with important  insights in determining the extent to which programs and operations are  meeting intended goals and results and at what cost.", "However, our work has found that DHS continues to miss opportunities to  optimize performance across its missions because of a lack of reliable  performance information or assessment of existing information;  evaluation of feasible alternatives; and, as appropriate, adjustment of  programs or operations that are not meeting mission needs. For example,  TSA\u2019s program for research, development, and deployment of passenger  checkpoint screening technologies lacked a risk-based plan and  performance measures to assess the extent to which checkpoint  screening technologies were achieving the program\u2019s security goals, and  thereby reducing or mitigating the risk of terrorist attacks. As a result, TSA  had limited assurance that its strategy targeted the most critical risks and  that it was investing in the most cost-effective new technologies or other  protective measures. Further, with regard to border security efforts, CBP  established performance measures for its checkpoints to indicate  checkpoint contributions toward apprehending removable aliens and  seizing illegal drugs, but the lack of information on those passing through  checkpoints undetected continued to challenge CBP\u2019s ability to measure  checkpoint effectiveness and provide public accountability. As the  department further matures and seeks to optimize its operations, DHS will  need to look beyond immediate requirements; assess programs\u2019  sustainability across the long term, particularly in light of constrained  budgets; and evaluate tradeoffs within and among programs across the  homeland security enterprise. Doing so should better equip DHS to adapt  and respond to new threats in a sustainable manner as it works to  address existing ones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Given DHS\u2019s role and leadership responsibilities in securing the  homeland, it is critical that the department\u2019s programs and activities are  operating as efficiently and effectively as possible, that these programs  are sustainable, and that they continue to mature, evolve, and adapt to  address pressing security needs. DHS has made significant progress  throughout its missions since its creation, but more work is needed to  further transform the department into a more integrated and effective  organization. Specifically, DHS has taken many actions to (1) develop  strategic and operational plans across its range of missions; (2) hire,  deploy and train workforces; (3) establish new, or expand existing, offices  and programs; and (4) develop and issue policies, procedures, and  regulations to govern its homeland security operations. DHS has also  made important progress in strengthening partnerships with stakeholders,  improving its management processes and sharing of information, and  enhancing its risk management and performance measurement efforts.  These accomplishments are especially noteworthy given that the  department has had to work to transform itself into a fully functioning  cabinet department while implementing its missions\u2014a difficult  undertaking for any organization and one that can take years to achieve  even under less daunting circumstances.", "Impacting the department\u2019s efforts have been a variety of factors and  events, such as attempted terrorist attacks and natural disasters, as well  as new responsibilities and authorities provided by Congress and the  administration. These events collectively have forced DHS to continually  reassess its priorities and reallocate resources as needed, and have  impacted its continued integration and transformation. Given the nature of  DHS\u2019s mission, the need to remain nimble and adaptable to respond to  evolving threats, as well as to work to anticipate new ones, will not  change and may become even more complex and challenging as  domestic and world events unfold, particularly in light of reduced budgets  and constrained resources. To better position itself to address these  challenges, our work has shown that DHS should place an increased  emphasis and take additional action in supporting and leveraging the  homeland security enterprise, managing its operations to achieve needed  results, and strategically planning for the future while assessing and  adjusting, as needed, what exists today. Addressing these issues will be  critically important for the department to strengthen its homeland security  programs and operations. We have made about 1,500 recommendations  to DHS to address these issues, which the department has or is working  to implement, but more work remains. Eight years after its establishment  and 10 years after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, DHS has  indeed made significant strides in protecting the nation, but has yet to  reach its full potential."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for its review and comment.

The department discussed its views of its accomplishments since 2001.  For example, the department noted its creation and management of the  Visa Security Program, which is operational at 19 posts in 15 countries;  the increase in the number of deployed Border Patrol agents since 2001;  the establishment of fusion centers to serve as focal points for the  analysis and sharing of threat and vulnerability-related information;  passenger screening and prescreening efforts; and support to state, local,  tribal and territorial partners\u2019 efforts to enhance emergency  communications capabilities, among other things.

In addition, each mission area appendix  provides examples of other DHS programs and efforts on which we and  the DHS IG have not reported or have completed limited work. Thus, this  report was not intended to cover all of DHS\u2019s homeland security-related  activities and efforts. Further, as discussed in the report, because we and  the DHS IG have completed varying degrees of work (in terms of the  amount and scope of reviews completed) for each functional area, and  because different DHS components and offices provided us with different  amounts and types of information, our assessments of DHS\u2019s progress in  each area reflect the information available for our review and analysis and  are not necessarily equally comprehensive across all 10 areas.", "In addition, DHS provided examples of activities and programs that it  stated are not reflected in our report that demonstrate progress DHS  made in preparing the nation to respond to threats.

It is  also based on our ongoing work on key DHS programs for various  congressional committees, as noted throughout the report. For this  ongoing work, we examined program documentation and interviewed  agency officials, among other things.", "To determine what progress DHS has made in implementing its mission  functions and what work, if any, remains, we identified 10 DHS functional  areas within its missions, which we define as categories or areas of  DHS\u2019s homeland security responsibilities. These functional areas are  based on those areas we identified for DHS in our August 2007 report on  DHS\u2019s progress in implementing its mission and management functions,  and our analysis of DHS\u2019s Quadrennial Homeland Security Review  (QHSR) and budget documents, such as its congressional budget  justifications. We discussed these functional areas with our subject  matter experts and DHS officials and incorporated their feedback as  appropriate. These areas include: (1) aviation security; (2) chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats; (3) critical  infrastructure protection\u2014physical assets; (4) surface transportation  security; (5) border security; (6) maritime security; (7) immigration  enforcement; (8) immigration services; (9) critical infrastructure  protection\u2014cyber assets; and (10) emergency preparedness and  response. Within these functional areas, we identified performance  expectations, which we define as composites of the responsibilities or  functions that the department is to achieve or satisfy based on  requirements, responsibilities, and goals set for the department by  Congress, the administration, and DHS and its components. In particular,  we used expectations identified in our August 2007 report as a baseline,  and updated, or added to, these expectations by analyzing:  \uf0b7  Homeland security-related laws enacted since September 2006 to  identify legislative requirements for each DHS functional area.  Examples of such laws include the Implementing Recommendations  of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, the Security and Accountability  For Every Port Act of 2006 (SAFE Port Act), and the Post-Katrina  Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006.   \uf0b7  DHS appropriation acts and accompanying conference reports for  fiscal years 2006 through 2011 to identify requirements established  and guidance provided to DHS for each functional area.  \uf0b7  Presidential directives and executive orders that have been issued  since September 2006 to identify expectations set for DHS by the  administration for each functional area. Examples of such directives  include Homeland Security Presidential Directive 25: Arctic Region  Policy, and Presidential Policy Directive 8: National Preparedness.   \uf0b7  Homeland security-related national strategies that have been issued  since September 2006 to identify expectations set for DHS by the  administration for each functional area. Examples of such strategies  include the 2010 National Security Strategy and 2007 National  Strategy for Homeland Security.  \uf0b7  Strategic plans and documents that have been issued since  September 2006 by DHS and its component agencies to identify  goals and measures established by the department for each  functional area. Examples of such strategic plans and documents  include the QHSR and Bottom-Up Review (BUR) reports, as well as  component level strategic plans, such as the U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE) Strategic Plan (Fiscal Year 2010-2014).", "We then grouped the expectations we identified within each functional  area into broader sub-areas. Table 5 provides an example of  performance expectations and sub-areas for the border security  functional area. Appendix I provides the complete list of functional areas,  sub-areas, and performance expectations.", "To identify the performance expectations and sub-areas, one analyst  independently reviewed the source documents to identify expectations  and sub-areas for a functional area. A second analyst then independently  reviewed and verified each analysis. We also obtained and incorporated  feedback from our subject matter experts on the expectations and sub- areas. In addition, we obtained feedback from DHS and component  officials on the expectations and sub-areas we identified, and  incorporated their feedback as appropriate.", "Further, we then aligned our functional areas to the five Quadrennial  Homeland Security Review (QHSR) missions based on our review of the  QHSR and BUR reports and DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget documents  (see table 6). Within these documents, DHS identified how its initiatives,  programs, and activities align or support each QHSR mission, with some  supporting more than one mission. For example, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection (CBP) identified that its efforts related to inspections at  ports of entry and facilitation of trade primarily support QHSR Mission 2:  Securing and Managing Our Borders, but also, to a lesser extent, support  QHSR Mission 1: Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security and  Mission 3: Enforcing and Administering Our Immigration Laws. On the  basis of DHS\u2019s alignment of its initiatives, programs, and activities to  QHSR missions, we grouped the 10 functional areas under DHS\u2019s QHSR  missions. In doing so, we recognized that our functional areas, as well as  those key sub-areas that comprise the functional areas, may pertain to  more than one QHSR mission area. For example, under our functional  area of immigration enforcement, our work addressing the sub-area  investigations of immigration offenses addresses DHS programs and  activities that relate to more than one QHSR mission\u2014primarily Mission  3: Enforcing and Administering Our Immigration Laws, and also Mission  2: Securing and Managing Our Borders and Mission 1: Preventing  Terrorism and Enhancing Security. In those cases when a functional area  aligned to more than one QHSR mission, we categorized it under the  QHSR mission that it primarily supported on the basis of our review of  DHS\u2019s QHSR and budget-related documents. In cases when sub-areas  within a functional area supported more than one QHSR mission, we kept  the sub-area with its functional area (e.g., aviation security) and noted to  which other QHSR missions it aligned. We provided DHS with our  alignment of the functional areas to the QHSR missions, and incorporated  the department\u2019s feedback, as appropriate.", "To identify key areas of progress and work that remains in the DHS  functional areas, we examined our and the DHS IG\u2019s past reports on DHS  missions, programs, and operations, including recommendations we and  the DHS IG have made, and actions DHS has taken or has underway to  address them. We also identified preliminary observations from our  ongoing work in some key areas. In doing so, we identified factors that  have affected DHS progress in the functional areas. Our work and the  work of the DHS IG have covered many of DHS\u2019s key programs,  operations, and activities. In this report, we highlight our key work in these  areas, but do not address all products we or the DHS IG have issued  related to DHS, nor did we address all of the sub-areas or DHS\u2019s  homeland security-related activities and efforts.

We  determined that the DHS IG reports were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report to provide examples, and to supplement our work,  of DHS\u2019s progress and work remaining. In addition, we obtained data  from DHS on its budget authority for fiscal years 2004 through 2011, and  funding and staffing levels related to the functional areas, and assessed  the reliability of that data by available documentation.

In some  cases, DHS provided us with updated data on its efforts, such as  statistics on technology deployments or program activities. We assessed  the reliability of these data by reviewing available documentation from  DHS. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. We included updated information in our  assessments of each sub-area and functional area, based on our review  of this information and our prior work. In some cases, we could not make  an assessment of the updated information DHS provided because we did  not have prior work upon which to base an assessment, or DHS\u2019s  reported actions were in the early stages of implementation, and thus it  was too early to assess the results of these efforts. We noted these  instances in our report.", "To identify crosscutting and management issues that have affected  DHS\u2019s implementation efforts, we analyzed the assessments of progress  and work that remains in each functional area. We also examined our and  the DHS IG\u2019s past reports on crosscutting issues, related  recommendations, and actions taken by DHS or that are underway to  address the recommendations. We obtained and incorporated feedback  on the crosscutting issues we identified from our subject matter experts.  In addition, we obtained and incorporated feedback from DHS on our  assessment of crosscutting issues that have affected the department\u2019s  mission implementation efforts, including updated information from DHS  pertaining to these crosscutting issues. We incorporated updated  information into our assessments based on our review of this information  and our prior work.

However, DHS faces challenges in establishing a  comprehensive national cyber analysis and warning capability.   Key progress: When incidents such as data loss or theft, computer intrusions,  and privacy breaches occur, agencies are to notify the U.S. Computer  Emergency Readiness Team.

The DHS IG recommended, among other things, that DHS establish a  consolidated, multiple classification level portal that can be accessed by  federal partners that includes real-time incident response related information  and reports. In addition, the DHS IG recommended the establishment of  specific outcome-based performance measures and a strategic plan to ensure  that the team can achieve its mission, objectives, and milestones.

As a result, the roles and responsibilities of key  officials involved in responding to a catastrophe had not been fully defined  and, thus, could not be tested in exercises. We recommended that FEMA  establish a program management plan to ensure that the plans that were  called for as part of the national preparedness system were developed in a  timely and integrated fashion. FEMA generally concurred and has actions  underway to address it. For example, FEMA told us that since we last  reported, it has revised or completed six concept plans and approximately  28 hazard-specific regional plans. FEMA also reported working to  implement elements of Presidential Policy Directive 8: National  Preparedness. This directive instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security  to develop a national preparedness goal and national preparedness  system to meet that goal through an integrated set of guidance, programs,  and processes. Specifically, FEMA reported in August 2011 that in  response to Presidential Policy Directive 8, FEMA is leading the  development of a Federal Interagency All-Hazards Response Plan, to  include scenario-specific annexes that integrate prior earthquake,  hurricane, and catastrophic planning efforts. To implement Presidential  Policy Directive 8, FEMA will need to review its current and pending  policies to ensure that they are consistent with the goals and requirements  of the Directive, and make any adjustments that may be needed.  Despite ongoing efforts to measure preparedness and assess  capabilities, FEMA faced difficulties in collecting reliable and  consistent data, and developing measurable target capabilities.   Key progress: DHS, particularly FEMA, implemented efforts to measure  preparedness by assessing capabilities and addressing related challenges.  In September 2007, DHS issued the National Preparedness Guidelines  that describe a national framework for capabilities-based preparedness as  a systematic effort that includes sequential steps to first determine  capability requirements and then assess current capability levels. As a  companion to the Guidelines, FEMA issued a Target Capabilities List,  designed to provide a national-level generic model of capabilities defining  all-hazards preparedness. FEMA also made progress in developing a  system for assessing national preparedness capabilities by, among other  things, establishing reporting guidance for state preparedness and issuing  a federal preparedness report.  Presidential Policy Directive 8, issued in March 2011, requires the  development of a national preparedness goal, system, and report. The  implementation plan for the directive calls for the development of the  national preparedness goal by September 25, 2011, and the development  of other documents by September 25, 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Area", "paragraphs": ["Summary of key progress and work remaining  What remains to be done: The success of FEMA\u2019s efforts to measure  preparedness has been limited due to, among other things, missing  quantifiable metrics to measure capabilities. In April 2009, we reported that  establishing quantifiable metrics for target capabilities was a prerequisite to  developing assessment data that can be compared across all levels of  government. At the time of our review, FEMA was in the process of refining  the target capabilities to make them more measurable and planned to  develop quantifiable metrics for each of the capabilities. We reported in  October 2010 that FEMA had not yet developed national preparedness  capability requirements based on established metrics to provide a  framework for assessing preparedness. FEMA officials told us that  evaluation efforts that they used to collect data on national preparedness  capabilities were useful for their respective purposes, but that the data  collected were limited by data reliability and measurement issues related to  the lack of standardization. Until a framework for assessing preparedness  is in place, we reported that FEMA would not have a basis on which to  operationalize and implement its conceptual approach for assessing local,  state, and federal preparedness capabilities against capability  requirements and identify capability gaps for prioritizing investments in  national preparedness. In our April 2009 report, we recommended that  FEMA improve national preparedness by enhancing its project  management plan for assessing capabilities to include reporting on the  progress of preparedness assessments and developing quantifiable  metrics for capabilities.   DHS concurred, and in July 2011 FEMA reported that it took steps to  establish a preparedness baseline and the accompanying foundation for  assessing preparedness, including determining how effective grants are in  improving preparedness. FEMA also reported that it was working with its  emergency response partners to identify end-states, capabilities, and  performance objectives for each emergency preparedness mission area as  part of its development of the National Preparedness Goal. FEMA further  will provide a summary of the progress being made towards developing  and maintaining performance objectives required to deliver the capabilities  described in the goal. In August 2011, FEMA reported that it had  established a Program Executive Office to ensure that the target dates for  implementation of Presidential Policy Directive 8 are met and stakeholders  are engaged in the process. As these efforts are recent, we have not  conducted work to assess their effectiveness in measuring preparedness.

Key progress: In February 2010, FEMA released a draft National Disaster  Recovery Framework, which is intended to provide a model to collectively  identify and address challenges that arise during the disaster recovery  process. This Framework is designed to help the emergency management  community work better together to support individuals, households, and  communities as they rebuild and restore their ways of life following a  disaster. FEMA later reported that since March 2010, it has received  hundreds of comments and recommendations from federal agencies and  departments on the proposed Framework.   In March 2010, we reported that FEMA assisted local communities with  developing long-term disaster recovery plans as part of its post-disaster  assistance. For example, one way FEMA assisted Iowa City\u2019s recovery  from major floods in 2008 by, among other things, identifying possible  federal funding sources for specific projects in the city\u2019s recovery plan and  advising the city on how to prepare effective project proposals. Local  officials credited this assistance with helping the city to be able to secure  federal funding.   What remains to be done: We have identified areas where FEMA\u2019s  recovery assistance to local communities should be improved. For  example, state and local officials in Texas recovering from Hurricane Ike in  2008 said that FEMA\u2019s process of ranking projects in the City of  Galveston\u2019s recovery plan had the effect of fostering unrealistic  expectations among the public about what projects would be funded. We  recommended that FEMA more clearly communicate the objectives and  processes it uses when assessing the value of specific recovery projects to  help prevent unrealistic expectations about the implementation of such  projects among members of the affected community. DHS agreed and  stated that it would further examine the tools it used to communicate with  impacted communities as part of the implementation of the National  Disaster Recovery Framework. With regard to Framework, in July 2011,  FEMA reported that the revised draft of the Framework was in the final  stages of interagency review and interagency teams had been working to  develop draft annexes for the six core functional areas of the Framework.  Since FEMA has not yet finalized this framework, it is too early to assess  its results.   FEMA improved the provision and oversight of emergency assistance  and services, but work remains in its management and operation of  emergency response and recovery assistance programs.   Key progress: FEMA has provided and coordinated the provision of  assistance to state and local governments, non-profit organizations, and  individuals after disasters\u2014-including helping communities develop long- term recovery plans. In June 2011, the DHS IG reported that it had  identified 128 programs that provide disaster assistance and that DHS  administers 69, or approximately 54 percent, of these programs. For  example, FEMA operates the Public Assistance program, which provides  grants to state, local, and tribal governments and certain non-profit  organizations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Area", "paragraphs": ["Summary of key progress and work remaining  FEMA also took steps to improve its disaster assistance program  oversight. In December 2008, we identified challenges in the Public  Assistance program related to project development, information sharing  and tracking the status of projects, project approvals and appeals, and  human capital. For example, disagreements between applicants and  FEMA, as well as changes to project scope decisions, contributed to  slowing down project development. We reported that DHS had addressed  these challenges, including finalizing a public assistance catastrophic  disaster recovery concept plan that recognized the need to more easily  tailor projects to meet post-disaster conditions; developing new  management information systems to better track and manage projects and  increase the transparency of public assistance funding; and creating a  credentialing program for employees. Further, in July 2011, FEMA reported  that it had established two Public Assistance review panels within the  Public Assistance appeals process for the purpose of expediting final  eligibility decisions for disputed projects. With respect to employee  credentialing, FEMA reported in July 2011 that its newly created FEMA  Qualification System is intended to build upon previous efforts to credential  FEMA\u2019s disaster response personnel. According to FEMA, the system is  expected to improve workforce qualification and certification of FEMA  personnel deployed for incident management and support operations. We  are conducting ongoing work related to FEMA\u2019s disaster assistance  workforce and plan to report on our results in 2012.   What remains to be done: In March 2010, we identified two broad  challenges related to FEMA\u2019s long-term disaster recovery assistance  efforts. First, the criteria for when FEMA was to provide long-term recovery  assistance in a specific disaster were vague, which resulted in uncertainty  among other federal agencies and state recovery officials. Second, in  some cases, FEMA assistance began before state and local governments  had the capacity to effectively work with FEMA and ended before critical  long-term recovery coordination and planning needs were fully addressed.  We recommended, among other things, that DHS develop clear and  consistent criteria that identify factors that determine whether and how the  entity responsible for coordinating long-term recovery will become involved  in a specific disaster. We also recommended that DHS establish a long- term recovery structure that more effectively aligns the timing and level of  involvement of the entity responsible for coordinating long-term community  recovery assistance with both the capacity of state and local governments  to work with them and the need for coordination assistance. DHS  concurred and reported in July 2011 that it had developed an assessment  tool to assist a coordinating officer or state when attempting to determine if  activating the long term recovery mission is appropriate. These are positive  steps that should help strengthen FEMA\u2019s efforts to address timing issues  with its disaster recovery, but they are still in the early stages of  implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Area", "paragraphs": ["DHS and FEMA made strategic  progress in enhancing  emergency and interoperable  communications. However,  specific alert systems, such as  the Integrated Public Alert and  Warning System, have  technical challenges, such as  message delivery limitations.", "Summary of key progress and work remaining  Additionally, FEMA reported in July 2011 that it sought to increase its  disaster reservist cadre with professionals in areas of community planning,  city management, and economic recovery to also provide an enhanced  technical resource to local governments early in recovery efforts to assist in  launching recovery planning. These are positive steps that should assist  FEMA in its recovery efforts. However, because of the long-term nature of  disaster recovery, it will take time to determine the impact of these efforts  in enhancing recovery from such recent disasters as the tornados that  devastated areas of Alabama and Missouri.  DHS and FEMA released key emergency communications strategic  documents and made grants available for interoperability, but have  made limited progress to enhance emergency alert systems.   Key progress: Continuity of communications, capacity, and interoperability  are primary areas of vulnerability in emergency communications.  Emergency communications breakdowns undermined response efforts  during terrorist attacks in 2001 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. In response,  federal agencies, including DHS, increased efforts to enhance emergency  communications. In June 2009, we reported that DHS and other federal  agencies took steps to enhance emergency communications by issuing  key documents such as the National Emergency Communications Plan\u2014 the first strategic document for improving emergency communications  nationwide. Further, DHS and other federal agencies made numerous  grants for interoperable communications available and increasingly aligned  them with national and state plans. In addition, we reported that federal  agencies, including DHS, took strategic steps to assist first responders.   In March 2010, we reported that the Emergency Communications  Preparedness Center had been established. At that time, the members  were developing a working definition of the scope of emergency  communications to define the scope of their mission and the types of  information that should be included in an emergency communications  clearinghouse. As of July 2011, DHS reported that the membership of the  Preparedness Center expanded to 14 federal agencies, and the members  had developed strategic objectives and an action plan to implement these  objectives. FEMA also reported that it established and implemented  working groups and a Disaster Emergency Communications Division to  support emergency and interoperable communications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Area", "paragraphs": ["Summary of key progress and work remaining  Further, in September 2009, we reported on the Emergency Alert System,  the primary national-level public warning system, and FEMA\u2019s Integrated  Public Alert and Warning System, which is intended to integrate new and  existing alert capabilities, including the Emergency Alert System, into a  \u201csystem of systems\u201d to become the country\u2019s comprehensive public alert  system. We reported that FEMA faced coordination issues in developing  and implementing the system. For example, many stakeholders we  contacted during our work knew little about the Integrated Public Alert and  Warning System and expressed the need for better coordination with  FEMA. Among other things, we recommended that FEMA develop  strategic goals and processes for deployment of the Integrated Public Alert  and Warning System and report periodically on program progress to the  Congress and to the Secretary of Homeland Security in order to improve  program transparency and accountability. DHS concurred and published  an Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Strategic Plan in June  2010 that identified the vision, mission, goals and objectives of the  program.  What remains to be done: In September 2009, we reported that FEMA  faced technical challenges in implementing the Integrated Public Alert and  Warning System related to systems integration, standards development,  the development of geo-targeted and multilingual alerts, and alerts for  individuals with disabilities. For example, FEMA\u2019s standard intended to  facilitate integration of alert systems was under development and not  widely used. As a result, we reported that integration with state and local  systems would likely be a significant challenge due to potential  incompatibility, and FEMA did not yet have logistical plans to integrate  these systems. Further, we reported that to demonstrate the integration  and expansion of new alerting technologies, and to work toward the  functionality described in the executive order, FEMA had implemented pilot  projects, but they ended inconclusively, with few documented lessons  learned.   We recommended, among other things, that FEMA establish and  implement a plan to verify the dependability and effectiveness of systems  used to disseminate alerts. FEMA concurred and, in July 2011, reported  that it had engaged with a range of agencies, organizations, and private  sector entities to promote Integrated Public Alert and Warning System  capabilities and opportunities for the integration of alert and warning  technologies for people with access and functional needs. FEMA reported  that it had partnered with organizations to demonstrate products that  incorporate technologies for alerting persons with access and functional  needs. Further, FEMA reported that it was developing an infrastructure of  alert and warning capabilities that expands on the traditional Emergency  Alert System by, for example, allowing individuals with enabled mobile  devices to receive text-like messages alerting them of imminent threats in  their geographic area. FEMA reported that in March 2011 it deployed the  Integrated Public Alert and Warning System-Open Platform for Emergency  Networks, a set of securely hosted Web services that enable the routing of  alerts and warnings between various third-party systems, networks, and  devices. As DHS has recently implemented this system and its pilot  products have not yet been deployed, it is too early to assess the  effectiveness of these efforts.", "Overall assessment  FEMA made progress in  allocating homeland security  grants using a reasonable risk  assessment methodology.  However, challenges remain  regarding the coordination of  grant programs.", "Summary of key progress and work remaining  FEMA used a reasonable risk assessment methodology to allocate  the Urban Areas Security Initiative and State Homeland Security  grants, but FEMA should coordinate the application and review  process for its preparedness grants.  Key progress: Within FEMA, the Grant Programs Directorate is  responsible for business operations, training, policy, oversight of all FEMA  grants, and the program management of preparedness grants. FEMA\u2019s  grant programs vary from enhancing capabilities that focus on  counterterrorism and catastrophic events, to specific first-responder  disciplines that strengthen capabilities for addressing hazards of all types.  For example, the State Homeland Security Program provides funding in an  effort to address the identified planning, organization, equipment, training,  and exercise needs at the state and local levels to prevent, protect against,  respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism and other catastrophic  events. The Urban Areas Security Initiative program provides funding to  address the unique planning, organization, equipment, training, and  exercise needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas, and assists them  in building an enhanced and sustainable capacity to prevent, protect  against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism. In June 2008, we  reported that DHS had constructed a reasonable methodology to assess  risk and allocate the Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland  Security grants, but that this methodology did not account for vulnerability  differences among jurisdictions.  In July 2011, DHS reported that it modified its methodology for fiscal year  2011 to address the measurement of vulnerability in its risk-based grant  allocation model. Specifically, FEMA reported creating a separate  vulnerability assessment that accounts for 20 percent of the overall risk  assessment for states, and territories, and the top 100 metropolitan areas  for use in the State Homeland Grant Program and the Urban Areas  Security Initiative grant program.

In our 2011 high- risk update, we reported that DHS has taken action to implement,  transform, and strengthen its management functions. The Secretary and  Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, and other senior officials, have  demonstrated commitment and top leadership support to address the  department\u2019s management challenges. In January 2011, DHS provided  us with its Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management, which  summarized the department\u2019s preliminary plans for addressing the high- risk area, and DHS updated this strategy in June 2011. We provided DHS  with feedback on the January 2011 strategy and have worked with the  department to monitor implementation efforts. For example, we noted that  the January 2011 strategy was generally responsive to actions and  outcomes we identified for the department to address the high-risk area.  However, we noted that, in most cases, the strategy did not identify the  specific resources needed to implement planned corrective actions,  making it difficult to assess the extent to which DHS has the capacity to  implement these actions. Additionally, we noted that the strategy did not  provide information on the underlying metrics or factors DHS used to rate  its progress, making it difficult for us to assess DHS\u2019s overall  characterizations of progress. In the June 2011 update, DHS provided  ratings of its progress in implementing corrective actions related to each  management function. We are assessing DHS\u2019s ratings and the June  2011 update, and plan to provide the department with our feedback later  this year.", "Going forward, to address the long-standing problems in its management  functions and in the integration of those functions, DHS needs to  implement its Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management; continue its  efforts to identify and acquire resources needed to achieve key actions  and outcomes; implement a program to monitor and validate its corrective  actions; and show measurable, sustainable progress in implementing  corrective actions and achieving key outcomes.", "DHS developed processes and policies for managing its  acquisitions, but faces significant challenges in ensuring proper  implementation. DHS has taken steps to strengthen acquisition  oversight processes, but it continues to face obstacles in managing its  acquisitions and ensuring proper implementation and departmentwide  coordination. We previously reported that DHS faced challenges related  to acquisition oversight, cost growth, and schedule delays. In August  2007, DHS established the Acquisition Program Management Division  under the Office of the Chief Procurement Officer to help strengthen  acquisition management within the department. Further, in June 2010, we  reported that DHS continued to develop its acquisition oversight function  and had begun to implement a revised acquisition management directive  that includes more detailed guidance for programs to use when informing  component and departmental decision making. We also reported that the  senior-level Acquisition Review Board had met more frequently and  provided programs decision memorandums with action items to improve  performance. However, while the Acquisition Review Board reviewed 24  major acquisition programs in fiscal years 2008 and 2009, more than 40  major acquisition programs had not been reviewed, and programs had  not consistently implemented action items identified as part of the review  by established deadlines. In July 2011, DHS reported that the Acquisition  Program Management Division in 2009 started conducting annual  portfolio program reviews with components with the goal of ensuring that  major programs receive at least one review on an annual basis, and that  DHS had conducted reviews of additional programs through the  Acquisition Review Board in fiscal years 2010 and 2011.", "Our work has also shown that departmental concerns exist about the  accuracy of cost estimates for some of DHS\u2019s major programs. In  addition, over half of the programs we reviewed for our June 2010 report  awarded contracts to initiate acquisition activities without component or  department approval of documents essential to planning acquisitions,  such as mission need statements outlining the specific functional  capabilities required to accomplish DHS\u2019s mission and objectives;  operational requirements; and acquisition program baselines.  Additionally, in November 2010, leveraging our work, the DHS Office of  Inspector General (IG) identified acquisition management as a major  challenge facing the department. We have made a number of  recommendations to DHS to strengthen its acquisition management  functions, such as establishing a departmental joint requirements  oversight board to review and approve acquisition requirements, and  ensuring major investments comply with established component and  departmental review policy standards. DHS generally agreed and is  working to address them by, among other things, establishing an  Investment Review Board to help oversee the status of all acquisition  investments; expanding its Acquisition Corps to provide trained  procurement and program management professionals to manage DHS\u2019s  most critical acquisition programs; developing a tool to track programs\u2019  cost, schedule, and performance indicators; and evaluating the  effectiveness of award fees and performance incentives. These are  positive actions that should better position DHS to meet its acquisition  needs. However, moving forward, DHS will need to continue to  demonstrate sustainable progress in implementing these actions and  delivering programs that meet cost, schedule, and performance  expectations. interrelated management controls and capabilities. For example, DHS  continued to issue annual updates to its enterprise architecture that  added previously missing scope and depth, and further improvements  were planned to incorporate the level of content, referred to as segment  architectures, needed to effectively introduce new systems and modify  existing ones. In addition, in July 2011, DHS reported that the  department had begun tracking implementation of our Enterprise  Architecture Management Maturity Framework and had developed plans  to improve enterprise architecture maturity within each component and  departmentwide. We further reported that DHS redefined its information  technology acquisition and investment management policies, practices,  and structures, including establishing a system life cycle management  methodology, and increased its information technology acquisition  workforce. In addition, in August 2011, DHS reported that it had efforts  underway to establish an information technology program manager  certification track intended to assist in managing information technology  program management challenges.", "Nevertheless, challenges remain relative to, for example, fully defining  key system investment and acquisition management policies and  procedures for information technology. Moreover, the extent to which  DHS implemented these investment and acquisition management policies  and practices on major information technology programs has been  inconsistent. For example, our work showed that major information  technology acquisition programs were not subjected to executive-level  acquisition and investment management reviews. As a result, major  programs aimed at delivering important mission capabilities had not lived  up to their capability, benefit, cost, and schedule expectations. those for configuring desktop computers and wireless communication  devices. Additionally, in November 2010, the DHS IG identified  information technology management as a major challenge facing the  department. For example, the DHS IG reported that the department faces  challenges as it attempts to create a unified information technology  infrastructure for effective integration and agencywide management of  information technology assets and programs. We made  recommendations to strengthen DHS information technology  management, such as establishing procedures for implementing project- specific investment management policies, and policies and procedures for  portfolio-based investment management. DHS is working to strengthen  these areas by, for example, developing a process for information  technology acquisition management to help ensure that each investment  begins with a successful plan and road map for its life cycle and by  establishing executive steering committees to monitor the cost and  schedule performance of all high-risk information technology investments.  While these are positive steps that should better position the department  in managing its information technology investments moving forward, DHS  will need to continue to make measurable progress in implementing these  actions and successfully developing and deploying information  technology programs. consolidate its disparate systems. In addition, DHS has not been able to  obtain an unqualified audit opinion on its consolidated financial  statements (i.e., prepare a set of financial statements that are considered  reliable). For fiscal year 2010, the independent auditor issued a  disclaimer on DHS\u2019s consolidated financial statements and identified  deficiencies in DHS\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Until these  weaknesses are resolved, DHS will not be in position to provide reliable,  timely, and useful financial data to support day-to-day decision making. In  addition, as a result of these weaknesses, in November 2010 the DHS IG  assessed financial management as one of the major management  challenges facing the department. DHS has taken steps to prepare and  implement corrective action plans for its internal control weaknesses  through its Internal Control Playbook, DHS\u2019s annual plan to design and  implement departmentwide internal controls. Further, in fiscal year 2010  DHS committed to the goal of receiving a qualified audit opinion on its  consolidated balance sheet in fiscal year 2011, and the department is  working toward that goal by, for example, focusing on strengthening  budgetary resource processes and payment management, and  remediating financial management issues at the U.S. Coast Guard. These  are positive first steps toward achieving a successful full scope audit of  the department\u2019s consolidated financial statements and, if implemented  effectively, should help DHS strengthen its financial management  functions. objectives, and performance measures for human capital management.  These strategies are promising, but DHS has faced challenges in  implementing its human capital functions, including hiring people with the  needed skills and abilities in areas such as acquisition management, for  example. Further, our prior work suggests that successful organizations  empower and involve their employees to gain insights about operations  from a frontline perspective, increase their understanding and acceptance  of organizational goals and objectives, and improve motivation and  morale. However, DHS\u2019s scores on the Partnership for Public Service\u2019s  2010 rankings of the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government  improved from prior years, but in 2010, it was ranked 28 out of 32  agencies in the Best Places to Work ranking on overall scores for  employee satisfaction and commitment. steering committee to provide oversight of the department\u2019s language  requirements. DHS reported that it is also working to address its human  capital management challenges by, among other things, developing  component operational plans for the Workforce Strategy, tracking those  plans against a common set of performance measures, and implementing  comprehensive workforce planning to link the department\u2019s strategic  goals, mission critical occupations, and workforce capacity and  capabilities.

In addition to these strategic  measures, the department has 132 management measures, which DHS  uses for assessing programmatic performance and for resource allocation  and other internal decision making purposes, such as program  evaluation. In addition, in July 2011, DHS reported that the department  has identified 24 areas for focused efforts to develop enhanced  measures, based on guidance from DHS leadership and the Office of  Management and Budget.

In such instances, proxy  measures\u2014or indirect indicators\u2014should be designed to assess the  effectiveness of program functions. Outcome measures are helpful to  departmental decision makers and managers, as they describe the  products and services delivered by a program over a period of time.

In our ongoing review of DHS\u2019s QHSR, we found that DHS  considered various factors in identifying high priority BUR initiatives for  implementation in fiscal year 2012, but did not include risk information as  one of these factors. Consideration of risk information could help  strengthen DHS\u2019s prioritization of mechanisms for implementing the  QHSR, including determining which BUR initiatives could be implemented  in the short or longer term, and the resources required for  implementation. We plan to report on the final results of this work later  this year.", "Also, with regard to transportation security, DHS has not fully utilized risk  information in its strategic planning and prioritization efforts. For example,  in March 2009 we reported that TSA had developed an approach to  prioritization of its security activities based primarily on intelligence  instead of comprehensive risk assessments. We reported that DHS had  not reviewed or validated the methodology for this approach; thus, TSA  lacked assurance that its approach provided the information needed to  guide investment decisions to ensure resources were allocated to the  highest risks. Further, with regard to planning efforts, in October 2009, we  reported that TSA\u2019s strategic plan to guide research, development, and  deployment of passenger checkpoint screening technologies was not risk- based. We noted that lacking such information, DHS could not provide  reasonable assurance that its strategy was effectively addressing security  gaps, prioritizing investments based on risk, and targeting resources  toward security measures that would have the greatest impact. Among  other things, we recommended that DHS conduct a complete risk  assessment related to TSA\u2019s passenger screening program and  incorporate the results into the program\u2019s strategy. DHS generally  concurred and reported actions underway to address them. For example,  in July 2011, TSA reported beginning to use a risk management analysis  process to analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of potential  countermeasures and impact on the commercial aviation system.

In 2005, we designated  information sharing for homeland security as high risk because the  government faced serious challenges in analyzing information and  sharing it among federal, state, local, and other security partners in a  timely, accurate, and useful way to protect against terrorist threats. We  have further reported that DHS must effectively share terrorism-related  information with state and local law enforcement because they depend on  it to maintain awareness of emerging threats and to allocate homeland  security resources, among other things. Further, gaps in sharing, such as  agencies' failure to link information about the individual who attempted the  December 25, 2009, airline bombing, prevented him from being included  on the federal government\u2019s terrorist watchlist, a tool used by DHS to  screen for persons who pose a security risk.", "For the purposes of this report, we are generally highlighting examples of  key DHS areas related to information sharing on which we have recently  reported and not on areas on which we have not reported or conducted  limited audit work.

Related to this responsibility, DHS has been implementing its  information sharing policy and governance structure to improve how it  collects, analyzes, and shares homeland security information across the  department and with these state and local partners.", "DHS expanded and enhanced its sharing of information, but should  improve its assistance and services to state and local homeland  security partners and streamline some of its information sharing  mechanisms. In January 2011, DHS issued a plan for addressing the  areas for which it has responsibility under the terrorism-related  information sharing high-risk area. DHS identified strategies and  initiatives it had planned or underway to address our high-risk criteria and  outcomes we identified as important to successfully managing risks that  exist due to gaps in information sharing. For example, the plan discussed  steps for developing a governance structure for information sharing and  beginning efforts to develop a set of metrics for measuring information  sharing performance and results. We provided DHS with feedback on this  plan. Among other things, we noted the department needs to move  toward a system where it accounts for information sharing initiatives  against a baseline set of defined capabilities\u2014such as information  sharing mechanisms, personnel, and technology\u2014that are needed, to  help decision makers weigh progress achieved and remaining to inform  investments. Subsequent to our feedback, in July 2011, DHS reported  that it had established performance measures for assessing its  information sharing efforts.

The office  determined information needs\u2014which are owned and controlled by the  states\u2014for 9 of the 50 states and was working with the remaining states  to identify their needs. However, we reported that the Office of  Intelligence and Analysis had not established mutually agreed upon  milestones for completing this effort.

For example, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis deployed  more than 60 intelligence officers to fusion centers nationwide to assist  state and local partners in areas such as obtaining relevant intelligence  products and leveraging DHS capabilities to support their homeland  security missions. However, the office had not yet defined how it planned  to meet its state and local information-sharing mission by identifying and  documenting the specific programs and activities that are most important  for executing this mission. Moreover, its performance measures did not  allow the office to demonstrate the expected outcomes and effectiveness  of programs and activities that support state and local partners. gaps, and collection requirements.

However, DHS had  not set standard performance measures for the centers. We  recommended that DHS define the steps it will take to design and  implement such a set of measures and commit to a target timeframe for  completing them. DHS concurred and stated that it has started to develop  a framework to demonstrate the value and impact of the national network  of fusion centers, and is using nationwide assessment data to support the  development of specific performance measures. These efforts should  help DHS strengthen its assessment of fusion centers\u2019 performance, but it  is too soon to assess results as DHS is in the process of implementing  these efforts.

For  example, in September 2010, we reported that DHS made progress in  researching and developing container security technologies. Specifically,  we reported that since fiscal year 2004 DHS conducted research and  development for four container security technology projects to monitor  cargo tampering and, according to DHS, provide a global communication  system to securely transmit information to DHS components responsible  for port security. Moreover, in June 2010 we reported that DHS made  significant progress in deploying radiation detection equipment to scan  cargo and conveyances entering the United States through fixed land and  sea ports of entry for nuclear and radiological materials.

DNDO pursued the acquisition and deployment of the cargo  advanced automated radiography system without fully understanding  that it would not fit within existing inspection lanes at ports of entry.  This occurred because, during the first year or more of the program,  DNDO and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) had few  discussions about operating requirements for primary inspection lanes  at ports of entry.

In March 2011, we reported that the independent testing and  evaluation of the Secure Border Initiative Network\u2019s virtual fence Block  1 capability to determine its operational effectiveness and suitability  was not complete at the time DHS reached its decision regarding the  future of the Secure Border Initiative Network, or requested fiscal year  2012 funding to deploy the new Alternative (Southwest) Border  Technology.We reported that because the new Alternative  (Southwest) Border Technology incorporates a mix of technology that  includes an Integrated Fixed Tower surveillance system similar to that  currently used in the Secure Border Initiative Network, such testing  and evaluation could have informed DHS\u2019s decision about moving  forward with the new technology deployment.   In September 2010, we reported that S&T\u2019s master plans for  conducting operational testing of container security technologies did  not reflect all of the operational scenarios that CBP was considering  for implementation.

Our prior work shows that cost-benefit  analyses help decision makers assess and prioritize resource  investments and consider potentially more cost-effective alternatives. For  example, in 2006, we recommended that DHS\u2019s decision to deploy next- generation radiation-detection equipment, or advanced spectroscopic  portals, used to detect smuggled nuclear or radiological materials, be  based on an analysis of both the benefits and costs and a determination  of whether any additional detection capability provided by the portals was  worth their additional cost.DHS subsequently issued a cost-benefit  analysis, but we reported that this analysis did not provide a sound  analytical basis for DHS\u2019s decision to deploy the portals. In June 2009,  we also reported that an updated cost-benefit analysis might show that  DNDO\u2019s plan to replace existing equipment with advanced spectroscopic  portals was not justified, particularly given the marginal improvement in  detection of certain nuclear materials required of advanced spectroscopic  portals and the potential to improve the current-generation portal  monitors\u2019 sensitivity to nuclear materials, most likely at a lower cost. At  that time, DNDO officials stated that they planned to update the cost- benefit analysis. In July 2011, DHS announced that DNDO and CBP  would end the advanced spectroscopic portal project as originally  conceived given the challenges the program faced. DHS reported that it  plans to deploy the existing units to field locations to gather operational  data to support future planning efforts. investment life cycle and participate in new councils and boards DHS is  planning to create to help ensure that test and evaluation methods are  appropriately considered as part of DHS\u2019s overall research and  development investment strategies. In addition, DHS reported that the  new councils and boards it is planning to establish would be responsible  for, among other things, making decisions on research and development  initiatives based on factors such as viability and affordability, and  overseeing key acquisition decisions for major programs using baseline  and actual data. According to DHS, S&T will help ensure that new  technologies are properly scoped, developed, and tested before being  implemented. In July 2011, S&T reported that it established a new group  to work with DHS components to, among other things, help ensure that  operational requirements are completely specified and validated and that  comprehensive cost-benefit analyses are performed to identify the best  alternative for meeting identified mission needs. However, as DHS has  recently established this group, it is too soon to assess its effectiveness.  DHS also reports that it is working with components to improve the quality  and accuracy of cost estimates and increased its staff during fiscal year  2011 to develop independent cost estimates, a best practice, to ensure  the accuracy and credibility of program costs.
