OJJDP has several administrative review and approval processes in place that have contributed to delays in grantees' ability to begin spending their funds. For instance, grantees cannot access their funds until OJJDP completes its internal review of grantees' budgets, a step that has taken more than 2 months, on average, after the project period began. Further, OJJDP's guidance on grant extensions is unclear and irregularly enforced. For example, one document states that generally only one extension per award is permissible, while another states that multiple extensions may be granted for up to a total of 5 years. OJJDP guidance further requires grantees to submit a narrative justification with their requests. However, OJJDP approved 72 of 73 extension requests from fiscal years 2010 through 2013 without such justification.

These VOCA grant programs are among the more than 40 discretionary  grant programs that OJJDP administers. The VOCA programs are  designed to help improve the investigation and prosecution of child abuse  cases, largely by providing funding, training, and technical assistance to  Children\u2019s Advocacy Centers (CAC) throughout the nation. CACs are  child-friendly facilities in which law enforcement, child protection,  prosecution, mental health, medical, and victim advocacy professionals  work together to investigate abuse, help children heal from abuse, and  hold offenders accountable.

Specifically, as shown in figure 2, we  identified three main sources of delay for VOCA grants that OJJDP  awarded from fiscal years 2010 through 2013: (1) project period start date  and award notification, (2) budget approval, and (3) conference cost  approval.", "Project period start date and award notification\u2014As shown in  figure 2, OJJDP notified grantees that they had been selected to  receive VOCA awards\u2014and officially obligated the federal funds\u201433  days, on average, after the start of the project period for VOCA grants  OJJDP awarded from fiscal years 2010 through 2013. However, we  identified variation in the average length of time between the project  period start date and the award notification date across the grant  years we reviewed. Specifically, for fiscal years 2010 through 2012,  the project period start date was August 1, and OJJDP notified  grantees of their award an average of 41 days after the project period  start date. OJJDP does not obligate award funds to grantees until  OJJDP makes this award notification, and accordingly, VOCA  grantees in these years were, on average, unable to expend grant  funds for more than a month out of their 12-month project period.  Beginning in fiscal year 2013, OJP changed the project period start  date for all of its awards from August 1 to October 1. As in prior  years, OJJDP notified selected VOCA grantees of their award in late  August or in September, but this notification now took place an  average of 14 days before the project period start date. OJJDP  retained the October 1 project period start date for fiscal year 2014  VOCA awards. OJJDP officials stated that notifying grantees before  the project period start date\u2014as was done in fiscal years 2013 and  2014\u2014is ideal because it maximizes the amount of time within the 12- month project period when grantees have access to their awarded  grant funds.", "Budget approval\u2014Before VOCA grantees can begin expending their  grant funds, they must also wait until OCFO has reviewed and given  final approval to the project budget that they submitted with their  application packets. This budget review process took 39 days from  the date award notification was made, or 72 days from the project  period start date, on average, for fiscal years 2010 through 2013.  OCFO officials told us that they strive to complete this budget review  before OJJDP notifies applicants that they will receive an award, but  that this rarely happens because of the timing of the congressional  appropriations process and other relevant procedural factors, such as  when the solicitation is posted, the duration of the peer review  process, and the total volume of budgets that OCFO has to review  across the universe of OJJDP grant programs. After the program  office reviews the applications internally to ensure that the budgets  align with the programmatic goals of the VOCA program, OJJDP  passes the budgets on to OCFO, which reviews the budgets to ensure  compliance with federal financial regulations. OCFO officials can  begin their preliminary budget review upon receipt of the budgets from  the program office, but they cannot finalize their budget review  process until DOJ receives its annual appropriation\u2014the timing of  which varies by year\u2014and OJJDP finalizes available award amounts  based on this appropriation. Once OJJDP notifies grantees of their  award amounts, and OCFO provides final budget clearance, grantees  are able to begin expending their grant funds.", "As with the award notification process, we identified year-to-year  variation in the length of the budget review process. For example,  budget approval took 11 days for fiscal year 2011 VOCA awards and  71 days for fiscal year 2012 VOCA awards, on average, from the  award notification date. The OCFO officials we spoke with could not  explain the specific reasons for this variation, but noted that,  generally, OCFO\u2019s ability to approve grantees\u2019 budgets in a timely  manner depends, in part, on the volume of grantee budgets OCFO is  reviewing at any given time.", "Conference cost approval\u2014DOJ requires, in accordance with OMB  guidance, that grantees obtain pre-approval before incurring  conference expenses. Through its OJP Financial Guide, OJP  broadly defines conferences to include meetings, retreats, seminars,  symposia, events, and group training activities. OJP officials stated  that DOJ established this preapproval requirement in October 2011  following a September 2011 DOJ Office of the Inspector General audit  that found that some DOJ components had not minimized conference  costs as required by federal and DOJ guidance.", "When the conference cost requirement was first implemented, in  October 2011, OJJDP officials stated that review and approval of  conference cost requests took as long as 5 to 6 months. However,  DOJ has subsequently made changes to reduce the amount of time it  takes to review and approve conference cost requests. For example,  according to OJP officials, DOJ released an official policy in July 2012  outlining the requirements for conference cost approval submissions  and also instituted a more streamlined approval process for requests  under $100,000. Additionally, OJP officials noted that OCFO  developed improved software solutions and provided grantees the  opportunity to submit blanket requests for approval of multiple events  that are similar in nature and scope. OJP officials stated that approval  now generally takes about 2 to 3 months, and a VOCA grantee stated  that the process has improved since the requirement was first  implemented.", "While these improvements have reduced the conference cost review  and approval time, OJJDP officials acknowledge that the conference  cost approval submission requirement has hindered grantees\u2019 ability  to expend grant funds within the allotted 12-month project period, and  VOCA grantees confirmed this. Specifically, DOJ requires grantees to  submit planned expenses associated with training and conferences  for preapproval at least 90 days before the event is to take place.  Further, OJJDP officials stated that in order for a grantee to have  enough time to finalize the event logistics, notify attendees, and make  other necessary arrangements following DOJ approval of the  grantee\u2019s request, the grantee really needs to submit its conference  cost approval request about 6 months before the event is to take  place. This would provide the grantee with about 3 months to finalize  the event once DOJ had approved the request. VOCA grantees  cannot submit these conference cost approval requests to DOJ until  OCFO has approved their grant project budgets\u2014a process that has  taken more than 2 months, on average, from the project period start  date, as discussed above. Accordingly, one VOCA grantee reported  being unable to conduct training and conference activities for the first  6 to 7 months of the grant\u2019s 12-month project period. VOCA grantees  reported that complying with the preapproval requirement has  hindered their ability to expend grant funds because they are not able  to hold any conference or training events\u2014a key purpose of their  grants\u2014during the initial months of their grant project period while  they are awaiting pre-approval. One VOCA grantee reported having to  cancel a planned training event because DOJ did not approve the  request in time, another grantee stated that the conference cost  approval process creates a lot of work for both the grantee and DOJ  and makes it more difficult to expend grant funds, while another  grantee stated that the process hinders its ability to provide training  and technical assistance, which are key grant program goals and  objectives.", "Despite efforts to reduce these sources of delay, the administrative  requirements described above continue to contribute to challenges in  VOCA grantees\u2019 ability to fully expend their grant awards within the  original 12-month project period that OJJDP has established in the VOCA  grant solicitations. Grantees also commit to fully expending their funds in  12 months when outlining their budget and project plans in their grant  applications. However, because we found that VOCA grant activities are  not being completed within the time parameters OJJDP established for  the grant program, this may affect the ability of grantees to complete their  grant goals and objectives. The OJP Grant Manager\u2019s Manual states that  program managers are responsible for setting a realistic project period  that accounts for the true length of projects to ensure that the grantee has  the full project period to complete activities and draw down funds, thereby  minimizing the need for no-cost extensions. According to OJP officials,  the selection of the VOCA grants\u2019 project period length is an OJJDP  policy decision. OJJDP officials stated that they have always had a 12- month project period in place for VOCA awards because funding for  VOCA is appropriated on an annual basis and OJJDP expects the grant  award to cover 12 months of expenses. However, in the event that  OJJDP is unable to further expedite the administrative review and  approval processes discussed above, it would benefit from reexamining  whether 12 months is an appropriate project period length to ensure that  VOCA grantees are well positioned to fully expend their grant funds. Such  an assessment would help ensure that the project period length is  realistic in light of the irrevocable administrative delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OJJDP\u2019s Guidance on Extensions Is Irregularly Enforced and Inconsistent", "paragraphs": ["OJJDP routinely approved VOCA grantees\u2019 requests for no-cost grant  extensions, but often did so without adhering to extension approval  guidelines, which we found to be inconsistent. By the end of fiscal year  2014, 15 of the 28 VOCA awards we included in our review had been fully  expended. Among these 15 VOCA awards, OJJDP approved an average  of 3 extensions per award, which extended the award for a total of 18  months, on average, beyond the initial 12-month project period.  Specifically, we found that OJJDP had approved all 73 extensions  requested by grantees across the 28 VOCA awards included in our  review, but often did so without adhering to guidance established in the  OJP Financial Guide, as shown in table 1. For example, the OJP  Financial Guide requires that grantees submit a narrative outlining both  the extraordinary circumstances that would justify the proposed extension  and the effect a denial of the request would have on the project or  program. However, of the 73 grant extension requests OJJDP approved  from fiscal years 2010 through 2013, 72 did not contain such a narrative.  Further, while the OJP Financial Guide states that generally only 1  extension per award will be permitted, of the 73 extension requests that  OJJDP approved, 45 extended the award more than once. Finally, while  the OJP Financial Guide states that the maximum extension allowable is  generally 12 months, OJJDP approved extensions for 3 awards that were  longer\u20141 for 13 months and 2 for 17 months.", "We also found that OJP does not have clear and consistent guidance for  when a grant extension should be approved. In addition to the guidelines  contained in the OJP Financial Guide\u2014as outlined above in table 1\u2014the  OJP Grant Manager\u2019s Manual also contains guidance on extensions. In at  least one instance, the guidance within these two documents is  inconsistent. For example, the OJP Grant Manager\u2019s Manual states that  grant awards are eligible to be extended for up to 12 months at a time for  up to 5 years in total. However, the OJP Financial Guide states that,  generally, only one extension per award should be granted, and that,  generally, the maximum allowable extension is for 12 months. The VOCA  program manager told us that when approving more than one extension  on the same award, she follows the OJP Grant Manager\u2019s Manual, and  that she was not familiar with the guidance in the OJP Financial Guide  that states that grant awards should generally be extended only once.", "According to OCFO officials, the OJP Financial Guide represents the  general guidelines and preferences for no-cost extensions but allows OJP  the flexibility, if needed, to grant extensions outside of those general  guidelines. Further, OCFO officials stated that the guidance in the OJP  Grant Manager\u2019s Manual represents the upper limit on the flexibility that  OJP is afforded in the OJP Financial Guide. We have previously reported  on instances in which DOJ grant guidance was inconsistent, and we  stressed the importance of establishing mutually reinforcing strategies  and harmonizing program requirements to ensure consistency. Further,  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that  information should be communicated to management in a form that  enables management to carry out its responsibilities. Without clear  guidance on the circumstances and requirements for approving no-cost  extension requests, the VOCA program manager cannot ensure that she  is consistently adhering to the relevant requirements.", "In combination with the administrative process delays described earlier,  OJJDP\u2019s routine extension of VOCA grants\u2019 project periods\u2014made  without adherence to stated guidance\u2014has led VOCA grantees to  maintain unexpended balances from prior-year grants while continuing to  receive new grant awards from OJJDP. Some VOCA grantees also  reported expending past years\u2019 grant funds conservatively to ensure that  grant funds would be available to expend as they awaited administrative  clearance of their current-year award. For example, OJJDP awarded  VOCA grantees $15.6 million in fiscal year 2013, even though about $8.7  million in VOCA grant funding awarded to these same grantees in fiscal  year 2012 remained unexpended when the fiscal year 2013 grants were  awarded. In some cases, very little of the grant funding awarded in fiscal  year 2012 had been expended when the fiscal year 2013 grants were  awarded. For example, in September 2013, OJJDP awarded the Western  Regional CAC with a fiscal year 2013 VOCA grant of over $1 million when  the grantee had expended less than 1 percent of its fiscal year 2012  award. As seen in figure 3, this trend is consistent over the period of our  review, though grantees have made some progress in more fully  expending prior years\u2019 grants since fiscal year 2010, when an average of  73 percent of grant funding had not been expended when OJJDP  awarded fiscal year 2011 grant funding. Two years later, grantees had not  expended an average of 59 percent of the fiscal year 2012 awards when  OJJDP awarded the fiscal year 2013 VOCA grants. However, this  reduction was not shared broadly across all of the VOCA grant programs.  In some cases, the percentage of unexpended grant funds increased over  this time period. For example, for the Regional CAC Program, grantees\u2019  percentages of unexpended grant funds increased from 73 percent of  fiscal year 2010 grant funding when OJJDP awarded fiscal year 2011  grant funding to 86 percent of fiscal year 2012 funding when OJJDP  awarded fiscal year 2013 grant funding.", "By carrying over unexpended grant funds beyond the terms of their initial  project periods, grantees are using prior years\u2019 awards to pay for current  activities. Thus, grantees may be delaying implementation of more  recently approved planned projects and activities to improve the  investigation, prosecution, and treatment of child abuse. Establishing  and enforcing clear requirements for approving no-cost grant extensions  would better enable OJJDP to ensure that VOCA funds are being used in  a timely manner to support those directly assisting victims of child abuse."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OJJDP\u2019s Performance Measures and Its Data Collection Methods Are Not Fully Aligned, Hindering Its Ability to Assess Grantee Performance", "paragraphs": ["OJJDP does not have the performance data necessary to assess VOCA  grantees\u2019 performance because the measures it has established to  assess performance do not fully align with the tools it has created to  collect desired performance information from grantees.", "Each time OJJDP announces available funding through a specific grant  program, OJJDP develops a solicitation to describe the program to  applicants and to outline the set of performance measures to which  grantees will be held accountable once funded. OJJDP expects grantees  to report on these performance measures using its Data Collection and  Technical Assistance Tool\u2014developed in 2005 as a comparable way to  collect quantitative performance data from grantees across all of its grant  programs that it could analyze in a quick and efficient manner. As  described earlier, all OJJDP grantees, including VOCA grantees, are  required to submit performance data reports using the DCTAT twice per  year, in conjunction with their semiannual narrative progress reports.  These narrative reports allow the grantees to provide qualitative data  describing their activities in a more general manner, but these reports do  not provide OJJDP with information to assess grantee performance  against the performance measures they established in the grant  solicitations. According to the OJJDP performance measures  coordinator, when developing solicitations, each grant program manager  should be selecting and including specific performance measures from  the universe of DCTAT measures. Further, the solicitations contain  instructions directing grantees to use the DCTAT system to report on  these measures. However, we found a misalignment between the  performance measures contained in the VOCA grant solicitations and the  universe of DCTAT measures. Specifically, OJJDP outlined a total of 44  performance measures across the 5 fiscal year 2012 VOCA grant  solicitations that it wanted grantees to address, but the DCTAT had  corresponding measures available for just 33 of these 44 measures. We  also found that even when corresponding DCTAT measures were  available, VOCA grantees did not include all such measures in their  DCTAT reports (see fig. 4). Specifically, of the 33 solicitation performance  measures that had corresponding DCTAT measures available, grantees  included just 13 in their fiscal year 2012 DCTAT reports. For example, the  fiscal year 2012 Regional CAC Program solicitation contained 10  performance measures, but the grantees included information on just 1 of  these 10 measures in their DCTAT submissions. Accordingly, OJJDP did  not have information to assess these grantees\u2019 performance against the  other 9 measures that OJJDP had established in its Regional CAC  Program grant solicitation.", "When we discussed with OJJDP officials the misalignment between the  solicitation measures and the measures grantees include in their DCTAT  reports, they could not explain the discrepancy. Further, OJJDP officials  told us that they have made certain DCTAT measures, such as those  addressing the use of evidence-based practices, mandatory to help  ensure that all grantees are reporting on common elements. These  mandatory DCTAT measures are used to inform DOJ\u2019s annual  performance report, strategic plan, and other similar activities. However,  these mandatory measures do not necessarily relate to the performance  measures outlined in each individual grant solicitation. In addition to the  mandatory measures, OJJDP officials also explained that they designed  the DCTAT to include an array of optional measures, such as those  addressing the provision of technical assistance, through which grantees  can report on data elements of greatest salience to their work. Through  these optional measures, OJJDP expects grantees to respond to the  performance measures outlined in the grant solicitation. Nevertheless, as  shown in figure 4, the DCTAT submissions that VOCA grantees provided  OJJDP in fiscal year 2012 were not fully responsive to the performance  measures outlined in the VOCA grant solicitations. Accordingly, OJJDP  does not have complete data to assess grantees\u2019 performance against  the performance measures it established in the solicitation.", "VOCA grantees told us that when completing their DCTAT reports, they  complete the mandatory measures that the DCTAT system prompts them  to respond to, and may also report on optional measures. However, five  of the six VOCA grantees told us that they have not received guidance or  feedback from OJJDP on which optional DCTAT measures to include in  their reports. Accordingly, the grantees use their best judgment when  determining whether to include optional measures in their DCTAT reports.  For example, one grantee included eight optional measures in its fiscal  year 2012 DCTAT reports, but none of these optional measures  corresponded to the performance measures contained in the respective  VOCA grant solicitation. This grantee told us that it selected these  optional measures because they seemed to align with the goals,  objectives, and outcomes of its grant. OJJDP does offer some training to  grantees on the DCTAT system, but our review of this training content  showed that the training focused on reporting against the mandatory  measures and did not include a discussion of the need to use the DCTAT  optional measures in order to respond to the performance measures  outlined in the grant solicitation.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government requires  agencies to engage in control activities\u2014such as establishing and  reviewing performance measures\u2014to ensure that management directives  are carried out. These standards further require that information should  be recorded and communicated to stakeholders in a form that enables  them to carry out their responsibilities.

The Office of  Justice Programs (OJP) instituted a policy in 2007 capping the amount of  grant funds that could be used for employee compensation. This policy  applies to all recipients of OJP discretionary grant awards over $250,000.  In accordance with Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A- 87, which requires federally funded compensation be \u201creasonable,\u201d OJP  set the cap at 110 percent of the maximum amount payable to a member  of the federal government\u2019s Senior Executive Service (SES). Specifically,  grantees were prohibited from using grant funds to pay for any portion of  an employee\u2019s cash compensation if that employee\u2019s total cash  compensation (from all sources) exceeded the cap.", "In 2010, in response to departmental concerns that the restrictions were  hindering OJP\u2019s ability to attract experienced, high-quality researchers  and experts, OJP revised its compensation cap policy. The revised policy  permits grantees to compensate employees at rates above the 110  percent cap provided that the portion of an employee\u2019s total annual  compensation paid with federal funds does not exceed the cap. For  example, the maximum SES salary for fiscal year 2013 was $179,700,  meaning that the OJP compensation cap applies for salaries of $197,670  or more\u2014110 percent of the SES salary level.

However, under the revised 2010 policy, the grantee would be allowed to  contribute $100,000 in federal funding toward the $200,000 salary  because the new policy limits the amount of federal funds that a grantee  may direct toward an employee\u2019s compensation rather than limiting the  total compensation that an employee may receive.", "Both the 2007 and 2010 policies include a provision stating that grantees  may apply for a waiver of the compensation restrictions. OJP officials  stated that they consider several factors when evaluating a waiver  request, including the particular qualifications and expertise of the  individual, the uniqueness of the service being provided, and the  individual\u2019s specific knowledge of the program or project being  undertaken with award funds, among other factors.", "For the VOCA grant programs, OJP has approved three waivers since the  compensation cap policy was instituted, in fiscal year 2007.

For example, in fiscal year 2007, the Midwest  Regional CAC sought to use VOCA funds to support the physicians\u2019  annual salaries of $201,905 and $187,200.
