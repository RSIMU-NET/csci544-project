DOJ stated that we  had not recognized that circumstances had changed since the inception of  our review and that departmental leaders had agreed on a common  approach that would address concerns we have raised. However, we  believe that our review accurately characterizes the evolution of  circumstances throughout the development of IWN as well as the current  status of the program. For example, we noted in our briefing slides that  the departments had collaborated productively on the Seattle/Blaine pilot  program, which served as a working demonstration and test of the IWN  design. We also acknowledged in the slides that the departments had  recently established a memorandum of understanding (MOU) regarding  development of interoperable communications systems in the future.  While that step is important, an effective governance structure still needs  to be implemented before decisions can be made and procedures  established for overcoming the differing missions, priorities, funding  structures, and capabilities among the departments.", "DOJ also commented that the current business environment is not  conducive to a single mobile-radio solution, and that such an approach is  no longer feasible or cost-effective. In the slides we pointed out that a  single, common project or system is not necessarily the best solution, and  our conclusions do not advocate such a system as the best solution. We  concluded that successful collaboration on a joint solution\u2014whether that  solution is IWN or an alternative approach\u2014is necessary to promote  efficient use of resources, reduce duplicative efforts, and encourage  interoperability. Although a joint solution could be based on a single,  nationwide network, such as an extension of the original IWN design, it  could also be, for example, a mutually agreed-upon strategy for developing  separate but interoperable networks and systems.", "DOJ stated that it planned to continue pursuing eventual integration and  interoperability with DHS and other entities using common standards and  guidelines rather than through a single, central solution. We agree that the  implementation of common standards and guidelines are important and  can help facilitate a joint project such as this. The Seattle/Blaine pilot  project, for example, was based on the Project 25 set of standards.  However, agreement has not yet been reached on the standards and  guidelines that are to shape future collaboration among the departments  on a joint approach to radio communications. As reflected in the briefing  slides, we believe that success hinges on a means to overcome differences  in missions and cultures, a collaborative governance structure through  which decisions are made and disputes resolved, and a joint strategy to  align activities and resources to achieve a joint solution.", "DOJ also stated that where the report seemed to suggest that DOJ and  other agencies had not collaborated, that in fact the departments had  worked together and collaborated extensively. However, as described in  the briefing, we disagree with this statement. While DOJ has collaborated  with other agencies on the Seattle/Blaine pilot project, the agencies  determined that that specific system design could not be implemented on  a nationwide scale, and they have not acted collaboratively to identify an  alternative approach for a jointly coordinated communication solution. As  discussed in the briefing, while the departments recently established an  MOU regarding development of interoperable communications systems in  the future, no progress had been made in re-establishing the joint  governance structure outlined in the agreement, and the departments have  been actively working to develop independent communications systems.  In effectively abandoning collaboration on a joint solution, the  departments risk duplication of effort and inefficient use of resources as  they continue to invest significant resources in independent solutions.", "Further, these stovepipe efforts will not ensure the interoperability needed  to serve day-to-day law enforcement operations or a coordinated response  to terrorist or other events. As stated above, the adoption of key  collaboration practices will be critical to a successful outcome.", "Finally, the department stated that it understood GAO\u2019s concern that the  departments risk duplication of effort and that it had made great progress  in minimizing duplication/overlap, as evidenced by the Seattle/Blaine pilot  project. However, as discussed above, the pilot project has not been  chosen as a basis for a jointly coordinated, nationwide communications  solution, nor has any other specific strategy been adopted that would  provide assurance that duplication will be minimized in the future. DOJ  also agreed that agencies must begin meeting quarterly to improve  communications and that they must better document their overall,  collective strategy beyond the MOU. Until a joint strategy to align activities  and resources is adopted, we believe the potential for duplication and  overlap remains.", "In comments from DHS, the Director of the Departmental Audit Liaison  Office discussed the development of the IWN program and noted that  issues had been identified with joint governance, the management of  priorities and requirements across multiple departments, and addressing  user requirements within schedule constraints. In this regard, DHS stated  that our report was focused on mandating that the three agencies have one  radio communications solution and that it implied that any other option  would result in a stovepipe of non-interoperable communications systems.  We disagree. As discussed above, in the slides we pointed out that a single,  common project or system is not necessarily the best solution, and we do  not advocate such a system as the best solution. We concluded that  successful collaboration on a joint solution\u2014whether that solution is IWN  or an alternative approach\u2014is necessary to promote efficient use of  resources, reduce duplicative efforts, and encourage interoperability.  Although a joint solution could be based on a single, nationwide network,  such as an extension of the original IWN design, it could also be, for  example, a mutually agreed-upon strategy for developing separate but  interoperable networks and systems.", "Regarding the breakdown of the original collaborative structure for the  IWN program, DHS commented that DHS and DOJ are employing different  radio designs funded by Congress that are commensurate with spectrum  needs in their environments and that the two departments have different  regional priorities, such that a common system will not work on a national  level. In the briefing, we recognized that the two departments had different  priorities and that those differences led to an inability to resolve conflicts  on the original IWN program. However, as discussed above, in effectively  abandoning collaboration on a joint solution, the departments risk  duplication of effort and inefficient use of resources as they continue to  invest significant resources in independent solutions. Given their  differences, adoption of key collaboration practices will be critical to  ensuring that separate projects in the two departments are successfully  coordinated in the future so that radio communications are improved  among federal agencies, costs reduced, and duplication eliminated  wherever possible.", "DHS also commented that we had not discussed the departments\u2019  concerns about the projected expense of expanding the Seattle/Blaine  pilot project to a national level.  While we did not discuss specific cost  projections for this option, which is no longer being considered, we  recognize that any investment in coordinated future communications  between the departments will be substantial. Accordingly, it will be critical  to ensure a properly coordinated approach so that duplication and overlap  is avoided.", "Regarding current collaboration with DOJ and Treasury, DHS noted that a  memorandum of understanding had been signed in January 2008 and  described how decisions are to be made under this agreement. DHS went  on to describe internal priorities, such as the need for radio system  upgrades in Customs and Border Protection, and stated that any cross- departmental efforts should not result in delays to these priorities. We do  not dispute the urgency for upgrading radio systems that DHS cites.  However, given that all three departments have differing priorities, as  discussed in the slides, it remains critical that key collaboration practices  are adopted to ensure successful coordination across departments.", "Finally, DHS briefly outlined its vision for a \u201ctiered\u201d strategy for achieving  effective radio communications in a timely and cost-effective manner. DHS  stated that the first goal of the partnership will be to define an outcome  and an associated joint strategy. We agree that these elements\u2014along with  an effective governance structure that includes a formal process for  making decisions and resolving disputes\u2014are key elements for successful  collaboration and implementation of a joint radio communications  solution.", "In comments from the Treasury, the Chief Information Officer stated that  the department continued to be highly supportive of the overall goals of  the IWN program and looked forward to continuing to work with DOJ and  DHS to advance law enforcement and emergency services  communications.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees and the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security,  and Secretary of the Treasury.

We disagree that our conclusions advocate a single system as the best  solution and clarified our position in the briefing that a joint approach could mean a single  system or it could be a mutually agreed-upon strategy for developing separate but  interoperable networks.", "Second, DOJ officials stated that we misrepresented their efforts to work with other  agencies, including DHS, and that the department had tried to reach consensus and  compromise with DHS but organizational challenges could not be overcome. We  acknowledge that DOJ took steps to collaborate on IWN; however, we also note that  when the challenges of collaborating could not be overcome, progress stalled.

These practices include:   Defining and articulating a common outcome or purpose that overcomes  differences in department missions, cultures, and established ways of doing  business.", "Establishing a governance structure, including a collaborative management  structure with defined leadership, roles and responsibilities, and a formalized  process for making decisions and resolving disputes.", "Establishing mutually reinforcing or joint strategies that work in concert with those  of the partners or are joint in nature to align activities and resources to accomplish  the common outcome.", "Implementing these practices is critical to sustaining a successful inter-agency project  such as IWN.", "DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution  Given the importance of radio communications and the reality of limited resources, it is  critical that agencies find ways to work together to achieve effective and efficient  interoperable solutions. In particular, the advantages of collaborating to develop a joint  radio communications solution clearly outweigh the benefits of each department pursuing  its own radio communications initiative, as DOJ, DHS, and Treasury agreed when they  signed on to the IWN program. The benefits of developing IWN as a joint communications  solution, as identified by the program, include:   supporting departmental missions effectively and efficiently,   providing sufficient communications coverage for current operations,   achieving efficient use of radio spectrum,   improving interoperability with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies,   achieving cost efficiencies through resource consolidation and economies of  scale.", "Achieving these benefits hinges on successful inter-agency collaboration.", "DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution  Despite early progress, the departments are pursuing independent solutions  Although the departments made early progress in jointly developing and implementing a  pilot program, they are no longer pursuing IWN as a joint solution and instead are  independently modernizing their own wireless communications systems.", "DOJ and Treasury (and later DHS) contributed resources to develop an operational pilot  in the Seattle/Blaine area to demonstrate the original IWN design. This pilot provided a  working demonstration and test of the preliminary network design, generally improved  communications in the coverage area, addressed federal encryption requirements  through new equipment, established technical solutions for interoperability with selected  state and local organizations, and provided valuable lessons learned. While the pilot  remains operational and has been expanded to increase coverage in areas of  Washington and Oregon, several DOJ and DHS components in the region have been  unable to fully use the system due to unmet requirements. Components in the area  continue to maintain legacy networks to ensure complete coverage.", "Since the pilot demonstration, DOJ and DHS have concluded that the pilot design could  not be implemented jointly on a nationwide scale. DOJ officials expressed concern that it  would be too expensive to expand the pilot network to fulfill DOJ, DHS and Treasury  requirements on a nationwide scale, while DHS officials were also concerned that the  design would not be technically well suited to meet DHS needs.", "DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution  Since deciding not to proceed with the IWN pilot design jointly, the departments have not  developed an alternative approach for collaborating on a joint communications solution,  either through development of a single, nationwide network, such as an extension of the  original IWN design, or a through a mutually agreed-upon strategy for developing  separate but interoperable networks and systems that can accommodate the needs of all  participants and incorporate the lessons learned from prior efforts (such as the pilot). For  example:  The departments have not used their IWN contract as a vehicle for development  of a joint solution. For nearly three years, DOJ, DHS, and Treasury jointly  participated in the process of selecting a systems integrator. However, since that  selection, the departments have not used the IWN contract (awarded a year and  a half ago) to begin developing a joint nationwide radio communications solution.  Instead, the task order that has been issued based on the IWN contract is being  used for establishing a joint program office for the contractor and DOJ\u2014not for  DHS or Treasury. The task order specifies that the contractor will draft  architecture documents for developing a communications system for DOJ\u2014it  does not include DHS or Treasury.", "The formal governance structure for IWN originally supported by the three  departments has been disbanded. Specifically, the IWN Executive Board and the  National Project Team stopped meeting after award of the IWN contract.

According to the department, the  total cost is estimated at $1.23 billion, and the system will be implemented over 6- 7 years.", "DHS is pursuing multiple approaches at both the component and department  levels to meet different priorities. For example, since 2005, Customs and Border  Protection has been developing and implementing a nationwide radio  communications network intended to improve and update radio communications  for Customs and Border Protection officers and agents\u2014referred to as the  Tactical Communications Modernization Project. In contrast, Immigration and  Customs Enforcement officials have adopted a different approach, looking for  opportunities to strategically partner with other agencies and leverage existing  assets to meet their operational requirements. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement has submitted a number of proposals to the department for  approval. While initiatives such as these are reviewed by the DHS Office of the  Chief Information Officer, they are funded at the component level and focus on  meeting the needs of individual components.", "DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution  In addition to such component initiatives, the DHS Office of Emergency  Communications (OEC), which is responsible for IWN, is pursuing a high-level  strategy for developing radio communications networks, based on shared  infrastructure, as an alternative to the original IWN design. The OEC approach,  which has been explored with the assistance of the Federal Partnership for  Interoperable Communications, focuses on coordination with federal, state, and  local organizations that are building or planning to build large communications  networks so that these networks might also meet the needs of member federal  agencies. However, the OEC\u2019s shared infrastructure approach has yet to be  approved at the department level.

As  we previously mentioned, these practices include defining and articulating a common  outcome or purpose, establishing a governance structure, and establishing mutually  reinforcing or joint strategies to accomplish a common outcome. For example:   The departments have not defined and articulated a common outcome or purpose  that overcomes differences in department missions, cultures, and established  ways of doing business. Although the departments originally recognized the  benefits of collaborating on a joint solution, they allowed differences in priorities  and opinions to stall their collaboration efforts. Specifically, DOJ saw IWN as a  concept or vision for new development, which would culminate in a nationwide  radio communications network for federal law enforcement. DHS, in contrast,  considered the IWN contract to be a vehicle for systems integration. In addition,  DHS considered improving radio communications around the nation\u2019s borders to  be a major priority, while DOJ\u2019s priorities were focused in other areas of the  nation. Further, the departments could not agree on the direction that IWN should  take after deciding that the design of the pilot would not be appropriate for a  nationwide network. DOJ and DHS program officials have both acknowledged DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution  that differing priorities led to an inability to resolve conflicts. They further  explained that delays in progress and continued deterioration of legacy systems  led the departments to independently pursue other solutions.", "The departments did not establish a collaborative governance structure that  includes a management structure, defined roles and responsibilities, and a  formalized process for decision making and resolving disputes. Although the  departments attempted to establish a joint governance structure, it was not  effective at decision making and resolving disputes and the partnership was  discontinued. Both DOJ and DHS stated that making joint decisions in their  original partnership depended on reaching consensus among the departments,  and when consensus could not be reached, progress on IWN stalled.", "The departments did not establish a mutual or joint strategy to align activities and  resources to accomplish a common outcome. Despite acknowledging the  potential benefits from collaborating on a joint solution, the departments have not  produced a strategic or implementation plan that outlines a strategy for  developing a joint radio communications solution, whether that solution is IWN or  an alternative joint approach.", "DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution  The departments are aware that efforts to collaborate have not been successful. Although  they have established three high-level initiatives to address coordination, these initiatives  are not focused on implementing a collaborative joint communications solution across  DOJ, DHS, and Treasury. Specifically:   The three departments signed a new memorandum of understanding in January  2008 that aims at coordinating their joint wireless programs. Although the goals of  the current memorandum are similar to those that the departments specified in  their 2004 agreement for IWN, DOJ and DHS officials have stated that no  progress has been made in re-establishing the joint governance structure outlined  by the agreement. In addition, decision-making procedures outlined in the 2008  memorandum\u2014like those in the 2004 agreement\u2014do not clearly define how to  overcome barriers faced when consensus cannot be reached among the  departments. DOJ and DHS officials agreed the memorandum serves primarily as  a means for facilitating communication among the departments when  opportunities and funding are available.", "DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution   Participation in the Federal Partnership for Interoperable Communications is  voluntary for both federal and state entities, coordination occurs on an ad-hoc  basis, and meeting participants do not necessarily include officials who are in  positions to make decisions about their agency\u2019s radio communications programs.  As previously described, the DHS OEC\u2019s shared infrastructure approach is  intended to explore collaboration through the Federal Partnership for  Interoperable Communications and focuses on coordinating radio  communications initiatives among federal, state, and local organizations based on  operational needs. However, DOJ officials stated that the Federal Partnership for  Interoperable Communications serves primarily as a working group of technical  staff, while Treasury officials noted that, to date, they have attended the group\u2019s  meetings primarily as observers rather than as active participants. Therefore, it is  unclear whether this initiative can address the day-to-day mission needs of law  enforcement agencies.", "DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution   In accordance with the 21 Century Emergency Communications Act, the  Emergency Communications Preparedness Center (ECPC) has been created  and is supported by the OEC. The purposes of this group include serving as the  focal point for interdepartmental efforts and providing a clearinghouse for relevant  information regarding the ability of emergency response providers and relevant  government officials to communicate in the event of natural or man-made  disasters and acts of terrorism. DHS officials believe that the creation of the  ECPC will address collaboration and may be the proper forum for coordinating a  joint solution. However, the charter for this organization has not yet been  approved. Although DOJ and Treasury both participate in the Emergency  Communications Preparedness Center, DOJ officials noted that this group is  focused on emergency communications and response, and it is unclear whether  this group can address the day-to-day operational requirements of law  enforcement agencies.", "DOJ, DHS, and Treasury are no longer pursuing a joint solution  DOJ and DHS pursuing independent solutions, it is clear that the departments do not view  these initiatives as a means to collaborate on the IWN program and have not defined or  committed to an alternative approach to develop a joint communications solution. Without  a commitment to collaborate on a joint solution, they will continue to invest significant  resources in independent solutions that risk duplication of effort and inefficient use of  resources. Further, these stovepipe efforts will not ensure the interoperability needed to  serve day-to-day law enforcement operations or for responding to terrorist or other events  that require a coordinated response.", "Despite early progress on the pilot effort, the departments have been unable to sustain  development of a joint radio communications solution on their own. As a result, after  seven years of effort, they are no longer pursuing IWN as a joint solution and are instead  pursuing potentially duplicative and wasteful independent solutions.", "A primary reason that collaboration on a joint communications solution has failed and the  benefits envisioned by the departments have not been realized is that the departments  did not effectively employ key cross-agency collaboration practices that could overcome  the challenges faced in such programs. Specifically, they lacked a means to overcome  differences in missions and cultures, a collaborative governance structure that could  make decisions and resolve disputes, and a joint strategy to align activities and resources  to achieve a joint solution.", "As long as the departments pursue separate initiatives and expend their resources  independently, they risk duplication and inefficiency, and may fail to achieve the level of  interoperability that is vital for both law enforcement and emergency communications.  While successful collaboration on a joint solution is necessary, this joint solution could be  based on a single, nationwide network, such as an extension of the original IWN design,  or it could also be a mutually agreed-upon strategy for developing separate but  interoperable networks and systems that incorporate lessons learned from past efforts.  Given the importance of collaborating effectively toward improving radio communications  among federal agencies, reducing costs, and eliminating duplication where possible and the departments\u2019 failure to develop a joint radio communications solution through their  own initiative, Congressional action should be considered to ensure that this collaboration  takes place.", "The Congress should consider requiring that the Departments of Justice, Homeland  Security, and Treasury collaborate on the development and implementation of a joint  radio communications solution. Specifically, Congress should consider requiring the  departments to:   establish an effective governance structure that includes a formal process for  making decisions and resolving disputes;   define and articulate a common outcome for this joint effort; and   develop a joint strategy for improving radio communications.", "Congress should also consider specifying deadlines for completing each of these  requirements.", "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation  We received comments via e-mail from DOJ and DHS on a draft of these briefing slides.  Treasury officials stated that they had no comments on the draft briefing slides.", "Officials from DOJ\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer disagreed with our findings and  conclusions in several areas and expressed concerns that we did not accurately  characterize the department\u2019s efforts to collaborate. Officials from DHS\u2019s National  Protection and Programs Directorate did not state whether they agreed or disagreed with  our findings, but provided suggestions for additional consideration; in addition, DHS  officials provided technical comments that we incorporated into the briefing slides, as  appropriate.", "Officials from DOJ\u2019s Office of the Chief Information Officer disagreed with our findings and  conclusions in several areas. First, the officials stated that our analysis was flawed and  unrealistic in focusing on a single, common project as the best solution for supporting  missions, improving interoperability, and achieving cost efficiencies. However, we  disagree that our conclusions advocate a single, common project or system as the best  solution. We concluded that successful collaboration on a joint solution, whether that  solution is IWN or an alternative approach, is necessary to promote efficient use of  resources, reduce duplicative efforts, and encourage interoperability. Although a joint  solution could be based on a single, nationwide network, such as an extension of the  original IWN design, it could also be, for example, a mutually agreed-upon strategy for  developing separate but interoperable networks and systems.", "Accordingly, we have clarified our briefing slides to emphasize that we have not  concluded that a single monolithic project or system is the most appropriate joint  collaborative solution.", "Second, the department officials stated that we misrepresented DOJ efforts to work with  other agencies, including DHS. Specifically, DOJ officials stated that they had tried to  reach consensus and compromise with DHS, but DHS leadership had not embraced the  concept of a joint program, forcing DOJ to work individually with the DHS components  instead of with a single, consolidated program office within the DHS organization.  Furthermore, the DOJ officials cited lack of centralized funding at DHS to be another key  challenge to collaborating with that department. We acknowledge that DOJ took steps to  collaborate on IWN, but when the challenges could not be overcome, progress stalled.  We recognize the challenges faced in collaborating among departments, and, in  particular, the challenges described by DOJ in collaborating with DHS. However, rather  than contradicting our conclusions, we believe these facts support our analysis that key  practices for collaborating were not established or sustained. Unless such practices are  established and sustained, the departments are unlikely to succeed at implementing a  joint collaborative solution.", "Third, DOJ officials also stated that we unfairly characterized the results of the  Seattle/Blaine pilot and failed to recognize DHS\u2019s lack of contribution to the pilot and its  requirements development. However, the pilot and its requirements development Agency Comments and Our Evaluation  occurred prior to DHS\u2019s involvement in the program. Further, in our briefing, we note that  the Seattle/Blaine pilot afforded several benefits to users in Washington and Oregon,  including improving communications in the coverage area and establishing technical  solutions for interoperability with state and local organizations. Further, we agree that the  pilot served as a working demonstration and test of the IWN design and that additional  participation from DHS might have resulted in additional requirements being met.  However, our discussions with users and potential users revealed that the pilot network  did not meet many of their needs. In order to make progress in addressing unmet needs  through a joint partnership, it will be important that the departments collaborate on  alternative approaches based on lessons learned from this pilot.", "Finally, DOJ officials also expressed concern that our findings did not address business  and operational issues facing IWN, including a lack of adequate funding and the differing  missions, priorities, funding structures, and existing capabilities at DHS and DOJ. While  we agree that the departments have faced significant challenges, we believe that  collaboration on a joint strategy remains critically important. We recognize that the  departments have taken initial steps to re-establish coordination, such as signing a  revised memorandum of understanding. However, an effective governance structure  needs to be implemented before decisions can be made and procedures established for  overcoming the differing missions, priorities, funding structures, and capabilities among  the departments.", "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation  We also obtained comments on a draft of this briefing via e-mail from DHS\u2019s National  Protection and Programs Directorate officials. In these comments, the DHS officials did  not state whether they agreed or disagreed with our findings, but they supported the  continued development of a joint federal radio communications strategy and stated that  more specific guidance was needed. Specifically, DHS identified three elements for  inclusion in the development of a joint strategy:   Expand the partnership to include other federal departments that rely on mission- critical wireless communications beyond the law enforcement community.", "Leverage existing infrastructure across all levels of government to ensure cost  effectiveness and reduce duplication of effort.", "Ensure that interoperability is a priority focus beyond the upgrade and modernization  focuses of the original IWN concept.", "In addition, the department stated that there was a need within DHS to further align  authority and resources with responsibility for a joint solution. For example, while the  Office of Emergency Communications was given responsibility for IWN, it was not given  authority and only limited resources for the management of the program and therefore  had limited ability to drive stakeholders toward a joint solution. The additional  considerations proposed by DHS for inclusion in the joint partnership are consistent with  our results, and may merit attention as the partnership Agency Comments and Our Evaluation  develops.
