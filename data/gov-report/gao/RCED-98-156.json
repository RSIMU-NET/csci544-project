Because Hawaii comprises eight major islands remote from the U.S. mainland, many cargo customers must rely on air service as the only way to transport their goods in a timely fashion. Historically, two airlines\u2014Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines\u2014have provided service to meet this need. Under an exemption from provisions of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act, these two airlines are permitted to operate an interisland \u201cturnaround\u201d service (i.e., flights within Hawaii) with relatively noisy \u201cStage 2\u201d aircraft, which are being phased out on the mainland.Specifically, airlines that were providing turnaround service with Stage 2 aircraft when the act was passed in November 1990 are allowed to continue to do so.", "In May 1995, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) determined that American International Cargo (AIC) also qualified on the basis of its November 1990 operations, in which it provided what FAA deemed turnaround service in Hawaii\u2014and \u201conward\u201d service to the U.S. mainland\u2014with a McDonnell-Douglas DC-8 Stage 2 aircraft. In November 1995, this airline began to conduct scheduled interisland cargo service consistent with FAA\u2019s decision. Shortly thereafter, in a reinterpretation of its 1995 decision, FAA concluded that AIC did not qualify to continue providing such service. FAA\u2019s revised interpretation required AIC either to begin operating quieter, Stage 3, aircraft on interisland routes or to exit these markets entirely. Converting an aircraft for Stage 3 operations typically costs an airline $1.5 million per engine. Legislation enacted in October 1996 allowed AIC to continue serving Hawaii\u2019s interisland markets with one Stage 2 aircraft through September 30, 1998. To help prepare the Congress to reexamine the issue as the deadline approaches, you asked us to determine on what basis FAA revised its interpretation of turnaround service.

In addition, Hawaii\u2019s relative lack of industry means that most finished goods must be imported from the mainland. Unlike much of the mainland\u2014where transport relies on air, sea, rail, and highway\u2014Hawaii must rely primarily on the first two means. For cargo customers, air shipment is the faster and more expensive option, and sea transport is the slower but less expensive option. Most cargo for which the speed of delivery is not critical moves by sea, both among the islands and between Hawaii and the mainland. However, other goods\u2014particularly, perishable produce, mail, and time-sensitive items\u2014move by air.", "The bulk of interisland cargo shipments moves among four islands\u2014Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the \u201cBig Island\u201d of Hawaii. Honolulu, Oahu\u2019s urban center, is the largest city in the islands and the center of the state\u2019s economic activity. Its airport, Honolulu International, is by far the busiest in the state. The island of Hawaii, the state\u2019s second most populous, has two key airports, at Kona and Hilo, which serve distinct economic regions. The airport at Kona supports an active tourism trade and offers direct flights to the mainland. By contrast, the airport at Hilo supports no direct flights to the mainland but serves as a key distribution point for tropical plants and flowers, the cultivation of which is becoming increasingly important to Hawaii\u2019s economy. The islands of Maui and Kauai also support scheduled commercial jet service. Figure 1 shows the major Hawaiian islands, their key communities, and their scheduled air cargo service; table 1 summarizes key operating statistics for Hawaii\u2019s airports.", "Prior to AIC\u2019s November 1995 entry into scheduled interisland service,Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were the chief providers of air cargo transport throughout the state. Aloha began its service to Hawaii\u2019s \u201couterisland\u201d residential and commercial centers in 1946. In addition to over 180 daily jet flights among Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island of Hawaii, Aloha operates a nighttime cargo service using some passenger aircraft with the seats removed. Aloha also operates an \u201cAloha Island Air\u201d service using small propeller-driven aircraft to reach remote rural areas. Hawaiian Airlines, for its part, has provided air service among the islands since 1929. Hawaiian\u2019s cargo service is conducted in conjunction with its passenger service; all cargo is carried below deck on more than 150 daily flights among the state\u2019s major communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Under FAA\u2019s Reinterpretation of Turnaround Service, AIC Must Use Stage 3 Aircraft or Discontinue Interisland Operations", "paragraphs": ["In 1990, the federal government acted to reduce aviation noise. Specifically, the Congress passed the Airport Noise and Capacity Act, requiring the gradual phaseout on the U.S. mainland of Stage 2 aircraft weighing over 75,000 pounds by December 31, 1999. The law did not cover any aircraft operations in Hawaii. In October 1991, the act was amended in part to require that no airline operate a greater number of Stage 2 aircraft in the state of Hawaii than it had operated on November 5, 1990, when the act was first passed. According to the amendment\u2019s legislative history, this amendment was included to ensure that Hawaii does not become a \u201cdumping ground\u201d for Stage 2 aircraft as these aircraft are phased out on the mainland.", "Thus, in order to use Stage 2 aircraft within Hawaii, an airline must have provided turnaround service on November 5, 1990. As long-standing incumbents, Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines meet this qualification and currently serve all major communities in Hawaii using Stage 2 aircraft. On May 25, 1995, in response to a formal request from AIC, FAA determined that AIC also had provided qualifying turnaround service during November 1990. As described, in November 1990, AIC was operating an air cargo service routed from Los Angeles to Honolulu to Hilo and then back to Los Angeles. In a subsequent letter to AIC, FAA explained that because the airline\u2019s service involved at least one takeoff-and-landing cycle in Hawaii, the airline qualified to provide scheduled interisland service with Stage 2 aircraft between Honolulu and Hilo.", "However, in May 1996, FAA issued a revised interpretation of turnaround service. Earlier, in February 1996, FAA had received a complaint from Aloha Airlines in which this airline challenged AIC\u2019s legal right to operate scheduled interisland service with Stage 2 aircraft in Hawaii. According to an FAA attorney, the agency reexamined its position on turnaround service because of comments submitted as part of a related rulemaking action begun on May 11, 1995. In its reinterpretation, FAA quoted language from the 1991 amendment\u2019s legislative history, which described turnaround service as \u201clocal flights between two Hawaii cities and/or counties which also serve as the origin and destination. . . .\u201d FAA cited further language from the legislative history, emphasizing that the 1991 amendment was designed to \u201censure that Hawaii does not become a dumping ground for Stage 2 aircraft. . . .\u201d On the basis of these statements, FAA concluded that the Congress had intended to preclude an airline from flying an aircraft from the mainland to Hawaii, and then flying that same aircraft between two points in Hawaii in order to qualify the latter segment as turnaround service.", "Although AIC argued to FAA that one takeoff and one landing constituted a flight, under the 1991 amendment a flight qualifying as turnaround service consists of operation among \u201ctwo or more points, all of which are within the state of Hawaii.\u201d Thus, the 1991 provision clearly contemplates that such a flight may consist of more than one takeoff and one landing. There is no indication either in the statute or in the legislative history that turnaround service may include points outside of Hawaii. The use of the word \u201clocal\u201d in the Senate report also supports the assertion that only points within Hawaii may be considered to constitute turnaround service.", "According to AIC, the procompetition mandates of the Federal Aviation Act, as well as other public policy encouraging competition in air transportation, should also bear on any legal interpretation of turnaround service. AIC has maintained that two sections of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act direct the Secretary of Transportation to consider various competitive impacts of the requirements to phase out Stage 2 aircraft.However, these sections are not relevant for operations in Hawaii because the noise legislation\u2019s mandatory phaseout of Stage 2 aircraft applies only in the contiguous 48 states on the U.S. mainland.", "As a result, from our own review of the statutory provision set forth in the act\u2019s 1991 amendment and the relevant Senate committee report, we found that FAA\u2019s most recent interpretation of the law is correct. We believe that a route from Los Angeles to two points in Hawaii and back to Los Angeles does not qualify as turnaround service within the meaning of the 1991 amendment. Because AIC did not provide turnaround service at the time the Airport Noise and Capacity Act was passed, under an October 1996 amendment it must either cease serving Hawaii\u2019s interisland cargo markets after September 30, 1998, or provide service with Stage 3 aircraft, as a company official has indicated it may do. Alternatively, the Congress could pass legislation temporarily extending AIC\u2019s right to operate Stage 2 aircraft, which would allow the airline to continue interisland service without modifying the single aircraft that provides it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AIC\u2019s Entry Into Interisland Markets Has Enhanced Competition", "paragraphs": ["AIC\u2019s November 1995 entry has enhanced competition in Hawaii\u2019s interisland air cargo markets, most markedly by offering new service options for some customers. For example, executives with a small-package delivery firm and a freight forwarding company told us that they have benefited primarily because AIC provides them with a daytime all-cargo service and convenient connections to the mainland. Additionally, many Big Island agricultural producers with whom we spoke consider certain specialized features of AIC\u2019s service\u2014such as its ability to handle large shipping containers and its ability to refrigerate cargo at Honolulu International Airport\u2014as crucial to their immediate and long-term needs.", "We also found that many customers consider each of the three competing airlines\u2019 interisland cargo rates when making shipping decisions but that they seldom select an airline on the basis of rate considerations alone. Three customers told us that they had observed a price decrease during the past 2 years and that they attribute this to AIC\u2019s presence in interisland markets. We could not obtain sufficient data to draw broad, marketwide conclusions about the airline\u2019s effect on interisland rates.

According to data from Hawaii\u2019s Department of Transportation, this made AIC the second-largest cargo airline in the state during 1997, in terms of the volume of cargo shipped. AIC has achieved this rapid growth primarily by using one cargo-dedicated Boeing 727 aircraft. Although the B-727\u2019s fuselage has virtually the same circumference as that of the Boeing 737s used by Aloha Airlines, the AIC aircraft\u2019s interior space is larger because, as a cargo aircraft, it contains no overhead luggage bins. Consequently, AIC\u2019s aircraft can accommodate the same basic type of cargo container used by Aloha and can also carry taller containers. At the time of our study, AIC provided twice-daily service to Maui, Kona, and Hilo\u2014once during the day and once at night\u2014with onward connections to the mainland.", "Some of AIC\u2019s growth represents the provision of entirely new air transportation services. For example, some customers who had previously shipped by sea are now shipping by air with AIC. Another portion of AIC\u2019s growth has occurred at the expense of Aloha and Hawaiian. Figure 2 shows cargo being unloaded from AIC\u2019s B-727 at Honolulu International Airport. Figure 3 shows the three airlines\u2019 volume of cargo shipped and their respective market shares.", "Others include several small cargo airlines providing service among the islands using propeller-driven aircraft.", "Figures sometimes do not add to the total because of rounding.", "Between 1995 and 1997, Aloha Airlines was the dominant cargo airline in Hawaii\u2019s interisland markets. As shown in figure 3, in 1997 Aloha was estimated to have carried over 3.5 times the cargo volume that AIC carried. None of the B-737 aircraft that Aloha uses to carry interisland cargo is permanently dedicated to cargo service; instead, Aloha reconfigures five aircraft nightly by removing the passenger seats. This activity, which takes about 15 minutes per aircraft, is reversed each morning. However, Aloha cannot remove the overhead luggage bins, thus somewhat limiting the height of cargo containers that its aircraft will hold. Aloha uses its \u201cquick-change\u201d aircraft extensively throughout the night, operating multiple flights into and out of Kona, Hilo, Maui, and Kauai. For example, Aloha makes five nightly roundtrips between Honolulu and Maui and four nightly roundtrips between Honolulu and Kona. Figure 4 shows Aloha employees moving cargo into one of its five quick-change B-737s.", "Hawaiian Airlines, which in 1995 was the state\u2019s second-largest cargo airline, has carried a decreasing total cargo volume since then, as have several smaller airlines. Hawaiian provides no service dedicated solely to cargo. Rather, Hawaiian offers cargo customers the opportunity to ship their items in the belly of its daytime DC-9 passenger flights. The relatively small space available in the belly of these aircraft limits the size and weight of cargo that can be shipped, and passengers\u2019 luggage and the U.S. mail must take priority over other types of belly cargo. Hawaiian also operates to 4 destinations on the mainland, and another 13 destinations via marketing agreements with other airlines. Finally, several major U.S. airlines\u2014including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and United Parcel Service (UPS)\u2014also carried interisland cargo during part or all of the 1995-97 period, but did not report data to the state of Hawaii.

A senior official with FedEx, which alone accounts for half of AIC\u2019s customer base, told us that it contracts with AIC primarily because the airline provides convenient daytime departures to key outerisland destinations. According to the official, this daytime service is crucial to satisfying FedEx\u2019s overriding need, which is to guarantee on-time delivery for its customers at certain key points during a business day. Additionally, several freight forwarders that transport cargo among the islands confirmed that AIC\u2019s daytime service and convenient mainland connections are key to meeting their own needs. For example, a senior official with a forwarder that arranges for cargo transport from the mainland, through Honolulu, to key outerisland destinations explained that AIC\u2019s presence provides the company with greater choice than would otherwise be the case. An additional forwarder mentioned that AIC\u2019s focus on cargo service encourages more careful handling of cargo than is the case with competing airlines. Finally, several customers expressed satisfaction that, because AIC operates an all-cargo service, none of their freight will get \u201cbumped\u201d in favor of passengers\u2019 needs.", "AIC\u2019s all-cargo service is also expanding the number of mainland markets in which Big Island agricultural producers can offer their large tropical plants for sale. AIC\u2019s service has accomplished this by decreasing the transport time from 10 days to less than 1 day, allowing plants to arrive fresh at their destinations. Alternative air transportation is not a viable option because no competing airline accommodates the size of container necessary to ship these plants properly. Prior to AIC\u2019s entry, cultivators of tropical plants relied on ships for the trans-Pacific voyage to California. After the 10-day voyage, the plants had to be \u201crefreshed\u201d at a greenhouse, at substantial additional cost. Typically, even with this care, the plants could not be fully restored to their original condition and therefore could not sustain additional transport to markets on the East Coast or elsewhere on the mainland. By contrast, a 12-hour voyage by air eliminates the need for such greenhousing. Sealed at Hilo for shipment to the mainland, the plants arrive at Los Angeles International Airport in nearly original condition. This allows the farmers to sell them at any mainland location at a price commensurate with their original quality. Big Island farmers also cultivate a wide variety of tropical flowers for sale to mainland florists. In this case as well, AIC\u2019s Hilo to Los Angeles service allows the flowers to arrive fresh and to be shipped onward from Los Angeles to any U.S. destination in a timely manner. The president of the Hawaii Florists\u2019 & Shippers\u2019 Association told us that members of his organization prefer AIC\u2019s unique services, which include refrigerated storage in Honolulu and \u201cseamless\u201d connections to the mainland, offered jointly with FedEx.", "Nevertheless, other air cargo customers, including national small-package delivery companies, local freight forwarders, and at least one bakery need not make use of the larger container used exclusively by AIC. In their cases, a variety of alternative considerations is more important. Several company executives whom we interviewed cited successful sustained business relationships with Aloha and Hawaiian but also explained that these two incumbents offer both a frequency and quality of service that AIC has not yet demonstrated. According to the president of a local bakery, Aloha\u2019s frequent nighttime flights and its effective backup strategies in the event of an aircraft\u2019s mechanical breakdown are persuasive reasons to continue signing long-term contracts with this airline. The bakery president stated that his company\u2019s credibility with consumers depends entirely on the distribution of his baked goods every morning. Only Aloha, he said, currently maintains an ability to deliver his appreciable amount of cargo on time daily, with few delays. In addition, according to two freight forwarders with whom we spoke, Aloha\u2019s consistency in following up on damage claims is a similarly compelling reason to select the airline\u2019s interisland service.", "Finally, for some customers, the business relationships that they have maintained with Aloha and Hawaiian during more than five decades of interisland service are more important than the new services that AIC has begun to offer. According to one senior state official, the uniqueness of Hawaii\u2019s remote island geography creates a situation in which customers throughout a variety of local industries place high value on long-term market presence. For these customers, this consideration may take precedence over an immediate economic benefit, such as a lower interisland cargo rate or a new service feature. These customers know that, in Hawaii, air service is essential to their business, and they are therefore inclined to contract with long-serving incumbents that have a proven ability to provide frequent, consistent service. Having recently witnessed the entry, and subsequent exit, of several passenger airlines that also carry cargo\u2014including MidPacific Airlines, Discovery Airlines, and Mahalo Air\u2014these customers prefer the long-term stability of the two largest incumbents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customers\u2019 Service Needs Weigh Heavily in Their Consideration of Rates", "paragraphs": ["AIC\u2019s, Aloha\u2019s, and Hawaiian\u2019s primary types of customers\u2014small-package delivery firms, freight forwarders, and agricultural producers\u2014have distinct shipping needs. The three airlines have responded to these distinctions by pricing their cargo services in a variety of ways. For example, with small-package delivery firms such as FedEx, UPS, and Airborne Express, the airlines typically prenegotiate a standard set of interisland rates for an established period of time. By contrast, the airlines often negotiate with freight forwarders to meet the forwarders\u2019 need to move individual cargo shipments. A forwarder often seeks the best option available for a shipment of heavy cargo on the basis of which airline can offer the best combination of a low rate, adequate space, and a timely departure. Finally, AIC typically works with the agricultural producers to prenegotiate a \u201cthrough-rate\u201d from Hilo to Los Angeles.", "The dissimilar nature of competing airlines\u2019 interisland services\u2014and customers\u2019 concerns about confidentiality\u2014made broad empirical conclusions about interisland rates impossible. We discussed rate considerations during 10 interviews with small-package delivery firms, freight forwarders, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), Big Island agricultural producers, and one bakery. Also, as part of a structured survey, we solicited rate data from USPS and 36 private companies. Because the rates charged for interisland cargo shipments are negotiated privately between the customers and the airlines, many customers cited the need to keep these data confidential and declined to provide them to us; others explained that data searches would be time-consuming or that they lacked historical records. (See app. I for full details on our data-gathering efforts.)", "Nevertheless, we discovered a recurring view about rates. While several of the customers we contacted considered rates to be an important factor in their shipping decisions, they explained that rates must only be viewed relative to the services provided and to the extent to which an airline\u2019s performance meets their expectations.", "For example, a manager for one small-package delivery firm explained to us that, while the rates AIC charges his company are reasonable and competitive, this is outweighed by its poor performance with regard to its aircraft\u2019s availability: In December 1997, he said, AIC\u2019s only aircraft was out of service on several occasions for mechanical reasons. He added that he would not like to see AIC\u2019s exit because this would likely encourage Aloha and Hawaiian to increase their own rates. Still, he explained, spotty reliability to date has kept his company from selecting AIC as a long-term partner and has kept AIC from bringing meaningful competitive pressure to interisland markets as a whole.", "According to some freight forwarders whom we interviewed, AIC\u2019s service is valuable primarily because it provides an additional shipping option as they make daily decisions regarding how to move individual shipments at a given price. However, for one executive, the additional option is meaningful only when AIC\u2019s rates are set below those of its competitors.", "According to this executive, when AIC\u2019s and Aloha\u2019s rates are comparable for a particular interisland shipment, he often selects Aloha because it consistently arrives on time and always provides a backup aircraft quickly in the event of a mechanical breakdown.", "One freight forwarder expressed a preference for the daytime belly-cargo service offered by Hawaiian Airlines because this service is typically priced far below all-cargo service. Nevertheless, this customer asserted, the most important factor is that an airline retain its ability to offer timely, reliable delivery of its goods. Precisely because belly cargo can be bumped from a daytime interisland passenger flight, some customers prefer Aloha\u2019s and AIC\u2019s all-cargo services.", "For their part, many Big Island agricultural producers told us that rates are important but emphasized that their primary concern is retaining the \u201cthrough-service\u201d that AIC operates from Hilo to the mainland. Retaining this service, they said, outweighs rate considerations. An official with the Hawaii Export Nursery Association confirmed the farmers\u2019 remarks and added that it is impossible to compare the rates that AIC charges for its through-service to the rates charged either for Aloha\u2019s nighttime all-cargo service or for Hawaiian\u2019s belly-cargo service because all of the services provided are so dissimilar."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AIC\u2019s Exit or Other Emerging Trends Could Change the Dynamics of the Interisland Markets", "paragraphs": ["Unless new legislation is enacted extending AIC\u2019s right to operate Stage 2 aircraft, after September 30, 1998, AIC will have to serve its interisland customers using aircraft powered by quieter engines. Alternatively, the airline may decide to exit interisland markets. If AIC takes such a step, there could be a discernible effect on a variety of interisland customers. AIC\u2019s exit would likely reduce the types of services offered to customers. The effect would probably be more dramatic for agricultural producers than it would be for customers in other industries, as Big Island farmers who have contracted with AIC would lose the ability to sell their goods in a variety of U.S. mainland markets. In remarks reflecting the importance of agriculture to the state\u2019s economy, Hawaii\u2019s agriculture secretary explained to us that, unless another airline fills the void, AIC\u2019s exit from interisland markets would affect the pace at which Hawaii recovers from the stagnant economic growth of recent years. The extent to which rates might increase in AIC\u2019s absence remains unclear because there were only a few instances in which we were able to determine the effect AIC\u2019s market presence has had on rates.

Major U.S. cargo airlines could begin to provide scheduled interisland service using Stage 3 aircraft, in direct competition with Aloha\u2019s and AIC\u2019s all-cargo services. For instance, FedEx may decide to operate its own interisland service, and could do so if greater volumes of interisland cargo in future years were to make this service cost-efficient. Such a decision would likely lead FedEx to sign fewer contracts with AIC for interisland service. This would affect AIC\u2019s economic fortunes, as the airline would lose the business of tropical flower cultivators and other customers who must ship time-sensitive items. In addition, several major passenger airlines could expand nonstop service from outerisland communities to the mainland or initiate additional interisland cargo services.

The attorney provided us with the agency\u2019s current position on whether AIC has the legal right to operate interisland service after September 30, 1998, and submitted documentation indicating how FAA\u2019s interpretation has evolved over time.", "To gain a full understanding of the key factors affecting the transport of air cargo throughout Hawaii, we solicited information pertaining both to the rates charged and the services provided. We attempted to obtain data on rates charged for interisland service during calendar years 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 (through October). Obtaining a substantial amount of empirical data from this 4-year period would have permitted us to conduct a complete economic analysis and to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the effect that AIC\u2019s November 1995 entry may have had on the rates charged by all airlines operating in the interisland markets. However, we were unable to obtain sufficient rate data to conduct such an analysis and to draw such conclusions.", "We used two methods to gather information regarding the potential effect of AIC\u2019s entry on interisland rates. First, we sought data from AIC, Aloha, and Hawaiian, which are the three airlines carrying significant amounts of cargo throughout the state of Hawaii. Although AIC provided us with the basic rates that it charged its 20 largest customers during 1996, these data alone could not provide us with the historical perspective necessary to draw meaningful conclusions. For a proper historical analysis of the rates charged prior to AIC\u2019s entry as well as since its entry, we would have needed to obtain similar data from other airlines and from these airlines\u2019 customers. Although Aloha provided us with cargo yields per pound since 1993 and with a list of its key customers, neither Aloha nor Hawaiian was able to share historical, customer-specific rate information.", "Second, in a mailed survey, we solicited information from 37 of AIC\u2019s, Aloha\u2019s, and Hawaiian\u2019s interisland customers. These customers included small-package delivery firms, freight forwarders, and agricultural producers. Thirty customers declined to provide us with the level of detail that we needed, despite our pledge of confidentiality. Customers cited concerns ranging from confidentiality clauses with airlines and the time-consuming nature of data searches to the absence of historical records as reasons for failing to provide the information. Taken together, the level of detail that we obtained was not sufficient to allow for meaningful analysis of interisland air cargo rates. Although we were unable to collect sufficient data with regard to the rates paid, we were able to use the survey as a means to identify candidates for structured personal interviews conducted during January 1998.", "During January 1998, we conducted 17 structured interviews in order to understand further the impact that AIC\u2019s entry may have had on interisland air cargo markets. In Honolulu, we met with officials from AIC, Aloha, and Hawaiian, and we toured the airport facilities of AIC and Aloha, observing both airlines\u2019 cargo operations there. Also in Honolulu, we interviewed several freight forwarding companies; two national small-package delivery firms; officials from Hawaii\u2019s departments of Transportation, Agriculture, Justice, and Land & Natural Resources; an independent economist with the Bank of Hawaii; an official of the U.S. Postal Service; and a Delta Air Lines cargo representative. In Hilo, we met with a variety of agricultural producers who cultivate tropical plants and flowers destined primarily for mainland markets. We also met with the executive officers of two key agricultural associations\u2014the Hawaii Export Nursery Association and the Hawaii Shippers\u2019 and Florists\u2019 Association. We did not provide a pledge of confidentiality for information obtained from personal or telephone interviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["Aaron Casey Alice Feldesman David Hooper Joseph Kile Steve Martin Marnie Shaul John Skeen The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
