The Corps is the lead federal agency responsible for maintaining and improving navigable waterways. Corps data show that obligations for navigable waterways have decreased from over $3 billion in fiscal year 2009 to about $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2011. Most annual DOT funding is provided to states through formulas, and states determine which projects to fund. For example, in fiscal year 2011, the Surface Transportation Program provided $9.5 billion to states for a variety of transportation projects, which may have included port improvements. However, because DOT does not specifically track formula funding used to maintain or improve ports or port connectors, officials were unable to provide GAO the extent to which these funds were used for port improvements, although the officials stated that the number of port-specific projects was likely small. Several DOT grant and credit programs can also provide specific funding to ports, though ports are primarily responsible for maintaining and improving infrastructure on port property.", "Aging MTS infrastructure, a growing backlog of projects, and the lack of an MTS system-wide prioritization strategy represent key challenges for the Corps and DOT to maintain and improve MTS infrastructure. For example, some structures that support navigation, such as locks, are over 100 years old, and their condition has resulted in deteriorating performance and costly delays to shippers. The Corps and DOT have taken some steps to prioritize their individual funding decisions, but none of these efforts consider MTS infrastructure system-wide. While the Corps is prioritizing projects within its navigation program, DOT has a more limited ability to prioritize funding for port infrastructure projects because the majority of DOT's funding goes to the states where decisions about transportation priorities are made at the state and local level.", "Two efforts in particular provide opportunities to improve the effectiveness of federal support to MTS infrastructure. First, the recently enacted Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act requires DOT to develop a National Freight Strategic Plan and to consult with appropriate transportation stakeholders. However, DOT and the Corps have historically had limited coordination involving system-wide MTS investments. Involving the Corps in the development of the National Freight Strategic Plan is particularly important given the critical role navigable waterways play in freight movement. Second, the Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS), a partnership of federal agencies chaired by DOT, has the opportunity to take further actions to help ensure that its 2008 National Strategy for the Marine Transportation System is reviewed and updated to reflect new and emerging challenges, and that its 34 recommendations to improve the MTS are implemented. One recommendation included studying approaches to allocate federal dollars among competing transportation priorities. However, the Strategy has not been reviewed and updated since the CMTS published it in 2008 and it does not incorporate accountability mechanisms, such as identifying desired results or performance measures, for the recommended actions. Such mechanisms would help ensure that the actions CMTS recommended to improve the MTS are indeed implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["DOT should (1) inform the development of the National Freight Strategic Plan with the Corps' planned investments in the nation's navigable waterways and (2) ensure the review and update of the National Strategy for the MTS to include accountability mechanisms for the Strategy's recommended actions.

Some ports,  like Georgia Port Authority\u2019s Garden City Terminal at the Port of  Savannah, have invested heavily to ensure that the port is ready to  accommodate the new larger vessels.", "According to DOT\u2019s most recent estimate, $4.3 billion is needed to  improve the condition of the nation\u2019s port connectors. We have  previously reported that the nation\u2019s surface transportation system,  including port connectors, is under growing strain, and the cost to repair  and upgrade the system to safely and reliably meet current and future  demands may exceed what the nation can afford."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prioritization of MTS Investments", "paragraphs": ["Both the Corps and DOT are taking some steps to prioritize funding within  their purview for all three segments of the MTS that we reviewed. We  have previously reported that a systematic approach to help guide  decisions on federal investment in the MTS is needed because of the  growing awareness of, and agreement about, the need to view the  various transportation modes that comprise the MTS from an integrated  standpoint, particularly for the purposes of developing and implementing  a federal investment strategy.", "The Corps has taken steps to prioritize limited funding within its  navigation program and civil works budget process. Within the navigation  program specifically, the Corps has developed the Operational Condition  Assessment tool for all inland navigation structures, such as locks and  dams, to ensure that structures are consistently assessed and to provide  relative risk ratings and project ratings. The Corps is developing a similar  tool for rating coastal navigation structures, such as jetties, and Corps  officials expect this tool to inform the Corps\u2019 fiscal year 2014 budget. For  navigation channels, the Corps is developing a uniform framework tool,  anticipated to be available for fiscal year 2015 to assess the condition of  all navigation channels. With respect to its civil works program, the Corps  began using performance-based budgeting beginning in fiscal year 2006  as a way to focus funding requests on those projects with the highest  anticipated return on investment. Under the current civil works budget formulation process, the Corps uses performance metrics and a benefit- to-cost ratio to evaluate projects\u2019 estimated future outcomes and gives  priority to those with the highest expected returns for the national  economy and the environment. In part, the Corps focuses on anticipated  outcomes because most of the construction and investigation projects  being considered in its civil works budget requests are new or have not  yet been completed, and thus have not generally begun to achieve  benefits. Because the Operation and Maintenance account includes  projects that have already been constructed, the Corps incorporates  ongoing performance information, such as assessments of whether  infrastructure meets current engineering and industry standards.  Nevertheless, the number of investigations and construction projects  receiving appropriations is typically greater than the number requested,  and as we have previously reported, the Corps\u2019 budget presentation does  not include an explanation of the relative priority given to projects or how  they are evaluated against each other.", "In addition to these efforts, the Corps recently issued a report to provide  advice on how Congress should address the need for additional port and  inland waterway modernization to accommodate post-Panamax  vessels. The Corps reported that it is critical that the U.S. develop and  move forward with a strategic vision for ensuring adequate investment in  maintaining navigation infrastructure and for facilitating the strategic  targeting of investments to ensure that the United States is ready for  these larger vessels when the expanded Panama Canal opens in 2014.  The Corps also presented a variety of financing options to initiate a  national discussion of possible paths to meet the challenge of  modernizing MTS infrastructure.", "DOT has a more limited ability to prioritize funding for port infrastructure  projects given the structure of federal surface transportation funding. The  vast majority of DOT funding goes directly to state DOTs through  formulas where decisions about transportation priorities are made at the  state and local level. In fiscal year 2011, FHWA provided states with over $39 billion in federal-aid highway funding. The statewide  transportation planning process is the forum through which states decide  how to spend significant amounts of federal transportation funds. This  process is informed by MPOs that lead transportation planning in  urbanized areas\u2014geographic areas with populations of 50,000 or more.  Although states must comply with federal planning requirements  administered jointly by FHWA and the Federal Transit Administration,  states have considerable discretion to allocate federal funds and select  projects. According to a senior DOT official, states and MPOs make the  decisions about how best to prioritize their formula funding and how to  integrate port infrastructure projects into their transportation plans.  However, as we have previously reported, data limitations and the lack of  performance measures for these projects can make it difficult to quantify  the benefits of these projects and to achieve state-wide or community  support.", "DOT\u2019s competitive grant and credit programs provide one opportunity for  the agency to prioritize funding for port infrastructure, yet funding for  these projects is relatively limited compared to formula funding. For  example, in fiscal year 2012, DOT had $500 million in TIGER funds to  obligate across all modes for a variety of transportation projects and $122  million in budget authority for the TIFIA program. transportation legislation, MAP-21, significantly expands the TIFIA  program by authorizing $750 million in budget authority in fiscal year 2013  and $1 billion in fiscal year 2014 to pay the subsidy cost of supporting  federal credit. According to FHWA, a $1 billion TIFIA authorization of  budget authority will support about $10 billion in actual lending capacity.", "According to DOT, actual TIFIA lending capacity is subject to the calculation of the  estimated subsidy cost for each credit assistance transaction. The amount varies based  on the risk profile of the project and the repayment stream. According to DOT, actual  original subsidy rates have ranged from less than 1 percent to over 15 percent of the  TIFIA credit assistance received. See GAO, Surface Transportation: Financing Program  Could Benefit from Increased Performance Focus and Better Communication,  GAO-12-641 (Washington, D.C.: June 21, 2012).", "MAP-21 also calls for a number of significant program reforms including a  10 percent set-aside for rural projects and an increase in the share of  eligible project costs from 33 percent to 49 percent. Projects that received  credit assistance through TIFIA tend to be large, high-cost highway  projects. Even with the additional budget authority authorized for the  TIFIA program, DOT officials told us that the funding process is driven by  applicants as opposed to a national assessment of priority.", "Moreover, port projects may not always compete well against other  transportation-funding projects. According to DOT officials, ports may be  less accustomed to the processes and procedures involved in applying  for federal funds, making it harder for them to compete for competitive  grants and loans. Given the short program timelines for the TIGER  program, some ports may have difficulty meeting timelines given the  complexity of their proposals. Additionally, port applicants may not be as  familiar with developing and completing federal environmental review  requirements making it difficult to remain eligible for funding. According to  one senior MARAD official, many ports lack sufficient expertise to conduct  early planning or are not well positioned to leverage existing relationships  with state DOTs. As a result, some ports may be less prepared to  participate in DOT\u2019s competitive funding processes and compete against  applicants with more experience participating in the federal funding  process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Government Has Taken Steps to Address MTS Challenges; However, Opportunities Exist to Improve the Effectiveness of Its Role in the MTS", "paragraphs": ["A number of efforts are under way to address MTS challenges through  better coordination of federal investments.

Although it is  too early to assess progress made in achieving these objectives, senior  DOT and Corps officials told us that the MOU played an important role in  ensuring interagency coordination on MTS infrastructure investments for  the last round of the TIGER program. However, as noted above, the bulk  of DOT\u2019s transportation funding is directed through state and local  transportation agencies.", "MARAD, the one federal entity charged with an MTS-wide mission, has  few programs to address system-wide challenges and a limited field  presence. MARAD is developing the Port Infrastructure Development  Program to improve the state of repair of all U.S. ports and enhance the  competitiveness of ports for public and private funds through  comprehensive planning. According to a senior MARAD official, the  program is being designed to create a level playing field for all ports,  including small- and medium-sized ports, to attract private-sector  financing, and it is being developed together with MTS stakeholders.  However, despite MARAD\u2019s efforts to obtain consensus on the program  from MTS stakeholders, the program has not been funded, and MARAD  officials acknowledge that the agency has more work to do to ensure that  its staff have the right skill set and expertise needed to manage the  program. Moreover, several MTS stakeholders whom we met with during  our site visits told us that MARAD does not currently have a major role to  play in MTS infrastructure development. For example, local  transportation-planning officials we spoke to in one major coastal city said  that MARAD representatives are not at the table during the MPO\u2019s  planning process, and therefore, DOT is missing an opportunity to  coordinate investments in the various MTS segments.", "The recently enacted MAP-21 also provides an opportunity to better  coordinate investments in the MTS. First, MAP-21 directly addresses the  fragmented nature of DOT programs, including those that address ports  and port connectors, by consolidating the number of federal-aid highway  programs to focus resources on key national goals. While MTS  stakeholders we met with generally told us they appreciated having  access to a variety of federal transportation programs that can be used  for surface transportation projects, we have previously reported on  coordination challenges within DOT that result from a modal approach to  administering and funding programs.", "Second, MAP-21 establishes a national freight policy and mandates that  DOT develop a National Freight Strategic Plan and a national freight  network. Specifically, in the development of the National Freight Strategic  Plan MAP-21 requires DOT to consult with state departments of  transportation and other appropriate public and private transportation  stakeholders. As we have previously reported, to develop an effective  strategic plan, agencies should involve their stakeholders, assess their  internal and external environments, and align their activities, core  processes, and resources to support mission-related outcomes.noted above, both the Corps and DOT have taken some steps to invest in  their respective segments of the MTS. However, there has been limited  coordination of MTS investments system-wide. The National Freight  Strategic Plan is an opportunity to address the MTS system-wide by  considering the Corps\u2019 future investments in navigable waterways.  Involving the Corps in the development of that plan is particularly  important given the nexus between freight and the entire MTS, since the  vast majority of the nation\u2019s freight is imported and exported via navigable  waterways through our nation\u2019s ports.", "As  In addition to these Corps and DOT-specific efforts, there are a number of  other federal efforts that have been recently created to address MTS  infrastructure investment system-wide. On July 19, 2012, the White  House established a Task Force on Ports to develop federal strategies to  address coastal port infrastructure investments. This high-level effort is  designed to address specific issues and provide immediate benefits to,  among other things, help ensure that the nation\u2019s navigable waterways  and ports are prepared to handle any increase in trade expected from the  expansion of the Panama Canal in 2014. In particular, the task force  plans to examine challenges to coastal ports including increased  competition from ports in Canada and the Caribbean and is tasked with  developing a strategy to inform future investment decisions and identify  opportunities for improved coordination and streamlined environmental  review of investments in port-related infrastructure. According to the  White House, the establishment of the task force responds to calls from  state and local governments, as well as ports and other maritime  stakeholders, for a more strategic framework for allocating federal  investments. While this particular effort targeting coastal ports provides  an immediate focus on some of the most pertinent MTS infrastructure  challenges, it is too soon to know how the task force\u2019s efforts will be  realized and whether it will provide the long-term commitment and  management needed to address MTS challenges.", "We also identified two federal advisory groups established to advise the  federal government agencies on system-wide MTS issues. Federal  advisory groups can play an important role in the development of policy  and government regulations by providing advice to federal agency  policymakers. For example, the Marine Transportation System National  Advisory Council (MTSNAC) was established to, among other items,  provide advice to the Secretary of Transportation via the MARAD  Administrator on marine highways and ports and their road, rail, and  marine highway connections. Members of MTSNAC reflect a cross  section of maritime industries and port and water resources stakeholders  from the private sector, academia, labor, and federal, state and local  entities. In addition, the Advisory Committee on Supply Chain  Competitiveness was recently established to advise the Secretary of  Commerce on the necessary elements of a comprehensive national  freight policy designed to support U.S. export growth and  competitiveness, among other items. The committee consists of 40  private-sector members, including representatives from supply chain firms  and their associations, stakeholders, academia, community organizations,  and others directly affected by the supply chain.

Established in  2004 by a directive from the President in the U.S. Ocean Action Plan, the  CMTS is a long-standing committee designed to foster a partnership of  federal agencies with responsibility for the MTS and to provide a forum  through which agencies coordinate and take action to address a wide  range of MTS challenges. For example, the CMTS reported in 2010 that  multi-agency efforts to address navigation technology issues could lead to  significant improvements to navigation safety information, especially in  and around ports. Specifically, the Corps, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, and the U.S. Geological Survey have  developed, published and adopted common data standards. According to  the CMTS, these efforts provide improved delivery of navigation  information and enable agencies to better share information of  navigational value. Similarly, to build on the MOU signed between the  DOT and the U.S. Department of the Army to coordinate and improve  infrastructure investment between the two agencies, the CMTS  Coordinating Board agreed in June 2012 to establish a CMTS  Infrastructure Investment Integrated Action Team to provide a forum for  participation by other agencies that are stakeholders in MTS  infrastructure.", "In July 2008, the CMTS published the National Strategy on the Marine  Transportation System (Strategy) to provide a framework and 5-year  action plan to address MTS challenges. The Strategy is intended to  present the most pressing challenges facing the MTS and provide a  framework for addressing MTS needs through 2013. It recommends 34  actions to address these issues, some of which touch upon key  challenges we identified. For example, to address challenges related to  the prioritization of federal investments in the MTS, it recommends  studying approaches to prioritizing how federal dollars should be  allocated among competing priorities as well as studying how best to  coordinate allocation of federal funds for projects across agencies.  Similarly, to address infrastructure capacity issues the CMTS  recommended that agencies publish valid, reliable, and timely data on the  MTS including cargo movements, capacity, and productivity as well as  develop performance measures to assess the productivity of the MTS and  the risk of potential infrastructure failures.", "The CMTS has taken steps to address some of the recommended actions  included in the Strategy. According to a 2010 implementation plan, the  CMTS developed a list of six priority actions taken from the Strategy\u2019s 34  recommended actions and identified 3 other priorities that address  emerging issues. According to CMTS officials, when at least three CMTS  members agree to address a long-term MTS issue, they may form an  Integrated Action Team or subcommittee. CMTS guidance states that,  once formed, these teams operate on a consensus basis and are  responsible for preparing an action plan that, among other things,  includes (1) a list of deliverables, (2) a schedule for completing them, (3)  identification of the parties responsible for completing them, and (4)  funding sources available. For example, the CMTS Coordinating Board  established the Research and Development Integrated Action Team in  March 2009 to respond to several recommended actions included in the  Strategy, including the need for valid data and for the development of  performance measures. CMTS members may also establish task teams  to address short-term issues; however, these teams are not responsible  for developing an action plan. For example, in December 2011 the  National Export Initiative task team was established in support of the  President\u2019s National Export Initiative to, among other things, monitor the  availability of export containers.

Although the CMTS website  states that the Strategy is a \u201cliving document\u201d to be enhanced and  updated, CMTS officials told us that agencies had not updated the  Strategy since it was published in 2008 and have no current plans to  do so. As a result, the Strategy does not specifically address new and  emerging challenges, such as the President\u2019s National Export  Initiative. CMTS officials told us that updating the Strategy would be  useful and that\u2014should sufficient resources be available\u2014the CMTS  would review the recommendations of the Strategy and update them  with respect to current and projected needs of the MTS.

While CMTS member agencies have taken steps to introduce  accountability mechanisms through action plans developed by  individual Integrated Action Teams, action plans were only developed  for those areas or activities where consensus existed among agencies  to establish them. For other areas, the Strategy\u2019s recommended  actions remain\u2014as a CMTS response to Congress describes\u2014broad  in scope, rather than finite, individually defined tasks. While identifying  broad objectives is a good first step, without a clearly defined and  articulated \u201cend-state\u201d for each recommended action, it is difficult to  evaluate the extent to which progress has been made or determine  whether the CMTS is achieving its intended results. Furthermore,  CMTS officials told us that identifying broad actions was the only way  to gain consensus among all CMTS member agencies when the  Strategy was developed. However, without incorporating  accountability mechanisms throughout the Strategy, agency and  Congressional decision-makers may lack information needed to  evaluate progress and determine the extent to which agency activities  are achieving their intended results to address MTS challenges. We  have previously identified desirable characteristics that we believe  would provide additional guidance to responsible parties for  developing and implementing national strategies. Those  characteristics include incorporating accountability mechanisms, such  as the clear identification of priorities, specific milestones, and  outcome-related performance measures.

We have previously  reported that including a process for reporting on progress could help  agencies implement national strategies more effectively. According  to CMTS officials, with no budget and limited member resources, the  Strategy\u2019s recommended actions were prioritized resulting in a set of  six top priority actions, with the work done on these priority actions  reflected in the 2009 and 2010 annual reports.
