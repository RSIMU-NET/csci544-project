These performance requirements focus on capabilities like  range and survivability, but law and DOD policy also mandate that  defense weapon system acquisition programs address the performance  requirement for reliability. Reliability is the probability that a system will  perform without failure over a particular timeframe and under specified  conditions. For example, reliability requirements often address how long  an aircraft or land vehicle should operate before needing repair. A  weapon system\u2019s reliability directly affects a warfighter\u2019s ability to  complete a mission, and how much DOD must spend to operate and  support the weapon system over its lifetime, which often spans decades.  Nonetheless, DOD acquisition programs continue to struggle to deliver  reliable weapon systems. For example, DOD\u2019s Director, Operational Test  and Evaluation (DOT&E) has identified poor reliability as the reason for  some acquisition programs not delivering suitable weapon systems to the  warfighter.", "Decisions made early in the acquisition process influence reliability  throughout a system\u2019s life cycle, and members of Congress have  expressed concerns that DOD does not focus adequate attention on  reliability when it is designing and developing weapon systems. Congress  has passed legislation related to weapon system reliability. The fiscal  year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) contained a  provision that established an Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition  and Sustainment (USD(A&S)). Weapon system reliability has a  significant impact on sustainment efforts. The following year, the fiscal  year 2018 NDAA included a provision mandating that DOD program  managers include certain reliability requirements in weapon system  engineering and manufacturing development and production contracts.  For its part, DOD has also demonstrated an increased focus on weapon  system reliability recently. In January 2019, the USD(A&S) working with  the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering  (USD(R&E)), according to a DOD official, issued a policy memorandum to  senior acquisition leaders at the military services addressing several  reliability-related concerns involving requirements, contract solicitations,  and data collection.", "While there has been an increased focus on reliability, Congress provided  DOD with additional tools to enable DOD to accelerate weapon system  acquisitions. As we reported in June 2019, the 2016 NDAA devolved  much of the decision-making authority for major defense acquisition  programs from the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to the  military services. The 2016 NDAA required DOD to issue guidance  establishing two new streamlined acquisition pathways for DOD\u2014rapid  prototyping and rapid fielding\u2014under the broader term \u201cmiddle tier of  acquisitions.\u201d According to the Joint Explanatory Statement  accompanying the 2016 NDAA, the guidance was to create an expedited  and streamlined \u201cmiddle tier\u201d of acquisition programs intended to be  completed within 5 years.

These companies won awards in the areas of reliability,  dependability, performance, or quality or have been recognized as  experts in reliability skill development. We met with representatives from  the four commercial companies to discuss reliability engineering and  collect documentation about the practices they use to develop reliable  products.

Marine Corps acquisition officials stated that reliability was not  a priority during the original system development process, and we have  previously reported the program was instead focused on achieving other  performance parameters, including water speed, survivability, and  lethality. Prime contractor representatives identified some of their design  engineers who lacked experience and did not comply with engineering  standards as a root cause for problems discovered late in the  development process.

The officials noted that at the time these were not focus  areas because the Air Force expected the contractor to conduct the  needed reliability engineering. In 2004, we reported that, as early as low- rate initial production, however, the Air Force identified 68 parts that had  a high rate of failure and needed to be removed or replaced, requiring  additional contractor work. We also reported the F-22 canopy also  experienced failures during testing, allowing it to achieve only about 15  percent of its expected lifetime.

As we have  previously reported, when programs overpromise a weapon\u2019s prospective  performance and deliver systems that cannot achieve their requirements,  such as reliability goals, the warfighter receives less capability than  originally promised.", "In one example, as we reported in 2019, more than 11 years after the  start of F-35 production, none of the three aircraft variants (Air Force,  Marine Corps, and Navy) had met the minimum targets for two of the  program\u2019s five reliability metrics. These include mean flight hours  between part removals for replacement and mean flight hours between  critical failures. We found that only the Navy variant had achieved the  minimum target for a third goal, mean flight hours between maintenance  events. As we reported, while the program has instituted an effort  intended to improve reliability, the effort does not align improvement  projects with the F-35\u2019s reliability requirements. That is, the reliability  improvement projects being funded may not improve the F-35\u2019s  performance against its reliability metrics. Ultimately, the program does  not expect to achieve the unmet reliability metrics by full aircraft maturity,  and program officials have acknowledged that the requirements should  be reevaluated. As a result, the warfighter may not receive an aircraft  that is as reliable as was expected.", "In a review of the V-22 program, DOD found that the program integrated  complex technologies and unprecedented capabilities into its weapon  system without accounting for unknown reliability risks. Specifically,  these capabilities included a conceptually new design and multiple  service and mission needs. However, officials stated that the program  derived its reliability requirements from antecedent helicopters, systems  that were not representative of the V-22 given its increased complexity.  With a limited understanding of the V-22\u2019s mission profile, program  officials stated that they also underestimated the amount of time the  system would be used in helicopter mode and its operating time on the  ground. Subsequently, when the Marine Corps variant of the V-22\u2014the  MV-22\u2014was deployed in Iraq from 2007 to 2009, a number of  components experienced high rates of failure, affecting systems such as  the engines and engine housing. This situation, combined with an  immature parts supply chain, reduced the system\u2019s availability  significantly below minimum levels. At the time, as we reported in May  2009, the MV-22 had a stated minimum mission capability rate of 82  percent, but the three MV-22 squadrons in Iraq demonstrated an average  of 62 percent.", "The development and integration of new technologies on the F-22\u2014 stealth, supersonics, and integrated avionics\u2014were critical to achieving  operational success, but also presented significant reliability risks.  Officials told us that the F-22 was initially expected to cost less to acquire  and operate than one of its predecessors, the F-15, and be more reliable  as well. However, they also stated this was an unrealistic expectation. We  have previously reported that the immaturity of technologies at the start of  and throughout development weaken a system\u2019s ability to achieve  reliability requirements. Since 2005, when full rate production of the F- 22 began, the program has made substantial additional investments in  increasing the system\u2019s reliability through various improvement programs.  But the program also changed its mean time between maintenance  reliability requirement to an operational availability metric, a target that as  of 2018 it had yet to meet and may need to reevaluate, according to  program officials.

Specifically, according to DOD, the  AMPV, EFV, and V-22 did not effectively incentivize reliability with the  contractor and one program, the F-35, did not include all of the program\u2019s  reliability metrics in the contract.", "Each F-35 aircraft variant is measured against five reliability metrics, two  of which are in part of the contract. Contractors are not responsible for  achieving reliability requirements if programs do not include them in  contracts. As of August 2018, two of the F-35\u2019s three variants had not met  minimum targets for any of the three metrics that are not in the contract.  The last variant (Navy) has met the minimum target for only one of the  three metrics. As we have previously reported, the warfighter may have to  accept F-35 aircraft that are less reliable and more costly than originally  expected.", "As we have reported, the F-35 program tried to encourage the aircraft\u2019s  manufacturer to improve reliability through an incentive fee in sustainment  contracts. These contracts, for sustainment services, included  incentives for meeting aircraft availability. Reliability of parts is one of the  factors that influences aircraft availability, because broken parts prevent  aircraft from flying. Program officials told us they hoped the incentive fee  in the sustainment contract would incentivize the contractor to invest in  and implement additional reliability activities, which would help improve  aircraft availability, but according to the program office, the incentive has  not been effective. Program officials told us the contractor has not  pursued the incentive fee in the sustainment contract through efforts to  improve aircraft reliability because it would have to invest significant  resources to design and incorporate changes into production aircraft in  order to do so. F-35 aircraft, especially early production aircraft, continue  to face challenges related to parts that are failing more often than planned  and are in short supply. For example, we have previously reported that  DOD found the special coating on the F-35 canopy that helps maintain  the aircraft\u2019s stealth failed more frequently than expected and that the  manufacturer could not produce enough canopies to meet demand,  ultimately degrading system capability.", "According to program officials, to ensure that reliability growth was on  track, the AMPV program offered an incentive fee of up to $16 million if  the contractor could demonstrate at least 80 percent of the system\u2019s  reliability before low rate production. But officials stated that the AMPV  contractor did not achieve the goal. The AMPV was a derivative system of  the Army\u2019s Bradley Fighting Vehicle with an accelerated development  schedule, and officials stated that for this reason the contractor assumed  the government would accept much of the Bradley\u2019s initial design and  changes to the AMPV\u2019s performance resulting from legacy reliability  issues. As a result of these expectations, officials stated that the  contractor did not put enough resources, including a robust reliability  team, toward the work that was eventually needed to improve reliability,  and the contractor understaffed in this area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Five of the Seven Selected Programs Deferred Key Reliability Engineering Activities until Later in Development", "paragraphs": ["The AMPV, EFV, F-22, F-35, and V-22 programs deferred key reliability  engineering activities, intended to improve system designs, until later in  development. As a result, they missed opportunities to identify,  understand, and mitigate reliability issues early in the development  process. After realizing reliability shortfalls late in development, some  programs initiated expensive redesign efforts that continued well into  production and deployment, while others accepted degraded  performance.", "Based on our prior reporting, we found the EFV program did not  implement a proactive reliability approach, which would include identifying  challenges early and designing reliability into the system in a cost- effective manner. Instead, the program used a test-fix-test approach  that relied on identifying failure modes after the system-integration phase.  Early in the acquisition process, officials noted in program documentation  that the program had conducted little reliability growth planning before  starting development, and officials stated that the EFV program did not  plan for or conduct dedicated reliability testing. Then, the program  prematurely conducted its critical design review, a key review during the  development phase which confirms the system\u2019s design is stable and is  expected to meet system performance requirements, before the EFV  prototype\u2019s system-integration work was complete. The program did not  have the time necessary to demonstrate design maturity as scheduled  and officials stated that they did not schedule long enough corrective  action periods to allow for proper failure mitigation. As a result, during a  2006 operational assessment, the EFV demonstrated very low reliability  and failed to complete amphibious, gunnery, and land mobility tests.", "F-22 program officials stated that many of the aircraft\u2019s components and  subsystems had to be tested as part of an integrated system. This limited  the discovery of reliability issues early in the development phase. DOD  reliability experts told us programs should not use integrated system  testing to demonstrate individual component reliability, and should instead  use it to focus on how components work together and identify more  complex system failure modes. F-22 officials also stated the program  office frequently continued with development and other testing before  implementing corrective actions for critical reliability issues. As we have  previously reported, the F-22 program started a program to improve its  reliability in 2005, near the start of full rate production, to mitigate  hundreds of known reliability issues deferred from earlier in development.  Nonetheless, we reported in 2012\u2014nearly 3 years after DOD announced  the end of F-22 production\u2014that reliability deficiencies had increased  support costs, and continued to prevent the aircraft from meeting its  reliability requirement.", "According to program officials, the Army selected a derivative of the  Bradley Fighting Vehicle to meet the AMPV requirements, even though  that vehicle\u2019s transmission had known reliability problems. According to  AMPV program officials, the Army selected this vehicle because it had  prioritized controlling costs and accelerating schedule. Program officials  stated that the focus on cost and schedule caused the contractor to  underestimate the necessary reliability work at the start of development  and led to a backlog of test incident reports and deferred corrective  actions. According to 2018 program documentation we reviewed, the  AMPV\u2019s reliability growth did not track to targets during development and  the vehicle did not achieve its pre-production reliability goal. Moreover,  some of the AMPV\u2019s deferred work may need to be addressed during a  future corrective action period that could continue through fiscal year  2021."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Acquisition Policy and Guidance Documents Identify, but Do Not Emphasize, Key Reliability Practices", "paragraphs": ["Although there are differences between the DOD and commercial sector  stemming from the statutory and regulatory structures that govern DOD\u2019s  acquisition processes, DOD has had long-established policy and  guidance at both the department and service level that recognize the four  key reliability practices we found in the commercial sector. For example,  the Defense Acquisition Guidebook encourages acquisition programs to  involve reliability engineers early and often, and DOD Instruction 5000.02  identifies the need for establishing realistic reliability requirements.  Additionally, the 2005 DOD Guide for Achieving Reliability, Availability,  and Maintainability addresses the importance of emphasizing reliability  with contractors, and the service-level policies at all three military  departments establish the importance of reliability engineering activities.", "However, most of these documents cover a wide range of acquisition  issues or many aspects of reliability engineering, and they do not  specifically emphasize the four key practices we identified in our review of  the commercial sector. For example, the DOD Instruction 5000.02 is an  overarching policy document covering the entire acquisition life cycle at a  high level, from concept development to live fire test and evaluation, and  only one section provides significant detail and direction on reliability. The  service level instructions and Defense Acquisition Guidebook similarly  cover the entire acquisition life cycle, and reliability is one of dozens of  characteristics addressed in each document. The DOD Guide for  Achieving Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability is largely focused on  achieving reliability, but the reliability proponents at OSD, the Army, and  the Navy said the guide is not consistently used throughout DOD, noting  that it was issued in 2005 and has not been updated since.", "DOD policy provides decision makers flexibility to tailor regulatory  activities that acquisition programs perform when developing weapon  systems. The process is inherently complex, and these decision makers  must balance many factors when overseeing and executing the  programs. In the absence of an emphasis on the key reliability practices  we identified, we found decision makers for the programs we reviewed  prioritized other activities intended to have positive acquisition schedule  and cost impacts. For example, AMPV program officials told us the  program eliminated 7,500 miles of contractor reliability testing in order to  proceed to the next development phase more quickly, believing that there  would be sufficient time later to complete corrective actions.", "Recently, DOD has begun employing the Middle Tier Acquisition  pathway\u2014an alternative acquisition pathway with an objective of  beginning production within 6 months and completing fielding within 5  years. This emphasis may encourage decision makers to prioritize  activities that promise to reduce schedule. We found that for the  programs we reviewed, however, such an approach can come at the  expense of other activities, such as implementing effective reliability  practices.", "DOD has recently taken steps that could introduce more balance when  decision makers consider trade-offs between schedule and reliability.  Specifically, DOD has highlighted the importance of one of the four key  reliability practices we identified: emphasizing reliability with contractors,  and Congress has passed legislation related to reliability. The NDAA for  fiscal year 2018 included a provision mandating DOD program managers  to include certain reliability requirements in weapon system engineering  and manufacturing development and production contracts. In January  2019, the USD(A&S) implemented the NDAA by issuing a policy  memorandum to Service Acquisition Executives and other DOD Directors  echoing this key practice. However, USD(A&S) has not similarly  emphasized the three other key reliability practices we identified in the  commercial sector, nor have the Secretaries of the Air Force, Army, and  Navy, who now have ultimate responsibility for most of DOD\u2019s major  acquisition programs. Specifically, these senior leaders have not  emphasized the value of  leveraging reliability engineers early and often, establishing realistic reliability requirements, and employing reliability engineering activities to improve a system\u2019s  design throughout development.", "As a result, it is less likely that acquisition programs will take the actions  necessary to recognize and address potential reliability problems early in  the development process. Without senior leadership emphasis on a  broader range of key reliability practices, DOD runs the risk of delivering  less reliable systems than promised to the warfighter and spending more  than anticipated on rework and maintenance of major weapon systems.  This risk is exacerbated in an environment where decision makers are  striving to deliver systems in an accelerated manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The best opportunity to influence the reliability of a weapon system is  early on during the design of the system. Decisions and tradeoffs made at  that time can increase the weapon system\u2019s reliability, help warfighters  execute their missions, and decrease operating costs for years to come.  However, these decisions and tradeoffs are not easy, as acquisition  decision makers are tasked with managing competing priorities such as  cost, schedule, and performance. Many of the DOD acquisition program  examples in this report illustrate what can happen when reliability is not  prioritized. The programs often approached reliability in a reactive  manner, discovered problems late in the development process, and then  tried to fix them through costly and time-consuming rework. The programs  did not consistently adhere to key practices we identified in the  commercial sector:  reliability engineers were not leveraged early in the development  process,  reliability requirements were not realistic,  reliability was not emphasized with contractors, and  reliability engineering activities were not utilized throughout design  and development.", "Recent DOD actions have highlighted the importance of emphasizing  reliability with contractors.
