Since then, for example, IRS (1) has begun reassessing its data needs and revised its plans to capture 100 percent of the data on tax returns; (2) has postponed indefinitely the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP), which has been IRS\u2019 primary program for obtaining comprehensive and reliable taxpayer compliance data since the 1960s; (3) no longer anticipates being able to do up-front matching of tax returns and information returns, at least until sometime after 2000; and (4) has abandoned its assumption that staff-year savings from modernization would be reinvested in front-line customer service and compliance positions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ready Access to Good Data Is Critical to Achieving IRS\u2019 Compliance Goal", "paragraphs": ["Achievement of IRS\u2019 compliance goal hinges on the ability of enforcement staff to readily access good data. For example, as we discussed in recent testimony on IRS\u2019 debt collection practices, existing IRS computer systems do not provide ready access to needed information and, consequently, do not adequately support modern work processes. Access to current and accurate information on tax debts is essential if IRS is to enhance the effectiveness of its collection tools and programs to optimize productivity, devise alternative collection strategies, and develop programs to prevent taxpayers from becoming delinquent in the first place.", "Although technology plays a key role in helping an organization collect good data and make it readily accessible to employees, it is critical that the organization first determine what data it needs. IRS has not yet identified all of the data that enforcement staff need to do their job. the individual income tax return (Form 1040) to determine what is and is not needed.", "It is also important that any data IRS captures, whether 40 percent or 100 percent of the universe, be easily accessed by staff who need it. In that regard, IRS officials told us that enforcement staff are not able to readily access the data that IRS is now capturing. Like Customer Service, IRS\u2019 enforcement functions should benefit from the eventual replacement of the current master files with CAPS and WMS.", "Data are also critical to IRS\u2019 new approach for researching ways to improve compliance. IRS has traditionally responded to noncompliance through audits and other enforcement efforts. Over time, IRS concluded that enforcement was essential to pursue intentional noncompliance but that improved taxpayer assistance and education, rather than enforcement, might be more appropriate for correcting unintentional noncompliance. With this in mind and concerned about noncompliance levels, IRS created a compliance research and analysis approach in 1993, with the intent of identifying noncompliant market segments and appropriate enforcement and nonenforcement efforts to address that noncompliance. IRS\u2019 major research tool is to be the Compliance Research Information System (CRIS). Plans call for CRIS to be an integrated network of databases containing a sample of internal, external, and multi-year data, accessible to national and district office personnel to support analyses of voluntary compliance levels. CRIS is expected to enable IRS to develop working hypotheses on the means to increase voluntary compliance, test hypotheses, evaluate the results, and make decisions on how to implement the new strategies.", "IRS may not have objective compliance data available when needed for its research efforts. In October 1995, IRS indefinitely postponed TCMP due to budget and taxpayer burden concerns. TCMP has been IRS\u2019 primary program for obtaining comprehensive and reliable taxpayer compliance data since the 1960s. IRS has not done a TCMP of individual income tax returns since 1988. With the postponement of TCMP, IRS lacks current measures on compliance and does not have the data it needs to determine which market segments to research on ways to correct noncompliance. As we discussed in an April 1996 report to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, although IRS plans to mitigate the data losses resulting from the postponement of TCMP, it has no specific proposal on how to accomplish this.", "IRS\u2019 original vision assumed that compliance efforts would be enhanced by more timely issue identification and resolution, facilitated in part by accelerating the matching of tax return data with data provided by third parties, such as banks and employers. The ultimate goal was to achieve up-front matching whereby data are received and processed soon enough to allow matching with the tax return while the return is being processed and before any refund is issued.", "IRS has been accelerating the matching process, but the first notice to taxpayers advising them of any discrepancy is still not sent out until about a year after the tax return was filed. According to IRS officials, IRS eventually wants to be able to send out notices in the same year the return was filed. Besides increasing the likelihood of contacting the taxpayer and resolving the case, sending the notice the same year the tax return is filed might help taxpayers avoid the same mistake on the following year\u2019s return. It is not clear when IRS will be able to do up-front matching."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Staffing Assumptions Make Achievement of IRS\u2019 Compliance Goal More Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Data and the technology that provides it are critical, but so are the people who are tasked with using the data. IRS already has tens of thousands of staff who work in areas, such as taxpayer service, examination, and collection, that can affect compliance levels. Until recently, IRS had assumed that staff savings resulting from modernization (such as the savings anticipated in the returns processing function) would be reinvested to provide more of those front-line staff, with a corresponding increase in revenues. That is no longer the case, at least not to the extent originally anticipated. According to IRS officials, one of the assumptions surrounding its recent reassessment of TSM was that IRS would be smaller and could not rely on reinvesting TSM savings.", "We have not quantified the implications of this change in staffing assumptions. It is clear, however, that IRS\u2019 success in increasing compliance is directly related to the number of staff involved in compliance-related activities and that any significant change in staffing could significantly affect IRS\u2019 ability to achieve 90-percent compliance goal. IRS could mitigate that effect, at least somewhat, by making sure that is has the right mix of staff. made procedural changes to speed up its collection process, but historically IRS has been reluctant to reallocate resources from the field to earlier, more productive, collection activities. IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 budget request states that, although traditional enforcement positions (which include revenue officers) \u201ccomprise the lion\u2019s share of IRS\u2019 enforcement efforts, they also represent on the margin the least efficient use of IRS resources.\u201d In that regard, the budget request provides for an increase in staff for IRS\u2019 telephone collection activities and a decrease in revenue officers\u2014a shift toward the kind of mix that we have advocated in the past.", "Another way to mitigate the effect of fewer-than-expected staff is to improve staff productivity. In that regard, one of IRS\u2019 efforts to improve compliance involves the automation of certain tasks done by enforcement staff in IRS\u2019 district offices. These tasks, like many in IRS, have for years involved the manual processing of paper, which has resulted in enforcement staff spending significant amounts of time on routine administrative duties. IRS has been implementing systems that are designed to ease this burden and help make enforcement staff more productive.", "The Integrated Collection System (ICS) is a computer-based information system that is intended to automate some of the labor-intensive tasks performed by revenue officers. Although this effort is not a major technological advancement, it should enable revenue officers to spend their time more productively. According to IRS, implementing this system in two pilot districts resulted in increased collections, faster case closing, and less time spent on each case. The system is currently operating in six districts, and IRS plans to roll it out in three more districts this year. According to IRS, further implementation depends on future funding and final measurements of productivity.", "IRS is also developing an automated inventory delivery system that is intended to direct accounts, based on internally developed criteria, to the particular collection stage where they can be processed most efficiently and expeditiously. This system, which IRS plans to test in July 1996, is intended to move accounts through the collection process faster and cheaper than under the current system.", "IRS offices. However, IRS recently decided not to continue funding TIES through TSM. It is our understanding that any future funding will be done outside of TSM.", "According to IRS, the features of ICS and TIES will eventually be incorporated into the Integrated Case Processing (ICP) system, which will also provide IRS\u2019 compliance function with automated tools for case assignment and tracking. However, as a result of the recent reassessment of TSM, IRS has decided to delay that integration until after the year 2000."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSM Investments Remain at Risk", "paragraphs": ["In March 1996, we told the Subcommittee on Oversight, House Committee on Ways and Means, that additional investments in TSM are at risk given current managerial and technical weaknesses.

Specifically, we said that IRS\u2019 reengineering efforts were not tied to its TSM projects and that IRS lacked a comprehensive plan and schedule defining how and when to integrate these business reengineering efforts with ongoing TSM projects.", "The reengineering efforts we referred to in July 1995 were put on hold pending the outcome of IRS\u2019 reassessment of TSM. As a result of the recent reassessment of TSM, IRS decided to reengineer \u201cthe tax settlement process\u201d. IRS has defined that process as beginning at the point taxpayers collect information necessary for the filing of tax returns and ending when the current year tax account is satisfied or enforcement action is initiated. IRS has identified 18 high-level processes for this time period. One of those processes focuses on IRS\u2019 tax return processing activity that we mentioned earlier. requirements that are not addressed by planned TSM projects or that make those projects obsolete. For example, if IRS decides that it is cost-effective to outsource paper tax return processing, it will not need the scanning and imaging technologies that DPS is being designed to provide.", "In closing, Mr. Chairman, our main point is that until clearly defined business requirements drive TSM projects, there is no assurance that TSM projects will achieve the desired objectives and result in improved operations.
