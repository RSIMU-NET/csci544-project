Congress has expressed an interest in how this assistance has been allocated to homeowners and rental property owners, particularly for state-administered programs. GAO's objectives were to review (1) how federal disaster-related assistance for permanent housing has been provided to homeowners and rental property owners, (2) the extent to which federally funded programs have responded to the needs of homeowners and rental property owners, and (3) the challenges that homeowners and rental property owners have faced in applying for and using federal assistance, and potential options for addressing these challenges. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed documentation for key programs and program data, and interviewed federal, state, and local officials regarding the challenges associated with these programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal post-disaster assistance for permanent housing was made available to homeowners and rental property owners following the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes through grants, loans, and tax incentives. State agencies were largely responsible for administering the programs that delivered most of the assistance, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program, the most widely used source of federal funds. Congress provided states with broad flexibility in their use of CDBG funds. Federal programs GAO reviewed addressed the repair and replacement needs of more homeowner units than rental units. In both Louisiana and Mississippi, more homeowner units were damaged than rental units, but the proportional damage to the rental stock was generally greater. Programs GAO reviewed provided about $13 billion in assistance for the repair and replacement of about 303,000 homeowner units, and about $1.8 billion for over 43,000 rental units. When the estimated number of assisted units is compared to the estimated number of damaged units, 62 percent of damaged homeowner units and 18 percent of damaged rental units were assisted. The difference in the level of assistance for homeowner and rental units was largely due to states' decisions to award the majority of their CDBG funds to programs for homeowners. When attempting to use the programs GAO reviewed, both homeowners and rental property owners encountered delays in funding availability and other challenges, which have likely contributed to the slow pace of recovery in some areas and fewer affordable units for renters. GAO and others have previously recommended options to minimize these challenges. However, without specific direction on how to better target disaster-related CDBG funds for the redevelopment of homeowner and rental units after future disasters, states' allocation of assistance to homeowners and rental property owners may again result in significant differences in the level of assistance provided."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Gulf Coast on August 29, 2005, and  was the worst natural disaster in our nation\u2019s history in terms of  geographic scope, the severity of its destruction, and the number of  persons displaced from their homes. The storm caused damage in  Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. It devastated far more  residential property than any other recent hurricane, destroying or making  uninhabitable an estimated 300,000 homes. It displaced thousands of  homeowners and renters and created a need for an unprecedented level of  recovery assistance. Then, just 1 month later on September 24, 2005,  Hurricane Rita struck, severely damaging or destroying more than 23,600  housing units in southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas.", "In response to the damage caused by these hurricanes, the government  provided significant funding for the recovery of the region, including funds  for rebuilding housing. Congress provided about $130 billion in disaster  recovery assistance, including about $19.7 billion in Community  Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds. The Department of Housing and  Urban Development (HUD) provided Louisiana and Mississippi\u2014the two  states most affected\u2014with the majority of these supplemental CDBG  funds, which were to be used in part for housing recovery. The Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), the Small Business Administration (SBA), and  the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) also provided various  resources\u2014grants, loans, and tax incentives\u2014for the recovery of  permanent housing. However, while Congress has provided funding for the  recovery of housing in the affected areas, some displaced residents are  still unable to return to their homes, in part because of the slow pace of  the repair and replacement of permanent housing and the lack of  affordable housing.", "Congress has raised questions about how federal funds for housing  recovery have been allocated for the repair of homeowner and rental  housing units, particularly under programs for which states have  discretion regarding the amount and types of assistance available to  homeowners and rental property owners. In light of these questions, this  report examines the federal assistance provided to homeowners and rental  property owners after the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Our work focused  on Louisiana and Mississippi, the states most affected by Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita. Specifically, we reviewed (1) how federal disaster-related  assistance for permanent housing has been provided to homeowners and  rental property owners affected by the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes; (2) the  extent to which federally funded programs responded to the needs of  homeowners compared to rental property owners in repairing or replacing  units damaged by these hurricanes; and (3) the challenges that  homeowners and rental property owners have faced in applying for and  using federal assistance, and potential options for addressing these  challenges.", "To describe how federal disaster-related assistance for permanent housing  was provided to homeowners and rental property owners, we identified  federal programs that made assistance available for the repair and  replacement of housing after the disasters, reviewed eligibility criteria and  award processes, and determined when funds became available. We  included programs that federal agencies, subject matter experts, and  studies and reports identified as being key to the repair and replacement  of permanent housing for homeowners and renters. As a result, we did not  include every program that provides post-disaster housing assistance. To  determine the extent to which these programs responded to the needs of  homeowners and rental property owners in repairing or replacing units,  we compared data on the number of homeowner and rental units damaged  to the number that were assisted through various programs, compared the  amounts of assistance awarded to homeowners and rental property  owners, and determined the extent to which repairs have been completed.  We assessed the reliability of these data and determined that they are  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our report. To identify challenges to  homeowners and rental property owners, we reviewed studies and  reports, interviewed program administrators, and analyzed the timeliness  of funding availability and application processing. To identify potential  options for addressing these challenges, we reviewed recommendations in  studies and reports, suggestions from program administrators and  organizations that worked with disaster victims, and information on the  congressional intent of post-disaster housing assistance. For more  information on our scope and methodology see appendix I.", "We conducted our work from October 2008 through January 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["After major disasters, various federal agencies provide a range of  assistance to individual victims; state, territorial, and local governments;  and nongovernmental entities. This assistance is administered through  various federal programs, and is generally made available after the  President issues a disaster declaration under the authority of the Robert T.  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Stafford Act).  While the federal government provides significant financial assistance  after major disasters, the federal role is primarily to assist state and local  governments, which have the central role in recovery efforts. State and  local governments have the main responsibility of applying for, receiving,  and implementing federal assistance. Further, they make decisions about  what priorities and projects the community will undertake for recovery.", "The Stafford Act also specifies that federal agencies providing financial  assistance after a major disaster cannot provide assistance to an individual  for the same loss for which another federal program or private insurance  company has provided compensation. Therefore, homeowners that  sustained damages from the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes must first seek  assistance from their homeowner insurance or National Flood Insurance  Program policies. Homeowners in the Gulf Coast area had varying levels of  hazard and flood insurance coverage. Of the 331,070 homeowner units that  sustained minor, major, or severe damage in Louisiana, 126,007 (38  percent) had hazard insurance only, and 118,928 (36 percent) had both  hazard and flood insurance. Of the 157,914 homeowner units that  sustained damage in Mississippi, 94,792 (60 percent) had hazard insurance  only, and 11,481 (7 percent) had hazard and flood insurance. Insurance  industry estimates indicate that homeowners in Louisiana and Mississippi  received average payments of nearly $16,000 in each state for personal  property claims related to Hurricane Katrina and average payments of  $13,000 and $3,500, respectively, for personal property claims related to  Hurricane Rita. For both Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, our analysis shows  that $9.7 billion was paid out through the National Flood Insurance  Program to homeowners in Louisiana and Mississippi, with a median claim  payment of $74,000. Less is known about the extent to which rental  property owners had hazard and flood insurance coverage and the  amounts paid out in claims after the 2005 hurricanes because data are not  readily available. In addition, data are not available to determine the  extent to which insurance settlements made to both homeowners and  rental property owners addressed their damages.", "Through executive orders, the authority to provide disaster relief  assistance has been delegated to FEMA. FEMA provides various forms of  temporary housing assistance, such as direct financial assistance or a  temporary housing unit after a disaster, typically for a period no longer  than 18 months, as directed by the Stafford Act. HUD is the recognized  federal authority for housing assistance (including permanent housing)  and has provided assistance such as rental housing vouchers and grants  for federally declared major disasters in the past and prior to FEMA\u2019s  creation in 1979. Over the years, Congress has provided several  mechanisms for disaster assistance, including HUD\u2019s CDBG program  funds for recovery. After the 2005 hurricanes, HUD was responsible for  providing assistance to clients that it had already been assisting and for  providing CDBG funds. Through the Small Business Act as amended, SBA  has the authority to provide home and business loans to repair or replace  damaged or destroyed real estate not fully covered by insurance.", "According to FEMA\u2019s National Disaster Housing Strategy, which was  issued in January 2009, throughout the Hurricane Katrina response,  responsibilities and roles that had seemed clear in previous events became  less clear as FEMA and other federal departments and agencies provided  increasing levels of support to state and local officials. For example,  FEMA typically does not provide housing assistance for more than 18  months, and generally does not lead efforts to coordinate and deliver  permanent housing assistance. However, in response to the 2005 Gulf  Coast hurricanes, FEMA led the coordination with states and local  communities and implemented many of the housing options, including  permanent housing. According to a congressional study on deficiencies in  post-disaster housing assistance, there was a lack of clarity in the long- term post-disaster housing-related responsibilities of HUD and FEMA, and  concerns have been raised regarding HUD\u2019s limited housing role after  Hurricane Katrina and its role in future disasters. The National Disaster  Housing Strategy states that HUD is uniquely positioned to assist those  affected by a disaster and will be given lead responsibility for permanent  housing when such assistance is needed in the future.", "After the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes, a variety of federal programs was  made available to homeowners and rental property owners for the repair  or replacement of permanent housing (see table 1). Four federal agencies  have responsibility for these programs: DHS, HUD, SBA, and Treasury.  DHS administers three different grant programs that can be used to repair  or replace disaster-damaged housing and mitigate damages after disasters.  HUD provides funding for two grant programs, including the CDBG  program, through which states can develop post-disaster programs that  benefit both homeowners and renters. The CDBG program has often been  relied upon as a convenient source of flexible funding that can be applied  to disaster situations to help states rebuild their communities. The SBA  provides two different types of loans for homeowners and owners of  residential rental properties. Both loan products can fund the repair or  replacement of disaster-damaged properties. Finally, Treasury has  responsibility for three programs that provide additional tax incentives to  the states affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita to encourage both  housing and economic development. Congress established the Gulf  Opportunity Zone Act of 2005 to provide tax incentives to individuals and  businesses in certain presidentially declared disaster areas. In contrast  with grant programs, where funds come directly from the government, GO  Zone incentives provide investors with relief from certain tax liabilities.", "Affordable housing challenges existed for both homeowners and renters in  Louisiana and renters in Mississippi before the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes,  particularly in the areas most damaged by these storms. According to  HUD, the generally accepted definition of \u201caffordable\u201d is for a household  to pay no more than 30 percent of its income on housing. Families who  pay more than 30 percent of their annual income for housing are  considered cost burdened. Like renters nationwide, renters in Louisiana  and Mississippi were generally more cost burdened prior to Hurricanes  Katrina and Rita than homeowners. For example, according to the 2004  American Community Survey, for the areas most damaged by the  hurricanes, in the New Orleans metropolitan area (St. Charles, Orleans, St.  Tammany, St. Bernard, and Plaquemines parishes) 48 percent of renters  and 24 percent of homeowners spent 30 percent or more of their income  on housing costs, compared with 50 percent of renters and 21 percent of  homeowners statewide. In the Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula metropolitan  area in Mississippi\u2014which includes Hancock, Harrison, and Jackson  counties\u201448 percent of renters and 21 percent of homeowners spent 30  percent or more of their income on housing costs compared to 50 percent  of the renters and 24 percent of homeowners statewide (see fig. 1).", "Hurricanes Katrina and Rita increased the need for affordable housing in  both Louisiana and Mississippi. For example, of the 82,000 rental units that  were damaged or destroyed in Louisiana, about 54,000 were affordable to  individuals earning less than 80 percent of the area median income,  according to state officials. Similarly, in Mississippi nearly one-fourth of  the 25,000 affordable rental units in three Mississippi coastal counties  were damaged, with Hancock and Harrison counties sustaining the most  damage to their affordable rental housing stock."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Assistance for Permanent Housing after the 2005 Storms Included Grants, Loans, and Tax Incentives, and States Designed Programs to Award the Majority of This Assistance", "paragraphs": ["After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, federal assistance for the repair or  replacement of permanent housing was made available to homeowners  and rental property owners in three forms: grants, loans, and tax  incentives.

Grants were made available through five different programs to  assist with the repair of disaster-damaged housing; to fund hazard mitigation  projects, such as the elevation of housing; and to repair or replace public  housing or other housing owned by a public housing agency (PHA). Loans  were made available through three programs (including one program that  also provides grants) for the repair of disaster-damaged housing for  homeowners and renters. Finally, three different tax incentive programs were  made available to encourage the redevelopment of housing in the GO Zone  for both homeowners and renters. While all of these programs could  potentially be used to repair, replace, or develop housing structures, some  could also be used for other activities, such as economic development.", "Of the programs we reviewed, two were available to homeowners only\u2014 the Individual and Households Program (IHP): Repair or Replacement  Assistance and the Home Disaster Loan Program (see table 2). Several  programs could have potentially served either homeowners or renters,  including the CDBG program, the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program  (HMGP), and some tax incentives. Finally, four of the programs we  reviewed could have assisted renters by funding or providing incentives  for the repair or replacement of rental housing.", "Some programs made assistance available for housing-related activities  only. For example, Home Disaster Loans, IHP Repair or Replacement  Assistance, and GO Zone Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) could  only be used for housing-related activities. However, most of the programs  we reviewed could be used for other activities as well. For example,  CDBG funds could be used flexibly by states and were made available for  economic development, infrastructure, historic preservation, and  demolition. Similarly, GO Zone Private Activity Bonds could be used for  the development of private facilities, such as hotels and retail facilities.", "Until recently, vouchers were made available to disaster victims to  subsidize rents in existing housing as a temporary source of housing  assistance. According to some housing experts, vouchers, specifically  Housing Choice Vouchers, which are permanent, should have been  provided to disaster victims, especially low-income renters, more quickly  after the Gulf Coast hurricanes.

Louisiana and  Mississippi created new state offices to design and administer the  programs funded with the supplemental CDBG funds, including housing  programs. In Louisiana, the Louisiana Recovery Authority was created and  charged with establishing spending priorities and policies related to the  state\u2019s use of the supplemental CDBG funds. In addition, a Disaster  Recovery Unit was created within the state\u2019s Office of Community  Development, which has managed the state\u2019s CDBG program over the past  two decades, to administer the funds. In Mississippi, the Governor\u2019s  Office of Recovery and Renewal was established and given primary  responsibility for designing housing recovery programs funded with  supplemental CDBG funds. The Mississippi Development Authority\u2019s  Disaster Recovery Division was responsible for managing Mississippi\u2019s  share of CDBG disaster relief funds.", "State agencies were responsible for administering two of the three tax  incentive programs that we reviewed. For the GO Zone Private Activity  Bond and LIHTC Programs, states were authorized to allocate additional  tax-exempt bond financing and low-income housing tax credits. Each  eligible state was responsible for setting up an application process and  selecting qualified projects to receive allocations up to each state\u2019s  allocation authority under the GO Zone Act. As we previously reported,  Louisiana and Mississippi generally allocated the GO Zone bond provisions  on a first-come, first-served basis, and did not consistently target the  allocations to assist recovery in the most damaged areas, although  Louisiana did set aside some of its allocation authority for the most  damaged parishes. In contrast, in allocating funds for the GO Zone LIHTC  program, the state housing finance agencies in Louisiana and Mississippi  gave priority to the GO Zone counties with the most hurricane-related  damage.", "State agencies also administered FEMA\u2019s HMGP. According to FEMA  officials, state agencies in Louisiana and Mississippi accepted applications  from local jurisdictions for the funds, and forwarded applications to FEMA  for review and funding. State mitigation plans document the state\u2019s  priorities for the use of HMGP funds, and states are required to update an  administrative plan for implementing HMGP funds after every disaster.  Plans for the use of HMGP funds should include mitigation activities that  are cost effective, environmentally sound, and either statewide or property  specific.", "Federal agencies directly administered six of the sources of post-disaster  housing assistance we reviewed, which accounted for approximately   $5 billion in available funds and $1 billion in available tax incentives (see  fig. 2). For example, the Community Development Financial Institutions  Fund within Treasury administers the New Markets Tax Credit program,  which competitively allocated tax credit authority\u2014the amount of  investment for which investors can claim a 39 percent tax credit over   7 years\u2014to Community Development Entities. FEMA administers both the  IHP Repair or Replacement Assistance and the Public Assistance for  Permanent Work programs. For the IHP Repair or Replacement Assistance  Program, FEMA reviewed applications and awarded funds to homeowners  for losses that were not covered by insurance. Through the Public  Assistance for Permanent Work Program, FEMA reviewed applications for  assistance from PHAs and could award assistance to PHAs for damages to  PHA-owned rental housing that was not funded with HUD funds (i.e.,  public housing could not be funded). HUD was responsible for awarding  Capital Fund/Emergency Natural Disaster funds to PHAs on a first-come,  first-served basis for the repair or replacement of a public housing  development damaged as a result of a natural disaster. PHAs that  experienced an emergency situation or a natural disaster were eligible to  apply for and receive funds from the reserve provided that they complied  with certain requirements. For example, according to HUD\u2019s Grant  Handbook, funds provided because of a disaster were only available to the  extent that needed repairs were in excess of payments from insurance  claims and other federal sources, such as FEMA funds for disaster-related  emergency work (but not permanent work). SBA was responsible for  administering the Home Disaster and Physical Disaster Business Loan  Programs. SBA reviewed applications for assistance and provided loans to  eligible applicants.

The CDBG program is the  federal government\u2019s most widely available source of financial assistance  to support state- and local government-directed neighborhood  revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development  activities. Congress provided states with supplemental CDBG funding to  help them recover from the Gulf Coast hurricanes, beginning in December  2005. To provide the states additional flexibility in delivering disaster  relief, many of the statutory and regulatory provisions governing the use of  the funds were waived or modified. HUD issued guidance in February 2006  stating that the funds should be used toward unmet housing needs in areas  of concentrated distress. In addition, in June 2006 Congress required states  to use at least $1 billion for the repair, rehabilitation, and reconstruction of  affordable rental housing, including public and other HUD-assisted  housing. This requirement was intended to ensure that states were not  only investing in homeownership but also in the housing needs of all  affected residents.", "To make CDBG funds available for the repair or replacement of permanent  housing, both Louisiana and Mississippi created new programs for  homeowners and small rental property owners (owners of rental  properties with up to four units). As we recently reported, Louisiana  created the Road Home Homeowner Program, through which funds were  made available to homeowners to rebuild homes on their own property,  sell their properties and relocate within the state, or sell their homes and  relocate outside the state. Mississippi created the Homeowner Assistance  Program for homeowners that sustained flood damage. The first round of  funding was limited to homeowners that did not have flood insurance  because they were located outside of a federally designated flood zone.  (See app. II for additional information about these programs.)", "Louisiana also created the Road Home Small Rental Property Program for  owners of small rental properties in the most damaged parishes and made  forgivable loans available in two funding rounds. Property owners had to  independently finance needed repairs and rent out their units to income- eligible tenants. Once the units were ready for occupancy, the state would  conduct inspections and authorize the disbursement of the loan. In  December 2008 the state announced an additional option for program  participants, designed to provide up-front financing. According to program  administrators, this option was created to increase the production of  rental housing with CDBG funds and to accelerate the distribution of  funds to small rental property owners. According to program  administrators, as of November 2009, 1,024 property owners had agreed to  participate in this option.", "Mississippi created the Small Rental Assistance Program for owners of  small rental properties in four counties (Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, and  Pearl River) and made forgivable loans available in two funding rounds.  The program was designed to offer four types of assistance: (1) rental  income subsidy, (2) repair or reconstruction of a Katrina-damaged  property, (3) reconstruction or conversion reimbursement of a non- Katrina-damaged property, or (4) new construction reimbursement. The  state of Mississippi generally disbursed loans in two installments, half  when the property owner provided a building permit and the remainder  when the property owner provided a certificate of occupancy.", "In addition, Mississippi used CDBG funds to address the need for  workforce housing and public housing. Mississippi created a Long Term  Workforce Housing Program to provide grants and loans to local units of  government, nonprofits, and for-profit organizations to provide long-term  affordable housing in Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, and Pearl River  counties. This program was designed to benefit households that earned  120 percent of area median income or less. The program could be used to  develop or repair housing for homeowners or renters. The state also  designated CDBG funds for the repair or replacement of public housing  units that were damaged by Hurricane Katrina.

FEMA accepted  applications for IHP Repair or Replacement Assistance via phone and the  Internet. Applicants who were awarded housing assistance, but who had  remaining unmet housing needs because damages exceeded the maximum  award, were referred to SBA for a disaster home loan application.  Similarly, SBA used its existing processes to make Home Disaster and  Physical Disaster Business Loans available to eligible homeowners.  Consistent with its existing processes, SBA made loan applications  available to applicants after they registered with FEMA and used its  existing loan underwriting criteria to evaluate loan applications. The  administrators of these programs did not create new programs to make  post-disaster housing assistance available. As we have previously reported,  SBA encountered challenges processing the large volume of applications  after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita but has since taken steps to more  effectively process large increases in application volume.", "Similarly, state agencies generally used existing procedures to award GO  Zone LIHTCs and HMGP funds. Specifically, in both Louisiana and  Mississippi, the state housing finance agencies announced the availability  of the additional credits through qualified allocation plans, reviewed and  scored the applications received, and awarded the credits to the highest  scoring applicants. Likewise, the state administrators of HMGP funds in  Louisiana stated they did not make changes to their normal application  processes after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In contrast, Mississippi  changed its HMGP application process by developing a Web-based system  to accept applications.

HUD\u2019s Capital Fund Emergency/Natural Disaster  Funding does not require a presidential disaster declaration to become  available; this program was available to PHAs that were affected by the  hurricanes.", "CDBG-funded assistance for homeowners and small rental property  owners did not become available until HUD accepted the program designs.  Each state had to submit an Action Plan to HUD detailing the plans for the  uses of its supplemental CDBG funds, and each had to submit  amendments to these plans for substantial changes. HUD accepted  Louisiana\u2019s Action Plan for the Road Home Homeowner and Small Rental  Assistance Programs in May 2006, and the state began accepting  applications for the homeowner program in August 2006 and the small  rental program in January 2007 (see fig. 3). According to an administrator  of Louisiana\u2019s CDBG-funded programs, the homeowner program was  initiated first because homeowners lost real property, homeowners are  less transient than renters, and the state perceived rental property owners  as having other federal resources for recovery, such as tax credits and  SBA loans. HUD accepted Mississippi\u2019s Action Plan for the Homeowner  Assistance Program in April 2006 and the Small Rental Assistance Program  in July 2007. The state began accepting applications for the homeowner  and small rental programs in April 2006 and September 2007, respectively.  According to officials from the Mississippi Governor\u2019s office, one of the  reasons that the homeowner program was implemented first was because  there were more homeowners than renters in the coastal counties. In  addition, according to state officials, it was possible for the state to  implement a compensation program for homeowners more quickly,  because funds could be provided directly to homeowners without the  requirement for environmental review assessments.

As a result of such rent increases, low- and moderate- income renters who could afford housing in New Orleans before the storm  may no longer be able to find affordable housing.

While it is projected that there will be more than a  full recovery of subsidized rental housing units in Mississippi\u2019s coastal  counties, it is also estimated that there will be an increased need for  additional rental assistance in these counties, such as housing choice  vouchers, to make available units more affordable.", "Finally, some of the residents who were displaced from their communities  have not returned, especially lower-income renters. As previously noted,  while the New Orleans metropolitan area is home to a population that is  equal to about 90 percent of the pre-Katrina population, school enrollment  across the metropolitan area has slowed, suggesting that the  characteristics of the population that has returned are different than those  of the pre-storm population.

First, to address the challenges related to the gaps in funding available to  repair and replace damaged housing\u2014specifically rental housing\u2014federal  funds for permanent post-disaster housing could be allocated between  homeowners and rental property owners based on need, and take into  account all of the programs and resources that are available. For example,  Congress could provide more direction to states on how to allocate  appropriations for the CDBG program. Directing how grantees allocate  CDBG funds would entail trade-offs. For example, states may have less  discretion in designing post-disaster housing programs and deciding how  much funding is to be made available for rebuilding units occupied by  homeowners and renters and for economic development activities. While  such trade-offs exist, Congress has previously provided specific direction  to recipients of CDBG funds. For example, Congress provided direction to  recipients of funds under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, which  is based on the CDBG program and focuses on redevelopment of  abandoned and foreclosed homes. Congress directed recipients of these  funds to focus on areas of greatest need, including areas with high  concentrations of foreclosed homes. Without specific direction on how to  better target disaster-related CDBG funds for the redevelopment of  homeowner and rental units after future disasters, states\u2019 allocation of  assistance to homeowners and rental property owners may again result in  significant differences in the level of assistance provided.", "To address the financing gaps faced by homeowners, larger amounts of  assistance could be made available to households. Several of the reports  we reviewed indicated that additional funds should be provided to  homeowners that did not receive sufficient CDBG funds to recover from  the storms. For example, one private research organization recommends  that the federal government allocate funds to close the gaps created by the  formula for the Road Home Homeowner Program, the CDBG-funded  homeowner program in Louisiana. In addition, this organization has  stated that grants should have been calculated based upon either the  higher of the assessed value or the damage estimate repair costs rather  than the pre-storm estimated value of homes. For future disasters, basing  grant amounts on repair costs rather than property values may be helpful  to households in closing financing gaps\u2014especially those households that  live in distressed or less desirable communities where property values are  less than the cost of repairs and replacement. However, in providing larger  amounts of assistance to individual households, fewer households may be  served with the same amount of overall program funding.", "To help reduce delays in delivering funds for the recovery of housing,  guidance could be developed, eligible uses of funds could be clarified,  states could design programs to provide funds up front, and application  processes could be simplified. We previously recommended that HUD  issue guidance for CDBG disaster-assistance programs that provides  information on acceptable program designs and discusses program  elements that trigger federal environmental reviews. We also  recommended that HUD coordinate with FEMA to clarify options and  limits of using CDBG funds with other disaster-related federal funds.  Such guidance could help states in the future by clearly articulating  applicable legal and financial requirements, as well as the types of  activities that may trigger federal environmental review requirements.  State officials in Louisiana have acknowledged that delays in making  CDBG funds available to small rental property owners could have been  minimized by designing a program that provided funds up front, rather  than after property owners independently financed repairs. Such program  designs for the use of CDBG funds after future disasters could potentially  reduce delays. Furthermore, organizations that represented disaster  victims have stated that complex application processes contributed to  delays in Louisiana, suggesting that for future disasters, delays could be  minimized if application processes are clear and transparent.", "Decision makers could also reconsider what federal programs should  deliver assistance for permanent housing. A report by the Office of the  Federal Coordinator indicated that the CDBG program should be re- evaluated to determine whether it should be the primary funding vehicle  for replacing housing stock following a disaster. The Office of the Federal  Coordinator also indicated that experts should convene to discuss how  challenges associated with the current federal funding vehicles for post- disaster recovery and rebuilding\u2014such as CDBG, Public Assistance,  Individual Assistance, and HMGP\u2014could be addressed and to explore  ideas for potential new vehicles and/or frameworks. According to HUD  officials, the CDBG program is not one of the federal government\u2019s official  disaster recovery programs. However, to date the supplemental CDBG  funds that have gone to the Gulf Coast have been the largest amount of  CDBG disaster relief provided to one area in the history of the program. A  previous GAO report stated that HUD should continue to work with the  administration to determine what role the CDBG program should have in  disaster recovery. HUD officials have also stated that a permanently  authorized disaster CDBG program may be more effective in delivering  post-disaster housing assistance. HUD officials have stated that if a  disaster-specific CDBG program is given a permanent role, they would  issue permanent regulations and program guidance. In addition, there  would be less need after each disaster for HUD to consider the use of  waivers and write federal notices to guide the use of CDBG funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita highlights the need to re- evaluate how housing assistance for homeowners and rental property  owners is delivered after a disaster. If the federal government adopts a  similar approach in the future, it will likely encounter many of the same  challenges, including gaps in available financing for permanent housing  and delays in the availability of program funds to victims. The state  programs, funded under the CDBG program, the largest single source of  federal assistance for permanent housing after the 2005 Gulf Coast  hurricanes, focused much of their resources on addressing the needs of  homeowners. Our analysis shows that recovery funds addressed a  substantially larger percentage of the rebuilding needs of homeowners  compared to rental property owners and that state-designed programs  have not fully accounted for the needs of renters in their decisions  regarding how to allocate funds. As a result, there continues to be an acute  need for affordable rental housing in the Gulf Coast area, and many  displaced residents may not be able to return to their communities. States,  which had broad flexibility in their use of CDBG funds, did not prioritize  the repair or replacement of rental housing for several reasons, including  their decisions to rely on other sources of federal funding for rental  housing, such as SBA loans and GO Zone LIHTCs. However, the GO Zone  LIHTC program addressed only a small part of the repair and replacement  needs of rental properties and furthermore, according to program  administrators, investors\u2019 demand for tax credits in the current economy  has been weak. In the event of a future disaster, the lack of specific  direction to states on how to target disaster-related CDBG funds may  again result in a significant difference in the amounts of assistance for the  redevelopment of homeowner and rental property units.

We also identified whether the program was  administered by a federal or state agency, the amount of funds available,  and how the administering agency awarded funds. For most programs, we  used the amount appropriated by Congress as the amount available.

For Mississippi\u2019s Public Housing Program, which was funded through the  Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG), we reported the  date that HUD approved the program design.", "To determine the extent to which the programs we reviewed responded to  the needs of homeowners and rental property owners in repairing or  replacing homeowner and rental units, we compared the available data on  units funded to the estimated number of units damaged for homeowner  and rental units. We first obtained data on the number of homeowner and  rental units with minor, major, and severe damage in Louisiana and  Mississippi from the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA)  published estimates. We used this information as an indicator of housing  need at the time of the disaster. We also used this information to highlight  the Louisiana parishes and Mississippi counties that sustained the most  damage. Based on available data for damaged homeowner and rental  units, we determined that eight parishes accounted for 70 percent of the  total homeowner and rental units damaged in Louisiana and that three  counties accounted for 43 percent of the total homeowner and rental units  damaged in Mississippi. To determine the proportion of homeowner and  rental units that sustained damage in each state and in the most damaged  areas, we compared the estimated number of homeowner and rental units  damaged to the number of occupied homeowner and rental units  statewide and in the most damaged areas from the 2000 Decennial  Census.", "We obtained data from program administrators on the numbers of  homeowner and/or rental housing units that were funded. For each  program, we requested data on the number of units funded as of  December 2008, although for some programs, program administrators  could not provide data as of this date. Specifically, data for Mississippi\u2019s  Small Rental Assistance and Long Term Workforce Housing Programs  were available as of April 2009; data for the Home Disaster Loan Program  were available as of July 2009; data for the Capital Fund  Emergency/Natural Disaster Funding Program for Mississippi and the  Physical Disaster Business Loan Program were available as of August  2009; and data for the New Markets Tax Credits (GO Zone) Program were  available for activities that were undertaken through December 2008. We  do not believe that the different dates for the count of units funded under  these programs will have a material impact on the results, as month-to- month unit count changes have been small for the key programs. For  Louisiana\u2019s Road Home Homeowner Program and Mississippi\u2019s  Homeowner Assistance Program, we counted awards to homeowners as  homeowner units funded, although homeowners are not required to use  their grant funds to repair their homes. We were not able to include data  on the number of rental units funded through the Physical Disaster  Business Loan Program because SBA did not have readily available  information on the number of rental units funded. To determine the  number and amount of Physical Disaster Business Loans for the repair of  residential rental properties, we obtained data categorized by the North  American Industry Classification System. We included approved loans for  real estate repairs only. Due to data limitations, we may not have included  all physical disaster business loans that were provided for real estate  repairs to residential rental properties. While we did not include a $15  million appropriation for the repair of rental housing damaged by  Hurricanes Katrina and Rita as one of the programs in our review, we  included these funds as well as data on the number of rental units funded  with this appropriation as a part of our analysis because it is an additional  source of funding for permanent rental housing. With available data, we  compared the total number of homeowner units funded to the total  number of homeowner units damaged in each state.", "Because some funded units may have received assistance from multiple  programs, we took steps to avoid double counting. We compared the  addresses of homeowner units funded by Louisiana\u2019s Road Home  Homeowner Assistance Program, Mississippi\u2019s Homeowner Assistance  Program, Individuals and Households Program: Repair or Replacement  Assistance, and the Physical Home Disaster Loan Program for both  Louisiana and Mississippi. This comparison allowed us to determine  whether a unit was funded by only one program or by multiple programs.  In order to ensure that an address was counted only once, we converted  the addresses of the homeowner units funded by each of the programs we  reviewed into a consistent format and applied standardization rules (for  example, \u201cStreet\u201d was consistently changed to \u201cSt.\u201d). This allowed us to  look for double counting for over 99 percent of the addresses we  compared. We could not compare addresses for homeowner units funded  by the HMGP, Long Term Workforce Housing Program, and New Markets  Tax Credits (GO Zone) Program, because unit-level data on rental property  street addresses were not readily available.", "In addition, we summarized the amounts of assistance awarded (and loans  approved) to homeowners and rental property owners through the  programs we reviewed as of December 2008, unless program  administrators could not provide funding data as of this date. For example,  administrators of Mississippi\u2019s Small Rental Assistance and Long Term  Workforce Housing Programs did not have archival data for December  2008, and thus they provided data as of April 2009. For the New Markets  Tax Credit Program (GO Zone), funding data were available for activities  that were undertaken through December 2008. However, while we could  determine funding amounts for homeowner units, we could not determine  funding amounts for rental units for this program because rental units are  funded as a part of mixed-use projects (that is, projects with both  commercial and residential uses). It was not possible to determine the  amounts funded only for the rental units associated with mixed-use  projects.", "We also obtained and analyzed data from program administrators to  determine the extent to which funded homeowner and rental units were  complete as of summer 2009. We were unable to determine the extent to  which homeowner units were complete because either program  administrators were not required to collect data or the data were not  readily available. For most of the programs that funded rental units, data  were available on the extent to which they were complete as of June, July,  and August 2009 (see app. VII). Data on the extent to which rental units  funded through the New Markets Tax Credit Program (GO Zone) were  complete were not readily available.", "To assess the reliability of agency data on the numbers and location of  homeowner and rental units funded as well as the amount of assistance  provided, we (1) performed electronic testing for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness; (2) reviewed related documentation,  including audit reports on data verification for some programs we  reviewed; and (3) worked with agency officials or contractors to identify  any data problems. When we found discrepancies, such as unpopulated  fields or data entry errors, we notified agency officials or contractors and  worked with these officials to correct the discrepancies before conducting  our analysis. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report.", "To identify challenges to homeowners and rental property owners, we  reviewed studies and reports about housing recovery in the areas affected  by the hurricanes, interviewed the administrators of the programs we  reviewed, interviewed organizations that worked with disaster victims to  obtain permanent housing, and analyzed data on the timeliness of funding  availability and application processing. To describe the timeliness of  funding availability, we interviewed program administrators, reviewed  prior GAO and other reports, and obtained documentation of the dates on  which HUD accepted plans for CDBG-funded programs. Also, in  examining application processing times for CDBG-funded programs, we  obtained data from program administrators on each loan or grant  awarded. We determined the median number of days between the date the  application was received by the state and the date funds were awarded  (for the homeowner programs) or the closing occurred (for the small  rental programs). We excluded outliers and records with missing data to  determine the median number of days elapsed between these points.  Further, we summarized available information from program  administrators and other reports on factors that may have contributed to  processing delays.", "To identify potential options for mitigating the challenges we identified,  we reviewed recommendations in studies and reports, suggestions from  program administrators and organizations that worked with disaster  victims to obtain permanent housing, and information on the  congressional intent of post-disaster housing assistance, including the  Stafford Act and FEMA\u2019s Disaster Housing Strategy.
