Among the conditions State uses to determine hardship pay are poor medical facilities,substandard schools for children, severe climate, high crime, political instability, and physical isolation. Recently, State has begun recognizing the lack of spousal employment opportunities as another factor in determining hardship. Where conditions are so adverse as to require additional pay as a recruitment and retention incentive, State can provide additional differential pay of up to 15 percent of base salary.

In a May 2001 semiannual report to the Congress, the Inspector General stated that inadequate training for first-tour staff in consular offices has led to lapses in nonimmigrant visa management at posts in a region where alien smuggling and visa fraud are prevalent. Furthermore, in Conakry (Guinea)\u2014a 25 percent hardship post where visa fraud and administrative problems were attributed to inexperienced staff\u2014the Inspector General found a high proportion of junior officers, mostly on their first tour, and officers in positions above their grade, making them ill-prepared to deal with work challenges. Similarly, in Bamako (Mali), another 25 percent hardship post that is chronically understaffed, the Inspector General again cited staff inexperience when consular employees failed to detect an alien smuggling ring. In these cases, the Inspector General called on the State Department to examine whether staff assigned to these posts have the level of experience necessary to operate effectively. Meanwhile, chronic staffing problems experienced in many African posts persist, and because consular positions worldwide are often filled by lower level staff, the Bureau of Consular Affairs considers African posts at risk. In Lagos (Nigeria), for example, 12 State positions were unfilled as of February 2002; and many of those filling positions were first-tour junior officers and civil service employees who had never served overseas. In the 10-officer consular section in Lagos, only the consul had more than one tour of consular experience.

For example, in Kiev (Ukraine), about half of the Foreign Service officer positions were staffed by junior officers or others in the positions for the first time; several employees were working in positions at least two levels above their grades. In addition, with the consul general position vacant in Kiev for a year and the deputy consul general position vacant for 15 months, a junior officer was serving as acting consul general. A similar situation occurred at a U.S. consulate in Russia when an untenured junior officer was serving as the consul general in 2001.

In Russia, 41 percent of U.S. mission employees did not meet the language proficiency level designated for their positions. In Pakistan, five public diplomacy positions in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi were held by employees without the language proficiency State would consider useful. In Saudi Arabia, the head of the public diplomacy section at a consulate had no Arabic language skills. According to post officials, language requirements are regularly lowered or waived to fill some positions quickly and reduce lengthy staffing gaps. To compensate for this, missions like China and Russia offer staff the opportunity to pursue language training while they are at post.

We have reported that valid and reliable data are a key element to effective workforce planning and strategic human capital management. While State officials told us they are making significant efforts to improve the department\u2019s mechanisms for workforce planning, we found the existing human resources data that State maintains and analyzes to be limited. For example, State does not maintain historical bidding data, data on directed assignments, and data on the dispersion of employee ratings and promotions at an aggregate level and the extent to which hardship service was considered in these personnel actions. In addition, State does not regularly analyze assignment histories to determine how the burden of hardship service is shared among Foreign Service employees.

Furthermore, financial and nonfinancial recruiting and retention incentives have not enticed employees to bid on some hardship posts in sufficient numbers. According to State officials, the problem of staffing hardship posts is exacerbated by a shortage of officers in the mid-level ranks, as well as certain restrictions such as medical problems (an employee\u2019s or a family member\u2019s), difficulty obtaining jobs for spouses, inadequate schooling for children, or the time to become proficient in a difficult language.

One example illustrating this problem is the assignment of senior officers. These officers are needed at overseas posts, particularly at hardship posts, to apply their experience and give guidance to junior officers. However, as we discuss later, senior officers nearing retirement often prefer to complete their careers in Washington for financial reasons.

However, State does not require that these bidders actually be assigned to hardship posts. In fact, rules under this program permit some fair share bidders to bid only on domestic positions. If fair share bidders bid on any overseas assignment, three of the six bids that they submit at their grades and within their specialty must be on hardship posts. Bidders may include up to three bids on assignments one level above their grade at 15 percent hardship posts or higher. However, employees may still choose to bid on posts with lesser hardship (5 to 10 percent differential). In the 2001 assignments cycle, 464 employees were designated as fair share bidders.

In addition, various employment mechanisms are available to allow post management to fill staffing gaps with temporary or limited-term personnel when necessary. While these options help ease the staffing problems at hardship posts and offer short- term relief, they are less than ideal.

Ninety-eight, or about 38 percent, of the posts overseas met the criteria to be designated most difficult to staff in the 2002 assignments cycle. To staff positions at these posts, State eases certain rules, which could compromise diplomatic readiness. For example, to attract employees to bid on these positions, the department may allow stretch assignments early in the assignments cycle, waive language requirements, or offer unusually short tours of duty (12 to 18 months). The vast majority of the most-difficult-to-staff posts are in the Bureau of African Affairs, with about 40 percent (39) of the posts, and the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, with 27 percent (26 posts, mostly in the Newly Independent States).

In a report to State in March 2001, the Office of the Inspector General supported using civil service employees to fill overseas vacancies but stated that the program had not substantially reduced the systemwide staffing shortage.

These financial incentives include a post differential allowance (or hardship pay) ranging from 5 to 25 percent of base pay to compensate employees for service where environmental conditions differ substantially from those in the United States and to entice them to serve.While there are factors other than money that may keep an officer from bidding for a position at a particular hardship post or restrict an officer\u2019s options to only selected posts, our analysis of bidding data (fig. 3) suggests that the differential rate does not appear to be effective in enticing a significant number of employees to certain posts. To address this issue, in 2001, State began to provide an additional 15 percent incentive to those who sign up for a third year at selected 2-year posts that have been extremely difficult to staff."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Locality Pay Has Diminished the Relative Value of Differential Pay", "paragraphs": ["According to State officials and Foreign Service employees, the incentive provided by differential (hardship) pay for overseas service has been diminished by rules governing locality pay. Locality pay is a salary comparability benefit to attract workers in the continental United States to the federal government versus the private sector. In 1994, an executive order began the process of allocating annual governmentwide pay increases between base pay and locality pay. However, Foreign Service employees serving overseas do not get locality pay. Thus, the differences in the statutes governing differential pay for overseas service and locality pay have created a gap between the compensation of domestic and overseas employees\u2014a gap that grows each year as locality pay rates continue to rise by 1 percent or more annually. State has not analyzed the effect that this difference has had since 1994 on the number of Foreign Service employees who bid on overseas assignments, including hardship posts. However, State Department officials, the American Foreign Service Association, and many officers with whom we met said that this gap penalizes overseas employees and that if it continues to grow, it will inevitably keep employees from choosing an overseas career in the Foreign Service. Figure 5 illustrates the effect that increases in locality pay have on the relative value of overseas differential rates. As figure 5 shows, the advantage of overseas pay with differential has eroded over time and locality pay has created a financial disincentive for all overseas employees. As of January 2002, the locality pay rate for Washington, D.C., was 11.48 percent. We estimate that by 2006 and 2010, the differential pay incentives for the 15 percent and 20 percent differential posts, respectively, will be less than the locality pay for Washington, D.C., assuming that the locality pay rate continues to increase at about 1 percent per year.", "In addition, Foreign Service employees we interviewed emphasized that it is also a financial disincentive to retire while serving overseas because post differential is not used to determine an officer\u2019s retirement benefits whereas locality pay, which is offered to those employees who serve in Washington, D.C., is factored into the retirement benefit. According to State human resources officials, retiring with a high three average salary calculated on service abroad can result in a substantial reduction in annuity annually, compared with a Washington-based high three average salary. As a result, a significant number of employees who are nearing retirement return to Washington, D.C., for their last tour of duty to have their locality pay factored into their high three salaries for purposes of calculating retirement benefits. In fact, according to State, since 1997, 62 percent of senior Foreign Service and management level employees who retired concluded their careers in Washington rather than from an overseas tour. This exacerbates the problem of staffing hardship posts because the most experienced employees tend not to choose overseas service during their last tour of duty.", "To address these overseas pay and retirement benefit issues, State, with the support of the American Foreign Service Association, proposed that Foreign Service employees working overseas should get locality pay equal to the Washington, D.C., rate. The Office of Personnel Management agrees that locality pay should be extended to overseas employees and has asked the Office of Management and Budget to consider this issue. The State Department estimates that it would cost $50 million to $60 million a year to increase overseas employees\u2019 pay to the Washington, D.C., level.

However, positions at hardship posts will continue to have fewer bids from qualified Foreign Service employees unless (a) adequate incentives are in place to entice these employees to bid on and accept assignments at hardship posts and (b) appropriate levers are used, when necessary, to assign experienced staff where they are most needed. Moreover, an assignment system that puts Foreign Service employees in the driver\u2019s seat and does not systematically prioritize the posts and positions that must be filled does not ensure that State\u2019s staffing requirements at hardship posts are adequately addressed.
