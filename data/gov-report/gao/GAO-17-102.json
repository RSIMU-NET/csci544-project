As of November 2016, IRS plans to begin compiling the new IRA asset data in 2017, but has not specified when the new IRA asset data will be available for analysis. Seventeen of the 26 custodians, who GAO identified as allowing retirement accounts with unconventional assets and who participated in GAO's data collection effort, reported having nearly half a million of these accounts in their custody at the end of calendar year 2015.

GAO's review of industry documents found that individuals wanting to invest in unconventional assets through their IRA generally agree to be responsible for overseeing the selection, management, and monitoring of account investments and shoulder the consequences of most decisions affecting their accounts. For example, owners of such accounts assume a fiduciary role, which makes them assume greater responsibility for overseeing the selection, management, and monitoring of account investments, and shoulder the consequences of most decisions affecting their accounts.", "Current IRS guidance provides little information to help IRA owners understand their expanded responsibilities and potential challenges associated with investing in unconventional assets.

Many owners of  individual retirement accounts (IRA) and participants in 401(k) plans  invest in mutual funds comprising stocks, bonds, and cash (in part  because their IRA custodian or employer may limit their investment  options).

For all objectives, we interviewed a range of federal and state regulators,  industry stakeholders, and participant advocates; reviewed relevant  federal laws, regulations, and guidance; and consulted available  literature. To examine the prevalence of retirement accounts that invest in  unconventional assets, we compiled data from industry stakeholders, web  searches, and the literature to help us identify 26 custodians and 48 other  service providers with experience working with account owners in  establishing and managing such accounts. Next, to learn about the  number, type, and value of retirement accounts held under custody at the  end of calendar year 2015, we conducted a survey data collection effort  and obtained responses from 17 of the 26 custodians that we identified  from available sources. We focused our effort on custodians as they are  responsible for reporting annually the fair market value of each IRA under  custody to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The custodians who  provided information varied in terms of the number and value of accounts  they held, and the types of unconventional assets they allowed. To  examine how these retirement accounts are managed and any  associated challenges, we developed a follow-up set of questions for the  same 17 custodians and received responses from 10 of them. We also  developed a similar set of questions for the 48 service providers we  identified who provide administrative support for IRAs and solo 401(k)  plans, collecting information from 21 of them. To augment our  understanding of challenges associated with managing retirement  accounts invested in unconventional assets, we analyzed 334 complaints  filed with three federal agencies\u2014the Department of Labor (DOL), the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  (OCC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\u2014and two  independent organizations\u2014the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  (FINRA) and the Better Business Bureau. Our list of custodians and  service providers was used to query databases and identify complaints.  We analyzed the complaints, developed general categories of challenges  account owners faced, and conducted a two-step review process to  ensure proper categorization of each complaint. We did not confirm the  authenticity of these complaints or independently investigate any of the  allegations made, or collect information on the extent to which each  complaint was resolved. As part of developing challenge categories, we  also reviewed federal and state enforcement actions against entities  involved with these types of retirement accounts. Finally, we examined  industry websites, and collected and reviewed publicly available  documents, including application forms, fee disclosures, and custodial  trust account agreements used to establish an IRA.

Traditionally, account owners  participating in these arrangements defer taxes on contributions to these  accounts up to certain statutory limits, and in general, contributions and  investment earnings on those contributions are not taxed as income until  the account owner withdraws them from the account. In addition,  account owners typically direct their investments and make decisions  regarding the purchase, sale, reinvestment, and withdrawal of  investments. Individuals saving for retirement in the United States  typically save through IRAs or an employer-sponsored plan, like a 401(k)  plan.", "What Is a Solo 401(K) Plan?  While employer-sponsored plans generally  have multiple employees participating in their  plans, a solo 401(k) plan\u2014also called an  individual 401(k), a one-participant plan, self- employed 401(k), or self-directed 401(k)  plan\u2014are qualified retirement plans designed  for the self-employed or a small business  owner with no employees (beyond themselves  and their spouse). The Economic Growth and  Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 included  reforms that generally provided small  business owners with no employees and the  self-employed the same advantages of a  conventional 401(k) plan, such as employee  deferrals, loan features, and Roth  contributions. Solo 401(k) sponsors select  plan investment options and may contribute to  the plan both as plan sponsor and plan  participant up to a combined $54,000 per  account (or $60,000 if age 50 or older) in tax  year 2017. In addition, plan sponsors may  elect to maintain exclusive authority and  discretion to manage and control plan assets  without involving a third-party. to qualify for preferential tax treatment. The most common IRA types are:  (1) traditional IRAs (which allow eligible individuals to make tax-deductible  contributions and accumulate tax-deferred investment earnings); and (2)  Roth IRAs, (which allow eligible individuals to make after-tax contributions  and accumulate investment earnings tax-free).", "401(k) plans have become the most common employer-sponsored  retirement savings vehicle in the United States. Created by the  Revenue Act of 1978, 401(k) plans typically allow participants to  specify the size of their contributions and direct those contributions, as  well as any made by their employer, to one or more investments  among the options that the employer has preselected as offering  effective diversification across broad asset classes. Investment  options generally include mutual funds, company stock, and money  market funds. DOL\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration  (EBSA) is responsible for, among other things, administering and  enforcing the fiduciary, reporting, and disclosure provisions of Title I of  ERISA. Self-employed individuals or owners of small businesses with  no employees may sponsor a 401(k) plan, known as a solo 401(k)  plan. To set up a solo 401(k) plan, individuals must adopt a written  plan document, arrange a trust for the plan\u2019s assets, develop a  recordkeeping system, and provide plan information to employees  eligible to participate. Solo 401(k) plan account owners can select the  plan\u2019s investment options as plan sponsor and invest in these options  as the plan participant.

Individuals seeking to save for  retirement by investing in unconventional assets must first determine  which type of retirement savings vehicle and investment aligns with their  savings goals. Nine of 17 custodians reported that clients want to invest  in unconventional assets for a variety of reasons, including avoiding the  stock market, diversifying retirement portfolios, investing in a tangible or  familiar asset, or investing in a company not yet publicly traded. One  custodian said that most individuals seeking investment in unconventional  assets did not own their own businesses, and that it was more common  for these individuals to establish an IRA with a custodian that allowed this  kind of investment. Self-employed individuals or owners of small  businesses who employ no other full-time employees may qualify to  sponsor a solo 401(k) plan. Two service providers who advise their clients  on creating solo 401(k) plans to invest in unconventional assets said that  their clients preferred the 401(k) plan for its higher annual contribution  limits and the ability to take participant loans.", "Establishing and Funding an Account. An individual must take several  steps to establish and fund an account that allows investment in  unconventional assets. First, individuals opening an IRA must find a  custodian willing to administer the asset. Eighteen of the 21 service  providers reported that in their experience most individuals wanting to set  up an account had a specific investment or asset type in mind before  making initial contact with them. Twelve of the 17 custodians reported  that they placed some restriction on the types of unconventional assets  that they would allow. For example, they reported that they did not allow  investment in certain assets, including foreign-based assets, precious  metals, person-to-person promissory notes, or single-member LLCs. One  custodian noted that such restrictions were necessary because some  assets were administratively infeasible for its business plan. For example,  a custodian who does not specialize in foreign-based assets may not  accept custody of these types of assets. Second, prospective IRA owners  must sign a custodial agreement that outlines the respective roles and  responsibilities of the account owner and custodian over the lifecycle of  an account. Our analysis of agreements available on 20 custodians\u2019  websites found that 18 custodians used IRS\u2019s model custodial agreement  to help IRAs conform to IRS requirements. The model agreement  includes several articles that IRS has approved regarding contribution  limits, prohibited assets, RMDs, and the treatment of beneficiaries,  among other things. The agreement also provides custodians with an  opportunity to amend the form with additional provisions as long as these  provisions comply with applicable requirements of federal and state law.  Third, the individual must authorize the custodian to fund the new account  either through a new contribution, or through a transfer or rollover of  funds from another qualified retirement account.", "Purchasing Assets. The choice to purchase unconventional assets rather  than publicly traded stocks and bonds in a retirement account marks a  significant shift in the balance in account management responsibilities  toward the account owner. On the one hand, solo 401(k) account owners  sponsor the plan and can serve as its trustee, allowing them to purchase  any asset permissible in the plan documents and deposit the asset in  their designated trustee account. On the other hand, IRA owners  investing in unconventional assets must locate an asset, determine its  suitability for their retirement goals, and conduct due diligence on the  investment and the investment sponsor. In addition, to finalize the  purchase, these IRA owners must collect, review, and prepare all  purchase documents and provide them to the custodian to execute the  purchase on behalf of the IRA. IRA owners and custodians must  complete this sequence of tasks each time an asset is placed in the  account. (See table 5.)", "The amount and type of documentation that account owners must provide  to custodians before an asset can be purchased can vary considerably  depending on the type of asset being purchased. Our analysis of  custodian documentation found that assets like promissory notes or  precious metals require minimal documentation from the account owner,  while other assets, such as real estate or private equity, can require the  account owner to provide considerable documentation before a purchase  can be made. Depending on the asset type selected, an account owner  may have to expend considerable time and effort to finalize an asset  purchase. (See table 6.)", "Some IRA owners may choose to exercise greater control and limit a  custodian\u2019s direct involvement in the purchase of unconventional assets  by adding a checkbook control feature to their IRA. In order to obtain  checkbook control, the account owner must first establish an LLC that is  owned by the IRA. Once this new LLC is established, a business  checking account linked to IRA funds is set up, and account owners are  named manager of the LLC with control of the checkbook. Using the  checkbook owned by the IRA\u2019s LLC, the account owner can take  advantage of time-sensitive offers and purchase assets directly from  investment sponsors without having to wait for a custodian to execute a  purchase or sale.", "Account Management and Compliance. Account owners who invest in  unconventional assets typically agree to become responsible for the day- to-day management of their accounts and ensuring that the account  remains compliant with laws and regulations, according to our review of  selected custodial agreements. As an IRA custodian can only act on the  direction of the account owner, an account owner generally must inform  the custodian of the many tasks needed to maintain assets in their  account\u2014such as purchases, sales, earned income, payments due,  requested distributions, and changes in the account\u2019s value\u2014and provide  sufficient documentation to the custodian to facilitate each account  transaction on their behalf. (See table 7.)", "The extent of custodian involvement in the ongoing management of an  account can depend on the types of unconventional assets held in the  account. For example, one custodian mentioned that promissory notes  that promised a balloon payment of principal and interest at the end of a  specified term generally required less recordkeeping from the custodian.  The same custodian and another described the management of a real  estate holding in an IRA as being a labor-intensive, manual process. In  this case, a custodian would coordinate with the account owner to pay all  expenses from IRA funds, such as maintenance, improvements, property  taxes, condominium association fees, general bills, and insurance, and  return any related income to the IRA.", "Account owners need to be mindful of fees and expenses associated with  plan investments and services to determine whether they continue to be  reasonable in light of the services provided. Given that retirement  accounts must be held in trust, IRA custodians generally charge a range  of administrative and transactional fees for the services they provide  throughout the lifecycle of an IRA. While some transactions like precious  metal storage lend themselves to a flat fee, other transactions like real  estate purchases can involve multiple transactions requiring greater  involvement by a custodian, leading to a higher incidence of fees that  must be paid out of the account. In reviewing fee disclosures from  custodians who made them publicly available on their websites, we found  that custodians generally charged fees for similar services\u2014account  establishment, account maintenance, transactional fees, and account  termination\u2014but the type of fee structure used and amounts of fees  charged varied among custodians. Custodians\u2019 fee structures generally  included a (1) flat fee; (2) a per-asset fee in an account; or (3) a fee  based on a percentage of an account\u2019s value.

Some  unconventional assets, such as precious metals, have a readily available  FMV; other assets, such as undeveloped land and private equity, may  require IRA owners to obtain a third-party appraisal or rely on investment  sponsors to provide the information. Many of the custodial agreements  we reviewed made IRA owners responsible for obtaining and providing a  year-end FMV of unconventional assets in their accounts to the custodian  each year. However, some custodians contact the investment sponsor  directly to obtain an updated FMV, and if unsuccessful, may report the  last-known FMV or the original purchase price. As a result, the FMV  reported to IRS may not reflect a nonpublicly traded asset\u2019s current value.

For example, the last-known FMV can be used to  calculate federal tax liability for IRA owners: when calculating RMDs; when determining the distribution amount in the event the IRA  engages in a prohibited transaction; and when reporting an in-kind distribution in the event a custodian resigns  an account (e.g., IRA owner fails to pay custodial fees or to provide  updated FMV).", "Distributions of assets at their last-known FMV can be especially  damaging if the asset distributed is found to be valueless and/or an  updated FMV is unattainable.

In 2011 SEC\u2019s Office of Investor Education  and Advocacy and the North American Security Administrators  Association (NASAA) issued a joint investor alert warning investors that  money held in accounts that allow investments in unconventional assets  presented attractive targets for fraud promoters seeking to engage in  fraudulent conduct. The alert included multiple examples of SEC and  state enforcement cases that involved fraudulent schemes associated  with IRAs that allow investments in unconventional assets. SEC officials  said that even though the prevalence of accounts holding unconventional  assets cannot be readily determined, the potential for fraud in these  accounts remained high and that concrete examples of fraud involving  these accounts have been, and continue to be, well documented. Three  state securities administrators said complaints from account owners were  often filed years after an account had lost value because these owners  believed the periodic account statements sent by the custodian were  correct. For example, if custodians, and in turn account owners, rely on  the purchase price of a promissory note as an annual FMV, they may not  realize when a borrower has filed for bankruptcy and thereby be unable to  pay back the note. Similarly, according to the three state securities  administrators, investment sponsors may report incorrect FMV  information to custodians to perpetrate fraud.
