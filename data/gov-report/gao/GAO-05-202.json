For example, DHS has developed a plan and a process for developing, implementing, and institutionalizing a program to manage risk. In its observations about the expenditure plan and DHS's management of the program, GAO recognizes accomplishments to date and addresses the need for rigorous and disciplined program practices. For example, US-VISIT has acquired the services of a prime integration contractor to augment its ability to complete US-VISIT. However, DHS has not employed rigorous, disciplined processes typically associated with successful programs, such as tracking progress against commitments. More specifically, the fiscal year 2005 plan does not describe progress against commitments made in previous plans (e.g., capabilities, schedule, cost, and benefits). According to GAO's analysis, delays have occurred in delivering capability to track the entry and exit of persons entering the United States at air, land, and sea ports of entry. Such information is essential for oversight. Additionally, the effort to pilot alternatives for delivering the capability to track the departure of persons exiting the United States is faced with a compressed time line, missed milestones, and potentially reduced scope. In particular, the pilot evaluation period has been reduced from 3 to 2 months, and as of early November 2004, the alternatives were deployed and operating in only 5 of the 15 ports of entry scheduled to be operational by November 1, 2004. According to US-VISIT officials, this is largely due to delays in DHS granting security clearances to the civilian employees who would operate the equipment at the ports of entry. These changing facts and circumstances surrounding the pilot introduce additional risk concerning US-VISIT's delivery of promised capabilities and benefits on time and within budget."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Pursuant to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act,  2005, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) submitted to the  Congress in October 2004 its fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan for the U.S.  Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program.

For example, the analysis addresses only government  costs and does not address potential nongovernmental costs. Further, the  analysis identifies three alternatives and identifies the third alternative as  the preferred choice.

An overview of specific observations follows:   The program office has acquired the services of a prime integration  contractor to augment its ability to complete US-VISIT. On May 28,  2004, and on schedule, DHS awarded a contract for integrating existing  and new business processes and technologies to a prime contractor and  its related partners.", "The fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan does not describe progress  against commitments made in previous plans. Although this is the  fourth US-VISIT expenditure plan, it does not describe progress against  commitments made in the previous three plans. For example, the fiscal  year 2004 plan committed to analyzing, field testing, and initiating  deployment of alternative approaches for capturing biometrics during  the exit process at air and sea ports of entry. However, while the fiscal  year 2005 plan states that US-VISIT was to expand its exit pilot sites  during the summer and fall of 2004 and deploy the exit solution during  fiscal year 2005, it does not explain the reason for the change or its  potential impact. Additionally, the fiscal year 2004 plan stated that $45  million in fiscal year 2004 was to be used for exit activities. However, the  fiscal year 2005 plan states that $73 million in fiscal year 2004 funds  were to be used for exit activities, but it does not highlight this  difference or address the reason for the change in amounts.", "The exit capability alternatives are faced with a compressed time line,  missed milestones, and potentially reduced scope. In January 2004, US- VISIT deployed an initial exit capability as a pilot to two ports of entry,  while simultaneously developing other exit alternatives. The May 2004  Exit Pilot Evaluation Plan stated that all exit pilot evaluation tasks were  to be completed by September 2004. The plan allotted about 3 months to  conduct the evaluation and report the results. However, an October 2004  schedule indicated that all exit pilot evaluation tasks were to be  completed between late October 2004 and December 2004, which is  about a 2-month evaluation and reporting period. As of early November  2004, exit alternatives were deployed and operating in only 5 of the 15  ports of entry that were scheduled to be operational by November 1,  2004. According to program implementation officials, this was because  of delays in DHS granting security clearances to the civilian employees  who would operate the equipment at the ports of entry.", "Additionally, the Evaluation Execution Plan describes the sample size of  outbound passengers required to be evaluated at each port. This sample  size will produce a specified confidence level in the evaluation results.  Because of the reduced evaluation time frame, the program still plans to  collect the desired sample size at each port by adding more personnel to  the evaluation teams if needed. These changing facts and circumstances  surrounding the exit pilot introduce additional risk concerning US-VISIT\u2019s  delivery of promised capabilities and benefits on time and within budget.", "US-VISIT and ACE collaboration is moving slowly. In February 2003,  we recognized the relationship between US-VISIT and ACE and  recommended steps to promote close collaboration between these two  programs. Since then, US-VISIT and ACE managers have met to identify  potential areas for collaboration between the two programs and to  clarify how the programs can best support the DHS mission and provide  officers with the information and tools they need. However, explicit  plans have not been developed nor actions taken to understand US- VISIT/ACE dependencies and relationships. Because both programs are  making decisions on how to further define, design, develop, and  implement these systems, it is important that they exploit their  relationships to reduce rework that might be needed to integrate the  programs.", "US-VISIT system capacity is being managed in a compartmentalized  manner. Currently, DHS does not have a capacity management  program. Instead, the US-VISIT IT Management Office relies on the  respective performance management activities of the pre-existing  systems, such as those managed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection  and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Until US-VISIT has  developed a comprehensive performance management and capacity  planning program, the program will continue to be reactive in its efforts  to ensure that US-VISIT system resources are sufficient to meet current  workloads, increasing the risk that it may not be able to adequately  support mission needs.", "The cost estimating process used for Increment 2B did not follow some  key best practices. The US-VISIT cost estimate did not fully satisfy most  of the criteria called for in SEI guidance. For example, costs related to  development and integration tasks for US-VISIT component systems are  specified, but information about estimated software lines of code is not.  Additionally, no one outside the US-VISIT program office reviewed and  concurred with the cost estimating categories and methodology.  Without reliable cost estimates, the ability to make informed investment  decisions and effectively manage progress and performance is reduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan (with related program office  documentation and representations) either partially satisfies or satisfies  the legislative conditions imposed by Congress. Further, steps are planned,  initiated, under way, or completed to address all of our open  recommendations.

Given that most of these open recommendations are aimed at correcting  fundamental limitations in DHS\u2019s ability to manage the program in a way  that ensures the delivery of (1) mission value commensurate with costs and  (2) promised capabilities on time and within budget, it is important that  DHS implement the recommendations quickly and completely through  effective planning and continuous monitoring and reporting.
