However, the key tracking tools DOD uses to provide visibility on the status of the recommendations do not provide current and complete information. For example, for those items that are behind schedule, many of the expected completion dates have not been updated to reflect when the items are now expected to be completed. The current DOD guidance for tracking the recommendations' status does not include a specific requirement to keep the information current in the tracking tools. Until DOD addresses these issues, it will not have a complete and accurate picture of when tasks are expected to be finished, whether progress is being made, whether efforts have stalled, or if there are other challenges. Ensuring that there is current and complete information regarding enduring recommendations would also help inform DOD's effort to monitor the health of the defense nuclear enterprise.", "DOD and the military services are experiencing challenges related to sustainment and maintenance of nuclear weapon systems and have ongoing and planned initiatives intended to mitigate these challenges. All of the systems we reviewed have been operational since before 1998, making these systems at least 22 years old (see figure). The age of the systems has resulted in maintenance and supply issues. For example, the Ohio -class submarine has experienced the failure of parts that were not originally intended to be replaced.

DOD, along with the Department  of Energy, has undertaken an extensive, multifaceted effort to sustain and  modernize U.S. nuclear weapons capabilities, including the nuclear  weapons stockpile; the research and production infrastructure; and the  NC3 system. Some of these sustainment efforts are directly linked to  recommendations from the nuclear enterprise reviews of 2014 and the  2015 NC3 report.

In many  cases, the industrial base that produced specific parts for a weapon  system is no longer active or is no longer producing the part, so when  parts break there are no replacements available. For example, Air Force  officials working to maintain the B-52 fleet told us that they have trouble  finding suppliers who will produce the necessary parts for such an old  airframe. Similarly, the Ohio-class SSBN program is experiencing  challenges in sustaining submarines through their planned 42-year  service life. The Ohio-class was initially intended to be operational for 30  years. Since it will be in service longer than expected, the Navy is finding  that parts not originally intended to be replaced now need replacement.  Navy officials stated that obsolescence has a greater impact for these  parts that were never expected to fail and therefore do not have an  industrial base to support replacements than for parts that the Navy has  always planned to replace at some point during the Ohio-class service  life.", "In certain scenarios, maintainers across several weapon systems have  had to reengineer parts, because the original blueprints do not exist.  Maintainers we spoke to reported long lead times to have parts fabricated  and delivered, which extends the time that a system is offline for  maintenance. The 2014 nuclear enterprise reviews included multiple  recommendations to address parts obsolescence and availability  problems in both the Air Force and the Navy, including the examples  shown in table 3.", "Additionally, maintainers may cannibalize parts, a process by which parts  are taken from one asset for use in another. This process is conducted  during maintenance for both Air Force and Navy nuclear weapon  systems. For example, according to Air Force officials, parts are routinely  cannibalized from B-2 aircraft that are undergoing modifications so that  they can be used on the operational B-2 aircraft. Similarly, Navy officials  stated that parts are cannibalized from other classes of submarines to  sustain Ohio-class SSBNs when replacement parts are not available  elsewhere. Parts cannibalization has also occurred during engineered  refueling overhauls. According to Navy officials, in the past, SSBNs  completing refueling overhauls have cannibalized parts from SSBNs that  are beginning to be overhauled. The final Ohio-class SSBN to undergo an  overhaul, the USS Louisiana, will not have that option, because there will  be no other SSBNs from which to cannibalize parts; all SSBNs except the  USS Louisiana and USS Wyoming have already completed their  overhauls.

In particular, the size of a fleet can  create challenges when it becomes difficult or impossible to meet  operational requirements. According to Air Force and Navy officials,  maintenance challenges stemming from small fleet sizes particularly  affect the B-2, E-4B, and E-6B weapon systems. Scheduling maintenance  is one such challenge, because taking one aircraft down for maintenance  will have a proportionally greater effect on the number of aircraft available  for operations than it would for a larger fleet. For example, according to  Air Force officials, the B-2 is experiencing challenges related to  maintaining aircraft availability during the extensive modernizations that  are being conducted, including integration of a new weapon and  upgrades to its radar system. Scheduling this modernization process, part  of the effort to sustain the B-2, is challenging given that there are only 20  aircraft in the fleet. Taking an aircraft down for maintenance limits the  number of aircraft available for operational use by U.S. Strategic  Command. Similarly, Air Force officials told us that the time needed for  maintenance and modernization efforts on the E-4B was a primary factor  leading to decreased aircraft availability of the E-4B, because of the small  number of aircraft in the fleet\u2014four in total. Having only four aircraft  means that delays currently experienced during depot maintenance and  installation of modifications have larger effects on the overall availability  of the fleet. One aircraft unavailable as it undergoes these actions results  in one quarter of the fleet being unavailable for operations.", "Additionally, unscheduled maintenance could exacerbate the issue of  scheduling challenges and conflict with operational requirements. Having  a small fleet with some systems in maintenance could also impede the  force\u2019s ability to surge if needed. The B-52 fleet has experienced a unique  challenge, because it has recently been used extensively in conventional operations. According to Air Force officials, it takes time to change a B-52  configuration from conventional to nuclear to ready the aircraft for a  nuclear mission, which may affect aircraft availability.

To mitigate this challenge, the  Air Force sometimes chooses to issue interim clearances. But in so doing  unit commanders must accept additional risk. Specifically, since  background investigations may not be complete at the time these interim  clearances are issued, it is possible that someone who has been issued  an interim clearance will ultimately be found ineligible for that security  clearance due to information discovered during their background  investigation. Similarly, there is a backlog of top secret clearances for  missile-wing personnel working with the Minuteman III, including  maintainers. Again, the services sometimes choose to issue interim  clearances, but leadership must accept that risk, and interim clearances  may have limitations. For example, according to officials from one of the  missile wings we spoke with, a missileer in that wing with an interim top  secret clearance can complete training for the Minuteman III but cannot  be certified to be on a two-person alert team.

However, the depot team would have  to conduct portions of the maintenance in the missile fields instead of  bringing the weapon system to a depot. This new programmed depot  maintenance takes individual Minuteman III launch facilities offline to  conduct major maintenance. Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center works  with the Defense Logistics Agency to procure parts as part of  programmed depot maintenance planning. According to Air Force  officials, the plan is to have 57 launch facilities go through the  programmed depot maintenance process each year, with a plan to  refurbish all launch facilities over an 8-year period.

Columbia-class SSBNs will continue to be armed  with these refurbished D-5s until about 2040, at which time the D-5s are  to be replaced by a successor submarine-launched ballistic missile.  According to Navy officials, maintaining one strategic weapon system  configuration during the transition to Columbia is beneficial from a cost,  performance, and risk-reduction standpoint.", "In 2018, the DOD Office of Inspector General reported that the Secretary  of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations have formally designated  strategic nuclear deterrence as the Navy\u2019s top priority. According to the  report, as a result, the Navy has reduced the time required for engineered  refueling overhauls of SSBNs, increased workforce size at shipyards,  accelerated and improved shipyard workforce training, and improved  SSBN maintenance procedures and schedules. However, while the Navy  was able to reduce the time required for its last two engineered refueling  overhauls, it has not hit the target of 27 months since 2010. In addition,  according to officials the Navy has created two working groups\u2014the  SSBN/Guided Missile Nuclear Submarine Working Group and the Trident  Coordination Group\u2014to monitor and mitigate Ohio-class sustainment and  maintenance challenges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Joseph W.
