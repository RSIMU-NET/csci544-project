Such efforts include: various transition plans; a decision-making structure that should enable the agency to make necessary supplier decisions; and a communications strategy and metrics to gauge the progress of transition activities. In addition, NASA has identified risks associated with the shuttle's retirement and has begun identifying capabilities and suppliers needed for future exploration activities. While NASA has developed plans and processes aimed at effectively managing the supplier base, several factors could impact their effectiveness. NASA may have to continue funding suppliers for work that would maintain the supplier's skills and capabilities, even when they are no longer working on Shuttle operations, until Constellation officials make a decision on whether or not they will be needed for future exploration activities due to a lack of detailed program requirements. In addition, relatively few supplier-related decisions have made it through the newly created decision-making process and NASA officials acknowledge the increasing number of decisions scheduled for upcoming years have the potential to overwhelm the transition decision-making process. Other issues have been identified that NASA will have to face in order to successfully transition from the shuttle program to its next generation human space flight systems. Challenges exist in the continued use of obsolescent materials, maintaining the overall viability of the supplier base, managing the overall workforce, disposing of property and equipment, and completing environmental cleanup. NASA has not developed cost estimates for transition and retirement activities past fiscal year 2010. Without cost estimates, NASA does not have the information needed to support the budget preparation process, assess the costs of addressing its supplier challenges, or account for how NASA will fund transition and retirement activities once the Space Shuttle Program comes to an end in 2010. Such knowledge is important because NASA and Congress will need to allocate funds among many competing priorities. In addition, it will be important for NASA to adjust its cost estimates every year as NASA gains more knowledge about its transition costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is in the  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is in the  midst of phasing out the Space Shuttle Program and beginning another  midst of phasing out the Space Shuttle Program and beginning another  major undertaking, the Constellation Program, which will create the next  major undertaking, the Constellation Program, which will create the next  generation of spacecraft for human spaceflight.

The Critical Single Source Supplier List existed prior to the  announcement of the Shuttle\u2019s retirement and is used to monitor the  unique capabilities provided by critical single source suppliers and note  any supportability issues that could arise. NASA considers a supplier to be  a critical single source supplier if it is the only known or only certified  source of particular hardware or services and has received hardware or  services from them in the past 5 years or expects to do business with them  again in the future. The list contains over 230 suppliers identified by each  of the five major Shuttle project offices (see app. II for a list of NASA\u2019s  critical single source suppliers). NASA can exercise various options to  ensure that certain key capabilities and the critical suppliers associated  with those capabilities are maintained until no longer needed.

For instance,  according to the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) project manager, even  though his office has identified, to the best of its abilities, the suppliers  that could be needed for the J-2X engine (which will be used on the Crew  Launch Vehicle), the Constellation Program is still working on the  requirements for the J-2X and has not made any determinations about  which Shuttle suppliers will be needed. The SSME project office was able  to identify suppliers that could be used for new exploration activities  because the same prime contractor that produces the Shuttle main engines  will produce the J-2X engine. There is a risk that the SSME project will  have to make decisions prior to the establishment of defined requirements  at a risk of losing some key capabilities. When NASA makes decisions as  whether to maintain an existing supplier that might not be needed in the  future, NASA is attempting to balance the risk associated with losing that  supplier and unnecessarily spending funds that could be used for other  priorities.

However, because the subcontractor\u2019s refurbishment capability may be  needed for the Ares 1 Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV), the SRB project  office sought and obtained $1.8 million in gap funding from the  Transition Program Requirements Control Board for work that would  preserve the subcontractor\u2019s capability/skills for the CLV through the  end of fiscal year 2007. Otherwise, according to analysis completed by  NASA, if the Constellation Program needed to restart the  subcontractor\u2019s refurbishment capability in the future through a new  subcontract with the CLV\u2019s prime, it would cost $15 million.

As a result, it is  important that NASA begin estimating its transition and retirement costs  and continually revisit these estimates to reflect final decisions on  requirements and additional knowledge gained on technology  development and supplier needs. Such cost estimates also need to be part  of NASA\u2019s budget submission to ensure Congress and NASA can balance  investments and negotiate between competing priorities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["Given the fact that many of NASA\u2019s transition and retirement activities will  continue to occur following the Shuttle retirement in 2010, it is important  that NASA identify and estimate the costs associated with these activities  in an accountable and transparent manner. Therefore, we are  recommending that the NASA Administrator direct the Exploration  Systems Mission Directorate and Space Operations Mission Directorate to  jointly develop cost estimates for transition and retirement activities  beyond fiscal year 2010 so that, in NASA\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget  submission, NASA can include transition and retirement funding needs for  the required out-years through fiscal year 2013.
