NHTSA has not developed such standards because it has not identified significant problems with occupant restraint systems that could be addressed by state motor vehicle inspection programs. The limitations of NHTSA's complaint system may hamper NHTSA's ability to detect safety-related trends through broad key-word searches of its complaint database and make it unlikely that NHTSA can identify all unsafe parts. In addition, the ability to recall unsafe aftermarket crash parts is limited because some parts are not stamped with the manufacturer's name and there is no trail leading from the manufacturer to the ultimate user of the part. Two studies on the safety of recycled airbags concluded that they can be a potentially safe, economical alternative to new airbags as long as they are undamaged and properly handled and installed.

To  repair crash-damaged vehicles, consumers spent over $8 billion and bought  over 61 million sheet metal and plastic body parts (including exterior  fenders, bumpers, hoods, and doors). Consumers and body shops that  repair crash-damaged vehicles have a choice in many instances of buying  new replacement parts from either the original equipment manufacturer or  other sources, commonly called aftermarket manufacturers. These  aftermarket manufacturers produce their parts by copying the design of the  original vehicle parts.", "Concerns have been raised for many years about the quality and safety of  aftermarket crash parts. A number of auto manufacturers and repair shop  owners argue that aftermarket crash parts are inferior to original parts and  pose a possible safety risk. Conversely, many aftermarket manufacturers  and auto insurers argue that aftermarket crash parts can be equal in quality  to original parts, are safe, and can cost up to 65 percent less than the  original equipment manufacturer\u2019s parts. Public awareness was heightened  in October 1999 after judgments totaling over $1 billion were entered  against State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company in response to a  class action complaint concerning the use of aftermarket crash parts. The  trial court concluded that State Farm breached its insurance policies by  requiring the use of aftermarket parts that did not return damaged vehicles  to their precrash condition. The court also found that State Farm\u2019s conduct  violated the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.", "State Farm has appealed this decision. In light of the decision, State Farm  has suspended its specification of aftermarket crash parts in repairs.", "Concerns have also been raised about the safety of replacing deployed  airbags with nondeployed airbags taken from old or otherwise damaged  vehicles. Many maintain that the airbag is such an important safety item  that only new bags produced by the original manufacturer should be used  to replace deployed bags. Others contend that recycled airbags pose no  safety issues when properly handled and installed and that their use can  save the consumer hundreds of dollars in repair costs.", "Because of potential concerns about the safety of aftermarket crash parts  and recycled airbags, you asked us to provide information on  studies on the safety of aftermarket crash parts and recycled airbags,  NHTSA\u2019s authority over aftermarket crash parts and recycled airbags,   NHTSA\u2019s ability to identify and remove unsafe aftermarket crash parts  and recycled airbags from the nation\u2019s roadways.", "To respond to these questions, we identified and reviewed existing safety  studies on aftermarket crash parts and recycled airbags; reviewed NHTSA\u2019s  legal authority over aftermarket crash parts and recycled airbags; reviewed  NHTSA\u2019s defect identification, investigation and recall processes; toured  two crash test facilities; and interviewed representatives of over 40  government and industry organizations.

These parts include hoods, doors, fenders,  and trunk lids. Crash parts exclude mechanical parts such as batteries,  filters, shock absorbers, and spark plugs. Body shops often use a mix of  parts in collision repairs, but we use the term \u201ccrash parts\u201d in this report to  refer to parts used on the exterior of a vehicle. Aftermarket crash parts are  the replacement automotive crash parts that are not made by the original  equipment manufacturer (OEM). Many of these aftermarket crash parts  manufacturers are located overseas. Recycled airbags are salvaged  nondeployed airbags removed from damaged or old vehicles.", "Crash parts are big business. In 1999, drivers had an estimated 6 million  automobile crashes in the United States costing over 40,000 lives and about  $8 billion in damage\u2014of which $1.2 billion represents the costs of  aftermarket crash parts. Overall, about 60 cents out of every dollar of  automobile insurance claims is spent on repairing collision damage to  vehicles. Insurance companies estimate that using aftermarket instead of  OEM parts saves hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Until the mid- 1980s, consumers and auto body shops could purchase new replacement  crash parts only from the original automobile manufacturer. At that time,  independent parts manufacturers began offering aftermarket replacement  parts at substantially lower prices. Still, the crash parts industry remains  highly concentrated, and OEM parts account for about 80 percent of the  market. Figure 1 shows the replacement crash parts market by source.", "Some aftermarket crash parts are certified as to their quality. In 1987, the  insurance industry funded the nonprofit Certified Automotive Parts  Association (CAPA), whose objective is to ensure the quality of aftermarket  crash parts. To determine the quality of these parts, the association  examines a manufacturer\u2019s plant, equipment, manufacturing processes, and  resulting products. If the association finds the aftermarket crash parts to be  equivalent in appearance, fit, material composition, and mechanical  properties to new OEM parts, it certifies the parts as functionally  equivalent to OEM parts. In addition, it periodically purchases parts in the  open market and checks them to ensure they meet the association\u2019s  standards. According to the association, in 1999, about 35 percent of all  aftermarket crash parts were certified. This represents about 5 percent of  the total aftermarket crash parts market\u2014which would include OEM,  aftermarket, and recycled parts combined.", "More recently, in 2000, Global Validators, an automotive quality consultant,  started a new certification process directed at improving the quality of  aftermarket crash parts. The Manufacturers\u2019 Qualification and Validation  Program, similar to the CAPA program, is a set of guidelines that outline  policies and quality management practices designed to ensure that  aftermarket crash parts are equal in form, fit, function, performance,  durability and appearance to OEM parts. This program is based on the QS- 9000 standard, a production quality standard developed in the automotive  industry. Consumers can search an on-line database to determine if a  specific part has been reviewed under the program.", "At the federal level, NHTSA is responsible for reducing accidents, deaths,  and injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes. NHTSA accomplishes  this, in part, by setting and enforcing safety performance standards that  apply to new motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment. Under these  standards, manufacturers of motor vehicles and equipment must assure  that their products comply with all applicable safety standards and certify  such compliance. The federal standards are written in terms of minimum  safety performance requirements for motor vehicles and equipment.  Examples of standards include hydraulic brake system requirements to  ensure safe braking performance, vehicle lamp requirements to provide  adequate illumination, and hood latch requirements to ensure that hoods  remain fastened securely.", "The Motor Vehicle Safety Act requires manufacturers to inform NHTSA  when a vehicle or equipment is defective or when a vehicle or equipment  does not comply with an applicable motor vehicle safety standard. These  requirements also apply to persons who import motor vehicles and  equipment into the United States. NHTSA does not approve vehicles or  equipment. Instead, federal law establishes a \u201cself-certification\u201d process  under which each manufacturer is responsible for certifying that its  products meet all applicable safety standards. The law also gives NHTSA  the authority to investigate possible safety-related defects, to decide  whether a defect exists, and to order a manufacturer to notify consumers  and to remedy any defect.", "NHTSA\u2019s process for identifying a possible defect in motor vehicles and  motor vehicle equipment begins with screening the complaints it receives  in its Office of Defects Investigation (ODI). Sources of complaints include a  toll-free hotline, a Web page, e-mail, telephone calls, and letters. In an  average year, ODI receives between 40,000 and 50,000 complaints. These  complaints are entered into a complaint database, which ODI analyzes to  identify potential defect trends.", "When the screening identifies a potential problem, ODI opens an  investigation called a preliminary evaluation. This evaluation involves  notifying the manufacturer and the public and gathering information on the  potential defect. If this process continues to indicate that a defect trend  may exist, the investigation moves to a second stage called an engineering  analysis. In this stage, ODI analyzes the character and scope of the  potential defect in more detail. This analysis may include inspections,  surveys, tests, and efforts to obtain additional information from the  manufacturer. If ODI continues to believe that a defect trend may exist, a  panel of experts from the agency may be convened to review the data.", "If the expert panel concurs with ODI, a recall request letter is sent to the  manufacturer. If the manufacturer declines to conduct a recall in response  to the letter, NHTSA\u2019s Associate Administrator for Safety Assurance may  issue an initial decision that a defect exists and convene a public meeting  on the issue. After the meeting, the NHTSA Administrator may issue a final  decision and order the manufacturer to conduct a recall. If necessary, the  agency will then go to court to enforce such an order. In almost all cases,  the manufacturer agrees to conduct the recall without NHTSA\u2019s forcing it to  do so. According to NHTSA officials, the agency opens between 80 and 100  defect investigations each year, of which more than half result in recalls. In  addition, manufacturers conduct an average of 200 defect recalls each year  that are not influenced by NHTSA\u2019s investigations. In 2000, there were over  385 recalls for safety-related defects affecting over 18 million vehicles.", "States are also involved in the regulation of aftermarket crash parts and  recycled airbags. According to the National Association of Independent  Insurers, 40 states have enacted some form of legislation governing the use  of aftermarket crash parts in vehicle repairs. Most of this legislation is  directed at ensuring that vehicle owners are aware that aftermarket parts  are being used in repairs. For example, 33 states require that written repair  estimates contain a disclosure statement notifying consumers that  aftermarket crash parts will be used in the repair, and 8 states require the  consent of the consumer to use aftermarket crash parts. Furthermore,  according to the Automotive Occupants Restraints Council, New York was  the only state that had enacted a law regulating the sale and installation of  recycled airbags as of December 2000. Appendix II provides a summary of  state law provisions covering aftermarket crash parts and recycled airbags.  In addition, in early 2000, the Massachusetts Auto Damage Appraiser  Licensing Board conducted two hearings to discuss the safety of OEM,  aftermarket, and recycled parts used in collision repair.

For  example, in September 2000, the Administrator of NHTSA testified on the  investigation and recall of Firestone tires. The Administrator said that by  the end of 1999, NHTSA had received 46 reports of incidents involving  these tires. NHTSA did not open a defect investigation at that time because  of the large number of tires in use and the variety of possible causes of tire  failure.

In addition, according to the former Chief of ODI\u2019s Trends and  Analysis Division, the complaints NHTSA receives about safety-related  defects may represent only 10 percent of all the complaints that  manufacturers receive. This estimate was based on the results of past  requests for information made to manufacturers after ODI had opened  investigations. For example, in February 2000, ODI began an investigation  of plastic door garnish moldings on 1998 and 1999 Sebring Coupe vehicles.

In these instances, the complainant would be unlikely to identify the  defective part as an aftermarket part. In addition, in submitting a complaint  to NHTSA, a complainant is free to describe the problem in any way he or  she chooses. The choice of words in a complaint is important because the  process NHTSA follows in identifying potential defect trends begins with a  search of key words in the database.

With aftermarket crash parts, however,  this information is typically not available. Vehicle owners may purchase  aftermarket crash parts at automotive retail stores and install the parts  themselves, or body shops may install aftermarket parts that they obtained  through parts distributors. In either instance, it is unlikely that the owners  of vehicles with unsafe aftermarket crash parts could be specifically  identified because it is unlikely that shops or distributors would maintain  the information needed to locate the owners of the unsafe parts.  Consequently, it would be necessary to recall unsafe aftermarket crash  parts using a broad-based approach similar to a consumer product safety  recall.

Likewise, congressional  oversight reports expressed concerns about the effectiveness and  efficiency of NHTSA\u2019s process of gathering and analyzing data on vehicle  defects and initiating investigations and recalls. The Transportation Recall  Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act was signed into law  in November 2000. In addition to requirements specifically addressing tires,  the act sought to increase NHTSA\u2019s legal authority, improve its regulatory  programs and access to safety information, and increase its funding levels  by $9.1 million. For example, the act requires manufacturers to report to  NHTSA safety recalls of their products (which would include OEM and  aftermarket crash parts) in other countries, increases civil penalties, and  establishes criminal penalties for persons who knowingly violate the act.  The act also requires NHTSA to conduct a comprehensive review of all  standards, criteria, procedures, and methods, including the data  management and analysis systems it uses to open a defect or  noncompliance investigation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The validity of concerns about the use of aftermarket crash parts and  recycled air bags has been debated for many years. As a result, a number of  states have enacted legislation to ensure that vehicle owners are aware that  aftermarket crash parts are being used in repairs. Existing studies on the  safety of aftermarket crash parts and recycled airbags show mixed results,  are limited in number and scope, and fail to resolve the debate. Although  NHTSA has the authority to regulate aftermarket crash parts, the agency  has not developed safety standards for them because it has not determined  that any aftermarket crash parts contain safety-related defects. NHTSA has  more limited authority to regulate the use of recycled airbags. NHTSA  could elect to develop safety standards for occupant restraint systems  under the used vehicle provisions of the Motor Vehicle Safety Act. These  standards could apply to systems containing recycled airbags, but the  standards would apply to the restraint system as a whole and not to its  individual components. NHTSA has not developed such standards because  it has not identified significant problems with occupant restraint systems  that could be addressed by state motor vehicle inspection programs.", "Absent a comprehensive study that resolves the issue of safety, NHTSA is  left to rely on its complaint system to identify possible safety-related  defects in aftermarket crash parts and recycled airbag systems. However,  NHTSA\u2019s defect identification and recall system has limitations. The key  database used to identify unsafe parts contains only a small fraction of the  complaints received by manufacturers. Apparently, many vehicle owners  are either unaware of NHTSA\u2019s complaint program or choose not to  participate in it. In addition, aftermarket crash parts may not be identified  as such in the database because consumers who complain to NHTSA may  not know they have aftermarket crash parts or their complaints may not  indicate that aftermarket parts are involved. These limitations may hamper  NHTSA\u2019s ability to detect safety-related trends through broad key-word  searches of its complaint database and make it unlikely that NHTSA can  identify all unsafe parts. In addition, the ability to recall unsafe aftermarket  crash parts is limited because some parts are not stamped with the  manufacturer\u2019s name and there is no trail leading from the manufacturer to  the ultimate user of the part. Therefore, even if an aftermarket part were  found to contain a safety-related defect, the product might have to be  recalled using a broad-based announcement similar to a consumer product  safety recall.", "The two studies on the safety of recycled airbags that we identified  concluded that they can be a potentially safe, economical alternative to  new airbags as long as they are undamaged and properly handled and  installed. However, the failure of some flood-damaged air bags to deploy  correctly also demonstrates the potential for serious safety consequences.  Resolving the safety issues associated with using recycled airbags is  important because it appears likely that their use will grow, especially if the  Insurance Corporation of British Columbia begins specifying their use in  early 2001.", "The recently enacted Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability,  and Documentation Act gives NHTSA an opportunity to improve its  systems for detecting and recalling defective products. It provides NHTSA  with the authority to require additional data from manufacturers and others  that it can consider in determining the need to initiate an investigation. In  addition, the act\u2019s provisions requiring a comprehensive review of all  standards, criteria, procedures, and methods used to open a defect or  noncompliance investigation give NHTSA an opportunity to improve its  processes for identifying potentially unsafe parts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Transportation should direct the Administrator of the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as part of the legislatively  required review, to consider taking the following actions:  Identify additional sources of information to include in the agency\u2019s  complaint database.

We discussed the report with  NHTSA officials, including the Associate Administrator for Safety  Assurance, the acting Chief Counsel, and the Director of the Office of  Defects Investigation. They emphasized that NHTSA has statutory  authority to issue standards only if they would meet the need for motor  vehicle safety and to seek recalls only if there is evidence that particular  products made by a specific manufacturer contain a safety-related defect.  They added that NHTSA has not taken action to regulate aftermarket crash  parts because studies conducted to date and other data and analyses do not  demonstrate that there are safety-related problems with the parts. They  also maintained that NHTSA does not have statutory authority to regulate  recycled airbags. They indicated that their authority over used vehicles is  limited to prescribing standards applicable to used motor vehicles for the  purpose of encouraging and strengthening state inspections of those  vehicles. As a result, NHTSA can issue performance-based standards for  used vehicle inspections, but cannot differentiate between new or used  individual parts or the history of those parts. We revised this report to  reflect NHTSA\u2019s comments on its authority over recycled airbags.
