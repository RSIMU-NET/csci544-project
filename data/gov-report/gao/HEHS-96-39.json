Second, the object that is to be equitably distributed must be determined. These objects include educational revenues or key educational resources, such as curriculum and instruction, or outcomes, such as student achievement. Third, the principle to be used to determine whether the distribution is equitable must be chosen. School finance experts have identified four principles for defining equity: (1) horizontal equity, in which all members of the group are considered equal; (2) vertical equity, in which legitimate differences in resource distributions among members of the group are recognized\u2014for example, given childrens\u2019 differences, some students deserve or need more educational services than others; (3) equal opportunity, also known as fiscal neutrality, which means that differences in expenditures per pupil cannot be related to local school district wealth; and (4) effectiveness, which assesses the degree to which resources are used in ways that research has shown to be effective. The effectiveness principle suggests that a resource inequity exists not only when insufficient resources are available but also when resources are not used in ways that produce desired impacts on student performance. The fourth issue, according to experts, is to determine what statistic will be used to measure the degree of equity in the school finance system. Many statistical measures exist for this purpose; one such measure is the federal range ratio."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Relationship Between Spending and Student Performance Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Using the effectiveness principle to define equity requires knowledge of the use of education dollars to achieve certain desired student outcomes.

In Minnesota, for example, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said that the plaintiffs\u2019 analysis showed that the wealthiest 10 percent of districts in 1989 raised on average six times more revenue through a levy program than the poorest 10 percent even though tax rates for the poorest districts were on average 25 percent higher.", "In Tennessee and Texas, the courts found that the differences in taxable wealth among districts created disparities in spending per pupil, which in turn led to such disparities in educational opportunities that some districts could not meet the state\u2019s basic education course requirements.

By 1992-93, however, the per pupil expenditures for every percent tax levied were essentially equal in less wealthy and wealthy districts. In Texas, where the goal was to improve access to revenues by decoupling a district\u2019s education revenue from its property wealth, a legislative analysis showed that tax effort rather than property wealth now explains the greatest amount of variance in a district\u2019s ability to raise revenues. In 1989, property wealth alone explained almost 70 percent of the variation in a district\u2019s ability to raise revenue, while a district\u2019s tax rate explained only 13.5 percent.
