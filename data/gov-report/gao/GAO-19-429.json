However, IAEA's planning documents do not include guidelines for prioritization. Instead, IAEA officials said they respond to member states' requests as they arrive and to the extent resources are available. By developing guidelines for prioritizing its nuclear security activities, IAEA could help ensure that it is allocating its resources to the areas of greatest need. IAEA has developed performance measures for its nuclear security program, but these measures do not have baselines or targets. This limits IAEA's ability to demonstrate the results of its nuclear security program.", "IAEA member states disagree over the agency's role in nuclear security, and according to U.S. and other member-state officials and experts GAO interviewed, these disagreements create challenges for the agency, such as funding its nuclear security efforts. Officials added that states that do not support the agency's nuclear security role resist efforts to substantially raise the agency's regular budget for nuclear security, contributing to the program's heavy reliance on voluntary, or extra-budgetary, contributions from member states.", "GAO previously reported that extra-budgetary funding is unreliable. Reliance on such funding affects nuclear security program planning, human resources, and sustainability. Experts and U.S. agency officials have suggested options to stabilize nuclear security program funding, but IAEA has not analyzed such options.

For example, the  number of states requesting assistance or participating in IAEA activities  to improve computer and information security capabilities is a  performance measure for the Information Management subprogram.", "According to IAEA\u2019s P&B, the agency follows a \u201cresults-based  management\u201d approach, which is driven by articulating desired results  and measuring actual performance against those results. The P&B states  that key elements of this approach include establishing program  baselines and targets and measuring actual performance against these  baselines and targets to determine whether the program is achieving its  planned outcomes.", "We reviewed IAEA\u2019s nuclear security program performance measures  against four leading practices for performance management we have  previously reported on: (1) linking performance measures to the offices  responsible for implementing the programs, (2) limiting measures to the  vital few, (3) determining whether performance measures for the defined objectives are appropriate for evaluating the agency\u2019s performance in  achieving those objectives, meaning that measures and processes for  measuring performance align with the objective, and (4) measuring  performance against baselines. The practice of measuring performance  against baselines is also consistent with IAEA\u2019s results-based  management approach. Table 1 shows the extent to which DNS\u2019s  performance measures meet leading practices.", "We found that DNS\u2019s performance measures fully met two of the four  leading practices. First, IAEA\u2019s nuclear security program performance  measures linked to the offices responsible for implementing them, as  DNS\u2019s four sections are responsible for implementing the four  subprograms of the corresponding name. For instance, a performance  measure linked to the Information Management subprogram within DNS  is the number of states requesting assistance or participating in IAEA  activities to improve computer and information security capabilities, and  the Information Management section implements the associated  subprogram, whose projects include information and computer security.  Second, IAEA\u2019s nuclear security program performance measures are  limited to the vital few; as discussed above, there are four high-level  measures for the program and between four and six measures for each  subprogram.", "We found that IAEA\u2019s performance measures partially met the third of the  four leading practices. Specifically, they were generally appropriate for  evaluating their corresponding outcomes and objectives. The program  objective of playing a central role and enhancing international cooperation  in nuclear security fully aligned with its associated outcome of improved  global coordination and cooperation in supporting national efforts to  improve nuclear security. Also, the associated measures by which IAEA  assesses progress toward this outcome\u2014the number of activities  duplicated by others and the number of activities carried out in  conjunction with IAEA\u2014fully aligned with the outcome and objective.  However, for the other two program objectives, outcomes and measures  partially aligned with the objectives. For example, one of the nuclear  security program\u2019s objectives is contributing to global nuclear security  efforts by establishing guidance and providing for its use through advisory  services and capacity building; there is a performance measure related to  advisory services, but no measure related to guidance.", "We found that IAEA\u2019s nuclear security program performance measures  did not meet the fourth leading practice, in that they did not include  baselines or targets. For example, the performance measure regarding  the number of states that have established or improved national nuclear  security measures and systems on the basis of advice from the agency  does not include a baseline of the number of states that already have  established effective nuclear security measures. The measure also does  not include a target for the number of states that should establish or  improve nuclear security measures. Without established baselines or  targets for each performance measure, IAEA\u2019s ability to demonstrate  results for its nuclear security program is limited.", "DNS officials acknowledged that the performance measures for the  nuclear security program and subprograms do not have targets or  baselines. They said that this is deliberate, based on nuclear security  being a national responsibility and the limitations of IAEA\u2019s nuclear  security mandate. However, many of the performance measures for the  nuclear security program and subprograms are focused on activities the  agency carries out, for which DNS can develop targets and baselines;  they are not focused on activities of member states. DNS officials also  said that the division struggles to develop measures because the nuclear  security environment\u2014for example, threats to computer security\u2014is  continually evolving. However, many of these measures\u2014such as  adherence to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear  Material\u2014are independent of the security environment, and uncertainty  should not prevent programs from developing measures to track their  performance.

First, IAEA officials said that there are  sensitivities around the data IAEA collects about member states, and  member states are hesitant to share information on their security  weaknesses. However, IAEA can report on its program performance  without reporting sensitive information about individual states. Many of its  measures pertain to numbers of states, and in cases where there are  sensitivities, IAEA could aggregate data to a regional level to conceal  state-specific information. Second, IAEA officials said that member states  may not consistently make available to the agency the information it  would need to measure the impact of its work. For example, to measure  the number of states that established or improved national nuclear  security measures based on advice from the agency, IAEA would need to  know whether states implemented the agency\u2019s recommendations.  However, as previously mentioned, most of IAEA\u2019s performance measures are focused on activities the agency carries out and not  activities of member states. For example, one of the nuclear security  subprogram\u2019s measures is the number of states that participate in the  Nuclear Security Guidance Committee. IAEA should have the data it  requires to report on measures focused on activities carried out or  facilitated by the agency.", "The lack of completeness in DNS\u2019s reporting limits the effectiveness of  the agency\u2019s communication on the nuclear security program\u2019s  performance.

IAEA officials also said that reliance on extra-budgetary contributions  leads DNS to plan its activities around conditions stipulated for the  contributions rather than planning around overall program needs.  Donor states may also use the contributions to create cost-free expert  positions for their own personnel that may not meet DNS needs. U.S.  officials said, however, that even within the constraints of extra- budgetary contributions, DNS could take steps to work with donors to  conduct work on a broader range of projects and initiatives, such as  providing donors with plans to address longer-term, strategic needs.", "Program sustainability. IAEA officials, several member-state  officials, and some experts we interviewed raised concerns about the  effect of extra-budgetary contributions on the sustainability of IAEA\u2019s  nuclear security efforts.

IAEA officials also identified ways in  which the reliance on extra-budgetary funding affects DNS\u2019s human  resource management. First, extra-budgetary funding generally  supports positions that are initially designed to last for only 2 or 3  years, leading to few long-term positions in the division and making it  difficult to sustain continuity of knowledge and experience over time.  Second, staff hired for positions supported by extra-budgetary funding  tend to look for regular-budget-funded positions elsewhere in the  agency, which hurts recruitment as well as retention within DNS.  Furthermore, the division must dedicate several staff to reporting on  the use of extra-budgetary funding provided by each donor.

As a result, IAEA officials have undertaken short-term  solutions to minimize the impact of its reliance on extra-budgetary  funding, such as reaching out to major donors and cultivating new  sources of funding. However, such new sources of voluntary funding also  would not be guaranteed or predictable and therefore would not improve  the stability of the division\u2019s funding stream. According to IAEA officials,  the agency has not identified options to stabilize DNS\u2019s budget within the  existing constraints.", "IAEA officials and experts suggested other options for making the nuclear  security budget more stable and flexible. One option could involve making  structural changes to the Nuclear Security Fund, such as assessing a  percentage of each extra-budgetary contribution and allocating those  assessed funds for general expenditures without conditions. This could  give the program more flexibility in using the funds and to support longer- term needs or projects. Another option could involve shifting funding  within the Department of Nuclear Safety and Security to balance the  proportion of regular and extra-budgetary funding between the Nuclear  Safety and Nuclear Security divisions. U.S. and IAEA officials identified  drawbacks to some of these options but IAEA has not comprehensively  identified and analyzed options to stabilize DNS\u2019s budget within the  existing constraints.

We summarized the information  gathered from experts and other interviewees in the report by using  \u201csome\u201d to refer to three members of a group, \u201cseveral\u201d to refer to four or  five members of a group, and \u201cmany\u201d to refer to more than five members  of a group. We interviewed officials representing 12 member states, and  20 experts.", "To determine the structure and range of IAEA\u2019s nuclear security work, we  reviewed pertinent legal instruments, such as the Statute of the IAEA, the  Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its 2005  amendment, and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts  of Nuclear Terrorism. We also reviewed IAEA\u2019s planning documents,  including the 2018-2019 Programme & Budget (P&B); 2017 and 2018  Nuclear Security Resolutions; and the 2018-2021 Nuclear Security Plan.  To review how IAEA plans and prioritizes its nuclear security work, we  reviewed these planning documents against the Project Management  Institute\u2019s The Standard for Program Management and interviewed IAEA  officials responsible for planning and prioritizing the agency\u2019s nuclear  security work. To examine how IAEA measures and reports on  performance, we reviewed the previously mentioned IAEA documents, as  well as IAEA\u2019s Nuclear Security Reports from 2016-2018. We also  reviewed the 2015-2016 P&B, the 2016 Nuclear Security Report, 2018  Annual Report, and the 2016 mid-term program performance report to  understand IAEA\u2019s use of objectives, outcomes, and performance  indicators. We chose the 2016 reports because at the time of our review,  the 2016 program performance report was the most recent completed.  We compared the agency\u2019s planning documents and reports with leading  practices for performance management and reporting, including leading  practices derived from our prior work, and IAEA\u2019s results-based  management approach. We derived some of these leading practices from  standards and practices developed for federal agencies, such as those  established in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.  Although federal standards are not required to be used by international  organizations such as IAEA, the leading practices based on these  standards can be instructive for assessing IAEA performance  measurement and reporting practices.", "To examine the challenges the agency\u2019s nuclear security role faces, we  reviewed the IAEA documents listed above as well as proceedings from  meetings and conferences and budgetary contributions data from the  United States and other member states. We analyzed statements from  IAEA, U.S., and member-state officials and from experts about IAEA\u2019s  nuclear security challenges. We also assessed actions IAEA and member  states have taken to potentially mitigate challenges by comparing those  actions with written commitments made in support of the agency\u2019s nuclear  security work. We also reviewed IAEA\u2019s central coordinating role in  nuclear security against certain key practices that we have previously  found to enhance and sustain collaborative efforts. We selected five  practices as relevant to our analysis, and combined two practices\u2014those  on establishing joint strategies and establishing compatible policies and  procedures. In our analysis we considered IAEA\u2019s role as a coequal entity  among many rather than one that has authority over other entities.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2018 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: The Nuclear Security Contact Group", "paragraphs": ["The Nuclear Security Contact Group (NSCG) was established at the 2016  Nuclear Security Summit to continue the work of the summit process,  including maintaining high-level political attention and momentum on  nuclear security, assessing and following up on commitments made at the  summits, and developing and maintaining connections to  nongovernmental experts and the nuclear industry.", "NSCG has 48 members as of March 2019, and its membership is open  to all International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) member states.  According to State officials, the group actively focuses on recruiting new  members. NSCG advertises itself through IAEA Board of Governors  statements and has issued joint statements to encourage other member  states to join. Canada was the first country to chair NSCG, followed by  Jordan and Hungary, which is the current chair.", "NSCG formally meets on the margins of the IAEA General Conference.  According to U.S. officials, NSCG has convened two to three times per  year since its inception after the 2016 summit. IAEA is an observer, and  an IAEA representative may comment on how NSCG proposals would  impact IAEA. Representatives to the NSCG are government agencies.  The National Security Council was the lead agency to represent the  United States in the NSCG through August 2018, and State has been the  lead agency since September 2018.", "According to officials and experts we interviewed, NSCG serves as a  forum for proposing and developing ideas rather than as a formal  decision-making body. Member states described the benefits NSCG has  provided. For example, some member-state officials said NSCG helps  maintain contact among summit participants and between nuclear  security officials in their respective capitals\u2014where nuclear security policy  would be implemented\u2014and those at IAEA. In addition, a member-state  official said that the group is a very important instrument for developing  key messages as part of a communication strategy. As a result of this  strategy, some ideas developed in NSCG have been introduced into IAEA  proceedings by NSCG member states, or into national policymaking  discussions. NSCG has also prepared unofficial position papers.  Furthermore, according to a member-state official we interviewed, NSCG  has discussed or developed internal papers on a number of topics related  to IAEA, including: ways to improve IAEA\u2019s coordinating role in nuclear security whether more regulation is needed in nuclear security  IAEA\u2019s role in dealing with emerging nuclear security challenges promoting a more resource stable and empowered Division of Nuclear  communication and outreach within IAEA  the agency\u2019s networks of nuclear security training centers.", "According to State officials, U.S. priorities for NSCG include ensuring that  it is productive and action-oriented, with representatives ready to share  views, brainstorm on ways forward, and lead change both at home and  internationally. State is also focused on preparing the NSCG\u2019s input for its  representatives to significant conferences, such as IAEA\u2019s ministerial- level and technical conferences and the 2021 Review Conference on the  Amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear  Material. According to a member-state official, the NSCG has discussed  how to engage in preparation for the review conference, the framework of  the review, what to ask of member states, and whether to revise the  Convention.", "According to U.S. officials and some member-state officials, NSCG has  also promoted implementation of summit commitments, in which  individual members are responsible for tracking and following up on  commitments made by countries in certain areas. For example, the  United States is the lead for following up on commitments related to  insider\u2013threat mitigation, and the Department of Energy led a meeting in  Belgium in February 2019 on that topic. State officials said that NSCG  also follows up on commitments made during the 2016 International  Conference on Nuclear Security.", "Many experts we interviewed said that the NSCG process lacks  transparency. Specifically, it does not publish its proceedings, which  these experts said made it difficult to discern its accomplishments. U.S.  and several member-state officials and experts said that a quiet approach  was necessary to protect the group from IAEA member-state politics.  Several representatives said that NSCG is mindful of the political  sensitivities around its association with the Nuclear Security Summits,  and is committed to supporting IAEA\u2019s nuclear security role without  becoming a distraction. In addition, one expert said that more openness  would weaken the group as a discussion forum. For example, publishing  proceedings would require getting consensus among members, which  would shift the focus of the group from discussion to decision-making.  U.S. officials said that NSCG planned to revamp and update its website,  and to use it to highlight nuclear security successes and events, such as  nuclear security support for major public events or regional training  events, but did not plan to promote its own work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, the following staff members  made key contributions to this report: William Hoehn (Assistant Director);  Alisa Beyninson; Antoinette Capaccio; R.
