Following these reviews, Congress established the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces to determine the appropriateness of current allocations of roles, missions, and functions among the armed forces and make recommendations for changes. Among its recommendations, the Commission called for DOD to conduct a comprehensive strategy and force review at the start of each administration, or every 4 years, to examine an array of force mixes, budget levels, and missions to identify the best force mix. In August 1995, the Secretary of Defense endorsed performing a quadrennial review of the defense program. He expected to complete the first such review in 1997.", "Congress, noting the Secretary\u2019s intention to complete a Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) in 1997, identified specific reporting requirements for the review in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. Congress expected the QDR to review the defense strategy of the United States and identify the force structure best suited to implement the strategy. Specifically, the law required a comprehensive examination of defense strategy; active, guard, and reserve component force structure; force modernization plans; infrastructure; budget plans; and other elements of the defense program. The law also required DOD to identify how the force structure would be affected by new technologies anticipated to be available by 2005 and by the changes in doctrine and operational concepts that would result from such technologies. DOD issued its report on the QDR in May 1997.", "The law also established an independent, nonpartisan panel comprising national security experts from the private sector, known as the National Defense Panel, to review the results of the 1997 QDR and conduct a subsequent study of force alternatives. Congress noted that it was important to provide for an independent review of force structure that extends beyond the time frame of the QDR and explores innovative and forward-thinking ways of meeting emerging challenges.

Specifically, the Panel stated that DOD placed too much emphasis on preparing for the unlikely probability of two major theater wars because it serves as a means to justify the current force structure. The Panel noted that funds now spent on preserving forces could be better spent on preparing for the future, thereby reducing the risk to long-term security.", "The Panel also said that some of the services\u2019 procurement plans did not advance the transformation of current capability to that needed in the future.

More specifically, we interviewed OSD officials about the Joint Data Support System as well as DOD and RAND officials about their verification and validation process and means for maintaining data entered into TACWAR and JICM. Also, we evaluated the steps taken by DOD to ensure the quality of data extracted from a major TACWAR data source, the Deep Attack Weapons Mix Study, as well as other sources that served as input.

TACWAR is a theater-level model that assesses force structures and resource allocations within the context of a joint campaign. The model ran on a 12-hour battle cycle, and operators, using their military judgment, could make periodic adjustments to the scenario to correct or revise any results that appeared unrealistic. For example, the model allowed units in a sector to move at their own speed. However, in a realistic situation, units would travel together to protect each other\u2019s flanks. The operators could adjust the speed of the units to ensure that they moved in concert. The results were then weighed against measures of effectiveness drawn from the war game for the Bottom-Up Review. The Deep Attack Weapons Mix Study data came from a recent DOD effort to assess deep attack requirements across the services. A key objective of the study was to analyze weapon mix requirements for DOD\u2019s planned force in 1998, 2006, and 2014 and determine the impact of force structure changes on the weapons mix.", "TACWAR was developed in the 1970s and has been revised several times.

Also, the model provides an aggregated look at the battlefield, which means it is not very useful for identifying details of the impact of particular weapon systems or force structure changes on the battle or the impact of some new technologies and emerging operational concepts.", "DOD officials used Deep Attack Weapons Mix Study data because they concluded it was the most current and complete information available on force structure, movement into theater, weapon system capabilities, and target locations. Also, according to officials, given the short time frame available to complete the assessment, it was important that the data was in the necessary format for TACWAR and ready to use. The recently completed study, according to one service official, was the most detailed and comprehensive force and weapon mix analysis conducted by the defense community. During the study, the services repeatedly reviewed and revised the data to ensure its accuracy.

It featured the first major theater war starting after a warning period, followed by the second, overlapping major theater war. Defense guidance also provided many of the operational assumptions for the scenario such as warning times, separation times between the two wars, equipment prepositioned in theater, call-up of reserve forces, allied participation, access to overseas bases, and port and transportation availability. However, other assumptions came from the war game analysis used in the Bottom-Up Review. These included assumptions about the readiness of U.S., allied and aggressor forces; that some forces from the first major theater war would be available for the second war\u2019s counteroffensive; and that some forces were already deployed overseas.

For example, a 10-percent force reduction meant the elimination of one Navy carrier battle group, one Army active division, and two Air Force fighter wings, along with some Marine Corps and support units. The 20-percent reduction meant the Army and Navy would lose two units each and the Air Force would lose four wings. With the 30-percent reduction, the Army and Navy would lose three units each and the Air Force would lose six wings. There would also be commensurate reductions in Marine Corps and support units.", "OSD and the Joint Staff also modeled other excursions from the base-case two major theater war scenario. They included shorter warning time, the enemy\u2019s use of chemical weapons in both wars, and a combination of both short warning and the use of chemical weapons. Each of these excursions required DOD to make more assumptions in addition to those already made. The shorter warning excursion assumed the U.S. forces were given fewer days\u2019 notice in advance of the start of the second war than in the base-case scenario. According to a Joint Staff official, the chemical excursion modeled a realistic scenario for the U.S. force and allies, which was neither a best nor worst case situation. This included assumptions about weather conditions, the number and type of weapons, and delivery methods. Information for this scenario was drawn from Defense Intelligence Agency data on the type and number of weapons in the enemies\u2019 inventories and how the enemies would deliver those weapons. Information such as dispersion rates and lethality of chemical agents modeled came from the Army Chemical School.

However, the analysis also showed that a slightly smaller force would be able to win without a significant increase in risk in the base-case scenario. When chemical weapons or shorter warning times were involved, the current force was necessary to conduct these operations with an acceptable level of risk.", "Although the analysis showed that a slightly smaller force was able to meet many of the two-war requirements without a significant increase in risk, OSD did not refine the analysis to model other force reductions, like  5 or 15 percent, to see if they would produce viable force options. They also did not model alternatives that would have affected the services\u2019 forces unequally, such as using a small reduction to one service\u2019s forces, but no reduction or even a slight increase to other services\u2019 forces. An OSD official stated that, given the time available to perform this assessment, OSD would not have been able to obtain consensus among the services on what smaller force reductions should look like or how unequal force reductions should be taken.

For example, as a result of its Army Force XXI initiative, the Army plans to begin fielding units that will have an enhanced situational awareness of the battlefield through digital technology by 2006. Also, the Air Force has proposed an alternative concept of operations using massive air strikes at the beginning of a war, with more munitions than currently planned, to rapidly halt the enemy\u2019s advance and provide more time for a ground buildup.

The contingencies consisted of interventions, shows-of-force, no-fly zone enforcement, maritime sanction enforcement, disaster relief, peacekeeping, noncombatant evacuations, and humanitarian assistance. The contingencies were based on the type, duration, and general frequency of such operations since 1991. Scenarios were developed using defense guidance and combatant command operational plans.

While the participants generally allocated forces to a contingency using the previously developed force list, they could change the forces based on military judgment or sometimes their availability. For example, in one case, U.S. forces were deployed to a large-scale intervention when events in two other areas of the world became concerns. Rather than send an Army air assault brigade to one of the two areas as a show of force as originally planned, participants decided to deploy Air Force fighters and a Navy aircraft carrier and hold the Army\u2019s one remaining uncommitted air assault brigade in reserve.", "DOD officials had differing views about whether the force allocation process in Dynamic Commitment resulted in the appropriate size and mix of forces being allocated to military operations. According to some game participants, there was a perceived need for each service to maximize the allocation of its forces to justify them and avoid force reductions.

The Panel was instructed by OSD to evaluate the services\u2019 modernization programs by looking at what is needed to sustain the force with modern equipment and superior technology. It identified 17 topics, grouped into three broad categories: cross-cutting issues, equipment-focused issues, and technology and acquisition issues. The topics and some of the systems examined are included in table 3.1.", "A separate task force of service, OSD, and joint staff officials was assigned to analyze each topic and arrive at a set of options. The objective of each task force, according to DOD officials, was to propose affordable plans for procuring systems that would modernize equipment and technology based on their view of capabilities for Joint Vision 2010, maximize jointness, and minimize the time to develop them. According to Panel officials, affordable meant that DOD assumed its procurement budget would increase to and then remain at about $60 billion a year by 2000. As a result, task forces were asked to examine the projected funding for systems beyond the Future Years Defense Program to 2015, based on then-current procurement plans, and determine whether systems or groups of related systems were affordable in terms of whether they represented an appropriate share of the procurement budget, given procurement plans for other types of systems. For example, the tactical aircraft task force developed options to reduce out-year funding requirements for tactical aircraft systems because then-current procurement plans for the Joint Strike Fighter, F-22, and F/A-18E/F would require a significantly larger share of procurement funds than was allocated to tactical aircraft in 1998. The task force examining the Navy\u2019s ship acquisition program also explored options to reduce out-year funding requirements. Allowing these programs to go forward as planned would have required senior DOD officials to decrease funding for other types of systems to maintain overall procurement spending at $60 billion annually.", "DOD was not able to provide the amount of planned funding for each of the 17 topics, but officials estimated that total annual procurement plans for the systems amounted to approximately $40 billion, or about two-thirds of DOD\u2019s planned annual procurement budget. The task force did not review some planned modernization efforts, such as antisubmarine and electronic warfare or minor procurement.", "The Panel directed the task forces to assess the acquisition plans reflected in the fiscal year 1998 Future Years Defense Program and to consider increasing or decreasing funding allocated to each group of systems up to 10 percent as a means of encouraging them to develop options to modify planned programs. According to DOD officials, the task forces began briefing their options to the Modernization Panel and to senior DOD officials in February 1997. Neither the Panel nor the task forces made recommendations; each only proposed options. Soon thereafter, the Senior Steering Group directed the task forces to identify adjustments to the fiscal year 1998-2003 budget based on the options; the programmatic risk associated with each option; how the option would affect the military\u2019s capability to implement the defense strategy; the impact of the option on the industrial base; and the statutory, regulatory, and other external barriers to implementing the option.", "In general, DOD\u2019s modernization decisions modified, but did not cancel, service procurement plans. The Secretary of Defense described the modernization decisions in the QDR as a modest reduction in some of the programs to ensure that the total program is realistic and executable within the budget. Some decisions decreased the number and delayed the procurement of some systems, reducing associated funding. For example, to sustain procurement of tactical aircraft systems at an affordable rate, DOD reduced the Air Force\u2019s plan to buy F-22s from 438 to 339 and delayed its full production time line. The Navy\u2019s plan to buy 1,000 F/A-18E/Fs was reduced to 785 with a provision to buy only 548, depending on the timely success of the Joint Strike Fighter. And the number of Joint Strike Fighters was reduced as well. In total, these changes reduced the services\u2019 $270 billion funding estimate for these aircraft by over $30 billion, or more than 10 percent.", "Another task force examined the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding program. The Navy had planned to build up to 10 ships a year between 2004 and 2015, but that would increase annual spending in those years to over $12 billion, well above the fiscal year 2001-2004 average of $7.9 billion. After examining the number of ships planned for 2015 and the associated annual shipbuilding costs, the task force presented an option to reduce the 334 ships planned for 2003 to 303 and thereby reduce the annual shipbuilding estimate to between $8 billion and $8.8 billion. The task force suggested that the annual savings in operating and support costs associated with maintaining fewer ships could be used to increase the capabilities on new ships and modernize existing ones.", "Other modernization decisions proposed increases to investment in some areas. For example, DOD increased its investments in biological and chemical defense by approximately $1 billion and national missile defense by about $2 billion.

Panel officials pointed to the senior officials\u2019 decision to examine Army ground and Marine ground force systems together rather than separately as evidence that at least some task forces were asked to look across some topics. However, other officials did not think that anyone systematically looked across the options to see their impact on joint war-fighting missions.", "In September 1996, just prior to the QDR, we identified the benefits of evaluating modernization options from a joint perspective and the urgent need for such information, given the hundreds of billions of procurement dollars involved.

Furthermore, DOD does not routinely review service modernization proposals from such a perspective. We believe that the QDR was such an opportunity and that information on recapitalization alternatives and redundancies in capabilities, developed from a joint war-fighting perspective, would have been invaluable to decisionmakers who must allocate defense resources among competing needs to achieve maximum force effectiveness.

Some Panel officials suggested that a better linking of the two assessments could improve the quality of the QDR, because changes in force structure could affect the size of some procurements. Moreover, as suggested in Joint Vision 2010, leveraging new technologies should increase defense capabilities and could thereby offer opportunities to affect force structure.

The QDR report identifies three paths that DOD considered and that included varying levels of modernization and force structure sizes. However, some defense experts have criticized this framework as being too simplistic in that two of the options\u2014such as the option to maintain the current force structure but forego DOD\u2019s goal of increasing procurement to $60 billion per year\u2014were not options that DOD would seriously consider.", "Moreover, DOD\u2019s force structure and modernization panels completed their analyses separately and did not model trade-offs between modernization and force structure. For example, DOD\u2019s regional great power analysis modeled DOD\u2019s planned force with various levels of modernization but did not examine whether a more modernized but smaller force would be effective in defeating potential aggressors. According to some defense experts, technologies such as stealth aircraft, precision munitions, and digitized forces may enable the United States to reduce force structure in the long term. DOD has several options for ensuring better integration of modernization and force structure decisions. DOD could maintain separate panels but provide guidance to ensure that the panels collaborate and that trade-offs between force structure and modernization are examined. Alternatively, DOD could establish one panel to analyze force structure and modernization issues.", "DOD officials expressed different views on the need to alter the timing of the defense strategy review. DOD began developing the strategy early in the QDR process and provided a draft of the strategy in January 1997 but did not finalize it until March 1997, when the force structure and modernization panels had completed much of their work. Several DOD officials, including those responsible for drafting the strategy and OSD officials who were responsible for leading the force assessments, did not perceive the lack of an approved strategy as a problem because the strategy was provided in draft to panel chairs. However, some service officials and panel members stated that the draft strategy was not widely disseminated and that the lack of a final strategy led to confusion, particularly since the Secretary of Defense changed during the QDR and the new Secretary could have made significant changes to the strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delaying the Start of the Next QDR May Result in a More Thorough Review", "paragraphs": ["The 1997 QDR began after the 1996 presidential election and was performed by a returning administration\u2014although a change in Secretary of Defense occurred during the early months of the QDR. However, if the next QDR occurs following the 2000 presidential election, DOD will have to conduct its analysis while undergoing a change in administration. This may further complicate DOD\u2019s efforts to perform the QDR because of the large turnover of senior DOD officials that may occur. Many DOD officials we spoke to characterized the 6-month time frame for conducting the 1997 QDR as being extremely tight given the complex nature and large number of issues, even with relatively little turnover among senior personnel. Officials also cited the short time frame as a key factor that limited the number and types of alternatives assessed. Delaying the QDR from the first to the second year of the presidential term is an option that would allow more time for an administration to put its key senior people, including the Secretary of Defense, in place; develop a defense strategy; prepare for the QDR; and conduct appropriate analyses. Such a delay in starting the QDR might be useful in providing a new administration with sufficient time to conduct a comprehensive strategy review and have a good analytical basis for making difficult choices among competing priorities.", "Delaying the process for a year may have some disadvantages. Several OSD officials stated they opposed a delay because it would postpone the administration\u2019s ability to impact the defense budget until well into a president\u2019s term. The current timing would allow QDR decisions made in 2001 to impact the president\u2019s fiscal year 2003 defense budget. A QDR that concludes in 2002 would affect the 2004 defense budget. Even if the review were delayed, a new administration could still make some changes in the 2003 budget through the program, planning, and budgeting system.

However, work by a congressionally chartered independent panel, if conducted prior to the QDR, could be used to encourage DOD to consider a wider range of strategy, force structure, and modernization options. Conducting a fundamental reassessment of defense requirements, as envisioned by the QDR, is extremely challenging for DOD, given that its culture rewards consensus-building and often makes it difficult to gain support for alternatives that challenge traditional ways of doing business. As evidenced by the 1997 QDR force and modernization assessments, DOD spent most of its analytical effort confirming that its current forces and initiatives were adequate to meet future defense requirements and restricting its analysis to \u201csalami-slice\u201d alternatives.

DOD stated that it is identifying the analytic tools needed for the next QDR and is improving existing tools where shortcomings have been identified. It also stated that it is examining areas of U.S. defense strategy and associated military capabilities not fully explored by the QDR or that were raised by the National Defense Panel, in addition to commissioning studies of internal and external lessons learned from the 1997 QDR. Moreover, it concurred with our conclusion that there is no central authority to ensure that follow-up efforts are integrated and that centralization could improve QDR preparation efforts. DOD also agreed that any mandated panel similar to the National Defense Panel should precede the QDR.", "DOD did not concur with our characterization of the QDR process in some areas and with our recommendation to consider changing the timing of the QDR. First, DOD stated that our draft was overly concerned with the benefit of having the QDR\u2019s panels report sequentially. For example, DOD noted that the draft strategy had been briefed early in the QDR to the force assessment and modernization panels and that they were told to base their assumptions on this draft. DOD further stated that if panel members were confused as to the final shape of the strategy, it should not be blamed on the QDR process. Second, DOD wrote that our draft placed undue emphasis on the force assessment and modernization panels acting as \u201cstovepipes.\u201d DOD stated that the QDR\u2019s structure allowed panels to focus on a tractable set of issues and that the Integration Panel ensured that all the various panel reports were combined into a coherent set of options. Finally, DOD wrote that beginning the QDR process later in a presidential administration would force the Secretary of Defense to wait two years before submitting a budget that reflects an administration\u2019s strategy, priorities, and program.", "We believe that our characterization of the QDR process does not overly stress the benefits of having panels report sequentially. We acknowledge that DOD officials primarily responsible for drafting the strategy and leading the force assessments believed that providing the draft strategy in January 1997 and the final strategy in March 1997 did not pose a problem for the panels. However, some panel members perceived that the lack of a final strategy earlier in the process led to confusion. We note that the 1997 QDR was conducted under favorable conditions in that many senior DOD officials were in place prior to the November presidential election to begin work on the strategy and that major elements of the strategy remained the same. We believe that significant concurrency between the strategy review and force structure and modernization assessments could be more problematic for the next QDR, which will be conducted by a new administration, particularly if senior officials decide on a new strategy that alters key force planning assumptions. Therefore, we believe that DOD should consider the need to finalize the strategy earlier in evaluating changes to the QDR process.", "In addition, while we agree that senior officials combined the work of the panels into broad, macro level alternatives, the panels themselves lacked a high degree of integration. For example, more collaboration between the regional great power force assessment and modernization analysis, possibly as a single panel, might overcome challenges to the timely sharing of information and would have permitted DOD to explore force structure versus modernization trade-offs. We acknowledge the benefit of breaking down a giant task like the QDR into discrete issue panels. If the overarching Integration Panel is the best means available for combining those panels\u2019 reports into coherent options, it could benefit from collaboration occurring at the lowest possible levels to make its work easier.", "Finally, while we recognize DOD\u2019s concerns regarding changing the timing of the QDR to later in an administration\u2019s term, we continue to believe that the 1997 QDR faced challenges from its tight time-frame, despite the benefits of a returning administration and speedy appointment of a new Secretary of Defense. The next QDR will be performed by a new administration. If the next QDR is delayed, it would allow the new administration to appoint its senior defense leadership, develop a defense strategy, prepare for the QDR, and conduct appropriate analyses. Our observation does not seek to limit a new administration\u2019s flexibility in determining how and when to conduct the next QDR. Rather, it attempts to give a new administration the benefit of more time to perform a more rigorous review before reaching conclusions that will shape the future of DOD and its budgetary priorities."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
