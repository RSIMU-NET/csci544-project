Voters can use one of two basic types of punch cards\u2014 Votomatic or Datavote. In both instances, voters use a computer-readable card to cast their vote. The Votomatic uses a computer-readable card with numbered boxes that correspond to a particular ballot choice. The choices corresponding to those numbered boxes are indicated to the voter in a booklet attached to a vote recording machine, with the appropriate places to punch indicated for each candidate and ballot choice. The voter uses a simple stylus to punch out the box corresponding to each candidate and ballot choice.

As previously stated, FEC is only now updating the 1990 standards. Because FEC has not proactively maintained the standards, they have become out of date. Vendors are using new technology and expanding voting equipment functions that are not sufficiently covered by the 1990 standards. For example, the 1990 standards do not address election management systems, which are used to prepare ballots and programs for use in casting and tallying votes, and to consolidate, report, and display election results. According to a NASED committee representative and the Independent Test Authority (ITA) responsible for testing election management systems, the lack of adequate standards to address election management software has forced them to interpret the current voting equipment standards to accommodate the development of this new software. Further, according to these representatives, these interpretations have not been documented and formally shared with FEC. As mentioned earlier, FEC is updating its standards, and the draft standards now address election management systems.", "FEC officials acknowledge the need to actively maintain the standards, but state that they have not done so because they have not been assigned explicit responsibility.

In 1994, the NASED committee accredited Wyle Labs to test the hardware and machine-resident software components of proprietary vote cast and tally equipment. In February 2001, Metamor (previously PSINet) applied for accreditation to conduct qualification testing of vote tabulation and election management software.  Also in 2001, SysTest applied for accreditation to conduct qualification testing of voting tabulation and election management software.  While both Metamor and SysTest have been granted an interim approval to test voting equipment, NASED has not yet accredited either.", "To test voting equipment, voting equipment vendors submit requests for testing to the ITAs, who then prepare a test procedure. The test procedure details the software and hardware testing requirements that the voting equipment will be tested against and is based on both the FEC voting equipment standards and the vendors\u2019 design specifications.", "According to ITA officials responsible for testing voting equipment, the testing process is generally an iterative one. Vendors are provided an opportunity to correct deficiencies identified during testing and resubmit the modified voting equipment for retesting. At the end of testing, the ITA completes a test report and notifies the Election Center that the voting equipment has successfully satisfied testing requirements. The Election Center then assigns a NASED number to the specific equipment model and firmware release that was tested and maintains the list of qualified voting equipment. Each time a vendor issues a new model or software release, the vendor is to submit a request for testing to the ITAs in order to qualify the new model or release. As of July 3, 2001, NASED had qualified 21 models of voting equipment and 7 election management systems, representing 10 vendors. See table 3 for a breakout of the types of equipment qualified.", "The ITAs stated that the testing process generally takes about 2 to 3 months. This is contingent, however, upon the vendors having the proper documentation in order. If documentation is missing or incomplete, the process may take longer.

Further, it states that another 2 years elapsed between the time FEC began evaluating the standards and the time it began updating them. We recognize that FEC is performing, through its own initiative, an important role in developing and updating the standards, and deserves credit for doing so. However, in our view, allowing 9 years to pass before beginning to update the standards, regardless of the practical circumstances that FEC cites, is too long and does not constitute a proactive maintenance process and is the primary reason that the current standards are out of date.

We provide the relevant elements of this chronology in this report. Additionally, we state in this report that FEC has assumed and is performing an important role by developing and revising the standards, despite its lack of explicit statutory responsibility.", "We do not agree with FEC\u2019s comment that it has been proactive in updating the voting equipment standards. As FEC acknowledges in its comments, 7 years elapsed from the time the standards were first issued in 1990 to the time that FEC initiated efforts to assess the standards to identify areas that needed to be updated. During that time, considerable experience with the standards was accumulating, as vendors were developing voting equipment to meet the FEC standards and ITAs were testing against them. Since then, additional experience has been gained with the standards as vendors have continued to develop voting equipment to meet the standards, and ITAs have continued to test vendors\u2019 equipment against the standards. For example, we state in this report that ITAs have had to interpret the 1990 standards in the testing process to accommodate vendors\u2019 use of new technologies and expanded equipment functions that are not addressed in the 1990 standards. However, FEC does not formally receive these interpretations, any one of which could be the basis for prompting an update to the standards. In our view, waiting 9 years to begin updating the standards is too long, does not constitute proactive maintenance, and is the primary reason that the current standards are out of date. 3.  FEC is correct in stating that we did not assess all of the revised draft standards areas. However, we disagree that this assessment approach ignores the collaborative and dynamic process of NASED\u2019s Voting Systems Committee and FEC\u2019s staff in overseeing the development of the standards for two reasons. First, this report recognizes that FEC worked closely with state and local election officials in revising the standards. Second, this joint FEC and NASED process has no relevance to our findings that certain standards areas do not address the full range of items associated with well-defined system requirements in these areas. As we state in the objectives, scope, and methodology section of this report, our approach was to assess all of the 1990 standards because they are the standards against which voting equipment are currently being developed and independently tested. In assessing drafts of the updated standards, we assumed that those areas in the 1990 standards that we found to be satisfactory would continue to be satisfactory in the updated standards. As long as our findings are limited to the standards area that we assessed, the issue of whether we assessed all or some of the draft standards is not relevant. 4.  We acknowledge that FEC\u2019s position, as stated in its comments, concerning standards areas omitted from the revised draft standards is that these were based on decisions resulting from deliberative and collaborative interaction among NASED and FEC staff, and were not, as we were told during the course of our review by the OEA Director, areas that were overlooked. Accordingly, we have modified our report to reflect this position. 5.  Subsequent to providing us written comments on a draft of this report, FEC provided us with a copy of volume II of the standards, which includes the tests to be conducted to ensure compliance with the voting equipment standards.  Based on our review of the relevant security sections, the standards satisfy the requirement for security certification.  We have modified our report, including the recommendations, to reflect this new information. 6.  We do not disagree that the draft standards discuss quality assurance and have been strengthened from the 1990 standards. We acknowledge these improvements to the standards in our report. However, as we state, quality assurance includes a number of activities. While FEC\u2019s draft standards include some of these elements, they do not include all of them.
