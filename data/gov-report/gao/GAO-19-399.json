Of these, 242 required a mitigation plan and 232 had one; 146 required a contingency plan and 102 had one (see table). Mitigation plans detail how an agency will reduce the likelihood of a risk event and its impacts, if it occurs. Contingency plans identify how an agency will reduce or recover from the impact of a risk after it has been realized. Bureau guidance states that these plans should be developed as soon as possible after a risk is added to the risk register, but it does not establish clear time frames for doing so. Consequently, some risks may go without required plans for extended periods.", "GAO reviewed the mitigation and contingency plans in detail for six risks which the Bureau identified as among the major concerns that could affect the 2020 Census. These included cybersecurity incidents and integration of the 52 systems and 35 operations supporting the census. GAO found that the plans did not consistently include key information needed to manage the risk. For example, three of the mitigation plans and five of the contingency plans did not include all key activities. Among these was the Bureau's cybersecurity mitigation plan. During an August 2018 public meeting, the Bureau's Chief Information Officer discussed key strategies for mitigating cybersecurity risks to the census\u2014such as reliance on other federal agencies to help resolve threats\u2014not all of which were included in the mitigation plan.", "GAO found that gaps stemmed from either requirements missing from the Bureau's decennial risk management plan, or that risk owners were not fulfilling all of their risk management responsibilities. Bureau officials said that risk owners are aware of these responsibilities but do not always fulfill them given competing demands. Bureau officials also said that they are managing risks to the census, even if not always reflected in their mitigation and contingency plans. However, if such actions are reflected in disparate documents or are not documented at all, then decision makers are left without an integrated and comprehensive picture of how the Bureau is managing risks to the census.", "The Bureau has designed an approach for managing fraud risk to the 2020 Census that generally aligns with leading practices in the commit, assess, and design and implement components of GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. However, the Bureau has not yet determined the program's fraud risk tolerance or outlined plans for referring potential fraud to the Department of Commerce Office of Inspector General (OIG) to investigate. Bureau officials described plans to take these actions later this year, but not for updating the antifraud strategy. Updating this strategy to include the Bureau's fraud risk tolerance and OIG referral plan will help ensure the strategy is current, complete, and conforms to leading practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that the Bureau set clear time frames for developing mitigation and contingency plans, require that mitigation and contingency plans include all key attributes, hold risk owners accountable for carrying out their risk management responsibilities, and update its antifraud strategy to include a fraud risk tolerance and OIG referral plan.

In February 2017, we added the 2020 Census  to our High-Risk List because operational and other issues were  threatening the Bureau\u2019s ability to deliver a cost-effective enumeration,  and the census remains on our 2019 High-Risk List as these issues have  persisted.", "With less than 1 year remaining until Census Day, many risks remain. For  example, as discussed in our high-risk reports, the Bureau decided to  scale back census field testing in 2017 and 2018 citing budget  uncertainty, and the Bureau has had challenges developing critical  information technology systems. Moreover, new innovations\u2014such as an  option for the public to respond to the census using the internet\u2014have  raised questions about potential security and fraud risks.

For each selected risk, we reviewed relevant Bureau documentation\u2014 including risk mitigation and contingency plans\u2014and we conducted  semistructured interviews with the Bureau officials responsible for  managing the risk. In addition, drawing principally from our Enterprise  Risk Management (ERM) framework as well as secondary sources, we  identified seven key attributes for risk mitigation and contingency plans to  help ensure they contain the information needed to manage risks. We  assessed the risk mitigation and contingency plans entered in the  Bureau\u2019s risk registers as of December 2018\u2014as well as the separate  mitigation and contingency plans for the six selected risks\u2014against the  seven key attributes.", "To evaluate the extent to which the Bureau\u2019s approach to managing fraud  risks to the 2020 Census aligns with leading practices outlined in our  Fraud Risk Framework, we reviewed Bureau documentation related to the  2020 Census antifraud strategy.

The Bureau has met all  the leading practices in the first part of the assess component, according  to our review. Specifically, the Bureau tailored the fraud risk assessment  to the 2020 Census as this is the first time an internet-response option will  be available for a decennial census in the United States. To identify  specific tools, methods, and sources for gathering information about fraud  risks, the Bureau met with relevant stakeholders, along with subject- matter experts, and conducted focus groups to develop various fraud  scenarios that became a key part of the assessment. The Bureau also  involved relevant stakeholders in the assessment process by outlining  their roles and responsibilities for the 2020 Census.

Bureau officials stated that they plan  to use the classification to determine appropriate follow-up steps based  on risk scores generated by its Fraud Detection Analytics Model that was  develop by SRQA for the 2020 Census. However, the Bureau did not  define thresholds for the low-, medium-, and high-risk categories. These  thresholds, if defined, would meet the intent of a fraud risk tolerance by  indicating the acceptable level of variation in self-responses.", "SRQA officials stated that they are developing these thresholds, and  therefore its fraud risk tolerance, and plan to have them completed in  August 2019. This includes reviewing available information collected  through the 2018 End-to-End Test, running simulations, defining  thresholds, and then evaluating the results to make adjustments.  Responses will receive a score, but until the Bureau defines fraud risk  tolerance thresholds for the low-, medium-, and high-risk categories, it  cannot effectively implement its antifraud strategy to allocate responses  for follow-up or inclusion. This may also affect the Bureau\u2019s ability to  evaluate and adapt its antifraud strategy if initial benchmarks are not in  place to use for monitoring, with subsequent adjustments potentially  requiring additional time and resources. While officials described steps and time frames to develop a fraud risk tolerance, they did not do so for  updating the antifraud strategy to include the tolerance.

First, until the  Bureau defines its fraud risk tolerances, such as defining low-, medium-,  or high-risk thresholds, it will not be able to effectively allocate resources  to respond to residual fraud risks consistent with the Fraud Risk  Framework\u2019s leading practices. Second, the Bureau did not initially  coordinate with the Department of Commerce (Commerce) OIG about its  antifraud strategy, which is not consistent with the leading practices. Such  lack of coordination could have precluded the OIG from determining if  potentially fraudulent activities should be investigated. After discussing  the results of our review with the Bureau, the Bureau contacted and met  with the Commerce OIG in February 2019.

The 2020 Census antifraud control activities focus on  detecting potentially fraudulent responses. The Bureaus plans to use a  combination of data analytics and follow up to review response data  before they are added to the Bureau\u2019s overall Census counts. The  Bureau\u2019s efforts for the 2020 Census also focus on minimizing costs.  Specifically, if the Bureau\u2019s fraud detection can minimize the amount of  cases that require manual investigation or work by field operations staff to  collect the information again, it can reduce the cost and workload to the  Bureau.", "The framework states the antifraud strategy should also ensure that  responses to identified instances of fraud are prompt and consistent. In  addition, effective managers of fraud risks are to refer instances of  potential fraud to the OIG or other appropriate parties, such as law- enforcement entities or the Department of Justice, for further  investigation. The Bureau\u2019s plan describes its process for scoring  responses using its Fraud Detection Analytics Model and then sorting  responses into a low-, medium-, or high-risk category. The plan also  outlines risk responses that depend on the risk category. For example,  medium-risk responses are reviewed internally and could be incorporated  into the census count or sent for additional follow up.", "However, the Bureau\u2019s antifraud strategy does not call for instances of  potential fraud to be referred to the Commerce OIG. Specifically, the  Bureau\u2019s fraud risk assessment and risk response plan do not mention  the Commerce OIG. Bureau officials stated that the Commerce OIG did  not participate in the development of these documents. In February 2019,  after we discussed the results of our review with the Bureau, the Bureau  met with the Commerce OIG to discuss potential referrals. As a result, the  Bureau agreed to develop and share with the Commerce OIG a plan that  outlines a potential referral process by summer 2019.", "Managers who effectively manage fraud risks collaborate and  communicate with stakeholders to share information on fraud schemes  and the lessons learned from fraud control activities.

Some  of the plans the Bureau has developed are missing key attributes we  identified for helping to ensure the plans contain the information needed  to manage risks. For example, none of the Bureau\u2019s plans described how  the Bureau will monitor the risk response, so the Bureau may not be able  to track whether the plans are working as intended. These issues have  arisen in some instances because the Bureau\u2019s decennial risk  management plan does not require mitigation and contingency plans to  have each of the seven key attributes we identified; in other instances,  the issues have arisen because Bureau officials do not always hold risk  owners accountable for fulfilling all their risk management responsibilities.  Consistently documenting risk management activities would support  management\u2019s ability to more quickly make informed decisions in  response to risks confronting the 2020 Census.
