HUD has attempted to estimate the amounts of improper subsidies attributable to each source but has developed reliable estimates for only the first--and likely the largest--source. HUD paid an estimated $1.4 billion in gross improper subsidies (consisting of $896 million in overpayments and $519 million in underpayments) in fiscal year 2003 as a result of program administrator errors--a 39 percent decline from HUD's fiscal year 2000 baseline estimate. GAO estimates that the amount of net overpayments could have subsidized another 56,000 households with vouchers in 2003. HUD has initiated several efforts under RHIIP to address improper subsidies in its public housing, voucher, and project-based Section 8 programs. Specifically, HUD has (1) stepped up monitoring of program administrators, (2) improved verification of tenants' incomes, and (3) provided guidance and training on program requirements to HUD staff and program administrators. These actions have strengthened HUD's oversight of the programs, despite some implementation problems and remaining challenges. For example, for the voucher and public housing programs, HUD field office staff completed about 1,100 Rental Integrity Monitoring reviews--that is, on-site assessments of public housing agencies' compliance with policies for determining rent subsidies--between 2002 and 2004. However, problems with a database containing information on these reviews prevented HUD from analyzing the results. According to HUD, the complexity of existing policies contributes to the difficulties program administrators have in determining rent subsidies correctly. For example, program administrators must assess tenants' eligibility for 44 different income exclusions and deductions. However, simplification of these policies, which will likely require statutory changes by Congress, could affect many tenants' rental payments, with some tenants paying more and others paying less.

Payments  made under these programs, which help keep rents affordable for about 5  million low-income tenants, account for the majority of HUD\u2019s  expenditures. For example, in fiscal year 2003, these payments accounted  for about $28 billion, or almost 75 percent of the department\u2019s total  expenditures. HUD\u2019s payments cover the difference between a unit\u2019s  monthly rental cost\u2014or, for public housing, the operating cost\u2014and the  tenant\u2019s payment, which is generally equal to 30 percent of the tenant\u2019s  adjusted monthly income. I will refer to these payments as rent subsidies.

In preparing the  report, we obtained and analyzed data on improper payments that HUD  collected for fiscal years 2000 and 2003.

The program,   authorized under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as  amended, provides housing vouchers that eligible individuals and families  can use to rent houses or apartments in the private housing market from  property owners participating in the program. In fiscal year 2003, the  program assisted about 2 million households (42 percent of all HUD- assisted households) and had outlays of about $13 billion. In general, only  households with very low incomes\u2014less than or equal to 50 percent of  area median income\u2014are eligible for vouchers.", "Under the public housing program authorized by the United States  Housing Act of 1937, as amended, HUD has subsidized the development,  operation, and modernization of government-owned properties, which are  currently managed by some 3,300 PHAs. In fiscal year 2003, HUD\u2019s public  housing program assisted 1.2 million households (one-quarter of all  households receiving housing assistance) and had outlays of about $7  billion. To be eligible for public housing, a household must be low  income\u2014that is, have an income that is less than or equal to 80 percent of  area median income.", "Under a variety of project-based Section 8 programs authorized by the  Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, as amended, HUD  subsidizes rents at certain multifamily housing developments, which had  often received construction subsidies from other HUD programs, with  rental assistance payments disbursed under multiyear contracts. Property  owners and managers for about 22,000 subsidized properties currently  participate in these programs. In fiscal year 2003, HUD\u2019s project-based  programs assisted 1.6 million households (one-third of all HUD-assisted  households) and had outlays of roughly $8 billion. In general, only  households with low incomes are eligible for HUD project-based Section 8  assistance.", "HUD\u2019s oversight of the program administrators varies, depending on the  program. For vouchers and public housing, HUD field offices provide  oversight of PHAs that administer the programs. Field office staff conduct  on-site reviews and analysis of PHAs\u2019 operations. For HUD\u2019s Section 8  project-based programs, contract administrators\u2014which include both  private contractors and HUD field offices\u2014are responsible for overseeing  and ensuring that Section 8 properties are in compliance with HUD\u2019s  policies.", "HUD created RHIIP in the spring of 2001 to assess the magnitude of and  reasons for improper payments in its rental housing assistance programs.  RHIIP was set up as a direct result of HUD\u2019s analysis of data it collected  on improper subsidy payments in fiscal year 2000. The analysis, which  HUD issued in a June 2001 report, focused on subsidy errors made by  program administrators but did not attempt to determine if the tenants had  supplied accurate and complete income information. In 2002, HUD  completed a separate evaluation to determine the magnitude of rental  assistance errors caused by unreported tenant income. The study matched  tenants\u2019 reported incomes with income data from the Internal Revenue  Service and the Social Security Administration.", "RHIIP\u2019s goal is to reduce the incidence and dollar amount of improper rent  subsidies by 50 percent in fiscal year 2005 compared with fiscal year 2000,  with interim goals of a 15 percent reduction by fiscal year 2003 and a 30  percent reduction by fiscal year 2004.

Program  administrator errors are the broadest category of errors because, as figure  1 shows, they can affect nearly all of the critical dimensions of the process  for determining rent subsidies. In performing their work, program  administrators may incorrectly determine rent subsidies by, for example,  making calculation and transcription errors or by misapplying income  exclusions and deductions required by HUD policies.", "Errors that result from unreported tenant income occur when tenants do  not report an income source, either their own or another household  member\u2019s, to program administrators. These errors generally occur early  in the process when the tenant first submits income information to  program administrators (see fig. 1). Although some tenants may not  disclose all income sources in order to qualify for assistance and to  increase the rent subsidies they receive, tenants may also fail to report  income sources unintentionally if program administrators provide unclear  instructions about the sources of income they must disclose.", "Finally, billing errors occur at the very end of the process (see fig. 1). The  procedures program administrators use to bill HUD for subsidy payments  vary for each of the three rental assistance programs, and, as a result, the  specific types of mistakes that lead to billing errors can also vary.  However, in general, billing errors arise when discrepancies exist between  the amount of rent subsidy the program administrator determines and the  amount billed to and paid by HUD. Billing errors can also include  accounting discrepancies between amounts paid by HUD and a property\u2019s  bank statements and accounting records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Reliable Estimates of Improper Payments Due Only to Program Administrator Errors", "paragraphs": ["To determine the amounts of improper rent subsidies resulting from  program administrator errors, HUD collected data on more than 2,400  randomly selected households participating in the voucher, public  housing, and project-based Section 8 programs for fiscal years 2000 and  2003. Our analysis of the documentation and data collected indicated that  these studies provided a reasonably accurate estimate of subsidy  determination errors made by program administrators. Data from the  fiscal year 2003 study show that the department paid an estimated $1.4  billion in gross improper rent subsidies (representing $896 million in  overpayments and $519 million in underpayments) as a result of program  administrator errors in fiscal year 2003\u2014a 39 percent decrease from fiscal  year 2000. The voucher program accounted for about one-half of the total  reduction, while public housing and project-based Section 8 each  accounted for roughly one-quarter. Because the overpayments exceeded  the underpayments, HUD was not able to use an estimated $377 million of  its funding to assist needy low-income households. On the basis of the  average national subsidy cost of a voucher in 2003\u2014about $6,720,  including administrative costs\u2014we estimated that HUD could have  provided an additional 56,000 households nationwide with vouchers in  fiscal year 2003, nearly the same number of households that currently  receive vouchers in the Los Angeles, California, area.", "Each of the rental assistance programs experienced substantial reductions  in gross program administrator error between fiscal years 2000 and 2003\u2014 50 percent for public housing, 35 percent for vouchers, and 32 percent for  project-based Section 8 (see fig. 2). These reductions exceeded HUD\u2019s  interim RHIIP goal of reducing improper rent subsidies by 15 percent by  fiscal year 2003 for this source of error. Many of the initiatives under  RHIIP were too recent to have had any direct impact on the reductions.  However, HUD officials stated that its communications with program  administrators about the importance of addressing improper rent  subsidies and program administrators\u2019 anticipation of increased  monitoring by HUD had probably led to voluntary improvements in  internal control activities and likely contributed to these reductions.", "Future estimates of improper subsidies may show whether further  reductions can be made and sustained as the RHIIP initiative matures.", "For the other two sources of errors\u2014unreported tenant income and billing  errors\u2014HUD did not produce complete or reliable estimates for all three  programs for fiscal years 2000 and 2003. HUD estimated that the  department paid $191 million in fiscal year 2003 in gross improper rent  subsidies due to unreported tenant income. However, the small number of  files that formed the basis for the estimate and the large variances in the  amounts of income tenants did not report resulted in a margin of error so  large that the estimate is not meaningful. As a result, the actual amount of  improper rent subsidies for this source of error could be as low as zero or  many times higher than HUD\u2019s estimate. Despite problems with the  estimate, HUD reported that gross improper rent subsidies due to  unreported income decreased by 80 percent from fiscal years 2000 to 2003.  However, we believe that any comparison between the two estimates is  not valid because of the limitations of the fiscal year 2003 estimate and  significant differences in the methodology used for each year.", "HUD also did not produce a complete and reliable estimate of the amount  of billing error in fiscal year 2000 for any of the three programs. For fiscal  year 2003, HUD has begun to implement a methodology for estimating  billing error for vouchers and public housing. For project-based Section 8,  HUD estimated approximately $100 million in billing errors for fiscal year  2003, although the small sample size and the concentration of errors in a  small number of properties resulted in a large margin of error."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Taken Steps to Reduce Improper Subsidies in All Three Programs, but Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["HUD has undertaken three separate efforts under RHIIP to address  improper rent subsidies for its public housing, voucher, and project-based  Section 8 programs.

According to HUD officials, these reviews were the first  comprehensive reviews of PHAs\u2019 tenant information files in more than 20  years. While important, the reviews were hampered by implementation  problems. For example, officials from most of the HUD field offices we  met with said that they did not have enough staff to conduct all of their  reviews within the required time frames and still fulfill their other  oversight responsibilities. As a result of resource constraints, some field  offices had to use staff with little or no experience in monitoring PHAs for  RIM reviews; issued their RIM review reports late; or postponed other  monitoring activities such as inspections of troubled properties.  Additionally, problems with a database containing information on RIM  reviews prevented HUD from analyzing the results of the reviews to assess  improvements in PHAs\u2019 calculations of tenant subsidies and provide  technical assistance to PHAs.", "For the project-based Section 8 programs, HUD plans to rely on  performance-based contract administrators (PBCA) to monitor property  owners\u2019 compliance with HUD\u2019s policies for determining rent subsidies.  For the past several years, HUD has been transferring responsibility for  overseeing property owners to PBCAs from other types of contract  administrators, including HUD field offices. As of October 2004, HUD\u2019s  project-based Section 8 programs consisted of about 21,900 properties,  and HUD had transferred contracts for about 11,800 of these properties to  PBCAs. HUD requires PBCAs to perform extensive annual reviews of  properties\u2019 operations, including reviewing owners\u2019 rent subsidy  calculations. To ensure that PBCAs meet HUD\u2019s performance standards,  HUD has developed a comprehensive oversight program. However,  because HUD has often not provided adequate oversight of contractors\u2014a  factor that in 2003 led us to designate acquisitions management as one of  HUD\u2019s major management challenges\u2014implementing these oversight  measures could pose challenges to HUD.", "In our February 2005 report, we recommended that HUD make regular  monitoring of PHAs\u2019 compliance with HUD\u2019s policies for determining rent  subsidies a permanent part of its oversight activities. We also  recommended that HUD collect complete and consistent information from  these monitoring efforts. In August 2005, HUD officials told us that they  planned to conduct 275 RIM reviews each year starting in 2006, and that  they were developing software to better track the results of RIM reviews.", "To improve verification of tenants\u2019 incomes, HUD has done the following:    For the voucher and public housing programs, HUD has implemented an  Internet-based income verification system that allows PHAs to compare  income information they receive from tenants with income information  employers report to government agencies. According to HUD officials, the  system is intended not only to help PHAs detect unreported income, but  also to provide them with a more convenient and accurate way to verify  tenant-reported information. HUD obtained the data currently in the  system through agreements with state wage and income collection  agencies. HUD is replacing these data with data from a single source\u2014the  National Directory of New Hires\u2014and intends to make it available to all  PHAs by the end of this month. Congress passed legislation in 2004 that  grants HUD the authority to request and obtain data from this directory\u2014a   database containing quarterly federal and state wage data, quarterly  unemployment data, and monthly new hire data reported by employers to  state agencies and compiled by the Department of Health and Human  Services.", "For project-based Section 8 programs, HUD plans to implement a similar  Internet-based system for property owners after it addresses data security  concerns. When Congress granted HUD access to the National Directory  of New Hires database, it required that HUD demonstrate to the  Department of Health and Human Services that all necessary steps had  been taken to prevent the inappropriate disclosure of information from the  database before property owners were given access. To alleviate concerns  about releasing sensitive information to private property owners, HUD is  initially making the data available only to PHAs to confirm that the system  is secure. If the Department of Health and Human Services is satisfied with  HUD\u2019s security precautions, HUD plans to make the information available  to property owners by the end of fiscal year 2006. Once the system is  implemented, property owners will be able to access earned income data  from a secure Web site.", "To improve HUD staff and program administrators\u2019 understanding of the  complex requirements for determining rent subsidies, HUD has taken the  following steps:    For vouchers and public housing, HUD has provided training and guidance  to PHAs on various topics, such as how to calculate subsidies, improve  quality control procedures, and comply with income verification  requirements. The training addresses program basics, including how to  interview prospective tenants and verify tenant income information. HUD  also has provided guidance to PHAs on developing policies and  procedures that would prevent future subsidy calculation errors and  provided technical assistance to PHAs that were deemed high risk on the  basis of their performance in RIM reviews.  Finally, HUD has updated or  developed guidance for PHAs on how to correctly calculate rent subsidies.", "For project-based Section 8 programs, HUD has improved its guidance and  training for property owners, contract administrators, and HUD field staff.  For example, in 2003, HUD revised its handbook for project-based Section  8 programs, which sets forth the requirements and procedures that  property owners must follow in administering these programs, including  determining rent subsides. Also in 2003, HUD issued a new monitoring  guide to help contract administrators improve their oversight of property  owners\u2019 subsidy determinations. HUD accompanied these efforts with  training for property owners, contract administrators, and HUD field  offices on the updated handbook and new monitoring guide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Has Considered Simplifying Policies for Determining Rent Subsidies but Has Not Done a Formal Review of the Potential Effects", "paragraphs": ["As one of its efforts under RHIIP and as mandated by The President\u2019s  Management Agenda for Fiscal Year 2002, HUD has considered various  approaches\u2014statutory, regulatory, and administrative\u2014to streamlining  and simplifying its policies for determining rent subsidies. According to  HUD, the complexity of the existing policies contributes to errors in  determining subsidies. For example, program administrators currently  must determine tenants\u2019 eligibility for 44 different income exclusions and  deductions in order to calculate rent payments and subsidies. The purpose  of some of these income exclusions and deductions is to provide  additional relief to certain tenants, such as elderly and disabled  households with large medical expenses, by reducing the amount they  contribute toward rent. Other income exclusions are designed to  counteract potential work disincentives\u2014for example, tenants\u2019 rental  payments are raised as their income increases.", "The process for determining rent subsidies is further complicated by the  difficulty some program administrators may have in understanding and  implementing HUD\u2019s program requirements. According to multiple field  office staff, program administrators, and industry groups we met with,  staff responsible for calculating rent subsidies are often poorly paid and  have large caseloads and limited education. These factors can contribute  to the misapplication of program policies and to subsequent errors in  subsidy calculations. In addition, these same groups commented that these  types of positions have a high turnover rate, and, as a result, it is difficult  for program administrators to retain knowledgeable and experienced staff.", "HUD has considered several approaches to simplifying rent subsidy  policies, including:    an income-based approach that would establish tenants\u2019 rents as a  percentage of their income, possibly with a limited number of exclusions  and deductions or none at all;   a tiered flat-rent system that would establish tenants\u2019 rents for several  income bands and eliminate the need to readjust rents because of income  changes, provided the changes were within the band; and    a mixed approach that would give program administrators various rent  structures to choose from, including income-based and tiered flat rents.", "Adopting any simplification approach represents a change from current  policies. Because most of HUD\u2019s policies have a basis in statute, major  changes are likely to require congressional action. Under any  simplification approach, many tenants\u2019 rental payments could be affected,  with some tenants paying higher rents and others paying lower rents. For  example, elderly and disabled households, as well as large families, that  currently benefit the most from HUD\u2019s exclusions and deductions would  be hit hardest by the elimination of current income adjustments. In  addition, the transition to simplified policies could create confusion  among program administrators and tenants in the short term. Depending  on the magnitude of program changes, program administrators\u2014the  approximately 22,000 property owners and 3,000 PHAs across the  country\u2014would have to retrain staff, update written procedures and  administrative plans, and make potentially costly modifications to their  software applications. Program administrators would also have to  undertake outreach efforts to explain the changes to tenants.", "HUD staff have conducted a preliminary analysis of the impact of some  simplification approaches on tenants\u2019 rental payments and program costs.  However, the department has not conducted a formal study on the impact  of policy changes to inform policymakers on this issue. To ensure that  policymakers have sufficient information with which to consider potential  simplification approaches, our February 2005 report recommended that  HUD study the possible impact of alternative strategies for simplifying  program policies on subsidy errors, tenant rental payments, program  administrators\u2019 workload, and program costs.", "In its fiscal year 2006 budget submission, HUD proposed, among other  things, to simplify program requirements for the voucher program and  provide PHAs with greater administrative flexibility.
