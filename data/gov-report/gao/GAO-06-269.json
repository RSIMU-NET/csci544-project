CM bills allow Treasury to obtain cash outside of its regular borrowing schedule in varying amounts and maturities, but Treasury pays a premium for doing so. GAO's analysis found that Treasury paid a higher yield on CM bills than that paid on outstanding bills of similar maturity in the secondary market. Treasury has taken steps to reduce the use and cost of CM bills. Treasury added a 4-week bill to its regular auction schedule in 2001, which led to reduced CM bill issuance, shorter terms to maturity, and lower borrowing costs in 2002. Treasury has also fine-tuned CM bill issuance by borrowing closer to the time when it needs cash. However, borrowing costs associated with CM bills have increased since 2003. While Treasury has made progress towards reducing the cost of CM bills, it may be possible to do more. GAO's analysis indicates that the yield differential has increased as short-term rates have risen. If these rates rise further, as market participants expect, so will the yield differential. While Treasury does not vary its debt management strategy in response to changing interest rates, it should be mindful of their effect on the relative cost of unscheduled CM bills and explore options to reduce the frequent use of CM bills and ultimately overall borrowing costs.

No regular security that matures on the same day another is  issued can be used to fill cash financing gaps over the long run because, in  a steady state, most, if not all, of the cash raised at each issuance would be  needed to pay maturing securities.  As a result, Treasury would not raise  large amounts of new cash.  In addition, Treasury generally sets the issue  amount for longer-term securities to cover long-term deficit needs, not  short-term cash shortfalls, and thus the new cash raised with the 5-year  note may not cover the full amount of cash needs in the beginning of the  month.

One possible consequence of this  practice is an increased risk that incorrect cash flow predictions or  emergencies could lead to Treasury overdrawing its Federal Reserve Bank  account.

Treasury bill yields have  risen and may continue to rise and eventually reach levels that prevailed in  the late 1990s, thereby erasing the portion of the decline in the yield  differential caused by lower interest rates.  However, because the 4-week  bill is now a permanent feature of Treasury\u2019s auction schedule and has  reduced Treasury\u2019s reliance on CM bills, the portion of the decline in the  yield differential attributable to relatively lower CM bill issuance is likely to  endure.  The experience during fiscal years 2002\u20132005 as a whole suggests  that the yield differential could remain about 13 basis points below pre- 2002 levels.  These findings are discussed in more detail later in this report.", "The large reduction in the yield differential has helped reduce borrowing  costs associated with CM bills.

Of the $1.06 billion in total borrowing costs  associated with CM bills in that year, $70 million was associated with the  yield differential.  Since then, the average yield differential has declined  and was 14 basis points, or about $3,800 a day per $1 billion borrowed, in  fiscal year 2005.  During fiscal year 2005, Treasury borrowed about $8  billion (annualized amount outstanding) using CM bills.

In fiscal year 2005, CM bill yields were within 2  basis points of overnight repurchase agreement yields. Although  repurchase agreements and CM bills are both short-term investments, there  are some differences.  For example, repurchase agreements are subject to  federal, state, and local taxes whereas CM bills are exempt from state and  local taxation.  Also, CM bills, like regular Treasury bills, are risk free  whereas repurchase agreements issued by private borrowers involve some  risk.  The high-quality collateral in a repurchase agreement (e.g., Treasury  securities or agency securities) reduces the credit risk faced by the lender  and allows borrowers to obtain cash at a lower cost than they would obtain  otherwise.  However, the lender is still exposed to credit risk because if  the borrower fails to repay the loan, the market value of the collateral may  be less than the amount owed.  Repurchase agreements are structured  carefully to reduce this credit risk exposure, for example, by lending less  than market value of the security used as collateral.  Nevertheless,  repurchase agreements have more risk than securities issued by Treasury  and accordingly have higher yields than Treasury securities of similar  maturity, which are risk free and are the floor for short-term rates in the  money market."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Identified Some Features That Affect the Yield Differential", "paragraphs": ["Our statistical analysis found that, all other things equal, the amount of CM  bills issued was positively correlated with the yield differential, meaning  that increases in the amount of CM bills issued relative to the amount of  similar-maturing Treasury bills outstanding increased the yield differential,  and decreases in the amount issued reduced the yield differential.

The when-issued market is important  because it serves as a price discovery mechanism that potential  competitive bidders look to as they set their bids for an auction. When- issued trading reduces uncertainty about bidding levels surrounding  auctions and also enables dealers to sell securities to their customers in  advance of the auction so they are better able to distribute the securities  and bid more aggressively, which results in lower costs to Treasury.  We  counted the number of preauction trades on the day of CM bill auctions and  found that when-issued trading is lower prior to CM bill auctions than  regular 4-week bill auctions.", "A broad range of participants generally improves competition and  theoretically maximizes the price investors pay for Treasury securities.

The auction spread is the difference between the yield Treasury  obtains at auction and the yield in the when-issued market at the time of  auction.

In a reverse repurchase agreement,  Treasury would lend market participants cash to purchase securities in the  secondary market.  The borrower would then return the cash borrowed  plus interest at a specified time, usually overnight.  Reverse repurchase  agreements could potentially narrow Treasury\u2019s negative funding spread  because repurchase agreement rates are generally higher than rates earned  on TT&L accounts.

In an equation that also included the other variables  in column A of table 6, the coefficient for a binary variable designating such  issues had a t-statistic of only 0.161 which led to the rejection of the  hypothesis that CM bills auctioned on Wednesdays and maturing after the  end of the month have lower yields.", "Instead of issuing a new security, Treasury may add to, or reopen, an  existing issue, increasing the amount outstanding of the issue.  CM bill  reopenings are fungible with previously issued regular bills and may enjoy  their liquidity.  Seligman found that CM bills issued off-cycle were  significantly more costly than those that reopened a previous issue.   However, contrary to Seligman\u2019s results, our analysis indicates that off- cycle CM bills are not more costly than reopenings.  Column D of table 6  shows the sign of the coefficient of the off-cycle variable is negative rather  than positive although, more relevantly, the coefficient is not significantly  different from zero.  The descriptive statistics in table 5 show that 86  percent of CM bills issued during the more recent period were issued off- cycle compared with about 40 percent in the earlier period.  Off-cycle  issuance has become a regular feature of CM bills and does not command  an extra return.", "Seligman also hypothesized that an increase in the number of business days  between CM bill announcement and auction would reduce the yield  differential.  While his estimates suggest that 2 business days advanced  notice reduces the yield differential, he found that increasing the  announcement period beyond 2 days did not further reduce the differential.   In contrast, we found that the sign for the coefficient of the number of days  of advance notice was positive and significant, as shown in column E of  table 6.  This has the unexpected implication that increasing the number of  business days notice before auction increases rather than reduces the yield  differential. Because markets usually penalize uncertainty, this result  appears counterintuitive and should be studied further to determine  whether it arose because of a statistical problem such as the correlation  between the advanced notice variable and an omitted variable that may be  unobservable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected CM Bill Features Reduce Yields but Opportunities for Additional Exploitation of These Features May Be Limited", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of CM bill yield differentials from fiscal year 2002 through  2005 revealed several features of CM bills that affect the yield differential;  however, Treasury\u2019s ability to achieve additional savings by further  exploiting these features may be limited.  The average yield differential was  substantially lower during the period from fiscal years 2002 through 2005  than it was in the preceding several years.  The two most important factors  behind the yield differential decline between the pre- and post-2002 period  were (1) the substantial decline in the general level of short-term rates and  (2) the major reduction in the ratio of CM bills issued to the average  amount of Treasury bills outstanding.  The level of short-term interest rates  is largely determined by Federal Reserve policy and market forces rather  than Treasury.  Treasury bill yields may continue to rise and reach levels  that prevailed in the early period, thereby erasing the portion of the decline  in the yield differential caused by lower interest rates.  However, because  the 4-week bill is now a permanent feature of Treasury\u2019s auction schedule  and has reduced Treasury\u2019s reliance on CM bills, the portion of the decline  in the yield differential attributable to the reduced ratio of CM bills to  similar-maturity Treasury bills is likely to endure.  The experience from  fiscal year 2002 through 2005 as a whole suggests that the yield differential  could remain about 13 basis points below pre-2002 levels.", "While Treasury may have some ability to change the relative amount of CM  and regular bills issued, the mix is affected by cash flow patterns largely  beyond its control.  Aligning cash outflows and inflows could reduce the  amount of CM bills issued, but Treasury does not have authority over the  timing of all cash flows.  However, Treasury does have control over debt- related cash flows.  Efforts to better align the timing of net increases in  debt with its largest cash payments could reduce both the size of CM bills  and the yield differential.", "To the extent that Treasury can increase the share of CM bills that mature  on dates when taxes are due, additional savings might be achieved.   Already more than 60 percent of CM bills met this criterion in fiscal year  2005, so the possibility of achieving further savings through this feature  may be minimal.  Moreover, Treasury\u2019s short-term borrowing needs do not  uniformly occur shortly before large tax due dates.", "Nearly one-half of CM bills issued since fiscal year 2002 have been issued in  multiple tranches.  Our results provide somewhat limited evidence that  multiple tranche issues may be more costly.  Even if such issues were to  require higher yields, however, multiple tranche issues have the advantage  of reducing borrowing costs by minimizing the duration of the amounts  borrowed in later tranches.  For example, instead of borrowing $20 billion  for 10 days, Treasury might use two tranches to borrow $10 billion for 10  days and $10 billion for 9 days, thereby saving 1 day\u2019s interest on the  second tranche.  Accordingly, the savings that multiple tranche CM bills  provide by reducing the number of days that interest is paid on later  tranches is likely to more than offset the higher yields such issues might  entail.", "Finally, the positive correlation found between the number of days of  advanced notice and the yield differential appears counterintuitive and  probably should not be used as a basis for reducing the notification period."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Analysis of CM Bill Auctions", "paragraphs": ["Given that CM bill auctions are innately less predictable than regular  Treasury bill auctions, it is not surprising that, by some measures, CM bill  auctions are less successful than regular auctions.

When-issued trading reduces  uncertainty about bidding levels surrounding auctions and also enables  dealers to sell securities to their customers in advance of the auction so  they are better able to distribute the securities and bid more aggressively,  which results in lower costs to Treasury.", "However, we found that trading activity is sparse before CM bill auctions.  We counted the number of preauction trades on the day of CM bill auctions  and found that when-issued trading is lower prior to CM bill auctions  compared with regular 4-week bill auctions (see table 7).

According to Treasury,  this is a good benchmark to measure auction yields because potential  bidders have a choice between purchasing securities at auctions or  purchasing securities in the when-issued market.  A negative spread (where  the auction yield is less than the contemporaneous when-issued yield)  indicates Treasury paid a lower yield than expected, which is a positive  auction result.  Alternatively, a positive spread (the auction yield is greater  than the contemporaneous when-issued yield) indicates Treasury paid a  higher yield than expected from information in the market at the time of  auction.  This would indicate a poor auction result.  By this measure, CM  bill auctions performed better than 4-week bill auctions.  The  contemporaneous auction spread of CM bill auctions from fiscal year 2002  through 2005 was approximately zero (see table 8), which implies that the  yield Treasury paid on CM bills generally reflected market information at  the time of the auction.  In contrast, the auction spread for 4-week bill  auctions averaged a positive 0.3 basis points for fiscal years 2002 through  2005.

In general, large, well-attended auctions improve  competition and lead to lower borrowing costs for Treasury.  For example,  in the 1990s Treasury switched its auctions from multiple-price to uniform- price format in order to encourage more aggressive bids and a broader  distribution of auction awards.  Treasury found that the share of the  auction awarded to the top five competitive bidders declined under the  new auction format to about 35 percent for 2-year notes and 36 percent for  5-year notes.  Using similar estimates of bidder participation in CM bill  auctions, we found that the share of the auction awarded to the top five  bidders was 60 percent or higher in over half of CM bill auctions held  during fiscal years 2002\u20132005.  The share exceeded 60 percent in only 18  percent (37 of 209) of 4-week bill auctions held during fiscal years 2002\u2013 2005.", "Treasury limits the maximum auction award to a single bidder to 35 percent  of the offering in part to foster a liquid secondary market for a new issue.

These squeezes arise  because Treasury allows dealers to sell the security short to its customers  (or other dealers) in the when-issued market before securities are  auctioned.  Lack of competition could also result in lower prices (higher  yields) at auction.  In contrast, we found generally negative correlations  between concentration measures and auction spreads for CM bill auctions.   In other words, in more concentrated auctions, Treasury was less likely to  pay more than the yield indicated in the when-issued market at the time of  auction.

In general, higher  ratios signal higher demand for the security being auctioned.  From fiscal  year 2002 to 2005, the bid-to-cover ratio for CM bill auctions averaged 3.17  (see table 9).  In contrast, the bid-to-cover ratio for 4-week bills averaged  only 2.30.  This suggests a stronger demand for CM bills than regular 4- week bills; however, these results should be interpreted with caution.
