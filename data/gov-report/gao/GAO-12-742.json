In July 2011, GAO evaluated 24 agencies\u0092 progress on this effort and reported that most agencies had not yet completed data center inventories or consolidation plans and recommended that they do so.", "In this subsequent review, GAO was asked to (1) evaluate the extent to which the 24 agencies updated and verified their data center inventories and plans, (2) evaluate the extent to which selected agencies have adequately completed key elements of their consolidation plans, and (3) identify agencies\u0092 notable consolidation successes and challenges. To address these objectives, GAO assessed the completeness of agency inventories and plans, analyzed the schedule and cost estimates of 5 agencies previously reported to have completed one or both estimates, and interviewed officials from all 24 agencies about their consolidation successes and challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of the most recent agency data submitted in September 2011, 24 agencies identified almost 2,900 total centers, established plans to close 1,186 of them by 2015, and estimated they would realize over $2.4 billion in cost savings in doing so. However, while the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required agencies to complete missing elements in their data center inventories and plans by the end of September 2011, only 3 agencies submitted complete inventories and only 1 agency submitted a complete plan. For example, in their inventories, 17 agencies do not provide full information on their information technology facilities and energy usage, and 8 provide only partial information on their servers. Further, in their consolidation plans, 13 agencies do not provide a full master program schedule and 21 agencies do not fully report their expected cost savings. Officials from several agencies reported that some of this information was unavailable at certain facilities or that the information was still being developed. In a prior report, GAO recommended that agencies complete the missing elements from their inventories and plans. Until these inventories and plans are complete, agencies will continue to be at risk of not realizing anticipated savings, improved infrastructure utilization, or energy efficiency.", "OMB requires a master program schedule and a cost-benefit analysis (a type of cost estimate) as key requirements of agencies\u0092 consolidation plans, but none of the five agencies GAO reviewed had a schedule or cost estimate that was fully consistent with the four selected attributes of a properly sequenced schedule (such as having identified dependencies), or the four characteristics that form the basis of a reliable cost estimate (such as being comprehensive and well-documented). For example, the Departments of Interior and Transportation did not have schedules and the Department of Agriculture\u0092s schedule was consistent with three of four attributes. Additionally, cost estimates for the Departments of Homeland Security and Veterans Affairs were partially consistent with the four cost characteristics. In the absence of reliable schedules and estimates, these agencies are at risk of experiencing cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. OMB has established a standardized cost model to aid agencies in their consolidation planning efforts, but use of the model is voluntary.", "Many federal agencies reported consolidation successes. Notably, 20 agencies identified 34 areas of success, although only 3 of those areas were reported by more than 1 agency. The two most-reported successes were focusing on the benefits of key technologies and the benefits of working with other agencies and components to identify consolidation opportunities. However, agencies have continued to report a number of the same challenges that GAO first described in 2011, while other challenges are evolving. For example, 15 agencies reported continued issues with obtaining power usage information and 9 agencies reported that their organization continued to struggle with acquiring the funding required for consolidation. However, other challenges appear to be less prevalent, including challenges in identifying consolidation cost savings and meeting OMB\u0092s deadlines. Overall, 25 challenges that were reported in 2011 were no longer reported in 2012. In light of these successes and challenges, it is important for OMB to continue to provide leadership and guidance, such as\u0097as GAO previously recommended\u0097using the consolidation task force to monitor agencies\u0092 consolidation efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["OMB\u0092s Federal Chief Information Officer should ensure that agencies use a standardized cost model to improve consolidation planning, and the 5 selected agencies should implement recognized best practices when establishing schedules and cost estimates for their consolidation efforts.

In recent years, as federal agencies modernized their  operations, put more of their services online, and increased their  information security profiles, they have demanded more computing power  and data storage resources. Over time, this increasing demand has led to  a dramatic rise in the number of federal data centers and a corresponding  increase in operational costs. The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) has recognized the  significance of this increase and in 2010, launched the Federal Data  Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI), a governmentwide effort to  consolidate data centers. In July 2011, we reported on 24 participating  departments\u2019 and agencies\u2019 (agencies) progress on this effort, noting that  most agencies had not yet completed the data center inventories or  consolidation plans needed to implement their consolidation initiatives.

According to OMB, the federal government had 432 data centers  in 1998; more than 1,100 in 2009; and 2,094 in July 2010. Operating such  a large number of centers places costly demands on the government.  While the total annual federal spending associated with data centers has  not yet been determined, OMB has found that operating data centers is a  significant cost to the federal government, including hardware, software,  real estate, and cooling costs. For example, according to the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the electricity cost to operate  federal servers and data centers across the government is about $450  million annually. According to the Department of Energy (Energy), data  center spaces can consume 100 to 200 times as much electricity as  standard office spaces. Reported server utilization rates as low as 5  percent and limited reuse of these data centers within or across agencies  lends further credence to the need to restructure federal data center  operations to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

By June 2012, create a governmentwide marketplace for data center  availability.", "To accomplish its first goal, OMB required each FDCCI agency to identify  a senior, dedicated data center consolidation program manager. It also  launched a Data Center Consolidation Task Force comprised of the data  center consolidation program managers from each agency. OMB officials  stated that this task force is critical to driving forward on individual agency  consolidation goals and to meeting overall federal consolidation targets.  OMB has also created a publicly available dashboard for observing  agencies\u2019 consolidation progress.", "To accomplish its second goal, OMB and GSA launched a  governmentwide data center availability marketplace in June 2012. This  online marketplace is intended to match agencies that have extra  capacity with agencies with increasing demand, thereby improving the  utilization of existing facilities.

In March 2011, we reported on the status of the FDCCI and  noted that data center consolidation makes sense economically and is a  way to achieve more efficient IT operations, but that challenges exist.  For example, agencies reported facing challenges in ensuring the  accuracy of their inventories and plans, providing upfront funding for the  consolidation effort before any cost savings accrue, integrating  consolidation plans into agency budget submissions (as required by  OMB), establishing and implementing shared standards (for storage,  systems, security, etc.), overcoming cultural resistance to such major  organizational changes, and maintaining current operations during the  transition to consolidated operations. We further reported that mitigating  these and other challenges will require commitment from the agencies  and continued oversight by OMB and the Federal CIO.", "In July 2011, we reported that agency consolidation plans indicate that  agencies anticipated closing about 650 data centers by fiscal year 2015  and saving about $700 million in doing so. However, we also found that  only one of the 24 agencies submitted a complete inventory and no  agency submitted complete plans. Further, OMB did not require agencies  to document the steps they took, if any, to verify the inventory data. We  noted the importance of having assurance as to the accuracy of collected  data and specifically, the need for agencies to provide OMB with  complete and accurate data and the possible negative impact of that data  being missing or incomplete. We concluded that until these inventories  and plans are complete, agencies may not be able to implement their  consolidation activities and realize expected cost savings. Moreover,  without an understanding of the validity of agencies\u2019 consolidation data,  OMB could not be assured that agencies are providing a sound baseline  for estimating consolidation savings and measuring progress against  those goals. Accordingly, we made several recommendations to OMB,  including that the Federal CIO require that agencies, when updating their  data center inventories, state what actions have been taken to verify the  inventories and to identify any associated limitations on the data. We also  recommended that the Federal CIO require that agencies complete the  missing elements in their consolidation plans and in doing so, consider  consolidation challenges and lessons learned. We also made  recommendations to the heads of agencies to complete the information  missing from their inventories and plans.", "In response to our recommendations, OMB took several actions.  Beginning in fiscal year 2011, in addition to the updated inventories due  at the end of every third fiscal quarter, agencies are required to submit an  updated consolidation plan by the end of every fourth fiscal quarter. Along  with the updated plan, agencies are required to submit a signed letter  from their CIOs, attesting to the completeness of the plan, stating what  actions were taken to verify the inventory, and noting any limitations of  inventory or plan data. The inclusion of this performance information will  continue to be important to OMB as it makes decisions on how best to  oversee the ongoing federal data center consolidations. By gathering this  understanding of the validity and limitation on agencies\u2019 data, OMB will be  better assured that agencies are providing a sound baseline for  estimating savings and accurately reporting progress against their goals.  The extent to which agencies have completed information missing from  their inventories and plans is discussed in the following section.", "More recently, in February 2012, we updated our March 2011 work and  reported that although OMB had taken steps to ensure the completion of  agencies\u2019 consolidation plans, a preliminary analysis indicated that not all  plans were complete. Also, in April 2012, we reported on the progress  OMB and federal agencies made in implementing the IT Reform Plan,  including one action item associated with data center consolidation.

Instead, the  Federal CIO and OMB relied on more informal means, such as the  FDCCI task force meetings, to disseminate the new guidance. Although  the task force serves as an important communications conduit for FDCCI,  the confusion we identified among agencies on which template to use  demonstrates that the task force was not effective as the sole means of  communication with the agencies.

State  and NRC were rated as providing partial forecasts because they both  provide incomplete savings and utilization forecasts. Some agencies  identified reasons for not having completed these forecasts.  Specifically, a Department of the Interior (Interior) official told us that it  was not cost effective to gather the missing information, so it was not  included. Officials from other agencies, such as Labor and NRC, told  us of data quality problems or that their data centers lacked the ability  to gather the required information. Further, a HUD official stated that  the department did not have any quantitative goals because their  consolidation effort was completed in 2005.", "Qualitative impacts. All 24 agencies fully describe the qualitative  impacts of their consolidation initiatives.

Additionally, State\u2019s plan details how the  department will consolidate all domestic data centers into four  enterprise data centers. Additionally, a HUD official stated that this  element was not applicable because the department\u2019s consolidation  effort was completed in 2005.", "Scope of consolidation. Twenty-two agencies\u2019 plans include a well- defined scope for data center consolidation, 1 provides partial  information on the scope of their consolidation efforts, and 1 does not  provide this information. Specifically, the agencies that provide this  information list the data centers included in the consolidation effort  and what consolidation approach will be taken for each center. For  example, EPA lists the 25 facilities for which either the servers will be  moved or the site will be decommissioned. Similarly, Justice lists the  36 centers that will be either consolidated or decommissioned.  However, Labor only partially addresses consolidation scope because  it only provides information on about half of its data centers.  According to an agency official, the centers that have been addressed  constitute the bulk of the agency\u2019s computing power, but that the  remaining facilities will be addressed in a later phase of the  consolidation effort, the timing for which has not yet been determined.  Additionally, Defense has not defined its consolidation scope. A  Defense consolidation program official stated that the department was  still working to better understand the full inventory for all departmental  components.", "High-level timeline. Twenty-two agencies include a high-level  timeline for consolidation efforts, 1 agency includes partial information  on its timeline, and 1 does not provide a timeline. For example,  Justice and EPA both provide the year for which action will be taken  on their centers to be consolidated and NRC lists the years its three  centers will be consolidated before they are replaced by NRC\u2019s new  data center. In contrast, Labor provides a timeline for about half of its  data centers, and Defense does not provide a timeline because it has  not fully defined the scope of its consolidation effort.", "Performance metrics. Eighteen agencies identify specific  performance metrics for their consolidation programs, 1 agency  provides partial information on its metrics, 4 agencies do not identify  specific metrics, and an official from 1 agency said that this element  did not apply. Specifically, Agriculture\u2019s plan defines several key  performance indicators such as the numbers of applications moved  and physical servers eliminated. Additionally, several agencies, such  as Commerce, Defense, and NSF, provide consolidation performance  metrics based on quantitative savings and utilization goals. As an  example of an agency with partial metrics, Education identifies metrics  based on its savings goals, but is missing information on its progress  in meeting utilization goals. Additionally, DHS and NRC do not identify  any performance metrics. Officials from both DHS and NRC agreed  that their agencies did not have such measures when their plans were  published, but noted that the required metrics had since been  developed or that they now have the resources to develop them.  Further, a HUD official stated that this element was not applicable  because the department\u2019s consolidation effort was completed in 2005.", "Master program schedule. Nine agencies reference a completed  master program schedule, 13 agencies do not reference such a  schedule, and officials from 2 agencies said that this element did not  apply. For example, HHS, VA, and GSA discuss their master program  schedules, but other agencies, such as State and EPA do not  reference schedules in their plans. State officials noted that the  department has a schedule, but that it was not included in their  consolidation plan due to a miscommunication. They stated that it  would be included in their next plan update. Some agencies, such as  Defense and Labor, are working to develop their schedules or will  develop them in the future. A Defense official told us that the  department has drafted a combined data center consolidation and  cloud computing master schedule that is expected to be approved by  the end of September 2012. Officials from Energy told us that their  consolidation schedule existed, but that it was part of a larger  departmental effort and did not provide detail down to the individual  data center level. Officials from OPM questioned the utility of a master  program schedule for relatively limited consolidation efforts. Two  agencies reported that this requirement was not applicable to their  situation. Specifically, officials from Education stated that this  requirement was not applicable because of the small scale of their  agency\u2019s consolidation efforts. Additionally, a HUD official stated that  this element was not applicable because the department\u2019s  consolidation effort was completed in 2005.", "Cost-benefit analysis. Five agencies provide results from a complete  cost-benefit analysis that encompasses their entire consolidation  initiative, 10 agencies provide only selected elements of a cost-benefit  analysis, and 7 agencies do not provide a cost-benefit analysis. This  element did not apply to 2 agencies. For example, Commerce details  full annualized cost and savings estimates through fiscal year 2015,  while other agencies, such as HHS and Interior provide only partial  information. Specifically, HHS addresses projected savings, but not  costs, and Interior acknowledges that an analysis has not yet been  completed. Some agencies, such as Defense and Energy, plan to  complete a cost-benefit analysis in the future. Officials from  Transportation told us that the department was working on a new  cost-benefit analysis, as the department no longer felt comfortable  with their original savings projections. An Education official noted that  the department\u2019s consolidation did not cost anything and that although  data will be moved out of the department\u2019s one server room to be  consolidated by the end of 2012, the facility would still operate as a  network center. Additionally, a HUD official stated that this element  was not applicable because the department\u2019s consolidation effort was  completed in 2005.", "Risk management plan. Eighteen agencies reference a  consolidation risk management plan and require that risks be tracked,  4 agencies partially address risk management, and 2 agencies do not  address risk management. For example, DHS describes its Data  Center Services Project Risk Management Plan, including how risks  are identified, assessed, and mitigated throughout the development  life cycle. Additionally, Transportation addresses how its risk  management plan identifies and tracks risks in three categories:  people, process, and technology and administration. In contrast,  agencies such as Energy and Interior are rated as partial because  they are continuing to develop their risk management processes. An  Interior official told us that the department\u2019s plan is scheduled to be  completed by June 2012. Officials from both OPM and SBA  acknowledged that their consolidation plans did not address a risk  management plan, but noted that risk was either being managed as  part of individual projects or within a larger context within their  respective organizations.", "Communications plan. Twenty-two agencies consider a  communications plan for the agencies\u2019 consolidation initiatives, 1  agency does so partially, and 1 agency does not. For example, HHS  describes a series of organizational responsibilities for gathering and  reporting project information, as well as communicating with other  departmental stakeholders. Additionally, GSA describes how its  communications approach ensures that stakeholders both within and  outside of the agency are kept informed as to consolidation progress.  The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) partially addresses its  communications plan, noting that it is maintained as part of a larger  departmental effort. OPM makes no such reference. Further, an  official from OPM told us that a communications plan was not as  critical for a small agency.", "Inventory and plan verification. Fifteen agencies fully describe the  steps taken to ensure that inventories and plans were complete and  accurate, and 9 agencies partially do so. For example, State  describes how information was gathered and validated, addresses  several limitations, and attests to the documents\u2019 completeness.  Additionally, EPA describes how information was validated, describes  limitations on inventory data, and attests to the currency of the  agency\u2019s plans. However, other agencies, such as Agriculture, HUD,  and SSA are rated as having partially completed this element  because they note that information was validated, but do not address  data limitations or the completeness of both the inventory and plan. A  HUD official told us that the department was unaware of this  requirement and agreed to consider what could be said in the next  plan update. An SSA official acknowledged that this information was  meant to be included, but was inadvertently omitted.", "Consolidation progress. Eleven agencies fully report on progress  meeting consolidation goals, 11 agencies do so partially, and this  element does not apply to 2 agencies. Specifically, Justice addresses  progress against consolidation goals, discusses consolidation  challenges, and references consolidation successes, such as  integrating lessons learned from other organizations. VA similarly  describes progress against goals and challenges, and also notes the  department\u2019s reliance on commercial and public best practices while  updating its consolidation plan. However, both Education and NASA  are rated as partially completing this element because they discuss  progress against goals, but do not present specific successes or  challenges. A NASA official agreed that this information was not  included, but stated that the agency was aware of situations that  addressed both categories of information. Additionally, a HUD official  stated that this element was not applicable because the department\u2019s  consolidation effort was completed in 2005. OPM officials stated that  the agency followed OMB\u2019s original guidance when completing their  updated consolidation plan, which did not include a requirement for  reporting on consolidation progress.", "Cost savings. Only 1 agency fully reports on consolidation cost  savings, while 13 agencies do so partially, and 8 do not. This element  does not apply to two other agencies. Specifically, Commerce  discusses net savings, future savings, budgetary impacts, and that the  consolidation effort did not incur any unexpected costs. In contrast,  HHS and Justice address net and future savings, but not budgetary  impacts or unexpected costs. Additionally, other agencies do not  include this information for various reasons. Notably, a Defense  official told us that it was challenging to gather savings information  from all the department\u2019s components. An NSF official told us the  information was not included because the agency had not yet realized  any cost savings and so, had nothing to report. However, the agency  expected to have more to report in the future. Additionally, a HUD  official stated that this element was not applicable because the  department\u2019s consolidation effort was completed in 2005. Further, as  with reporting on consolidation progress, OPM officials stated that  they followed OMB\u2019s original guidance, which did not include a  requirement relating to cost savings.", "In the continued absence of completed consolidation plans, agencies are  at risk of implementing their respective initiatives without a clear  understanding of their current state and proposed end state. For example,  OMB intends for agencies\u2019 master program schedules to provide an  agencywide plan drawn from detailed implementation schedules for each  data center. However, only nine agencies have fully completed this  activity. Further, OMB intends agencies\u2019 cost-benefit analyses to assess  planned investments and cost savings calculations on a year-by-year  basis, thus capturing realistic estimates of funding needed or savings  realized from the closing of facilities and associated reduction in energy  use. Nonetheless, only five agencies have completed such a study.  Without completing this information, agencies may not realize anticipated  cost savings, improved infrastructure utilization, or energy efficiency.

A credible cost-benefit analysis, which is one type of cost  estimate, is a key tool for management to use in making informed  decisions and includes information such as relative benefits and the effect  and value of cost trade-offs. However, of five agencies (Agriculture, DHS,  Interior, Transportation, and VA) selected for further analysis, none had a  schedule or cost estimate that was fully consistent with best practices. Of  the five agencies, two did not have schedules at all and one agency had  previously completed a cost estimate but no longer had confidence in  those calculations and therefore, planned to do a new cost-benefit  analysis.

A schedule also  provides a time sequence for the duration of a program\u2019s activities and  furthers an understanding of both the dates for major milestones and the  activities that drive the schedule. Our research has identified four select  attributes of properly sequenced schedule activities that are essential for  a reliable schedule network. Table 6 provides a detailed description of  these attributes.", "Of the five agencies selected, three agencies (Agriculture, VA, and DHS)  provided their consolidation master program schedules and two agencies  (Interior and Transportation) did not provide a master program schedule  that we could evaluate. Of the three agencies that provided schedules,  Agriculture and VA provided a single master schedule and DHS provided  4 schedules representing different aspects of the department\u2019s future  consolidation plans. However, none of these agencies\u2019 schedules is fully  compliant with the four attributes, although each agency was at least  partially consistent with these practices.

Three of DHS\u2019s schedules include summary links, as  does VA\u2019s schedule.", "Department officials gave a variety of reasons why their respective  department did not provide documentation of a completed master  program schedule:", "An Agriculture official told us that the department had a detailed  schedule for every individual closure, but that because those projects  are not necessarily linked to one another, there was no need to link  these activities in a master schedule. However, leading practices  demonstrate that even a summary master schedule should be a roll- up of lower-level schedules and reflect milestones that are  automatically calculated through the established network logic  between planned activities. A schedule with proper logic can predict  impacts on the project\u2019s planned finish date of, among other things,  misallocated resources, delayed activities, external events, scope  changes, and unrealistic deadlines.", "DHS\u2019s consolidation program manager stated that the department  provided separate schedules because schedules are developed for  individual facilities when placed under contract for closure. However,  leading practices show that a program schedule should include the  entire required scope of effort, including the effort necessary from all  government, contractors, and other key parties for a program\u2019s  successful execution from start to finish. The DHS consolidation  program manager acknowledged that the schedules in question were  developed by contractors and that the department plans to  incorporate the suggested best practices as appropriate.", "A VA official told us that because some of the tasks in the  department\u2019s schedule are expected to start on particular dates to  ensure funding is available for the project task, they do not have  predecessor tasks. While this can be a permissible step when the  schedule constraints are clearly identified, the VA official was able to  provide some, but not all, of those constraints. The VA official further  told us that unnecessary tasks and constraints have since been  removed from the department\u2019s schedule.", "Interior officials stated that the department\u2019s master program schedule  was not yet complete.", "Transportation\u2019s consolidation program manager stated that the  department does not have a master program schedule dedicated to  the FDCCI.

Without such estimates,  agencies are at risk of experiencing cost overruns, missed deadlines, and  performance shortfalls. Our research has identified a number of best  practices that are the basis of effective program cost estimating and  should result in reliable and valid cost estimates that management can  use for making informed decisions. Table 8 provides a detailed  description of the four characteristics of a high-quality and reliable cost  estimate.", "Of the five agencies selected, four (Agriculture, DHS, Interior, and VA)  provided supporting documentation used to calculate the cost estimates  found in the agencies\u2019 consolidation plans and one (Transportation) did  not. Transportation officials explained that they were no longer confident  in their prior estimates and they planned to undertake a new cost-benefit  analysis in 2012. None of the four agencies\u2019 estimates was fully compliant  with best practices, although all of the estimates were at least minimally  consistent with these practices.

A discussion of the analysis of each characteristic follows the table.", "Comprehensive. None of the estimates are fully consistent with this  practice, although all four estimates satisfy about half of the criterion  for this practice. For example, Agriculture includes most related costs  and estimate assumptions, but does not include a work breakdown  structure. Similarly, Interior includes most related costs and estimate  assumptions, but also does not include a work breakdown structure.", "Well-documented. None of the estimates fully satisfy this practice.  Specifically, one estimate satisfies most, but not all, of the practice,  one estimate satisfies about half of the criterion for the practice, and  two estimates satisfy a few of the criterion for the practice. For  example, Interior documents its technical baseline but does not fully  document how the estimate was developed. VA describes how its  calculations were performed and discusses the estimate\u2019s technical  baseline, but satisfied only half of the criteria describing how the  estimate was performed.", "Accurate. None of the estimates fully satisfied this practice. One  estimate satisfied about half of the practice and three estimates  satisfied some of the practice. For example, Agriculture\u2019s estimate is  partially based on historical estimates, but has not been updated  since March 2009. Additionally, while DHS updated its estimate in  July 2011, it did not adjust for inflation or document variations  between planned and actual costs.", "Credible. None of the estimates fully satisfied this practice. One  estimate satisfied about half the practice and three estimates satisfied  some of the practice. For example, DHS addressed some aspects of  a risk and uncertainty analysis, but did not conduct an estimate  sensitivity analysis. Conversely, VA addressed some aspects of an  estimate sensitivity analysis, but did not conduct a risk and uncertainty  analysis. Neither agency conducted an independent cost estimate.", "Agency officials gave a variety of reasons for why their cost estimates  were not complete. For example, the Agriculture CIO indicated that the  department\u2019s estimate was performed several years ago by a contractor  and additional documentation was difficult to acquire. Additionally,  Interior\u2019s consolidation program manager stated that the department was  in the process of revising its cost estimate using OMB\u2019s cost model, but  the effort was not yet complete. Further, Interior\u2019s consolidation plan  describes several efforts to estimate costs that the department ultimately  did not include in their plan and indicates that the department will address  this in a future deliverable. In May 2012, Interior officials stated that they  recently provided this information to OMB. VA officials stated that they did  not provide previous cost estimate documentation because the  department expected to revise its cost estimate using new information  regarding cost assumptions and that this information would affect life- cycle cost estimates. The DHS consolidation program manager noted that  the department is now taking a different approach towards cost estimates  through the use of enterprisewide contracts. Regarding Transportation,  although it reported FDCCI-related estimated savings of over $26 million  in its 2010 plan, the department\u2019s updated consolidation plan states that  the original cost estimates were no longer relevant and the department is  in the process of conducting a new estimating effort that was not  completed in time for the plan\u2019s submission. Further, in March 2012, a  department official confirmed that Transportation no longer felt  comfortable with the original savings estimate and that planned cost  savings were being reevaluated. The official further stated the department  intends to complete a new cost-benefit analysis.", "Between the five agencies that we reviewed, there are plans to  consolidate 375 data centers of all sizes. In the absence of reliable cost  estimates, these five agencies are exposed to the types of risks that we  have reported to be recurring problems in our program reviews\u2014namely  cost overruns, missed deadlines, and performance shortfalls. Because of  the importance of a high-quality cost estimate to consolidation efforts as  significant as these, it will be important for these agencies to work to  improve their cost estimates, thus providing information on which  management can make well-informed decisions as the agencies move  towards their 2015 targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Developed a Model to Help Agencies Plan Consolidations, but Does Not Require Its Use", "paragraphs": ["To assist agencies in their data center consolidation efforts, the FDCCI  Data Center Consolidation Task Force developed a standard Total Cost  of Ownership (TCO) model in order to provide a comprehensive tool to  help to inform consolidation decision making, model consolidation paths,  and assist with the development of cost savings figures and funding  needs. OMB provided the model to agencies for voluntary use starting in  January 2012, noting that it is intended to provide a uniform and  consistent method to derive agency cost savings figures and a modeling  and simulation tool to inform consolidation decisions.", "At a high level, agencies load their raw agency inventory data into the  spreadsheet-based model to develop three outputs: an \u201cas is\u201d view of current costs; a 5-year projection of costs based on maintaining current equipment  and facilities at current growth rates; and a 5-year projection of costs, including equipment and facilities counts,  based on the agency\u2019s planned data center closure and efficiency  targets.", "The model relies on a number of built-in assumptions\u2014based on best  practices in the public and private sectors and grouped into categories  such as facilities, hardware, and software\u2014to provide its outputs. The  model also recognizes some limitations, such as an inability to capture  costing data for individual facilities and an inability to recognize individual  costs for hardware and software. To compensate, the model applies  universal values for such information, while recognizing the inaccuracies  this may cause in some costing elements. The model further allows  agencies to adjust specific variables to input costs that are atypical or not  already anticipated by the model. According to an official from the GSA  program management office that maintains the cost model, while not  intended to capture comprehensive program costs, the model does  provide agencies with the ability to customize the input information to  make it as comprehensive as they need it to be. As a result, agencies  could use this tool to provide more consistent and reliable cost estimates.  Moreover, the model provides standardized cost calculations, adjustment  for inflation, and a scenario-analysis tool that agencies can use to analyze  alternatives and develop plans. Thus, it can be used as a tool to help  agencies improve their consolidation planning.", "Officials from several agencies told us that they plan to use the TCO  model in future cost estimating efforts. For example, a Transportation  official told us that the department intends to use the model as it  recalculates its cost-benefit estimate. Additionally, the Interior  consolidation program manager stated that the department planned to  use the model to determine power estimates. Officials from other  agencies, such as SSA and EPA, told us that the model was being  considered for future use.", "Use of the TCO model could provide more consistent and reliable cost  estimates, but using the model is currently voluntary. In light of the  limitations identified above in our review of the five agencies\u2019 cost  estimates, the deployment of a standardized tool for planning  consolidation efforts could help ensure that agencies develop consistent  and uniform projections.

Cloud computing is an emerging  form of computing that relies on Internet-based services and resources to  provide computing services to customers, while freeing them from the  burden and costs of maintaining the underlying infrastructure. OMB  suggests both technologies as agency approaches, along with  decommissioning and consolidation. Nine agencies reported that focusing  on virtualization and cloud computing have proven successful for their  consolidation efforts.", "The Interior consolidation program manager cited virtualization as the  department\u2019s greatest consolidation success, noting the efforts of the  department\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs as an example. Specifically, Interior  has documented virtualization as a key enabler in the efforts of the  bureau to close data centers. After closing 11 data centers in fiscal year  2011, the bureau turned its attention to remote sites with more than three  servers. Through virtualization, the bureau was able to reduce all remote  sites to either one or two physical servers. Additionally, on a site-by-site  basis, other application and database servers were either virtualized or  migrated to one of two primary bureau data centers. In doing so, the  bureau\u2019s virtualization effort reportedly produced over $114,000 in cost  avoidance savings for fiscal year 2011, is expected to produce over  $66,000 in savings for fiscal year 2012, and is planned to produce further  savings of $66,000 annually. Table 11 details reductions and savings that  the bureau has already realized and plans for the future.", "Other agencies also reported virtualization as a key factor in being able to  realize resource reductions. For example, EPA officials told us that the  agency was using virtualization to optimize their IT infrastructure. In 2011,  the agency virtualized over 360 servers, increasing the agency\u2019s  virtualization by 6 percent. In 2012, the agency plans to consolidate and  virtualize email hosting services, allowing the agency to decommission 14  percent (or over 300) of its physical servers, and migrate the agency\u2019s  email gateways to cloud services. In one EPA facility, the agency will  migrate over 100 servers from eight server rooms to one primary data  center. Additionally, NRC reports that it used virtualization to exceed its  2011 goals for Windows server reductions. Specifically, the agency was  able to exceed its goal of reducing 13 servers and actually reduced 33  physical servers, a reduction of more than 10 percent from its baseline of  288 servers. Further, OPM officials reported that within 15 months, the  agency was able to increase the virtualization of its Windows servers from  15 percent to 50 percent, resulting in cost savings for the agency.", "Other agencies reported on the less tangible, but still significant,  importance of virtualization to their efforts. An Education official told us  that the department\u2019s biggest success has come from focusing on  virtualization, rather than physical consolidation. DHS reported that the  increased implementation of virtualization will reduce the overall costs of  the department\u2019s migration and postmigration operations. Further, officials  from Labor told us that they expect virtualization to have an impact on the  results of their consolidation, but that they had not yet documented any of  those results.", "Officials from three agencies also shared with us the advantages of  moving their organizations to cloud services. Specifically, a DHS official  told us that the department\u2019s cloud services technology was becoming  operational and as a result, costs savings were becoming evident versus  traditional consolidation. Whereas 2 years ago, the department had  nothing in the cloud, a large percentage of services were now moving in  that direction. The official specifically noted a DHS component that was  originally only going to move to its own physical infrastructure, but was  now joining with other components because of the benefits of moving  services to the cloud. A HUD official stated that the department\u2019s  successes were related to higher efficiency and utilization of computing  and storage resources. Essentially, HUD embarked on a cloud-like  solution\u2014by means of the department\u2019s existing outsourcing contract\u2014 before cloud computing really existed as a service. As a result, the official  noted that the department has been receiving a number of benefits such  as green IT, regular technology refreshes, and high utilization of  resources. A second HUD official noted that the department has been  rated across the government as having the third-highest computing  utilization and the second-most efficient use of storage capacity. Further,  and as mentioned earlier, an EPA official noted that the migration of  EPA\u2019s email gateways to cloud services will enable the agency to  decommission 14 percent (over 300) of the agency\u2019s physical servers.", "Eight agencies reported consolidation successes that had been realized  through agencies working together, both within and outside of their  department, to identify consolidation opportunities. For example, several  of the agencies that reported success with virtualization, as discussed  earlier, also reported working with other departmental components as a  key enabler of resulting savings. Specifically, Interior reported that as part  of the department\u2019s closing of 11 Bureau of Indian Affairs data centers in  fiscal year 2011, two facilities were consolidated with other Interior  bureaus, resulting in a reduction of 43 of the bureau\u2019s 65 servers and  producing immediate cost avoidance savings of over $114,000. Defense  noted the willingness of its components to adopt the departmental  strategy of first looking to the Defense Information Systems Agency for  application and data hosting before pursuing any other options. Further, a  SBA official told us that one success from the consolidation effort was  that agencies have been looking for ways to work together. Specifically,  the official cited the SBA\u2019s effort to reach out to another agency in order  to craft an interagency agreement to work together and move part of their  operations into the hosting agency\u2019s systems. A second agency official  noted that because of this, the hosting agency has contacted SBA to  make sure that it included SBA\u2019s needs in its planning and requests.  Additionally, a DHS official told us that departmental components were  joining together to move services to the cloud.", "There were also reported successes in working with external agencies.  For example, VA reported that the department was successful in working  with the Defense Information Systems Agency on an agreement to  consolidate mission critical enterprise IT systems into the agency\u2019s  Defense Enterprise Computing Centers. The department noted that  considerable cost savings could be realized by entering into such an  interagency agreement, as opposed to leasing from a commercial site, for  mission critical health record systems. Additionally, a HHS official  similarly reported that the department\u2019s Indian Health Service, which has  small data centers that cannot close because of communication  difficulties in their locations, recognized that Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian  Affairs had a data center in close proximity to an Indian Health Service  facility. Consequently, the service was able to share space with the  bureau and consolidate one of its data centers and the service is now  looking for similar opportunities that will allow HHS to consolidate further.  Further, Labor officials told us that the department was consolidating  small server rooms in regional offices to co-located facilities and that this  approach was expected to reduce costs.", "The consolidation successes experienced by agencies indicate that  aspects of FDCCI are moving forward as planned. Further, almost half of  these reported accomplishments directly relate to key tenets of OMB\u2019s  plans for the initiative, demonstrating that OMB has developed a  consolidation road map that provides realistic means by which agencies  can achieve their goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Continue to Report Consolidation Challenges, but the Types of Challenges Are Evolving", "paragraphs": ["In 2011, we reported on the challenges that agencies were facing during  data center consolidations. These included challenges related to FDCCI  as well as those that were cultural, funding related, operational, and  technical. In 2012, agencies have continued to report many of the same  challenges, have reported new challenges, and have stopped reporting  challenges they previously identified. As we found in 2011, some  challenges are more common than others. Specifically, the number of  agencies reporting a particular challenge range from 15 to 1. Additionally,  25 challenges reported in 2011 were not reported in 2012. Two agencies,  HUD and NSF, did not report any challenges. Table 12 details the  reported challenges, the numbers of agencies experiencing that  challenge, and identifies the challenges no longer being reported by  agencies. The table is followed by a discussion of the most prevalent  challenges.", "Agencies reported seven challenges that are specific to FDCCI, including  obtaining power usage and providing good quality asset inventories, both  as required by OMB. Specifically, 15 agencies reported that obtaining  power usage information was a challenge, which is less than the 19  agencies that reported this challenge last year. For example, a NASA  official told us that the agency only had one data center (out of 79) that  was fully metered, but that the agency was working to establish metering  capabilities at several more locations. An SBA official told us that the  agency was still working to complete a power audit, but that it was  questionable whether such an audit would be worth the amount of work  required to install separate power meters in leased facilities. A USAID  official reported that none of the agency\u2019s facilities were metered and that  the agency was not a landlord for any of its facilities, making power  information difficult to obtain. Further, 10 agencies reported that providing  good quality inventories was a challenge, which is more than the 4  agencies that reported this challenge last year. For example, an EPA  official told us that the agency had trouble determining cost information  for its server rooms because most were facilities within office spaces and  which were part of larger federal leases or within GSA buildings. As a  result, EPA focused their efforts on facilities greater than 500 square feet.  Additionally, a Defense official reported that that gathering and verifying  inventory information for an organization the size of the department was  challenging.", "Agencies reported three cultural challenges to data center consolidation,  including accepting cultural change that is part of consolidation and  obtaining enterprise buy-in to the consolidation effort. One of the most  prevalently reported cultural challenges, accepting cultural change, was  cited by 5 agencies, which is 10 fewer agencies than last year. For  example, Energy found that there was a perceived need for each facility  or departmental organization to have \u201cownership\u201d of their own data  centers and server rooms in order to support their business or mission  needs. Justice recognized that moving from the department\u2019s current  environment to a more unified, standardized, and cost-efficient approach  for providing data center services requires change and consequently,  efforts were underway to drive more significant consolidation. Another  commonly reported cultural challenge was obtaining enterprise buy-in to  the consolidation effort, which was reported by 5 agencies\u2014an increase  from the single agency that reported this last year. For example, DHS  reported their consolidation effort to be a multistakeholder operation that  required immense amounts of coordination and found that delays and  issues arose when various stakeholders maintained differing visions,  expectations, and commitment to the effort. Further, NRC reported that  one of its main challenges was managing the level of coordination  required by the number of internal and external entities involved in  planning and the related activities that need to happen simultaneously.", "Agencies reported two funding challenges: acquiring the funding needed  for consolidation and identifying cost savings to be realized by  consolidation. Nine agencies reported challenges with acquiring funding,  which is slightly fewer than the 11 agencies that reported this challenge  last year. For example, Energy reported that the department had little or  no funding available to invest in data center measurement systems,  server utilizations assessments, or consolidation projects. Additionally,  both Justice and Transportation reported challenges in providing upfront  funding for consolidation efforts before cost savings accrue. Two  agencies reported challenges with identifying cost savings, a decrease  from the 9 agencies that reported this challenge last year. For example,  an Interior official noted that the department would likely not be able to  report on savings for 2011 because most bureaus absorbed the cost of  consolidation within their budgets. Although site-specific plans were  required by the department, most did not address costs. Additionally, an  SSA official noted that the agency currently had too many uncertainties  surrounding its consolidation effort to perform a cost-benefit analysis.", "Agencies reported eight operational challenges, including difficulties with  procurement and technology and resource constraints, neither of which  had been reported in 2011. Three agencies encountered challenges with  procurement, including DHS, which had to create a team to streamline  projects through the department\u2019s procurement process. GSA reported  encountering construction contracting challenges on all three of the  agency\u2019s calendar year 2011 data center consolidations. These contract  challenges included: vendors that could not meet award schedules,  nonresponsive vendors, and long lead times for some IT equipment. To  counter such delays, GSA increased the time allotted for planned  contracting efforts and vendor delivery schedules. Additionally, two  agencies reported challenges with technology and resource constraints.  Specifically, EPA reported encountering minor delays in consolidation  plan execution due to such constraints and NRC reported another of its  main challenges to consolidation being available resources and the  impact on its critical path to consolidation, which is the timely completion  of the agency\u2019s new headquarters building.", "Agencies reported only one technical challenge to consolidation, planning  a migration strategy. Specifically, this was reported by seven agencies,  an increase from the two agencies that reported this in 2011. For  example, Transportation\u2019s consolidation plan notes that in the  department\u2019s organization, it is a long process to identify possible  consolidations, present them to management, then to users, and then  work the technical side of migrations. Transportation\u2019s plan also noted  that application mapping is a very difficult and time-consuming activity,  but cannot be skipped in a successful completion of a migration. Further,  an Education official told us that the department had to develop a two- step approach for migrating files after encountering technical issues with  an earlier migration effort. Finally, Commerce reported in its consolidation  plan that detailed consolidation planning was critical due to the number of  moving parts and potential impact on applications and customers.", "As we have previously reported, one approach agencies can use to  manage challenges such as the ones described above is through risk  management processes. In 2011, we reported that less than half of the  agencies included a discussion of risk management in their data center  consolidation plans. As we stated earlier, 18 of the agencies, or 75  percent, now fully address risk management. By addressing consolidation  risk, agencies have better positioned themselves to manage the  challenges they have identified.", "In any significant IT initiative, it is important that both successes and  challenges be highlighted. In the case of FDCCI, a success highlights  approaches and strategies that are helping agencies to meet their  consolidation targets and fulfill the intent of the initiative. Conversely, a  challenge identifies an area where agencies are struggling to meet the  requirements and intent of this governmentwide effort. The two most  reported consolidation successes are both key tenets of OMB\u2019s FDCCI:  the use of virtualization and cloud services, and working with other  agencies to find consolidation opportunities. Alternately, the three most  reported challenges directly impact the ability of FDCCI to meet its goals:  gathering power usage information, developing good quality data center  inventories, and acquiring the funding needed for consolidation. In light of  how closely the successes and challenges reported by agencies relate to  FDCCI, it will be important for OMB to continue to provide leadership and  guidance to the initiative. This includes, as we have previously  recommended, utilizing the existing accountability infrastructure of the  Data Center Consolidation Task Force to assess agency consolidation  plans to ensure they are complete and to monitor the agencies\u2019  implementation of their plans."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With agencies reporting having closed 286 data centers by the end of  2011 and planning to close an additional 346 centers by the end of 2012,  the data center consolidation initiative is expected to realize about $2.4  billion in cost savings through 2015. OMB now requires agencies to  annually update both their data center inventories and their consolidation  plans and has expanded the required content of both. However, agencies\u2019  consolidation and savings goals continue to be built on incomplete  inventories and plans. To better ensure that FDCCI improves  governmental efficiency and achieves promised cost savings, we are  reiterating our prior recommendation to the department secretaries and  agency heads of the 24 departments and agencies participating in the  federal data center consolidation initiative to fully complete their  consolidation inventories and plans expeditiously.", "As OMB refines its approach to the data center consolidation initiative, it  provides updated guidance to agencies. However, three agencies did not  learn of the most recent changes in OMB\u2019s required formats, in part  because the guidance was provided in meetings and not in a formal letter  from the Federal CIO to agency CIOs or disseminated on the website  where all prior guidance had been disseminated. Until OMB uses more  structured mechanisms to disseminate its guidance, it runs the risk that  agencies will not learn of important changes in format or approach.", "Additionally, basic consolidation plan requirements, such as the need for  schedules and cost estimates, are still unmet by almost 70 percent of the  agencies. Among the five agencies selected for a detailed review, none of  the agencies\u2019 master schedules and estimates were completed in a  manner consistent with best practices. For example, none of the agencies  was able to demonstrate that its cost estimates were accurate, credible,  or comprehensive. OMB\u2019s cost of ownership model should help address a  number of planning concerns. As more agencies use the model, OMB  can use the model to ensure consistent planning and reporting on  consolidation efforts across FDCCI. However, agencies\u2019 use of the model  is still voluntary. Until OMB requires agencies to use the model, it may  miss opportunities to ensure consistency among agencies and it will  remain difficult to summarize projections across agencies.", "As the federal consolidation effort matures, agencies are beginning to  realize successes. These constructive experiences, which stem from  OMB\u2019s recommended consolidation strategies, indicate that FDCCI is  moving in the right direction. However, as agencies work towards their  consolidation goals, many continue to report challenges related to  gathering the necessary technical information and funding the  consolidation itself. While these challenges are consistent with those  reported in the past, over 25 previous challenges were no longer reported  by the agencies. Such a dynamic environment reinforces the need for  agencies to remain in communication in order to facilitate knowledge  sharing and transfer and for OMB to continue to provide leadership and  guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In addition to reiterating our prior recommendation to agencies to  complete the missing elements of their inventories and plans, we are  making two recommendations to OMB.
