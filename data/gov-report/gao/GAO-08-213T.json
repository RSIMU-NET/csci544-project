In response to concerns that large amounts of federal financial assistance were not subject to audit and that agencies sometimes overlapped on oversight activities, Congress passed the Single Audit Act of 1984. The act adopted the single audit concept to help meet the needs of federal agencies for grantee oversight as well as grantees' needs for single, uniformly structured audits. GAO supported the passage of the Single Audit Act, and continues to support the single audit concept and principles behind the act as a key accountability mechanism for federal grant awards. However, the quality of single audits has been a longstanding area of concern since the passage of the act in 1984. In its June 2007 Report on National Single Audit Sampling Project, the PCIE found that, overall, approximately 49 percent of single audits fell into the acceptable group, with the remaining 51 percent having deficiencies severe enough to classify the audits as limited in reliability or unacceptable. PCIE found a significant difference in results by audit size. Specifically, 63.5 percent of the large audits (with $50 million or more in federal award expenditures) were deemed acceptable compared with only 48.2 percent of the smaller audits (with at least $500,000 but less than $50 million in federal award expenditures). The PCIE report presents compelling evidence that a serious problem with single audit quality continues to exist. GAO is concerned that audits are not being conducted in accordance with professional standards and requirements. These audits may provide a false sense of assurance and could mislead users of the single audit reports. The PCIE report recommended a three-pronged approach to reduce the types of deficiencies found and to improve the quality of single audits: (1) revise and improve single audit standards, criteria, and guidance; (2) establish minimum continuing professional education (CPE) as a prerequisite for auditors to be eligible to be able to conduct and continue to perform single audits; and (3) review and enhance the disciplinary processes to address unacceptable audits and for not meeting training and CPE requirements. In this testimony, GAO supports PCIE's recommendations and points out issues that need to be resolved regarding the proposed training and other factors that merit consideration when determining actions to improve audit quality. GAO believes that there may be opportunities for considering size when implementing future actions to improve the effectiveness and quality of single audits. In addition, a separate effort considering the overall framework for single audits could answer such questions as whether simplified alternatives can achieve cost-effective accountability in the smallest audits; whether current federal oversight processes for single audits are adequate; and what role the auditing profession can play in increasing single audit quality."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s analysis of the results of  the Report on National Single Audit Sampling Project recently issued by  the President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE) under the  direction of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). First, I would  like to commend the PCIE for conducting this comprehensive and  important study dealing with the quality of single audits. The single audit is  a key accountability mechanism over the use of federal grants and other  awards. In fiscal year 2007, $449 billion in federal grants was budgeted to  state and local governments. The PCIE report raises significant concerns  about the quality of single audits, and makes recommendations aimed at  improving the effectiveness and efficiency of those audits.", "Today, I will provide (1) GAO\u2019s perspective on the history and importance  of the Single Audit Act and the principles behind the act, (2) our  preliminary analysis of the recommendations made by the PCIE for  improving audit quality, and (3) additional factors for consideration for  improving the quality of single audits. My statement today is based on our  continuing work as the standards setter for generally accepted  government auditing standards (GAGAS) and our related work in the area  of single audits, including ongoing interaction with key stakeholders in the  single audit process and members of the auditing profession providing  single audit services to recipients of federal awards. In addition, this  statement is based on our analysis of the PCIE report, and our discussions  with the PCIE project team, the American Institute of Certified Public  Accountants (AICPA), and OMB."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Evolution of the Single Audit Act and Its Underlying Principles", "paragraphs": ["In the early 1980s, Congress had concerns about a lack of adequate  oversight and accountability for federal assistance provided to state and  local governments. Before passage of the Single Audit Act in 1984 (the  act), the federal government relied on audits of individual grants to help  gain assurance that state and local governments were properly spending  federal assistance. Those audits focused on whether the transactions of  specific grants complied with program requirements. The audits usually  did not address financial controls and were, therefore, unlikely to find  systemic problems with an entity\u2019s fund management. Further, individual  grant audits were conducted on a haphazard schedule, which resulted in  large portions of federal funds being unaudited each year. In addition, the  auditors conducting the individual grant audits did not coordinate their  work with the auditors of other programs. As a result, some entities were  subject to numerous grant audits each year, while others were not audited  for long periods.", "In response to concerns that large amounts of federal financial assistance  were not subject to audit and that agencies sometimes overlapped on  oversight activities, Congress passed the Single Audit Act of 1984. The act  stipulated that state and local governments that received at least $100,000  in federal financial assistance in a fiscal year have a single audit conducted  for that year. The concept of a single audit was created to replace multiple  grant audits with one audit of an entity as a whole. State and local  governments which received between $25,000 and $100,000 in federal  financial assistance had the option of complying with audit requirements  of the act or the audit requirements of the federal program(s) that  provided the assistance. The objectives of the Single Audit Act, as  amended, are to    promote sound financial management, including effective internal control,  with respect to federal awards administered by nonfederal entities;    establish uniform requirements for audits of federal awards administered    promote the efficient and effective use of audit resources;  reduce burdens on state and local governments, Indian tribes, and  nonprofit organizations; and    ensure that federal departments and agencies, to the maximum extent  practicable, rely upon and use audit work done pursuant to the act.", "The Single Audit Act adopted the single audit concept to help meet the  needs of federal agencies for grantee oversight as well as grantees\u2019 needs  for single, uniformly structured audits. Rather than being a detailed review  of individual grants or programs, the single audit is an organizationwide  financial statement audit that includes the audit of the Schedule of  Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) and also focuses on internal  control and the recipient\u2019s compliance with laws and regulations  governing the federal financial assistance received. The act also required  that grantees address material noncompliance and internal control  weaknesses in a corrective action plan, which is to be submitted to  appropriate federal officials. The act further required that single audits be  performed in accordance with GAGAS issued by GAO. These standards  provide a framework for conducting high-quality financial audits with  competence, integrity, objectivity, and independence.", "The Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 refined the Single Audit Act of  1984 and established uniform requirements for all federal grant recipients.  The refinements cover a range of fundamental areas affecting the single  audit process and single audit reporting, including provisions to    extend the law to cover all recipients of federal financial assistance,  including, in particular, nonprofit organizations, hospitals, and  universities;    ensure a more cost-beneficial threshold for requiring single audits;    more broadly focus audit work on the programs that present the greatest  financial risk to the federal government;    provide for timely reporting of audit results;    provide for summary reporting of audit results;    promote better analyses of audit results through establishment of a federal  clearinghouse and an automated database; and    authorize pilot projects to further streamline the audit process and make it  more useful.", "The 1996 amendments required the Director of OMB to designate a  Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) as the single audit repository,  required the recipient entity to submit financial reports and related audit  reports to the clearinghouse no later than 9 months after the recipient\u2019s  year-end, and increased the audit threshold to $300,000. The criteria for  determining which entities are required to have a single audit are based on  the total amount of federal awards expended by the entity. The initial  dollar thresholds were designed to provide adequate audit coverage of  federal funds without placing an undue administrative burden on entities  receiving smaller amounts of federal assistance. When the act was passed,  the dollar threshold criteria for the audit requirement were targeted  toward achieving audit coverage for 95 percent of direct federal assistance  to local governments. As part of OMB\u2019s biennial threshold review required  by the 1996 amendments, OMB increased the dollar threshold for  requirement of a single audit to $500,000 in 2003 for fiscal years ending  after December 31, 2003.", "Federal oversight responsibility for implementation of the Single Audit Act  is currently shared among various entities\u2014OMB, federal agencies, and  their respective Offices of Inspector General (OIG). The Single Audit Act  assigned OMB the responsibility of prescribing policies, procedures, and  guidelines to implement the uniform audit requirements and required each  federal agency to amend its regulations to conform to the requirements of  the act and OMB\u2019s policies, procedures, and guidelines. OMB issued  Circular No. A-133, Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit  Organizations, which sets implementing guidelines for the audit  requirements and defines roles and responsibilities related to the  implementation of the Single Audit Act. The federal agency that awards a  grant to a recipient is responsible for ensuring recipient compliance with  federal laws, regulations, and the provisions of the grant agreements. The  awarding agency is also responsible for overseeing whether the single  audits are completed in a timely manner in accordance with OMB Circular  No. A-133 and for providing annual updates of the Compliance  Supplement to OMB. Some federal agencies rely on the OIG to perform  quality control reviews (QCR) to assess whether single audit work  performed complies with OMB Circular No. A-133 and auditing standards.", "The grant recipient (auditee) is responsible for ensuring that a single audit  is performed and submitted when due, and for following up and taking  corrective action on any audit findings. The auditor of the grant recipient  is required to perform the audit in accordance with GAGAS. A single audit  consists of (1) an audit and opinions on the fair presentation of the  financial statements and the SEFA; (2) gaining an understanding of  internal control over federal programs and testing internal control over  major programs; and (3) an audit and an opinion on compliance with legal,  regulatory, and contractual requirements for major programs. The audit  also includes the auditor\u2019s schedule of findings and questioned costs, and  the auditee\u2019s corrective action plans and a summary of prior audit findings  that includes planned and completed corrective actions. Under GAGAS,  auditors are required to report on significant deficiencies in internal  control and on compliance associated with the audit of the financial  statements.", "Recipients expending more than $50 million in federal funding ($25 million  prior to December 31, 2003) are required to have a cognizant federal  agency for audit in accordance with OMB Circular No. A-133. The  cognizant agency for audit is the federal awarding agency that provides the  predominant amount of direct funding to a recipient unless OMB  otherwise makes a specific cognizant agency assignment. The cognizant  agency for audit provides technical audit advice, considers requests for  extensions to the submission due date for the recipient\u2019s reports, obtains  or conducts QCRs, coordinates management decisions for audit findings,  and conducts other activities required by OMB Circular No. A-133.  According to OMB officials, the FAC single audit database generates a  listing of those agencies that should be designated cognizant agencies for  audit based on information on recipients expending more than $50 million.", "The officials also stated that OMB is responsible for notifying both the  recipient and cognizant agency for audit of the assignment. Federal award  recipients that do not have a cognizant agency for audit are assigned an  oversight agency for audit, which provides technical advice and may  assume some or all of the responsibilities normally performed by a  cognizant agency for audit.", "Federal grant awards to state and local governments have increased  significantly since the Single Audit Act was passed in 1984. Because single  audits represent the federal government\u2019s primary accountability tool over  billions of dollars each year in federal funds provided to state and local  governments and nonprofit organizations, it is important that these audits  are carried out efficiently and effectively. As shown in figure 1, the federal  government\u2019s use of grants to state and local governments has risen  substantially, from $7 billion in 1960 to almost $450 billion budgeted in  2007.", "GAO supported the passage of the Single Audit Act, and we continue to  support the single audit concept and principles behind the act as a key  accountability mechanism over federal grant awards. However, the quality  of single audits conducted under this legislation has been a longstanding  area of concern since the passage of the Single Audit Act in 1984. During  the 1980s, GAO issued reports that identified concerns with single audit  quality, including issues with insufficient evidence related to audit  planning, internal control and compliance testing, and the auditors\u2019  adherence to GAGAS. The federal Inspectors General as well have found  similar problems with single audit quality. The deficiencies we cited during  the 1980s were similar in nature to those identified in the recent PCIE  report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of PCIE Report Identify Serious Single Audit Quality Issues", "paragraphs": ["In June 2002, GAO and OMB testified at a House of Representatives  hearing about the importance of single audits and their quality. In its  testimony, OMB identified reviews of single audit quality performed by  several federal agencies that disclosed deficiencies. However, OMB  emphasized that an accurate statistically based measure of audit quality  was needed, and should include both a baseline of the current status and  the means to monitor quality in the future. We also recognized in our  testimony the need for a solution or approach to evaluate the overall  quality of single audits.", "To gain a better understanding of the extent of single audit quality  deficiencies, OMB and several federal OIGs decided to work together to  develop a statistically based measure of audit quality, known as the  National Single Audit Sampling Project. The work was conducted by a  committee of representatives from the PCIE, the Executive Council on  Integrity and Efficiency (ECIE), and three State Auditors, with the work  effort coordinated by the U.S. Department of Education OIG. The Project  had two primary objectives:  to determine the quality of single audits by performing QCRs of a  statistical sample of single audits, and  to make recommendations to address any audit quality issues noted.", "The project conducted QCRs of a statistical sample of 208 audits randomly  selected from a universe of over 38,000 audits submitted and accepted for  the period April 1, 2003, through March 31, 2004. The sample was split into  two strata:    Stratum 1: entities with $50 million or more in federal award expenditures,    Stratum 2: entities with less than $50 million in federal award expenditures  (with at least $500,000).", "The above split in the sample strata corresponds with the current  threshold for designating a cognizant agency, which is for entities that  expend more than $50 million in a year in federal awards. Table 1 shows  the universe and strata used in the analysis and the reviews completed in  the National Single Audit Sampling Project.", "The project covered portions of the single audit relating to the planning,  conducting, and reporting of audit work related to (1) the review and  testing of internal control and (2) compliance testing pertaining to  compliance requirements for selected major federal programs. The scope  of the project included review of audit work related to the SEFA and the  content of all of the auditors\u2019 reports on the federal programs. The project  did not review the audit work and reporting related to the general purpose  financial statements.", "The PCIE project team categorized the audits based on the results of the  QCRs into the following three groups:    Acceptable\u2014No deficiencies were noted or one or two insignificant  deficiencies were noted. This group also includes the subgroup, Accepted  with Deficiencies, which is defined as one or more deficiencies with  applicable auditing criteria noted that do not require corrective action for  the engagement, but should be corrected on future engagements. Audits  categorized into this subgroup have limited effect on reported results and  do not call into question the auditor\u2019s report. Examples of deficiencies that  fall into this subgroup are (1) not including all required information in the  audit findings; (2) not documenting the auditor\u2019s understanding of internal  control, but testing was documented for most applicable compliance  requirements; and (3) not documenting internal control or compliance  testing for a few applicable compliance requirements.", "Limited Reliability\u2014Contains significant deficiencies related to applicable  auditing criteria and requires corrective action to afford reliance upon the  audit. Deficiencies for audits categorized into this group have a substantial  effect on some of the reported results and raise questions about whether  the auditors\u2019 reports are correct. Examples of deficiencies that fall into  this category are (1) documentation did not contain adequate evidence of  the auditors\u2019 understanding of internal control or testing of internal  control for many or all compliance requirements; however, there was  evidence that most compliance testing was performed; (2) lack of  evidence that work related to the SEFA was adequately performed; and   (3) lack of evidence that audit programs were used for auditing internal  control, compliance, and/or the SEFA.", "Unacceptable\u2014Substandard audits with deficiencies so serious that the  auditors\u2019 opinion on at least one major program cannot be relied upon.  Examples of deficiencies that fall into this group are (1) no evidence of  internal control testing and compliance testing for all or most compliance  requirements for one or more major programs, (2) unreported audit  findings, and (3) at least one incorrectly identified major program.", "As shown in table 2, the PCIE study estimated that, overall, approximately  49 percent of the universe of single audits fell into the acceptable group.  This percentage also includes \u201caccepted with deficiencies.\u201d The remaining  51 percent had deficiencies that were severe enough to cause the audits to  be classified as having limited reliability or being unacceptable.  Specifically, for the 208 audits drawn from the universe, the statistical  sample showed the following about the single audits reviewed in the PCIE  study:    115 were acceptable and thus could be relied upon. This includes the  category of \u201caccepted with deficiencies.\u201d Based on this result, the PCIE  study estimated that 48.6 percent of the entire universe of single audits  were acceptable.    30 had significant deficiencies and thus were of limited reliability. Based  on this result, the PCIE study estimated that 16.0 percent of the entire  universe of single audits was of limited reliability.    63 were unacceptable and could not be relied upon. Based on this result,  the PCIE study estimated that 35.5 percent of the entire universe of single  audits was unacceptable.", "It is important to note the significant difference in results in the two strata.  Specifically, 63.5 percent of the audits of entities in stratum 1 (those  expending $50 million or more in federals awards) were deemed  acceptable, while 48.2 percent of audits in stratum 2 (those expending at  least $500,000 but less than $50 million) were deemed acceptable.", "Because of these differences, it is also important to analyze the results in  terms of federal dollars. For the 208 audits drawn from the entire universe,  the statistical sample showed the following about the single audits  reviewed in the PCIE study:    The 115 acceptable audits represented 92.9 percent of the value of federal  award amounts reported in all 208 audits the PCIE study reviewed.", "The 30 audits of limited reliability represented 2.3 percent of the value of  federal award amounts reported in all 208 audits the PCIE study reviewed.    The 63 unacceptable audits represented 4.8 percent of the value of federal  award amounts reported in all 208 audits the PCIE study reviewed.", "The dollar distributions for the 208 audits reviewed in the study are shown  in table 3.", "The most prevalent deficiencies related to the auditors\u2019 lack of  documenting    an understanding of internal control over compliance requirements,   testing of internal control of at least some compliance requirements, and    compliance testing of at least some compliance requirements.", "The PCIE report states that for those audits not in the acceptable group,  the project team believes that lack of due professional care was a factor  for most deficiencies to some degree. The term due professional care  refers to the responsibility of independent auditors to observe professional  standards of auditing. GAGAS further elaborate on this concept in the  standard on Professional Judgment. Under this standard, auditors must  use professional judgment in planning and performing audits and in  reporting the results, which includes exercising reasonable care and  professional skepticism. Reasonable care concerns acting diligently in  accordance with applicable professional standards and ethical principles.  Using professional judgment in all aspects of carrying out their  professional responsibilities\u2014including following the independence  standards, maintaining objectivity and credibility, assigning competent  audit staff to the assignment, defining the scope of work, evaluating and  reporting the results of the work, and maintaining appropriate quality  control over the assignment process\u2014is essential to performing a high  quality audit.", "We previously noted similar audit quality problems in prior reports. In  December 1985, we reported that problems found by OIGs in the course  of QCRs mostly related to lack of documentation showing whether and to  what extent auditors performed testing of compliance with laws and  regulations. In March 1986, we reported that our own review of single  audits showed that auditors performing single audits frequently did not  satisfactorily comply with professional auditing standards. The  predominant issues that we found in our previous reviews were  insufficient audit work in testing compliance with governmental laws and  regulations and evaluating internal controls. We also observed, through  discussions with the auditors and reviews of their work, that many did not  understand the nature and importance of testing and reporting on  compliance with laws and regulations, or the importance of reporting on  internal control and the relationship between reporting and the extent to  which auditors evaluated controls. As a result, in 1986, we reported that  the public accounting profession needed to (1) improve its education  efforts to ensure that auditors performing single audits better understand  the auditing procedures required, and (2) strengthen its enforcement  efforts in the area of governmental auditing to help ensure that auditors  perform those audits in a quality manner.", "Similar to our prior work, the PCIE report presents compelling evidence  that a serious problem with single audit quality continues to exist. The  PCIE study also reveals that the rate of acceptable audits for organizations  with $50 million or more in federal expenditures was significantly higher  than for audits for organizations with smaller amounts of federal  expenditures. The results also showed that overall, a significant number of  audits fell into the groups of limited reliability with significant deficiencies  and unacceptable.", "In our view, the current status of single audit quality is unacceptable. We  are concerned that audits are not being conducted in accordance with  professional standards and requirements.

The PCIE report also  recommends that OMB develop, or arrange for the development of,  minimum content requirements for the required training, in consultation  with the National State Auditors Association (NSAA), the AICPA and its  Governmental Audit Quality Center (GAQC), and the cognizant and  oversight agencies for audit. The report states that the minimum content  should cover the essential components of single audits and emphasize  aspects of single audits for which deficiencies were noted in this project.  In addition, the report recommends that OMB develop, or arrange for the  development of, minimum content requirements for the ongoing CPE and  develop a process for modifying future content.", "The report further recommends that OMB encourage professional  organizations, including the AICPA, the NSAA, and qualified training  providers, to offer training that covers the required content. It also  recommends that OMB encourage these groups to deliver the training in  ways that enable auditors throughout the United States to take the training  at locations near or at their places of business, including via technologies  such as Webcasts, and that the training should be available at an  affordable cost. The PCIE project report emphasizes that the training  should be \u201chands on\u201d and should cover areas where the project team  specifically found weaknesses in the work or documentation in its  statistical study of single audits. The report specifically stated that the  training should cover requirements for properly documenting audit work  in accordance with GAGAS and other topics related to the many  deficiencies disclosed by the project, including critical and unique parts of  a single audit, such as  the auditors\u2019 determination of major programs for testing,  review and testing of internal controls over compliance,    compliance testing,    auditing procedures applicable to the SEFA,    how to use the OMB Compliance Supplement, and    how to audit major programs not included in the Compliance Supplement.", "The PCIE report concludes that such training would require a minimum of  16 to 24 hours, and that a few hours or an \u201coverview\u201d session will not  suffice.

The report noted that other  federal laws and regulations do currently provide for suspension and  debarment processes that can be applied to auditors of single audits. Some  cognizant and oversight agency participants in the project team indicated  that these processes are rarely initiated due to the perception that it is a  large and costly effort. As a result, the report specifically recommends that  OMB, with federal cognizant and oversight agencies, should (1) review the  process of suspension and debarment to identify whether (and if so, how)  it can be more efficiently and effectively applied to address unacceptable  audits, and based on that review, pursue appropriate changes to the  process; and (2) enter into a dialogue with the AICPA and State Boards of  Accountancy to identify ways the AICPA and State Boards can further the  quality of single audits and address the due professional care issues noted  in the PCIE report.

For instance, there may be merit  to conducting a more refined analysis of the distribution of audits to  determine whether less-complex approaches could be used for achieving  accountability through the single audit process for a category of the  smallest single audits. Such an approach may provide sufficient  accountability for these smaller programs.", "An example of a less-complex approach consists of requirements for a  financial audit in accordance with GAGAS, that includes the higher level  reports on internal control and compliance along with an opinion on the  SEFA and additional, limited or specified testing of compliance. Currently,  the compliance testing in a single audit is driven by compliance  requirements under OMB Circular No. A-133 as well as program-specific  requirements detailed in the compliance supplement. A less-complicated  approach could be used for a category of the smallest audits to replace the  current approach to compliance testing, while still providing a level of  assurance on the total amount of federal grant awards provided to the  recipient.", "Another consideration for future actions is strengthening the oversight of  the cognizant agency for audit with respect to auditees expending $50  million or more in federal awards. As shown in the data from the sample  universe of single audits used by the PCIE, 852 audits (or 2.2 percent) of  the total 38,523 audits covered $737.2 billion (or 84 percent) of the  reported federal award expenditures. This distribution suggests that  targeted and effective efforts on the part of cognizant agencies aimed at  improving audit quality for those auditees that expend greater than $50  million could achieve a significant effect in terms of dollars of federal  expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We continue to support the single audit concept and principles behind the  act as a key accountability mechanism over federal awards. It is essential  that the audits are done properly in accordance with GAGAS and OMB  requirements. The PCIE report presents compelling evidence that a  serious shortfall in the quality of single audits continues to exist. Many of  these quality issues are similar in nature to those reported by GAO and the  Inspectors General since the 1980s. We believe that actions must be taken  to improve audit quality and the overall accountability provided through  single audits for federal awards. Without such action, we believe that  substandard audits may provide a false sense of assurance and could  mislead users of audit reports.  While we support the recommendations  made in the PCIE report, we believe that a number of issues regarding the  proposed training requirements need to be resolved.", "The PCIE report results also showed a higher rate of acceptable audits for  organizations with larger amounts of federal expenditures and showed  that the vast majority of federal dollars are being covered by a small  percentage of total audits. We believe that there may be opportunities for  considering size characteristics when implementing future actions to  improve the effectiveness and quality of single audits as an accountability  mechanism. Considering the recommendations of the PCIE within this  larger context will also be important to achieve the proper balance  between risk and cost-effective accountability.", "In addition to the considerations surrounding the specific  recommendations for improving audit quality, a separate effort taking into  account the overall framework for single audits may be warranted. This  effort could include answering questions such as the following:    What types of simplified alternatives exist for meeting the accountability  objectives of the Single Audit Act for the smallest audits and what would  the appropriate cutoff be for a less-complex audit requirement?  Is the current federal oversight structure for single audits adequate and  consistent across federal agencies?", "What alternative federal oversight structures could improve overall  accountability and oversight in the single audit process?", "Are federal oversight processes adequate and are sufficient resources  being dedicated to oversight of single audits?", "What role can the auditing profession play in increasing single audit  quality?", "Do the specific requirements in OMB Circular No. A-133 and the Single  Audit Act need updating?", "Mr. Chairman, we would be pleased to work with the subcommittee as it  considers additional steps to improve the single audit process and federal  oversight and accountability over federal grant funds. Mr. Chairman and  members of this subcommittee, this concludes my statement. I would be  happy to answer any questions that you or members may have at this time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contacts and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For information about this statement, please contact Jeanette Franzel,  Director, Financial Management and Assurance, at (202) 512-9471 or  franzelj@gao.gov.
