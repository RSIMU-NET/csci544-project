In some cases, Interior is authorized to collect royalties and fees for these uses. Over the years, GAO has reported on challenges facing Interior as it implements its programs. In addition to basic program management issues, the department faces difficult choices in balancing its many responsibilities, and in improving the condition of the nation's natural resources and the department's infrastructure, in light of the federal deficit and long-term fiscal challenges facing the nation.

However, numerous important problems remain, as discussed below. Management of resource protection efforts needs to be strengthened. Interior has undertaken steps to improve some of its resource protection efforts, but it has yet to develop a cohesive national strategy to address wildland fire issues, as GAO has recommended. In addition, Interior agencies that manage hardrock mining and oil and gas production on their lands have not effectively carried out their environmental protection responsibilities. Management problems in Indian and island community programs persist. While Interior has implemented major reforms to address weaknesses in managing Indian trust funds and other assets, concerns remain about finalizing organizational changes and delays in decisions about land that the department will take into trust status. In addition, island community programs continue to lack accountability measures. Land appraisals continue to fall short of standards. While Interior has consolidated the land appraisal function into a departmental office to address serious problems with the quality of its appraisals and the millions of dollars that had been lost as a result, a large portion of appraisals that GAO reviewed still did not comply with recognized appraisal standards. Deferred maintenance backlog needs to be addressed. Interior has implemented improved inventory and asset management systems for some programs, but it is not clear how it will address the estimated $17 billion in deferred maintenance. Other programs continue to lack information required to accurately estimate needs. Revenue collection needs more management attention. Interior may not be collecting billions of dollars of revenue from oil and gas royalties; geothermal royalties; and fees from individual recreational uses, air tour operations in and around national parks, and commercial filming and still photography in national parks. Contract and grant management lack needed controls. Because it lacks adequate controls over management of grants and contracts, Interior cannot ensure that millions of dollars in grant and contract funding were used appropriately."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work at the Department of the  Interior.

In recent  years, the Congress has appropriated about $10 billion annually to meet  these responsibilities.

The  average number of acres burned by wildland fires annually from 2000 to  2005 was 70 percent greater than the average number burned annually  during the 1990s, and appropriations for the federal government\u2019s wildland  fire management activities tripled from about $1 billion in fiscal year 1999  to nearly $3 billion in fiscal year 2005. Experts believe that catastrophic  damage from wildland fire will continue to increase until an adequate long- term federal response is implemented and has had time to take effect.  While USDA\u2019s Forest Service receives the majority of fire management  resources, Interior agencies\u2014the National Park Service, BIA, FWS, and,  particularly, BLM\u2014are key partners in responding to the threats of  wildland fire. Consequently, most of our work and recommendations on  wildland fire management address both departments.", "The Interior agencies and the Forest Service have not yet developed a  cohesive strategy that identifies long-term options and associated funding  estimates for addressing wildland fire threats, as we first recommended in  1999; nor have they developed a tactical plan that outlines the critical  steps and time frames needed to complete such a strategy, as we  recommended in 2005. While the agencies together issued a document in  February 2006 titled Protecting People and Natural Resources: A Cohesive  Fuels Treatment Strategy, it does not identify long-term options or  associated funding estimates. Also, although the agencies have  undertaken some tasks over the past 7 years that they stated are important  to developing the cohesive strategy that we recommended, we have  concerns about when and whether such tasks will be completed as  planned. For example, the agencies began developing two modeling  systems to help them (1) allocate resources to respond to wildland fires  and (2) identify the extent, severity, and location of wildland fire threats to  our nation\u2019s communities and ecosystems; these systems are slated for  completion in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We are concerned, however,  that the agencies\u2019 recent endorsement of significant, mid-course design  changes to the resource allocation model may not fulfill key project goals,  including determining the most cost-effective allocation of resources. In  addition, the agencies currently have no plans to routinely update data in  the threat modeling system\u2014this would be necessary, for example, after  major fires, hurricanes, or other factors have significantly altered the  landscape. Such updated data are necessary to accurately capture the  nature of wildland fire threats and to optimize allocation of resources over  time. For these reasons, we continue to believe that a cohesive strategy  and tactical plan would be helpful to the Congress and the agencies in  making informed decisions about effective and affordable long-term  approaches to addressing the nation\u2019s wildland fire problems.", "In addition, in 2006, we reported that the agencies needed to develop  better guidance on sharing the costs of suppressing fires among federal  and nonfederal entities. In some cases, these entities used different cost- sharing methodologies for fires with similar characteristics, which  resulted in inconsistent sharing of costs among federal and nonfederal  entities. The cost-sharing method used can have consequences in the  millions of dollars for the entities involved. As of January 2007, the  agencies were updating their guidance on possible cost-sharing methods  and when each typically would be used, but it is unclear how the agencies  will ensure that the guidance is followed.", "Finally, as we testified last month, preliminary findings from our ongoing  work indicate that the effectiveness of the agencies\u2019 efforts to contain  wildfire suppression costs may be limited because the agencies have not  clearly defined their cost-containment goals, developed a strategy for  achieving those goals, or developed related performance measures. In  addition, for efforts to contain wildfire suppression costs to be effective,  once the agencies have defined their cost-containment goals, they need to  integrate them with other goals of the wildland fire program\u2014such as  protecting life and property\u2014and to recognize that trade-offs will be  needed to meet desired goals within the context of fiscal constraints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hardrock Mining Operations Lack Needed Financial Assurances", "paragraphs": ["Under BLM regulations, hardrock mining operators who extract gold,  silver, copper, and other valuable mineral deposits from land belonging to  the United States are required to provide financial assurances, before they  begin exploration or mining, to guarantee that the costs to reclaim land  disturbed by their operations are paid. However, we reported in June 2005  that BLM did not have a process for ensuring that adequate assurances  were in place. As a result, some assurances may not fully cover all future  reclamation costs, some operators do not have financial assurances, and  some have either outdated reclamation plans and cost estimates or none at  all. When operators with insufficient financial assurances fail to reclaim  BLM land disturbed by hardrock mining operations, BLM is left with  public land that poses risks to the environment and public health and  safety, and requires millions of federal dollars to reclaim. For example, we  reported that 48 hardrock operations had ceased to operate and had not  been reclaimed since the financial assurance requirement began in 1981;  for 43 of these sites, BLM identified a total of about $56 million in  unfunded reclamation costs. We also reported that BLM\u2019s system for  managing financial assurances did not have current information or track  certain information critical to managing the program.", "In response to our 2005 recommendations, BLM has taken substantial  steps to correct these problems. In 2006, the agency modified its system  for managing financial assurances to track key data.  BLM also began  requiring its state office directors to use a newly created report available  from the system to ensure that adequate financial assurances are in place,  and to (1) develop corrective action plans to address any financial  assurance deficiencies with operators and (2) certify that reclamation cost  estimates are adequate. If implemented properly, these efforts should  ensure that appropriate financial assurances are in place to pay for  necessary reclamation of federal lands."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increases in Oil and Gas Permitting Activities Lessen BLM\u2019s Ability to Meet Its Environmental Protection Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["The number of oil and gas operations occurring on or under federal lands  and private lands for which the federal government retains mineral rights  that are permitted by BLM, has increased dramatically\u2014more than tripling  from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2004\u2014in part as a result of the desire to  reduce the country\u2019s dependence on foreign sources of oil and gas. In June  2005, we reported that BLM has struggled to deal with this permitting  workload increase while also carrying out its responsibility to mitigate the  impacts of oil and gas development on land that it manages. Overall, BLM  officials told us that staff had to devote increasing amounts of time to  processing drilling permits, leaving less time to ensure mitigation of the  environmental impacts of oil and gas development. For example, two field  offices we visited that had the largest increases in permitting activity were  each able to meet their annual environmental inspection goals only once in  the past 6 years. BLM has authority to assess and charge fees to cover its  expenses for processing oil and gas permits, which would enable it to  supplement its program resources. While the agency had not exercised  this authority at the time of our report, it had begun taking steps to  develop a fee structure for these permits. To help BLM better respond to  its increased workload, we recommended that the agency finalize and  implement this fee structure to recover its costs for processing  applications for oil and gas drilling permits.", "In response to our recommendation, BLM issued a proposed regulation in  July 2005 that included a $1,600 fee for processing oil and gas permits.  However, the next month, the Congress prohibited Interior from initiating  the new fee in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and the final regulation did  not include the proposed fee.

For example, we found that some refuge managers took  extensive measures to oversee operations and enforce environmental  standards, while others exercised little or no control. We found that such  disparities occurred for two primary reasons. First, FWS had not officially  determined its authority to require permits\u2014which would include  environmental conditions to protect refuge resources\u2014of all oil and gas  operations in refuges; we believe the agency has such authority. Second,  refuge managers lacked guidance, adequate staffing levels, and training to  properly oversee oil and gas activities. We also found that FWS was not  collecting complete and accurate information on damage to refuge lands  as a result of oil and gas operations and what steps were needed to  address that damage.", "FWS has taken some steps to address recommendations we made to  resolve these problems. For example, the agency has implemented training  for staff overseeing oil and gas activities and has begun collecting better  data on the nature and extent of oil and gas activities. However, FWS has  not implemented two key recommendations that would strengthen its  ability to protect refuge resources.", "First, because FWS had not formally clarified its authority to oversee all  types of oil and gas operations on refuges, we recommended that the  agency (1) determine its authority to oversee such operations and report  that determination to the Congress and (2) seek from the Congress any  additional authority that might be needed to apply a consistent and  reasonable set of controls over all oil and gas activities occurring on  national wildlife refuges. To date, FWS has not finalized its determination,  but it has indicated that it does not believe it has the authority to require  permits of all oil and gas operations that would include steps that must be  taken to protect refuge resources. Further, FWS has indicated that it does  not believe it needs additional authority to effectively manage oil and gas  operations on refuges. We continue to believe, however, that FWS does  have the authority to require such permits of all operators. Moreover,  because of the effects of oil and gas activities on refuge resources that we  previously reported, we also continue to believe that if FWS ultimately  determines that it does not have the authority to require permits, it should  seek this authority from the Congress in order to adequately protect  refuges.", "Second, although FWS has taken steps to identify the level of staffing it  needs to adequately oversee oil and gas activities occurring on national  wildlife refuges, it has not\u2014as we recommended\u2014sought the funding to  meet those needs through appropriations, its authority to assess fees, or  other means."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Management Problems in Indian and Island Community Programs Persist", "paragraphs": ["GAO has reported on management weaknesses in Indian programs for a  number of years.

Management of Indian trust  funds and assets has long been plagued by inadequate financial  management, such as poor accounting and information systems; untrained  and inexperienced staff; backlogs in appraisals, determinations of  ownership, and record-keeping; lack of a master lease file or accounts- receivable system; inadequate written policies and procedures; and poor  internal controls.", "In response to these problems, the Congress enacted the American Indian  Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, which among other things,  established the Office of the Special Trustee (OST) to oversee and  coordinate the department\u2019s implementation of trust fund management  reforms. In December 2006, we reported that OST had made progress  implementing reforms, and it estimated that almost all key reforms needed  to develop an integrated trust management system and to provide  improved trust services would be completed by November 2007.  However, OST also estimated that data verification for leasing activities  would not be completed for all Indian lands until December 2009.  Furthermore, OST\u2019s most recent strategic plan, issued in 2003, did not  include a timetable for implementing trust reforms or a date for OST\u2019s  termination, as required by the reform act.

Trust status  means that the federal government holds title to the land in trust for tribes  or individual Indians; land taken in trust is no longer subject to state and  local property taxes and zoning ordinances. Many Indians believe that  having their land placed in trust status is fundamental to safeguarding it  against future loss and ensuring their sovereignty. In 1980, the department  established a regulatory process intended to provide a uniform approach  for taking land in trust.

The economic challenges stem from dependence on a few  key industries, scarce natural resources, small domestic markets, limited  infrastructure, shortages of skilled labor, and reliance on federal grants to  fund basic services. To help diversify and strengthen their economies, OIA  sponsors conferences and business opportunities missions to the areas to  attract U.S. businesses; however, there has been little formal evaluation of  these efforts. In addition, efforts to meet formidable fiscal challenges and  build strong economies are hindered by financial reporting that does not  provide timely and complete information to management and oversight  officials for decision making. The insular area governments have also  submitted required audits late, received disclaimer or qualified audit  opinions, and had many serious internal control weaknesses identified. As  a result of these problems, numerous federal agencies have designated  these governments as \u201chigh-risk\u201d grantees. Interior and other federal  agencies are working to help these governments improve their financial  accountability, but more should be done.", "To increase the effectiveness of the federal government\u2019s assistance to the  U.S. insular areas, we recommended, among other things, that the  department (1) increase coordination activities with officials from other  federal grant-making agencies on issues of common concern relating to  the insular area governments, such as single audit reports, high-risk  designations, and deficiencies in financial management systems and  practices and (2) conduct formal periodic evaluations of OIA\u2019s  conferences and business opportunities missions, assessing their impact  on creating private sector jobs and increasing insular area income.

We found that for  2004 through 2006, compact assistance to the respective governments was  allocated largely to the education, infrastructure, and health sectors, but  that neither country has planned for long-term sustainability of the grant  programs, taking into account the annual decreases in grant funding. In  addition, both countries\u2019 single audit reports for 2004 and 2005 indicated  (1) weaknesses in their ability to account for the use of compact funds and  (2) noncompliance with requirements for major federal programs.

Conducting appraisals is an important function\u2014between  November 2003 and May 2006, for example, Interior appraised more than  6.5 million acres of land that was valued at over $7 billion. Land appraisals  are needed when Interior agencies are buying, exchanging, or leasing land.  Such transactions are an integral part of Interior\u2019s land management in  order to achieve specific purposes, such as consolidating existing  holdings, acquiring land deemed important for wildlife habitat or  recreational opportunities, and opening land to the development of energy  and mineral resources. Interior generally requires land acquisitions to be  based on market value and, thus, objective land appraisals are essential.  Past reports, however, have identified serious problems with Interior  agencies\u2019 appraisal programs, particularly with regard to appraisal  independence, and have identified millions of dollars that the federal  government had lost because of inadequate appraisals.", "While Interior has made major program changes, significant problems  continue. Specifically, to remedy decades of problems with the quality and  objectivity of its land appraisals, Interior removed the land appraisal  function from its land management agencies and consolidated it into a  departmental office\u2014the Appraisal Services Directorate\u2014in November  2003. This was a substantial move in the right direction to help ensure the  independence of the appraisal function, and we reported in September  2006 that the objectivity of appraisals has improved since the directorate\u2019s  inception. However, we also identified two major remaining challenges.", "First, there is still wide variation in the quality of appraisals for land  transactions involving potentially billions of dollars. For example, about 40  percent of Interior\u2019s appraisals for land transactions that we reviewed did  not comply with recognized appraisal standards. This lack of compliance  occurred, in large part, because appraisers appeared not to apply the  specialized skills needed to perform their duties for certain appraisals. In  addition, peer reviews of appraisals were cursory, with reviewers  approving appraisals without considering property characteristics that can  impact the value of land, such as the presence of roads.", "Second, the directorate does not have a system for ensuring that it sets  and meets realistic time frames for appraisal delivery. Of the 3,500  appraisals completed since the directorate was created, over 70 percent  missed their deadlines, with an average delay of 4 months. Delays in  delivery of appraisals can impact the ability of land management agencies  to carry out land acquisition missions, and some land deals have been  scuttled as a result.", "Since our report last fall, Interior has taken encouraging steps to address  our recommendations. For example, Interior has stated that it has  implemented a compliance inspection program for appraisals that are  considered \u201chigh risk\u201d to help ensure that such appraisals comply with  recognized appraisal standards.

Other  authorities for granting royalty relief may also affect future royalty  revenues. Specifically, under discretionary authority, the Secretary of the  Interior administers programs granting relief for certain deep water leases  issued after 2000, certain deep gas wells drilled in shallow waters, and  wells nearing the end of their productive lives. In addition, the Energy  Policy Act of 2005 mandates relief for leases issued in the Gulf of Mexico  during the 5 years following the act\u2019s passage, provides relief for some gas  wells that would not have previously qualified for royalty relief, and would  provide relief in certain areas of Alaska where there currently is little or no  production.", "The U.S. Comptroller General has highlighted royalty relief as an area  needing additional oversight by the 110th Congress. Currently, we are  assessing MMS\u2019s estimate of forgone royalties in light of changing oil and  gas prices, revised estimates of future oil and gas production, and other  factors. We are also seeking to identify comprehensive studies that  quantify the potential benefits of royalty relief. We intend to issue a report  on these issues later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Revenue from Geothermal Leases May Change", "paragraphs": ["In May 2006, we reported that a change in how royalties on geothermal  leases are disbursed may result in a change in the amount of royalties  collected by the federal government. Specifically, while the Energy Policy  Act of 2005 included provisions to encourage geothermal development, it  also reduced the royalty percentage the federal government receives.  Despite this, the act directs the Secretary of the Interior to seek, for most  leases, to maintain the same level of royalty revenues as before the act.  This could be accomplished by negotiating different royalty rates based on  past royalty history, provided that electricity prices remain constant.  Although it is impossible to predict with reasonable assurance how these  prices will change in the future, Interior must make its best effort to  mitigate the impact of changing prices if federal royalty revenue is to  remain the same. This mitigation can only be achieved if there is timely  and accurate knowledge of the revenues that lessees collect when they sell  electricity. However, we reported that MMS does not routinely collect  revenue data from electricity sales. Without such knowledge, MMS will  have difficulty collecting the same level of royalties from lessees under the  new royalty process. To demonstrate its commitment to collect the same  level of royalty revenues as prior to passage of the act, we recommended  that MMS routinely collect future sales revenues for electricity when  royalty payments are due.

However, we found that the  agencies were not collecting such fees in the following cases:  In May 2006, we reported that the Park Service was not collecting all  required fees from companies conducting air tours in or around three  highly visited national parks because of (1) an inability to verify the  number of air tours conducted over the three national parks and,  therefore, to enforce compliance and (2) confusion resulting from  differing geographic applicability of legislation governing air tours in  national parks.", "In May 2005, we reported that the Park Service could be collecting more  revenue through the permits it issues for special park uses, such as special  events, but was not doing so because park units were not consistently  applying criteria for charging permit fees. In addition, the Park Service  had not implemented a May 2000 law that required the collection of  location fees for commercial filming and still photography, resulting in  significant annual forgone revenues. In response to our recommendation,  the Park Service began collecting location fees in May 2006.", "In September 2006, we reported that Interior agencies have been slow to  implement authorities for charging fees for recreational uses of federal  lands and waters.

In total,  federal grazing revenue amounted to about $21 million in fiscal year 2004,  although grazing fees differ by agency. For example, in 2004, BLM and the  Forest Service charged $1.43 per animal unit month, while other federal  agencies charged between $0.29 and $112 per animal unit month. We  reported in 2005 that while BLM and the Forest Service charged generally  much lower fees than other federal agencies and private entities, these  fees reflect legislative and executive branch policies to support local  economies and ranching communities. Specifically, BLM fees are set by a  formula that was originally established by a law that expired, but use of  the formula has been extended indefinitely by Executive Order since 1986.  This formula takes into account a rancher\u2019s ability to pay and, therefore,  the purpose is not primarily to recover the agencies\u2019 costs or capture the  fair market value of forage. Instead, the formula is designed to set a fee  that helps support ranchers and the western livestock industry. Other  federal agencies employ market-based approaches to setting grazing fees.", "Using this formula, BLM collected about $12 million in receipts in fiscal  year 2004, while its costs for implementing its grazing program, including  range improvement activities, were about $58 million. Were BLM to  implement approaches used by other agencies to set grazing fees, it could  help to close the gap between expenditures and receipts and more closely  align its fees with market prices.

In our review of 11 task  orders Interior issued on behalf of DOD\u2014amounting to about $66  million\u2014we found numerous breakdowns in management controls.   Specifically, we found that Interior  issued task orders that were beyond the scope of the contract, in violation  of federal competition rules;   did not comply with additional DOD competition requirements when  issuing task orders for services on existing contracts;   did not comply with ordering procedures meant to ensure the best value  for the government; and inadequately monitored contractor performance.", "Moreover, we found that the contractor was allowed to play a role in the  procurement process normally performed by the government because the  officials at Interior and DOD responsible for the orders did not fully carry  out their roles and responsibilities.

At that time, we testified that Interior faced serious  challenges to addressing the declining condition of the nation\u2019s natural  resources and related infrastructure under its responsibility.  Unfortunately, almost 15 years later, the message in my testimony today is  very similar. While some of the programs we evaluated in the past have  improved, evaluations of additional programs reveal many of the same  persistent management problems\u2014a lack of adequate data to understand  the condition of its natural resources and infrastructure and the actions  necessary to improve them, a lack of adequate controls and accountability  to ensure federal resources are properly used and accounted for, and a  lack of adequate strategic planning and guidance for program  implementation. Clearly the department needs to address management  and control gaps in its programs and ensure its activities are carried out in  the most cost-effective and efficient manner, but difficult choices remain  for improving the condition of the nation\u2019s natural resources and the  department\u2019s infrastructure in light of the federal deficit and long-term  fiscal challenges facing the nation. Either new sources of funding need to  be identified and pursued, or the department must determine the services  it can continue and the standards it will use for maintaining its facilities  and lands. As we stated in our testimony nearly 15 years ago, we believe  that in reaching these decisions, policy makers should know the full extent  of the resource shortfalls facing federal natural resource management  agencies. In addition, it is essential for the department to identify the  impacts on services and infrastructure that would occur should serious  cutbacks be necessary in order to maintain a certain standard of quality.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
