One tool used to maintain fisheries at sustainable levels is the individual fishing quota (IFQ), which sets individual catch limits for eligible vessel owners or operators.

For this study, GAO determined (1) the costs of managing (i.e., administering, monitoring, and enforcing) IFQ programs and how these costs differ from pre-IFQ management costs; (2) what, if any, IFQ management costs are currently being recovered by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS); and (3) ways to share the costs of IFQ programs between government and industry."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Fiscal year 2003 management costs varied considerably among IFQ programs. According to fishery managers, halibut and sablefish program costs were higher and surfclam/ocean quahog program costs were lower, when compared with pre-IFQ management costs. Although complete cost information was not available, GAO aggregated cost estimates from information provided by NMFS and other organizations involved in IFQ-related activities and estimated that fiscal year 2003 IFQ management costs were at least $3.2 million for the Alaska halibut and sablefish program, $274,000 for the surfclam/ocean quahog program, and $7,600 for the wreckfish program. While NMFS does not systematically track the costs of managing IFQ programs and does not have complete information on pre-IFQ management costs, fishery managers said management costs were greater under the halibut and sablefish IFQ program than under pre-IFQ management, in part, because of the IFQ program's complex rules. In contrast, fishery managers said costs were less under the surfclam/ocean quahog IFQ program than under pre-IFQ management, in part, because the simplicity of the program's design made it easier to monitor compliance. Moreover, according to fishery managers, NMFS incurred additional costs for the development and initial implementation of both programs. NMFS is not recovering management costs as required by the Magnuson- Stevens Act for two of the three IFQ programs. Under the act, as amended by the 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act, NMFS is required to recover the \"actual costs directly related to the management and enforcement\" of all IFQ programs. NMFS has implemented cost recovery for the halibut and sablefish program, but it has not done so for the surfclam/ocean quahog or wreckfish programs. NMFS officials said that cost recovery for the surfclam/ocean quahog program has been a low priority and very few people were fishing wreckfish. Also, the Magnuson-Stevens Act does not define \"actual costs directly related to the management and enforcement\" of an IFQ program. NMFS has interpreted the term to mean those costs that would not have been incurred but for the IFQ program (i.e., the incremental costs). However, another way to interpret the term \"actual costs directly related to\" is full costs. Under a \"full cost\" approach, NMFS could have recovered more costs of managing the IFQ program. Several methods are used for sharing IFQ management costs between government and industry. These methods principally fall into three categories: user fees, quota set-asides, and devolution of services. Under user fees, government recovers costs by collecting a fee from the quota holder or fisherman. Under a quota set-aside, government can set aside (i.e., not allocate) a certain amount of quota each year, lease the set-aside quota to fishermen, and use the revenue to pay for program management costs. Finally, under devolution of services, management services previously performed by government, such as monitoring compliance with individual catch limits, are transferred to industry."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Overfishing is a problem with significant environmental and economic  consequences. When a fishery\u2014one or more fish stocks within a  geographic area\u2014cannot be sustained because of overfishing, the marine  ecosystem in which those stocks live can be harmed, and fishermen and  their communities can experience economic hardship. Yet, about one-third  of the U.S. fish stocks assessed by the National Marine Fisheries Service  (NMFS), within the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), are overfished or approaching an  overfished condition. Greater competition for fewer fish increases the  likelihood that stocks will decline further and catches will decrease.", "One of the causes of overfishing is the excessive investment in fishing  capacity, such as when there are more boats than the fishery can support.  An individual fishing quota (IFQ) is one of the management tools available  to help reduce overcapacity and promote conservation. Today, several  countries, including the United States, use IFQ programs to manage  fisheries within their 200-mile exclusive economic zone (see apps. II and  III). In the United States, IFQ programs are developed primarily by regional  fishery management councils established by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery  Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act) in 1976 and  implemented by NMFS. Under an IFQ program, fishery managers set a total  allowable catch in a particular fishery on the basis of fish stock  assessments and other indicators of biological productivity, and the  managers then allocate quota\u2014the privilege to harvest a certain portion of  the catch\u2014to eligible boats, fishermen, or other recipients. IFQ program  rules often allow a quota holder to transfer quota by sale, lease, or other  methods. Such transfers are expected to reduce the number of fishermen  and boats and consolidate the quota among the more efficient fishermen.  At the time of our review, NMFS had implemented three IFQ programs: the  Mid-Atlantic surfclam/ocean quahog program in 1990, the South Atlantic  wreckfish (snapper-grouper complex) program in 1992, and the Alaskan  halibut and sablefish (black cod) program in 1995. In addition, at the time  of our review, an IFQ program had been approved but not yet implemented  for the Bering Sea crab; an IFQ program was being developed for the Gulf  of Mexico red snapper; and IFQ programs were being considered for other  commercial fisheries, such as the Gulf of Alaska groundfish (e.g., pollock,  cod, and sole).", "IFQ programs have achieved many of the desired conservation and  management benefits, such as helping to stabilize fisheries and reducing  excessive investment in fishing capacity. However, these programs have  also raised concerns, such as the costs of IFQ management and the equity  of gifting a public trust resource to a select group of beneficiaries.", "This is the third in a series of reports you requested on IFQ programs as  Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the former Subcommittee on  Oceans, Fisheries, and Coast Guard, Senate Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation. In December 2002, we reported on the extent  of consolidation of quota holdings, the extent of foreign holdings of quota,  and the economic effect of IFQ programs on seafood processors. In  February 2004, we reported on methods available for protecting the  economic viability of fishing communities and facilitating new entry into  IFQ fisheries, key issues facing fishery managers in protecting  communities and facilitating new entry, and the comparative advantages  and disadvantages of the IFQ system and the fishery cooperative  approach. For this report, you asked us to (1) determine the costs of  managing (i.e., administering, monitoring, and enforcing) IFQ programs  and how these costs differ from pre-IFQ management costs; (2) determine  what, if any, IFQ management costs are currently being recovered by  NMFS; and (3) assess ways to share the costs of IFQ programs between  government and industry.", "To conduct this review, we visited locations in Alaska, Florida,  Massachusetts, New Jersey, and South Carolina. We selected these sites to  obtain broad geographic coverage for the three domestic IFQ programs. In  these locations and elsewhere, we interviewed fishery participants;  officials at NMFS, the U.S. Coast Guard, and state enforcement agencies;  representatives of the International Pacific Halibut Commission; and  fishery council staff. In Alaska and New Jersey, we visited ports where we  observed offloads of IFQ fish. In addition, we obtained information from  government officials from Australia, Canada, and New Zealand because  these countries share fishery management costs with the fishing industry.  Because NMFS does not systematically track IFQ management costs, we  estimated these costs from information that we gathered for fiscal year  2003 from NMFS and other organizations involved in IFQ-related activities.  Since the data we received appeared reasonable, given differences among  the programs, and were consistent with explanations of program  operations and costs provided by agency officials, we concluded that these  data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of this report.

To develop their plans, the councils each use a collaborative process that  involves advisory committees, public hearings, and other means to ensure  that interested parties have an opportunity to provide input. Council staff  then analyze the information for use in plan development. Once a council  adopts a plan, NMFS drafts regulations to implement the plan. The council  then submits the plan and regulations to the Secretary of Commerce for  approval. The Secretary reviews the plan and proposed regulations for  consistency with U.S. law and with each other. The plan and proposed  regulations may then be published for public comment. Plans may be fully  or partially approved, or disapproved and returned to the council for  revision. If approved, regulations must be issued for implementation.", "Once a fishery management plan is approved, NMFS is responsible for  implementing it. In the case of an IFQ program, NMFS must set up the  systems for collecting annual permit, logbook, and fish dealer data; obtain  records of qualifying catches and other information to determine eligibility  to hold quota share; process initial requests for quota; and issue the initial  quota share. The quota share represents a percentage of the total allowable  catch for the fishery, which a fishery management council sets\u2014typically  each year\u2014subject to NMFS\u2019s confirmation. To set the total allowable  catch, the council relies on stock assessments performed by one of the  NMFS regional fisheries science centers. In the case of the halibut fishery,  the International Pacific Halibut Commission performs the stock  assessment and sets the total allowable catch.", "Once a fishery management plan becomes operational, NMFS is  responsible for administering it. Administrative activities unique to an IFQ  program include, among others, calculating and distributing the annual  quota allocations, approving and processing quota transfers, and  monitoring compliance with program requirements. In addition,  administrative activities in early IFQ program years may include  adjudicating appeals of the initial allocation. Both NMFS and the councils  have responsibility for monitoring existing plans and proposing any  changes for approval and implementation by NMFS.", "NMFS shares responsibility with the U.S. Coast Guard and state agencies  for enforcing the rules of a fishery management plan. For an IFQ program,  the Coast Guard generally conducts at-sea and aerial surveillance of fishing  activities, and NMFS contracts with state agencies to assist its Office for  Law Enforcement with inshore activities, such as monitoring the landings  for compliance with individual catch limits. NMFS also audits the paper  trail (consisting of logbook, landings, and buyer records) created by the  IFQ program.", "The 1996 Sustainable Fisheries Act amended the Magnuson-Stevens Act to  require the Secretary of Commerce to recover \u201cactual costs directly related  to the management and enforcement\u201d of IFQ programs.

Since NMFS does not systematically track the costs of  IFQ programs or the time spent on IFQ activities, we requested cost  information from NMFS and other organizations that performed  IFQ-related activities during fiscal year 2003. However, these organizations  did not or could not provide cost information for all of their IFQ-related  activities. (See app. I for information on the organizations that provided  data.) The estimated management costs shown in table 1 varied  significantly by program, in part, because of differences in the number of  program participants and program design. For example, the halibut and  sablefish program had the largest number of quota holders\u2014about  4,300\u2014and a complex set of rules designed, in part, to protect the  owner-operator character of the fleet, such as limits on the amount of quota  an individual could hold and restrictions on who could receive quota  transfers.

Of the total spent to manage the  program, about 51.6 percent, or $1.7 million, was spent on NMFS  enforcement activities, such as dockside monitoring, and 42.7 percent, or  $1.4 million, was spent on NMFS administrative activities, such as  managing IFQ permits and quota share transfers.

Since information on how wreckfish  management costs changed with the introduction of the IFQ program was  not available, we did not include wreckfish in our analysis of comparative  costs. While NMFS does not systematically track IFQ management costs  and cost data on fishery management activities prior to the IFQ program  are incomplete, fishery managers said the overall costs of managing the  halibut and sablefish fisheries were higher under the IFQ program than  under the previous management system. Before implementation of the IFQ  program, both the halibut and sablefish fisheries were managed by setting  an annual catch limit for the entire fishery by fishing area, as well as  restricting the times when fishing could occur and the type of gear that  could be used\u2014for example, hooks, pots, and nets. However, there were no  restrictions on the number of people that could fish. Over time, as more  boats entered the fishery and the catch limits were reached sooner, the  fishing seasons became shorter; in some areas, fishing was limited to less  than 48 hours a year, resulting in so-called fishing derbies\u2014that is,  fishermen trying to catch as much fish as they could within the time  allotted. With the implementation of the IFQ program, the fisheries were  managed under a complex set of rules designed, in part, to protect the  owner-operator character of the fleet. For example, the rules limited the  amount of quota an individual could hold, restricted who could receive  quota transfers, and required that quota be issued by vessel categories with  quota transfers prohibited across vessel categories\u2014for example, larger  boats could not buy quota from smaller boats. In addition, the IFQ program  allowed fishery managers to extend the fishing season to 8 months.", "The IFQ program\u2019s complexity and longer fishing season required NMFS to  devote more staff time to administrative, monitoring, and enforcement  activities than previously needed. More specifically,  NMFS created a Restricted Access Management division to handle the  administrative activities of the IFQ program, such as issuing annual  quota allocations, handling quota transfers, and maintaining the IFQ  landings database;  NMFS created an Office of Administrative Appeals to handle appeals  related to the IFQ program, such as appeals of the initial quota  allocation determinations and subsequent decisions regarding quota  transfers;  NMFS hired 20 additional staff (16 enforcement officers and 4 agents) to  monitor the individual catch limits of the more than 3,000 halibut  fishermen who now, with an 8-month fishing season, could land their  catch at any 1 of more than 35 ports along the coasts of Alaska, Oregon,  and Washington; and   the International Pacific Halibut Commission, which conducts halibut  stock assessments and annually establishes halibut catch limits, by  geographic area, determined that the IFQ program\u2019s extended season  increased the resources needed for the U.S. portion of its halibut  sampling program.", "In contrast to the halibut and sablefish program, fishery managers reported  that overall management costs for the surfclam and ocean quahog fisheries  were lower following the implementation of the IFQ program. Fishery  managers primarily attributed the lower costs to the simplicity of the IFQ  program as compared with the previous management system. Before the  IFQ program, the fisheries were managed through a combination of tools,  such as minimum size limits for harvested clams; annual and quarterly  quotas; and, in the case of surfclams, fishing time restrictions. Fishery  managers said that the pre-IFQ time management system, which required  NMFS to set and monitor an allowable fishing time for each vessel in the  fishery, was very labor-intensive for the Mid-Atlantic Council and the  following offices: NMFS Sustainable Fisheries, NMFS Enforcement, NOAA  Northeast Regional Counsel, and NOAA Northeast General Counsel for  Enforcement and Litigation. Further, as overfishing continued, the length  of time each vessel was allowed to fish continued to be reduced until it had  decreased to six 6-hour trips per fishing quarter in the mid-1980s.  According to NMFS officials, the continual changes in policy required  NMFS to spend significant staff time monitoring the status of the fishery, as  well as drafting revisions to fishery regulations.", "After implementation of the surfclam/ocean quahog IFQ program, fishery  managers reported that the amount of management time the council and  NMFS spent on the surfclam and ocean quahog fisheries decreased  dramatically. For example, council staff estimated that the IFQ program  reduced the amount of time they spent on surfclam/ocean quahog activities  from 3 or 4 staff-years annually to less than 1/2 a staff-year during fiscal  year 2003. This decrease occurred because the surfclam/ocean quahog  population had stabilized, and fishery managers no longer had to  micromanage the fisheries.", "In addition, NMFS officials also reported that enforcement costs were  substantially lower after implementation of the surfclam/ocean quahog IFQ  program. Before IFQ implementation, enforcement under the time  management system required the use of Coast Guard boats and helicopters  to monitor boats for compliance with their fishing time restrictions.  Enforcement also required monitoring offloads to ensure that minimum  clam sizes were being met. With the implementation of the IFQ program  and its reliance on individual catch limits, NMFS changed its enforcement  efforts from the costly at-sea monitoring of boats to monitoring the amount  of clams coming ashore and making sure all landings were reported  accurately. The council and NMFS generally believe that the  surfclam/ocean quahog fisheries are ideally suited to dockside enforcement  because the fisheries have a small number of vessels that can offload their  clam cages only at docks with cranes and sell their product to one of a few  processors with a canning facility. For this reason, fishery managers said  that the surfclam and ocean quahog fisheries required substantially less  enforcement effort than before the IFQ program was implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fishery Councils and NMFS Incurred Additional Costs Associated with Development and Implementation of Two IFQ Programs", "paragraphs": ["According to fishery managers, the fishery councils and NMFS incurred  additional costs associated with developing and implementing the halibut  and sablefish and surfclam/ocean quahog IFQ programs.

Under this  interpretation, at the end of each fiscal year, offices in NMFS\u2019s Alaska  Region, including Restricted Access Management, Sustainable Fisheries,  and Law Enforcement, as well as the International Pacific Halibut  Commission, submit their incremental cost estimates to the Restricted  Access Management office. The Restricted Access Management office uses  these estimates and the total ex-vessel value of the two fisheries to  calculate an annual fee to be levied on halibut and sablefish program  participants. NMFS relies on cost estimates provided by these various  offices because it does not systematically track the costs of IFQ programs  or the time spent on IFQ activities. NMFS officials told us that developing  the cost estimates is challenging because most staff work on more than one  program at a time, and it is difficult to isolate the costs attributable to the  IFQ program.", "While NMFS requests cost estimates for nine budget categories\u2014personnel  compensation, personnel benefits, travel, transportation, rent, printing,  other contractual services, supplies, and equipment\u2014NMFS does not have  a standard procedure for estimating these costs. Instead, each organization develops its cost estimates independently using its own methodology. For  example, the Restricted Access Management office prepares year-end  estimates of the amount of time each staff person spent on IFQ work, an  average percentage of all staff time spent on IFQ work, and a percentage of  its overhead costs to be charged to the IFQ program. In contrast, the  International Pacific Halibut Commission prepares its incremental cost  estimates by adjusting the U.S. portion of its pre-IFQ (1994) costs upward  by 5 percent per year and then subtracts that amount from the U.S. portion  of the commission\u2019s total annual costs. Nonetheless, NMFS officials believe  that their cost estimates represent the best available information on the  incremental costs of the IFQ program.", "Applying the \u201cincremental costs\u201d definition and using the cost estimates  submitted by the various offices, NMFS reported recovering about $3.2  million in halibut and sablefish IFQ program costs for fiscal year 2003.

Under a \u201cfull cost\u201d approach, NMFS  could have recovered more than the $3.2 million recovered for fiscal year  2003. For example, NMFS could have recovered the costs associated with  the sablefish stock assessment, which would be done regardless of  whether or not the fishery was managed under an IFQ program.

These methods principally fall into three categories\u2014user fees, quota  set-asides, and devolution of services from government to industry.  Sharing costs between government and industry can help alleviate  concerns about fishery management costs and the equity of giving away a  public resource in the form of individual fishing quota to a select group of  beneficiaries.", "Table 2 shows the types of cost-sharing methods used in selected countries  that manage fisheries under individual fishing quotas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "User Fees", "paragraphs": ["Under the user fee method, government recovers costs by collecting a fee  from those who benefit from using the resource. In the case of an IFQ  program, the beneficiary is generally the quota holder or fisherman. Among  the advantages, user fees promote equity, because they distribute  management costs to those who benefit from having exclusive access to a  public resource. Further, government can select the method for collecting  fees that best reflects the extent to which program participants have  benefited. For example, in the Alaskan halibut and sablefish IFQ program,  fishermen pay their fees after the fishing season closes on the basis of the  amount of fish caught. Fishermen who have not caught any fish do not pay  a fee. By collecting fees after the end of the season, government also has  better cost information for the program. Charging fees also creates an  incentive for users to evaluate which management services have benefits  that exceed their costs and communicate this information to government.", "Among the disadvantages, user fees directly affect a fishing firm\u2019s  profitability and its ability to compete. In cases where participants pay a  flat fee regardless of the extent to which they benefit from using the  resource, user fees could be disproportionately borne by the smaller  fishing firms. Also, user fees have administrative costs to government for  determining the total amount of recoverable costs, as well as for billing,  tracking, collecting, and enforcing the fee payments of each individual  quota holder or fisherman. User fee programs that base their fees on  ex-vessel value may require additional recordkeeping. In the United States,  for example, NMFS must keep records on IFQ fish prices and IFQ landings  by species, month, and port in order to calculate the annual fee charged for  halibut and sablefish IFQ management costs.", "Several countries recover IFQ management costs through user fees.  However, the features of each user fee program vary by which costs are  recovered and how fees are assessed. As previously discussed, in the  United States, NMFS collects fees to recover the incremental costs of the  Alaskan halibut and sablefish IFQ program, and it does not recover stock  assessment costs. In contrast, other countries, such as Australia and New  Zealand, do not limit recovery to incremental costs. Australia recovers all  domestic commercial fisheries\u2019 licensing, data management, and logbook  management costs; 50 percent of monitoring and enforcement costs; and 80  percent of research and data collection costs, which include stock  assessment research.

An  advantage of the quota set-aside method is that it does not necessitate the  collection of fees from each quota holder, thus avoiding late or nonpayment  concerns and reducing collection costs to government. Another advantage  of quota set-asides is that government eliminates the possibility that those  who do not pay their fees might continue to benefit from the public  resource.", "A disadvantage of the set-aside method is that if the value of the quota is  too low, the government may not raise enough funds to cover the IFQ  program\u2019s management costs. Therefore, government needs to accurately  estimate the value of the quota for the upcoming season and the cost of  managing the fishery when determining the amount of quota to withhold.", "Canada uses a method similar to a quota set-aside (known as quota  reallocation) to collect costs of its halibut IFQ fishery. In that fishery, a  portion of each quota holder\u2019s annual quota\u2014not to exceed 15 percent of  the total allowable catch\u2014is allocated to an industry association for  redistribution. The original quota holder has the right to lease back his or  her shares. If he or she declines, the industry association makes the shares  available for purchase by other quota holders.
