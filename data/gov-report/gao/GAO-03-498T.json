As you know, the GPO was enacted in  1977 to equalize the treatment of workers covered by Social Security and  those with government pensions not covered by Social Security. In short,  the GPO prevents workers from receiving a full Social Security spousal  benefit on top of a pension earned from government employment not  covered by Social Security. However, the law provides an exemption from  the GPO if an individual\u2019s last day of state/local government employment  is in a position that is covered by both Social Security and their state/local  pension system. In these cases, the GPO will not apply, and Social Security  spousal benefits will not be reduced.", "Last year, you asked us to (1) assess the extent to which individuals  retiring from jobs not covered by Social Security may be transferring  briefly to covered jobs in order to avoid the GPO, and (2) estimate the  impact of such transfers on the Social Security Trust Fund. To complete  our work, we first reviewed the GPO\u2019s legislative history and government  reports documenting the purpose of the offset and the Social Security  Administration\u2019s (SSA) policies and procedures for administering it. We  also performed limited work with associations, researchers, and  retirement system officials in 28 states. Finally, we performed audit work  in Texas and Georgia, two of the states where we identified use of the last- day exemption. On August 15, 2002, we reported to you on the results of  our work. Today I will discuss the findings of our review.", "In summary, because no central data exists on use of the GPO exemption  by individuals in approximately 2,300 state and local government  retirement plans nationwide, we could not definitively confirm that this  practice is occurring in states other than Texas and Georgia.

Workers contribute to the program via wage deductions.  State and local government workers were originally excluded from Social  Security.", "Starting in the 1950s, state and local governments had the option of  selecting Social Security coverage for their employees or retaining their  noncovered status. In 1983, state and local governments in the Social  Security system were prohibited by law from opting out of it. Of the  workers in the roughly 2,300 separate state and local retirement plans  nationwide, about one-third are not covered by Social Security.", "In addition to paying retirement and disability benefits to covered  workers, Social Security also generally pays benefits to spouses of retired,  disabled, or deceased workers. If both spouses worked in positions  covered by Social Security, each may not receive both the benefits earned  as a worker and the full spousal benefit; rather the worker receives the  higher amount of the two. In contrast, until 1977, workers receiving  pensions from government positions not covered by Social Security could  receive their full pension benefit and their full Social Security spousal  benefits as if they were nonworking spouses. At that time, legislation was  enacted creating the GPO, which prevented workers from receiving a full  spousal benefit on top of a pension earned from noncovered government  employment. However, the law provides an exemption from the GPO if an  individual\u2019s last day of state/local employment is in a position that is  covered by both Social Security and the state/local government\u2019s pension  system.

Most of these employees were paid about $6 per  hour. At this rate, the Social Security contributions deducted from their  pay would total about $3 for the day.

The GPO  exemption is also becoming part of teachers\u2019 regular retirement planning  process as its availability and use is publicized by teaching associations  and financial planners (via Web sites, newspapers, seminars, etc.) and by  word-of-mouth. One association\u2019s Web site we identified lists the names  and telephone numbers of school officials in counties covered by Social  Security and how to contact those officials for such work.

Officials in fast-growing school systems reported they needed to hire  teachers even if they only intended to teach for 1 year. However, some  schools reported that they have had teachers leave shortly after being  hired. For example, in one district, a teacher signed a 1-year contract to  teach but left after 61 days, a time sufficient to avoid the spousal benefit  reduction.

The first option, as proposed in H.R. 743, is to change  the last-day provision to a longer minimum time period. This option would  require only small changes to administer and would be less burdensome  than other methods for SSA to administer. Also, this option has precedent.  Legislation in 1987 required federal employees transferring between two  federal retirement systems, the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS)  and Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), to remain in FERS for  5 years before they were exempt from the GPO. We found that most of the  jobs in Texas last for about 1 day, so extending the time period might  eliminate many of the exemption users in Texas.", "The second option our report identified is to use a proportional approach  to determine the extent to which the GPO applies. Under this option,  employees who have spent a certain proportion of their working career in  a position covered by Social Security could be exempt from the GPO. This  option may represent a more calibrated approach to determining benefits  for individuals who have made contributions to the Social Security system  for an extended period of their working years.

The practice of providing full  spousal benefits to individuals who receive government pensions but who  made only nominal contributions to the Social Security system also runs  counter to the nation\u2019s efforts to address the solvency and sustainability of  the Social Security program.", "Based on the number of people reported to be using the loophole in Texas  and Georgia this year, the exemption could cost the Trust Fund hundreds  of millions of dollars.
