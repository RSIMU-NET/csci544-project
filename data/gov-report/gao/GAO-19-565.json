The first review cycle begins when FDA accepts a generic drug application for review and ends when FDA makes its first decision about whether the drug should be approved for marketing and sale. For applications that were not approved in that first cycle, the application must undergo one or more subsequent review cycles to obtain approval, delaying the generic drug's arrival to market.", "GAO identified several factors that may have contributed to whether a generic drug was approved during the first review cycle. For example, certain types of complex drugs were less likely to receive approval in the first review cycle, such as eye drops or other drugs administered through the eye.", "FDA has taken steps to increase the rate of generic drug approvals in the first review cycle. For example, FDA has increased communication with applicants and introduced templates for reviewers to improve the consistency and clarity of their comments. However, GAO's review of a judgmental selection of 35 applications found examples of variation in the clarity and content of FDA's comments to applicants. Such variation may have contributed to whether applicants could adequately address deficiencies within the first cycle, and therefore whether the applications were approved. In addition, stakeholders GAO interviewed expressed concern that changes to the brand-name drug's labeling mid-cycle could delay or prevent generic drugs' approval in the first review cycle, and some stakeholders said they believe that the labeling changes may be strategically timed to delay approvals. Although FDA officials noted that it would be difficult for brand-name companies to time labeling changes in this way, they said that the agency has not conducted analysis that would enable it to assess the validity of these concerns. Therefore, FDA lacks the information needed to respond to these concerns or address problems should they exist."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDA 1) take additional steps to address inconsistency in its written comments to generic drug application sponsors and 2) assess the extent to which the timing of brand-name drug companies' drug labeling changes affects the approval of generic drugs and take steps, as appropriate, to limit the effect. HHS concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Generic drugs, which are essentially copies of approved brand-name  drugs, can provide substantial cost savings for patients and third-party  payers, including government health programs. According to industry  estimates, in 2018 generic drugs accounted for nearly 90 percent of  prescriptions filled in the United States. In 2016 we reported that, on  average, generic drugs have retail prices that are 75 to 90 percent lower  than the retail prices of their brand-name counterparts, and new research  indicates that the gap between brand-name and generic drugs may be  widening. While estimates vary, studies have found that generic drugs  have collectively saved patients and third-party payers billions of dollars.  Such cost savings have resulted in widespread national interest in  facilitating the quick approval of generic drugs; however, the interest in  quick approvals must be balanced by the need for safety and efficacy.", "Typically, when seeking to market a generic drug in the United States, a  drug sponsor who develops the drug, such as a drug company, submits a  generic drug application to the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for review. Through its  review, FDA seeks to determine whether the product is therapeutically  equivalent to the brand-name drug. For example, a generic drug  application includes data that are intended to demonstrate that the  generic drug has the same active ingredient and other key characteristics  and delivers the same amount of active ingredient in the same amount of  time as the brand-name drug.", "Questions have been raised by generic drug applicants and trade  associations about the low percentage of applications approved within  FDA\u2019s first review cycle\u2014the time from when FDA accepts an application  for review to when FDA makes its first decision about whether it is  approved\u2014and FDA has a stated goal to minimize the number of review  cycles for applications to attain approval.

Once those deficiencies are addressed, the applicant can  amend the application and seek another full review\u2014the second review  cycle. According to FDA, in recent years (fiscal years 2013\u20132017) it took  an average of three review cycles for a generic drug application to reach  approval, which can take years, including the time it takes for the  applicant to make changes to the application in response to FDA\u2019s  comments and the time it takes for FDA to review the changes.

Using these data,  we identified the number of applications that were approved in the first  review cycle and determined the rate of approval in that cycle for  applications with certain characteristics. We assessed the reliability of  FDA data we received by reviewing related documentation, performing  data reliability checks (such as examining the data for missing values and  checking values against other documentation), and interviewing relevant  agency officials. On the basis of these steps, we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To supplement this analysis and to identify characteristics of applications  that may have contributed to whether they were approved in the first  review cycle, we also reviewed documentation from the first review cycle  for a judgmental selection of 35 generic drug applications that were  submitted to FDA in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Specifically, we selected  30 of these applications for variation in (1) applicant size, determined by  either the number of applications submitted in fiscal years 2015 through  2018 or whether the applicant had any approved applications as of fiscal  year 2018, (2) application priority review status, (3) first review cycle  outcome, and (4) application complexity status.

GDUFA II was enacted in  August 2017 to reauthorize the generic drug user fee program from fiscal  year 2018 through fiscal year 2022. In return, FDA provided Commitment  Letters to Congress that detailed its plans to implement program  enhancements and meet certain performance measures related to the  review of generic drug applications. For example, in its Commitment  Letter for GDUFA II, FDA stated that, for applications in the first review  cycle, it would review and act on at least 90 percent of them within  specified timeframes\u20148 months for certain priority applications and 10  months for all other applications.

The Office of Generic Drugs is responsible for providing  regulatory oversight and strategic direction for FDA\u2019s generic drug  program to make safe, effective, and high-quality generic drugs available  to the public. The Office of Generic Drugs\u2019 Division of Filing Review  determines whether the generic drug application is acceptable for review,  meaning that the application is sufficiently complete for FDA to review the  application, such as information about the amount of active ingredients  present in the drug. If the generic drug application is not acceptable for  review, FDA issues a Refuse to Receive letter to the applicant explaining  what additional information is required before the application can be  accepted for review. In response, the applicant can resubmit the generic  drug application with additional information and officials within the  Division of Filing Review will assess the information and determine if the  resubmitted application is acceptable for review.", "Once the Division of Filing Review determines that a generic drug  application is acceptable for review, the first review cycle begins, and  FDA officials review the application across the following three review  disciplines:", "Bioequivalence.

Officials within the Office of Pharmaceutical  Quality have responsibility for ensuring the quality of drug products  and assessing all drug manufacturing facilities, including both  domestic and foreign. Officials within this office assess the risk of toxic  substances or bacterial content in the drug, among other things.", "All generic drug applications are reviewed by primary reviewers and  secondary reviewers. Primary reviewers assess the application to ensure  that the documentation meets regulatory requirements in their specific  disciplines. For example, primary reviewers within the Office of  Pharmaceutical Quality evaluate documentation related to the proposed  drug manufacturing process to ensure that the process produces quality  drugs consistently. Secondary reviewers ensure the quality and  consistency of primary reviewers\u2019 assessments and the clarity of  communication to applicants.", "During the first review cycle, FDA communicates with applicants when  issues arise during its review that may prevent the agency from approving  the generic drug application. This communication is typically made  through the issuance of information requests or discipline review letters:  Information requests. Information requests are letters sent to  applicants to request clarification or additional information that is  needed or would be helpful for FDA to complete its review. These  letters may be sent by any review discipline and can be sent at any  point after the Office of Generic Drugs accepts the generic drug  application for review.", "Discipline review letters. Discipline review letters are letters issued  by each review discipline at about the mid-point of the review cycle to  identify possible deficiencies.

We found that the sufficiency of the  generic drug application, including the completeness of the application  and the degree to which the applicants understood and fulfilled  application requirements, affected its likelihood of receiving an approval in  the first review cycle. According to FDA, one indication of the sufficiency  of the generic drug application is whether FDA had previously refused to receive the application for review because it was not substantially  complete upon its first submission. Our analysis of FDA data found that  applications that had previously been refused were slightly less likely to  be approved in the first review cycle compared with applications that had  not previously been refused, and rates of approvals decreased for  applications with two previously refused attempts. See table 1.", "According to stakeholders we interviewed, the sufficiency of a generic  drug application may partially reflect the level of experience the applicant  has in submitting applications, and we found some evidence to support  this explanation. FDA managers and reviewers said that, in general, less  experienced applicants are more likely to produce lower-quality generic  drug applications compared to applicants with relatively more experience.  Our analysis of FDA data found that applicants that submitted just one  application during fiscal years 2015 through 2017 had a slightly lower rate  of approval in the first review cycle (10 percent) compared to the rate  across all applicants (12 percent). Additionally, in our review of 35  selected generic drug applications, we identified three applications that  were from applicants that had no previously approved generic drug  application submissions, an indication that they may have little or no  experience with these applications. None of the three applications were  approved in the first review cycle. One of these applications elicited  reviewer comments that outlined basic application requirements,  potentially reflecting the lack of experience of the applicant.", "Drug quality deficiencies. Our review of documentation from the first  review cycle for 35 generic drug applications included 26 that were not  approved in that cycle. Among those 26 applications, the most common  deficiencies that remained at the end of the first cycle were related to the  quality of the drug\u2014356 out of 435 deficiencies. These deficiencies  included issues related to the drug manufacturing facilities, which can  affect the quality of the drug produced and the stability of the drug over  time, among others. Officials from one large applicant told us that most of  the comments they received from FDA reviewers are related to the quality  of the drug. Three out of five applicants we interviewed also noted that  the results from inspections of drug manufacturing facilities\u2014which FDA  includes as a component of its review of the quality of the drug\u2014are a  factor that may cause an application not to be approved in the first review  cycle. Among the 26 applications we reviewed that were not approved,  eight had an outstanding deficiency related to the manufacturing facility.", "Type of drug. We also found that the rate of approval in the first review  cycle differed based on certain characteristics of the type of drug  reviewed, including the route of administration, which may indicate the  complexity of the drug. Complexity can also be influenced by other factors  including, for example, the drug\u2019s active ingredient or formulation. FDA  officials noted that some complex drugs\u2014including those that combine  drug products with drug delivery devices, such as asthma inhalers\u2014are  less likely to be approved in the first review cycle. Officials we interviewed  from one large applicant\u2014which we identified based on the number of  approved generic drug applications it had in fiscal year 2018\u2014reported  that their company had never submitted a generic drug application for a  complex drug product that received approval in the first review cycle  despite having significant experience with producing complex drugs.  Officials we interviewed from another applicant said that very few of its  dermatological products, which are considered complex, had received  approval in the first review cycle.", "In our review of FDA data, we also found that applications for drugs with  certain routes of administration\u2014the method by which the drug is taken,  such as oral, topical, or intravenous\u2014had different rates of approval in  the first review cycle. In particular, from fiscal years 2015 through 2017,  FDA reviewed generic drug applications for 41 ophthalmic and 20  transdermal drugs\u2014types of drugs that FDA considers complex\u2014and  none of these applications received approval in the first review cycle. In  contrast, generic drug applications for topical drugs, which FDA also  identifies as complex, had higher approval rates. Specifically, our analysis  found that the rate of approvals in the first review cycle for generic drug  applications for topical drugs was 25 percent\u2014more than double the rate  for all applications included in our analysis. FDA officials stated that in  recent years FDA released several product-specific guidances for topical  drugs\u2014technical guidance intended to help applicants identify the most  appropriate methodology for developing certain drugs and generating the  evidence needed to gain approval. FDA officials told us these guidances  may have contributed to the higher rates of approval in the first review  cycle for topical drugs. See table 2.", "Generic drug application priority review designation. In addition, we  found that a generic drug application\u2019s priority review status may affect  the rate of approval in the first review cycle. FDA may grant priority review  status to applications under several circumstances, including for the first  generics of brand-name drugs and other designations, such as for drugs  that could help address public health emergencies. Our analysis of FDA  data found that the rates of approval in the first cycle were lower for  applications for first generics than for applications with no priority  designation\u20146 percent and 14 percent, respectively. One potential  explanation for the relatively low rate of approval is that for a first generic,  applicants have a financial incentive to be the first to submit an  application to FDA. Officials from one trade association stated that  applications for first generics may be of lower quality because the  applicants are rushing to submit their applications. In other cases,  priority designations were associated with higher first-cycle approval  rates. First-cycle approval rates for applications with other types of priority  designations were higher than for applications with no priority  designation\u201418 percent for applications that were marked as priority for  other reasons, such as drug shortages or public health emergencies.

In presentations to applicants and others,  FDA officials have presented information about generic drug  application reviews and deficiencies frequently identified in generic  drug applications. FDA has posted some of these presentation  materials, including several video recordings, publicly on its website to  share the information with industry.", "Communication during the review cycle. FDA has changed its  review process to encourage reviewers to communicate with  applicants at about the mid-point of the review cycle. FDA reviewers  now aim to issue discipline review letters at about the mid-point of the  first review cycle, rather than waiting until the end of the review cycle  to communicate deficiencies. According to FDA, these earlier  communications are intended to provide applicants with an  opportunity to address issues before the end of the first review cycle  and facilitate more approvals during that cycle.", "Assistance with applications for complex drugs. FDA has taken  steps to assist applicants developing generics of complex drugs, such  as drugs with complex active ingredients, formulations, or routes of  administration. Beginning in fiscal year 2018 when GDUFA II was  implemented, applicants developing complex drugs may request  meetings with FDA prior to submitting a generic drug application and  at the mid-point of the review cycle. In addition, FDA officials told us  that since fiscal year 2013 when GDUFA was implemented, the  agency has released 378 product-specific guidance documents  focused on complex drugs.", "While all five applicants we interviewed generally described FDA\u2019s efforts  to increase communication as helpful, they offered opportunities for  improvement. For example, four out of the five applicants said that  product-specific guidance helps them understand exactly what the  requirements are for product development, which can facilitate approval  in the first review cycle. However, two of these applicants also said that  FDA does not obtain sufficient input from the generic drug industry when  developing product-specific guidance documents. To increase  transparency, stakeholders said that FDA could solicit industry input to  avoid proposing unrealistic guidance and one stakeholder suggested that  FDA could create a workgroup to prevent unintended consequences  following the implementation of new and revised guidance. However, FDA  officials told us that draft guidance documents have a public comment  period for stakeholders to provide comments on guidances before they  are finalized.", "In December 2017, we similarly found that stakeholders indicated they  would benefit from greater transparency in FDA\u2019s process for developing  guidance. We recommended that FDA publicly announce the agency\u2019s  plans for issuing new and revised product-specific guidance for  nonbiological complex drugs within the next year. FDA agreed with this  recommendation and published a website in April 2019 that provides  information about upcoming product-specific guidance documents for  complex generic drugs.", "In addition, all five applicants we interviewed said that FDA has improved  communication with them, such as by increasing the frequency and timing  of communications, and two applicants indicated that discipline review  letters add predictability to the review process. (See app. I for more  information on FDA\u2019s changes to the generic drug application review  process to improve communication with applicants.) While all five  applicants we interviewed generally agreed that the increased  communications would help increase rates of first-cycle approval, they  also suggested that additional flexibility to communicate with FDA  informally mid-cycle, such as by phone, could further facilitate the review  process by helping applicants respond to questions or get clarity on  questions included in the information requests or discipline review letters.  FDA officials told us that applicants currently can request teleconferences  with FDA, such as after receiving a complete response letter; however,  they also noted that applicants generally prefer email communications  and such teleconferences are not frequently utilized.", "FDA has also taken steps to improve consistency among reviewers.  These steps could facilitate more approvals in the first review cycle  because receiving consistent comments from FDA reviewers typically  makes it easier for applicants to respond more quickly, which\u2014according  to some stakeholders\u2014can result in approval in the first review cycle.  These changes include the following:", "Creating review templates.

According to FDA\u2019s Manual of  Policies and Procedures, these templates are intended to increase  reviewers\u2019 efficiency and improve assessment consistency.", "Developing common phrases. FDA also issued internal guidance on  common phrases that reviewers may use to communicate generic  drug application deficiencies in their comments to applicants during  the first review cycle. For example, officials from the Division of  Labeling Review said they maintain a database of common phrases  and train reviewers on how to explain deficiencies to applicants.

However, all five  applicants we interviewed noticed inconsistency among reviewers.  FDA officials and two applicants suggested that this may be because  FDA reviewers have different professional backgrounds. One  applicant noted that some reviewers benefit from visiting  manufacturing facilities if they do not have prior experience in the  generic drug industry.

While FDA has taken steps to  improve consistency among generic drug application reviewers,  stakeholders noted that inconsistencies persist, and these inconsistencies  may influence whether an application is approved during the first review  cycle. For example, most stakeholders we interviewed (three out of five  trade associations and four out of five applicants) indicated that they were  aware of examples when different FDA reviewers within the same review  discipline provided substantively different assessments of similar generic  drug applications, specifically by requesting additional information from  applicants for some applications and not others. For example, one  applicant cited an example of two similar topical drugs whose applications  relied on the same data set. The reviewer for one application required  additional data, while the reviewer for the other application did not. To  improve consistency, four applicants we interviewed suggested that FDA  improve its reviewer training and one suggested that FDA create a  workgroup to examine and address inconsistencies among reviewers.", "Four of the five applicants we interviewed also reported variation in the  consistency of reviewers\u2019 comments, including a lack of clarity in the  information required for the applicant to address the comments.

This manual describes a standard process for FDA  reviewers to use when assessing the completeness of generic drug  applications, including clearly communicating with applicants about  deficiencies that must be corrected for their applications to be approved in  order to reduce the number of review cycles. According to the manual,  primary reviewers are responsible for assessing whether applications  meet the regulatory requirements for approval, while secondary reviewers  are responsible for ensuring consistency among assessments and quality  of communications to the applicant. Further, the manual advises primary  and secondary reviewers to ensure that comments to applicants about  deficiencies include similar content. The manual also indicates that  comments should include the following four elements: (1) refer to a  specific location within the generic drug application; (2) identify the  omitted information or explain the problem with the information submitted;  (3) explain the actions necessary to resolve the deficiency; and (4)  explain why the information or revision is needed. Finally, FDA provides  reviewers with plain language writing guidelines and other writing  resources to support the development of clear messages for external  communications.", "In our review of documentation from the first review cycle for 35 generic  drug applications, we found variation in the clarity and specificity of some  reviewer comments that may have influenced the outcome of the first  review cycle. For example, some discipline review letters included clear  descriptions of potential remedies for some deficiencies, while others did  not clearly describe the deficiency or FDA\u2019s expectations for an  approvable generic drug application. Of the 35 generic drug applications,  we conducted a more detailed review of four applications from fiscal year  2018\u2014two that received approval in the first review cycle and two that did  not. In the two applications that were not approved in the first review  cycle, we identified 32 instances in which the comments did not fully meet  FDA\u2019s criteria.", "Two of the four applications we reviewed in more detail had similar  numbers and types of deficiencies identified in the discipline review letters  sent to the applicants mid-way through the first review cycle, such as  quality deficiencies related to the drug substance and drug product, but  the clarity and content of the comments included in the discipline review  letters varied considerably. For one of the applications, the comments were written clearly and, consistent with FDA\u2019s Manual of Policies and  Procedures, identified options for addressing the deficiencies. For the  other application, the comments were less clear and did not clearly  identify ways to address the deficiencies. The applicant of the generic  drug application with clearly written comments resolved all of the  deficiencies raised in their discipline review letter and the generic drug  application was approved in the first review cycle. In contrast, the  applicant of the other application did not resolve all deficiencies raised in  their discipline review letter and was not approved in the first cycle. See  Table 4 for more detail on these two examples.", "Inconsistency among reviewers could affect the rate of approvals in the  first review cycle if comments provided to applicants differ in content or  are not clearly communicated. For example, if some reviewers provide  unclear comments, it could be more difficult for the applicant to address  deficiencies in a timely manner, while applicants that received clear  comments could potentially address deficiencies within the first review  cycle. This could delay some generic drugs from entering the market if  applicants require more time, including potentially additional FDA review  cycles, to understand and respond to unclear comments. This has  potential impacts on patient access to generic drugs and on applicants\u2019  abilities to effectively manage their expectations for when their generic  drug applications will be approved.", "FDA officials explained that although secondary reviewers are  experienced, they do not consistently receive additional training to ensure  clarity and consistency among primary reviewers. They noted that FDA  offers training in clear writing for FDA employees but it is not required for  reviewers. FDA managers noted that some inconsistency among  reviewers may persist due to various factors such as tenure with the  agency and different professional backgrounds or interpretations of the  generic drug application information. They also said that standardizing  reviewers\u2019 writing is challenging since each reviewer might have his or  her own writing style and scientific expertise. Two applicants and one  trade association we interviewed also said that the length of reviewers\u2019  tenure with the agency could impact the substance of their comments in  information requests and discipline review letters and the likelihood of the  applicant attaining approval in the first review cycle. For example, one  trade association we interviewed said that inexperienced reviewers  typically request information from applicants that a more experienced  reviewer would already know, such as information about drug  manufacturing facilities.", "Unknown effects of labeling changes. Three applicants we interviewed  noted that they believe FDA could improve the rate of approvals during  the first review cycle if they took steps to mitigate delays that  stakeholders said result from brand-name drug labeling changes that  occur mid-cycle. Because generic drug labels generally must match  brand-name labels, most applicants we interviewed said that changes  made by brand-name drug companies to the labeling of drugs during the  review process can delay or prevent approval of generic drugs in the first  review cycle because the applicant of the generic drug would likely need  to update the label before it is approved. In addition, five of the 10  stakeholders we interviewed said they believe such labeling changes  negatively impact the rate of first-cycle approvals, and three said they  believe that brand-name companies may strategically time updates to a  brand-name drug\u2019s labeling to occur right before the approval of a generic  competitor in order to delay generic drug approvals.", "Although our review of 35 selected applications did not identify examples  where labeling changes made during the first review cycle were the only  factor that prevented approval, we identified two instances where labeling  changes were among multiple factors that prevented approval.  Specifically, we identified two applications for which the complete  response letters noted recent changes in the brand-name drug\u2019s labeling  as one of multiple factors that contributed to the generic drug application\u2019s  failure to receive approval in the first review cycle. One of these  applications had successfully addressed several labeling deficiencies  during the first review cycle, but received a complete response letter that  included new labeling deficiencies because of recent changes in the  brand-name drug\u2019s labeling.", "Three applicants and one trade association identified labeling changes as  a concern during our interviews. Two of these applicants and the trade  association suspected updates are strategically timed to delay generic  drug approvals. However, FDA does not know whether there is validity to  these concerns because it has not conducted analysis that would enable  it to assess their validity. FDA officials noted that they were aware of  these types of concerns, but thought it would be difficult for brand-name  drug companies to successfully time changes in their drugs\u2019 labeling to  affect applications under review, and that labeling changes for brand- name drugs must be justified, for example, to note an adverse reaction  identified after approval. However, FDA officials also acknowledged that  there may be an incentive for brand-name drug companies to change the  label on a drug frequently to make it more difficult for a generic drug  application to be approved.", "FDA officials stated that the Office of Generic Drugs does not assess how  often brand-name companies change their labeling or track how often  such labeling changes occur because such changes are reviewed by the  Office of New Drugs. Further, while FDA officials noted that the two  offices have coordinated on the review of some labeling changes, they  stated that they do not coordinate on the timing of approval of brand- name drug label changes. This is inconsistent with federal internal control  standards, which state that agencies should identify risks that affect their  defined objectives and use quality information to achieve these  objectives, including by identifying the information required to achieve the  objectives and address related risks. In addition, FDA can approve a  generic drug application even though changes have been made in the  brand-name drug labeling that the applicant has not incorporated into its  proposed labeling, provided the applicant meets certain criteria; however,  FDA officials told us that applications rarely meet the required criteria.  Conducting an assessment of the extent to which the timing of such  changes affect the approval of generic drugs in the first cycle of review  would provide FDA with the necessary information to respond to  stakeholder concerns and take action, as appropriate, such as by  coordinating with the Office of New Drugs on this issue. To the extent that  brand-name companies\u2019 labeling changes are creating unnecessary  delays in generic drug approval, such delays may impede generic drug  entry into the market, which would be inconsistent with FDA\u2019s stated  goals of speeding up generic drug reviews."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The timely approval of safe generic drugs in FDA\u2019s first review cycle can  provide substantial cost savings to patients and third-party payers. Since  the enactment of GDUFA, FDA has taken steps to help applicants submit  stronger generic drug applications and correct deficiencies within the first  review cycle. However, according to FDA its most recent analysis found  that the average generic drug application required three cycles of review  before approval. Opportunities exist to enhance FDA\u2019s efforts to increase  the rates of approval for generic drugs in the first review cycle, including  improving the consistency and clarity of reviewer comments and  assessing the effects of the timing of brand-name companies\u2019 changes to  labeling.", "Taking such steps could help FDA meet the agency\u2019s goals of minimizing  the number of review cycles necessary for generic drug application  approval and increasing the overall rate of approval, including within the  first review cycle.
