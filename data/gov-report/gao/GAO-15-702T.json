During these tests, the Marketplace approved subsidized coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) for 11 of the 12 fictitious GAO applicants for 2014. The GAO applicants obtained a total of about $30,000 in annual advance premium tax credits, plus eligibility for lower costs due at time of service. For 7 of the 11 successful fictitious applicants, GAO intentionally did not submit all required verification documentation to the Marketplace, but the Marketplace did not cancel subsidized coverage for these applicants. While these subsidies, including those granted to GAO's fictitious applicants, are paid to health-care insurers, and not directly to enrolled consumers, they nevertheless represent a benefit to consumers and a cost to the government. GAO's undercover testing, while illustrative, cannot be generalized to the population of all applicants or enrollees. GAO shared details of its observations with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) during the course of its testing, to seek agency responses to the issues raised. Other observations included the following:", "The Marketplace did not accurately record all inconsistencies. Inconsistencies occur when applicant information does not match information available from Marketplace verification sources. Also, the Marketplace resolved inconsistencies from GAO's fictitious applications based on fictitious documentation that GAO submitted. Overall, according to CMS officials, the Marketplace did not terminate any coverage for several types of inconsistencies, including Social Security data or incarceration status.", "Under PPACA, filing a federal income-tax return is a key control element, designed to ensure that premium subsidies granted at time of application are appropriate based on reported applicant earnings during the coverage year. GAO, however, found errors in information reported by the Marketplace for tax filing purposes for 3 of its 11 fictitious enrollees, such as incorrect coverage periods and subsidy amounts.", "The Marketplace automatically reenrolled coverage for all 11 fictitious enrollees for 2015.

However, for five of the six terminations, GAO subsequently obtained reinstatements, including increases in premium tax-credit subsidies.", "For an additional six applicants, GAO sought to test the extent to which, if any, in-person assisters would encourage applicants to misstate income in order to qualify for income-based subsidies during coverage year 2014. However, GAO was unable to obtain in-person assistance in 5 of the 6 undercover attempts. For example, an assister told GAO that it only provided help for those applying for Medicaid and not health-care insurance applications.

We  presented preliminary results in July 2014. Among other things, PPACA  provides subsidies to those eligible to purchase private health-insurance  plans who meet certain income and other requirements, and with those  subsidies and other costs, represents a significant, long-term fiscal  commitment for the federal government. According to the Congressional  Budget Office, the estimated cost of subsidies and related spending  under the act is $28 billion for fiscal year 2015, rising to $103 billion for  fiscal year 2025, and totaling $849 billion for fiscal years 2016\u20132025.  While subsidies under the act are not paid directly to enrollees,  participants nevertheless benefit through reduced monthly premiums or  lower costs due at time of service, such as copayments. Because subsidy  costs are contingent on who obtains coverage, enrollment controls that  help ensure only qualified applicants are approved for coverage with  subsidies are a key factor in determining federal expenditures under the  act.", "PPACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, expands the availability of  subsidized health-care coverage, and provides for the establishment of  health-insurance exchanges, or marketplaces, to assist consumers in  comparing and selecting among insurance plans offered by participating  private issuers of health-care coverage. Under PPACA, states may elect  to operate their own health-care exchanges, or may rely on the federally  facilitated exchange, known to the public as HealthCare.gov. These  marketplaces were intended to provide a single point of access for  individuals to enroll in private health plans, apply for income-based  subsidies to offset the cost of these plans\u2014which are paid directly to  health-insurance issuers\u2014and, as applicable, obtain an eligibility  determination for other health coverage programs, such as Medicaid or  the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. The Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS) is responsible for overseeing the establishment of these online  marketplaces, and the agency maintains the federally facilitated  exchange.

We obtained the advance premium tax credit (APTC) in all cases, totaling  about $2,500 monthly or about $30,000 annually for all 11 applicants.  After receiving these premium subsidies, our 11 fictitious applicants paid  premiums at a total annual rate of about $12,000. We also obtained  eligibility for cost-sharing reduction (CSR) subsidies. The APTC and  CSR subsidies are not paid directly to enrolled consumers; instead, the  federal government pays them to issuers of health-care policies on  consumers\u2019 behalf.

Specifically, CMS directed its document contractor not to terminate  policies or subsidies if an applicant submitted any documentation to the  Marketplace.

An applicant can then decide if he  or she wants all, some, or none of the estimated credit paid in advance, in  the form of payment to the applicant\u2019s insurer that reduces the applicant\u2019s  monthly premium payment.", "If an applicant chooses to have all or some of his or her credit paid in  advance, the applicant is required to \u201creconcile\u201d on his or her federal tax  return the amount of advance payments the government sent to the  applicant\u2019s insurer on the applicant\u2019s behalf with the tax credit for which  the applicant qualifies based on actual reported income and family size.", "To facilitate this reconciliation process, the Marketplace sends enrollees  Form 1095-A, which reports, among other things, the amount of advance  premium tax credit paid on behalf of the enrollee.

In all three cases,  the forms did not accurately reflect the number of months of coverage,  thus misstating the advance premium tax credits received. In one of the  cases, for instance, the form did not include a couple of months of  advance premium tax credit that was received and, as a result,  understated the advance premium tax credit received by more than $600.  Appendix V shows complete results for tax forms we received. Because  we did not provide CMS with detailed information about the specific  cases, CMS officials said they could not conduct research and explain   In two cases, we received multiple forms  why these errors occurred.

In discussions  with CMS and IRS officials, we found that the federal government has not  established a process to identify and recover the value of CSR subsidies  that have been provided to our fictitious enrollees improperly. These  subsidies increase government costs; and, according to IRS, excess CSR  payments, if not recovered by CMS, would be taxable income to the  individual for whom the payment was made.

However, we had not filed any such  applications, nor, as described earlier, had we sought any  redetermination of subsidies.

We were  told we could not speak with the caseworker, and it could take the  caseworker up to 30 days to resolve the issue.
