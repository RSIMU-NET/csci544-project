Much has changed since the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 and  the Classification Act of 1949 laid the foundation of much of today\u2019s  federal personnel system. Agencies\u2019 missions have evolved and  employees\u2019 expectations of work and the workplace are changing. Recent  publications by the administration and others have raised concerns about  whether the government\u2019s employment policies and practices are still  relevant and desirable to the current and future workforce.

We first added federal strategic human capital  management to our list of high-risk government programs and operations  in 2001. Although Congress, the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM), and individual agencies have made improvements since then,  federal human capital management remains a high-risk area because  mission-critical skills gaps within the federal workforce pose a high risk to  the nation.

The federal workforce will  need to develop new skill sets and expertise to effectively utilize and  manage these technological advances.", "In 2017, we convened a forum that highlighted several applications of  artificial intelligence, many of which could affect agencies and federal  work. For example, robots enabled by artificial intelligence could assist  patients with medication management and mobility support in clinical  settings; developments in automated vehicles could affect work related to  government vehicle pools, safety, and transportation management; the  use of artificial intelligence in criminal justice and cybersecurity  applications could bring benefits but would need to be carefully managed  with regard to privacy protection, among other concerns; and the  accelerated pace of change associated with artificial intelligence may  strain workforce systems\u2019 capacity to train and hire individuals with  appropriate skill sets.", "Technology is also changing human capital management, according to  experts we contacted. Experts stated that technology can help improve  recruitment efforts, streamline hiring processes, and match employees to  tasks. For example, they said that employers can develop mobile apps to  make the hiring process easier to navigate and use artificial intelligence to  better screen and align applicants with job positions. Experts also stated  that employees will need to constantly update their digital literacy to stay  current with emerging technology.", "OPM has also explored the effect of technology on the federal workforce.  In February 2018, OPM reported that, in most jobs, certain activities may  be automated rather than the entire occupation. OPM also reported that  machine assistance may amplify the value of expertise and may increase  work capacity by providing employees time to focus on more important  work. Further, OPM reported that it is seeking to acquire or develop  enterprise technological solutions to improve the analytic capabilities of  the federal human capital community. Improved data analytics should  help support more informed and evidence-based planning and decision- making.", "OPM suggested that the technological changes will require agencies to  coordinate efforts to (1) fund technological experimentation and pilots; (2)  promote acquisition of skills that are not replaced by technology (e.g.,  creativity, relationship building, and innovation); and (3) engage in  strategic foresight activities. Relatedly, OPM, the Office of Management  and Budget, and the Department of Defense are developing a plan to  identify ways to provide employees impacted by automation with other  work, and to identify skills needed in the future. The agencies\u2019 efforts are  part of the cross-agency priority goal on the 21st century workforce.", "Federal work is also being affected by increased use of virtual  communication, which provides flexibility in where employees can do their  work. In both the workforce-at-large and the federal workforce, the  percentage of employees who telework has increased. For example,  OPM reported that the percent of eligible employees teleworking  increased from 29 percent in 2012 to 51 percent in 2016.", "We have previously reported that the federal government has increasingly  recognized telework as an important human capital strategy that can give  employees more work-life balance and help agencies continue operations  during emergency events. However, federal agencies also face costs  associated with telework, including training staff, ensuring supervisors  have the necessary skills to manage remote staff, and overseeing the  telework program to ensure compliance and reduce the risk of fraud. In  July 2016, we found that OPM provided resources to agencies to help  them with their telework programs, but was missing other opportunities to  help agencies better identify the net cost savings associated with their  telework programs.", "We recommended that OPM work with the Chief Human Capital Officers  Council to provide clarifying guidance on options for developing  supporting data for benefits and costs associated with agency telework  programs.

In addition, agencies use contractors to provide the  skills needed to help them manage complex operations. In fiscal year  2017, federal agencies obligated almost $306 billion for service contracts.  Contractors can help agencies meet surge capacity needs, among other  benefits. However, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and our prior  work have identified risks of overreliance on contractors and the need for  increased management attention on certain types of services, such as  professional and management support services.", "In addition to using grants and contractors, Congress has given broad  statutory authority across the executive branch to use various open  innovation strategies. Open innovation involves using various tools and  approaches to harness the ideas, expertise, and resources of those outside an organization to address an issue or achieve specific goals. Our  October 2016 report highlighted cases where agencies are using open  innovation strategies\u2014such as crowdsourcing and prize competitions\u2014to  effectively engage and collaborate with each other, and to leverage  knowledge outside the federal workforce to achieve their goals.", "For example, at the time we found that every 2 years since 2009 the  Federal Highway Administration had engaged a broad range of public-  and private-sector stakeholders to identify and implement innovative  ideas that measurably improved highway construction projects. Federal  workers in charge of such open innovation initiatives will need to be able  to work in collaborative, cross-cutting environments. To that end, in June  2017, we identified various government-wide and agency-level resources  \u2014such as interagency communities of practice and dedicated staff  positions\u2014the executive branch has put into place to support effective  implementation of open innovation initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fiscal Constraints", "paragraphs": ["Increasing fiscal constraints require agencies to reevaluate and  reprioritize what the federal government does, how it does business, and,  as appropriate, who conducts its business.

The Bureau is redesigning its approach to the 2020 Census to address  rising costs and declining response rates. In May 2017, we reported that  the basic design of the enumeration\u2014mail out and mail back of the  census questionnaire with in-person follow-up for nonrespondents\u2014has  been in use since 1970. However, this traditional design is no longer  capable of cost effectively counting the population, and the Bureau has  fundamentally reexamined its approach for conducting the 2020 Census.  For example, the Bureau is planning to offer households the option of  responding to the survey through the internet.", "The Bureau is also leveraging nonfederal partners and technology to  respond to evolving mission requirements. For example, the Bureau plans  to enhance its work with nonfederal partners to successfully complete the  enumeration, particularly for hard-to-count groups, such as minorities,  renters, and young children. In July 2018, we reported that to facilitate  this effort, the Bureau plans to hire nearly twice as many partnership  specialists as it had planned for the 2010 Census.", "These partnership specialists will need core relationship-building skills  and advanced knowledge of digital media. However, the Bureau faces a  significant challenge in hiring staff with these skills because it is operating  in a much tighter labor market than it did prior to the 2010 Census.  Likewise, the Bureau has had difficulty filling key positions to oversee  information technology contracts. In August 2018, we reported that a  government program management office is managing the contractor that  will integrate all of the Bureau\u2019s key systems and infrastructure for the  decennial. However, in June 2018, Bureau officials reported that 33 of  the office\u2019s 58 federal employee positions were vacant.

While  the percentage of federal employees 40 years and older remained  relatively flat, the federal workforce had a higher percentage of individuals  who are 40 and older compared to the U.S. employed civilian labor force.  The federal workforce had a higher percentage of people with a disability,  who were veterans, or held an advanced degree (see figure 3).", "Agencies face a potential risk related to retirement, particularly among the  Senior Executive Service (SES). Specifically, we found that retirement  rates for SES employees are higher than for all employees, with 7 to 8  percent of SES retiring every year for the past 6 years (see figure 4).  Cumulatively, 41 percent of the permanent SES workforce in fiscal year  2012 retired by fiscal year 2017. If turnover is not strategically managed  and succession plans are not in place, gaps can develop in an agency\u2019s  institutional knowledge and leadership as experienced employees retire.  While retirements can aggravate the problem of skill gaps, they also  present an opportunity for agencies to realign their workforce with needed  skills and leadership levels to better meet existing and newly emerging  mission requirements.", "Based on expert interviews, we also identified shifts in employee attitudes  toward work, which present recruiting opportunities and challenges for the  federal government. Experts said that employees seek meaningful work (i.e., work that can influence the greater society); autonomy within the workplace (i.e., opportunities to develop creative  and innovative solutions to complex problems);  control over their work environment (i.e., they want to set a schedule  and to work in a location that provides work-life balance); and  career mobility, including opportunities for upward mobility (i.e.,  promotions) and lateral mobility (i.e., opportunities to rotate to different  roles or projects within the same agency, a different agency, or  outside of government).", "Related to career mobility, experts said that employees are seeking  greater developmental opportunities and would prefer longer-term  employment where they can continue to build their skills and train.  Experts noted that while employees change jobs more often than in the  past, this phenomenon can be a result of employers investing less in  employee development, which has led to greater turnover. OPM also  recently reported that millennials are known for frequently transitioning  from one job to the next.", "While federal agencies offer unique opportunities to pursue meaningful  work, achieve autonomy, and have a healthy work-life balance, experts  also highlighted key challenges regarding perceptions surrounding federal  work from the potential applicants. These challenges include perceptions  that the government is too bureaucratic, federal work lacks innovation and  involves maintaining the status quo, federal work is less prestigious than  the private sector, and federal workers do not get to see the immediate  effect of their work. Officials from federal employee and manager groups  believed that furloughs, government shutdowns, pay freezes, and  negative rhetoric from elected officials have all contributed to the negative  perceptions among potential applicants. For example, from December 22,  2018, to January 25, 2019, a partial government shutdown occurred as a  result of a lapse in appropriations affecting some, but not all federal  agencies. It was the second multiweek lapse in appropriations causing a  government shutdown since 2013 and the longest shutdown in American  history. Federal employees at the affected agencies did not receive a  paycheck during the government shutdown. Experts we interviewed  noted that the perception of job security offered by federal work is  attractive to employees. However, prolonged shutdowns may alter this  perception and harm the government\u2019s recruitment and retention efforts.", "Given the changing demographic composition of the federal workforce  and shifting attitudes toward work, our analysis suggested that it may be  important to select and train managers and supervisors who possess  several leadership competencies. These competencies include fostering  an inclusive workplace (valuing diversity and individual differences and  leveraging these differences to achieve the agency\u2019s mission); team  building (inspiring and fostering team commitment, spirit, pride, and trust);  interpersonal skills (treating others with courtesy, sensitivity, and respect);    and managing conflict (encouraging differing opinions to be expressed  and resolving disagreements in a constructive manner).

Consequently, these agencies\u2019 human  capital efforts tend to focus on support and transactional activities and  compliance with rules and regulations. While these functions are  important, successful strategic human capital management requires  human capital professionals to integrate human capital strategies with  their agency\u2019s core business practices.

This  level of detail does not adequately address the multidisciplinary nature of  modern work. For example, cybersecurity spans many occupational  families. Similarly, with technological advances, agencies may need  interdisciplinary talent such as workforce specialists in information  technology. Agencies may be better able to assess gaps in such talent by  defining, developing, and deploying workers based on skills and  competencies, not by occupational series.", "According to the Department of Defense Civilian Human Capital Officer,  agencies can assess gaps in skills and competencies through functional  communities, in which experienced leaders in areas such as acquisition  or financial management define, assess, and determine how to distribute  skills and competencies in the workforce.

She also said that a  mature functional community can help align workforce planning to agency  strategic goals and objectives.", "In January 2015, we recommended that OPM work with agency CHCOs  to (1) establish a schedule specifying when OPM will modify its Enterprise  Human Resources Integration (EHRI) database to capture staffing data  that it currently collects from agencies through its annual workforce data  reporting process; and (2) bolster agencies\u2019 ability to assess workforce  skills and competencies by sharing competency surveys, lessons learned,  and other tools and resources. In December 2018, OPM released a  memorandum outlining plans for a phased, government-wide competency  assessment of program and project managers beginning in May 2019.  Additionally, in March 2019, OPM reported that it had identified a data  source that was more efficient and accurate in identifying staffing gaps  than EHRI data.

In our prior work, we have noted the  importance of active campus recruiting that goes beyond infrequent  outreach to college campuses. Active campus recruiting includes  developing long-term institutional relationships with faculty,  administrators, and students.

This includes developing strategic partnerships with a  diverse range of colleges and universities, trade schools, apprentice  programs, and affinity organizations from across the country.", "Likewise, representatives of consulting firms we interviewed stated they  cultivate a talent pipeline by building a brand on campus, developing  relationships with college students, and recruiting on campuses for entry- level positions and internship programs. One consulting firm  representative said that the firm sends \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d to build  relationships with college freshmen and sophomores, and to discuss  working in the professional services industry. Another consulting firm  representative said that the firm uses social media to develop  relationships with students prior to a campus visit. Consulting firm  representatives also noted that they expanded their talent pool by visiting  technical conferences, veteran groups, and campuses with students of  diverse backgrounds.", "Consulting firm representatives stated that their internship programs are  among their most successful practices for cultivating a talent pipeline  because the firms can offer full-time positions to rising seniors during the  internship. Similarly, CHCOs and federal employee and management  group representatives we interviewed noted that internships are important  for establishing a pipeline for recruitment.", "Highlight agency mission. Agencies can help counter negative  perceptions of federal work by promoting their missions and innovative  work, according to expert and CHCO interviews. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides \u201cDay in the Life\u201d  information on its work to promote public awareness of how its everyday  tasks tie in with its mission of protecting the United States, according to  the DHS CHCO. The DHS CHCO stated that promoting agency mission  can be done while cultivating a talent pipeline and assessing applicants\u2019  abilities. For example, the department holds recruitment events where  potential candidates can participate in law enforcement-related activities  such as fitness testing. The CHCO noted that in addition to promoting  homeland security careers, these events help prospective candidates  determine if a position is a good fit for them.", "Recruit continuously and start the hiring process early in the school  year. The ability to hire students is critical to ensuring that agencies have  a range of experience levels for succession planning and a talent pipeline  to meet mission requirements. One of the key challenges agencies face  in recruiting students is managing the timing of recruitment. The federal  fiscal year begins on October 1\u2014about when private sector firms we  interviewed start recruiting on campus. Frequently, however, federal  agencies have been unable to hire at this time of year because of the  limitations of continuing resolutions. Yet if agencies wait to start the  recruiting and hiring process until they receive funding, many graduates  will have taken other job opportunities.", "Agencies can overcome these timing challenges by recruiting  continuously and starting the hiring process early in the school year. To  recruit continuously, CHCOs from the U.S. Departments of Agriculture  and Homeland Security said they advertise funding-conditional positions  throughout the year. Similarly, representatives of some consulting firms  said they post positions that are contingent on funding and complete the  hiring paperwork, among other requirements, for these positions before  obtaining federal funding. This has helped navigate the timing of annual  appropriations because these organizations can onboard candidates as  soon as they receive funding.", "Representatives of one federal management group also stated that  recruiting continuously and starting the hiring process earlier is a good  practice even when agencies receive funding in October, since it can  reduce stress from cumbersome recruiting and hiring work when a  position needs to be filled.", "Strategically leverage available hiring flexibilities. CHCOs cited the  complex competitive examining process as a cause of the lengthy hiring  time. This has been a long-standing concern: In our 2002 report on  human capital flexibilities, we noted that for many years prior, federal  managers had complained that competitive examining procedures were  rigid and complex.", "However, agencies can use a number of additional hiring authorities  beyond competitive examining. These authorities can add flexibility to  the process and CHCOs expressed a desire for more. However, we  previously found that agencies relied on only a small number of available  authorities.

OPM agreed with our recommendation and has made progress in these areas, although more work is needed. As of July 2018,  OPM had started a project to review hiring authority data and to create an  inventory of authorities used by agencies. In its July 2018 study on  excepted service hiring authorities, OPM identified possible opportunities  to streamline authorities and outlined planned actions to promote a more  effective and efficient hiring process. As of December 2018, OPM said  that it continues to research and examine these streamlining opportunities  as part of the broader initiative to modernize federal hiring practices under  the President\u2019s Management Agenda.

CHCOs and  OPM officials stated that roadblocks to hiring the right skills include issues  with assessment methods. Specifically, agencies may use methods that  are less relevant for assessing the desired skills or agencies may  experience issues incorporating multiple assessments in the hiring  process. For example, one CHCO said that her agency uses multiple- choice questions to assess candidates, but essay questions more  effectively assess the skills she seeks. OPM issued guidance to agencies  on how to use additional assessment methods, including how to rank  applicants.", "Additionally, federal employee and management group representatives  said agencies could reduce the time of the assessment process by  sharing hiring lists. The Competitive Service Act of 2015 allows agencies  to share hiring lists, but agencies have only started to pilot the practice  within departments, according to OPM officials. OPM and agencies  discussed sharing hiring certificates with the CHCO Council, and OPM is  planning virtual training sessions on this topic.

According to officials from the Australian  Public Service Commission, Australian agencies previously relied on  interviews as the main assessment method. However, the Australian  Public Service Commission encouraged agencies to use a range of  different assessment methods, such as prescreening questionnaires,  video interviews, and technical multiple-choice questions. As a result,  officials stated that Australian agencies interview fewer but more suitable  candidates, which can save time and resources. Also, Australian  agencies can hire from a list of candidates that one agency already  determined to be qualified in certain skills.", "Improve the security clearance process. The security clearance  process can contribute to onboarding delays, according to CHCOs. For  example, at one agency, the CHCO said it takes applicants more than  400 days to receive their security clearances.

We previously reported that to develop a  culture of agility, agencies need to be able to (1) identify the skills  available in their existing workforces, and (2) move people with specific  skills to address emergency, temporary, or permanent needs within and  across the agencies. Agencies can develop a culture of agility to meet  mission needs by supporting rotational assignments for employees. For  example, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission established an oversight  board when it faced a period of downsizing and could not hire externally  as a result of contraction within the nuclear industry, according to the  agency CHCO. This board helped ensure that employees with the  required skill sets were considered first before an approval to hire would  be granted.

However,  OPM\u2019s 2018 Federal Work-Life Survey Governmentwide Report found  that one of the most commonly reported reasons employees do not  participate in work-life programs is lack of program awareness among  employees and supervisors. For example, 23 percent of those who did  not participate in the employee assistance program said they were  unaware of the program services.", "Some agencies are addressing this issue by advertising and helping  employees use available benefits, work-life balance programs, and other  resources. For example, the National Science Foundation offers  employees many opportunities to learn about existing benefits, according  to the foundation\u2019s CHCO. These opportunities include triannual  retirement seminars where employees receive personalized retirement  estimates, quarterly financial planning seminars where employees receive  a free 1-hour consultation, and annual benefit fairs where employees can  learn about various health care providers, the work-life programs, and the  employee assistance program.", "Tailor benefits and incentives to employees\u2019 needs. Our analysis of  CHCO and expert interviews also found that employees may value  different benefits and incentives depending on their stage in life.

For example, the Social Security Administration\u2019s CHCO said  that the agency\u2019s younger workers value work-life and wellness  programs, so the agency implemented a health-tracking program and a  fitness discount program for all employees. CHCOs also suggested  identifying and incorporating the benefits that would be most useful to  various groups of employees, such as sabbaticals for midlevel employees  or paid parental leave for employees starting families.

We requested an update in December 2018  and will continue to monitor OPM\u2019s actions to implement this  recommendation.", "As an example of agency training efforts, the Social Security  Administration has national and regional development programs that offer  12 to 18 months of training and rotations for entry-, mid-, and senior-level  employees to strengthen foundational, technical, and leadership  knowledge and skills, according to the agency\u2019s CHCO. For example, its  Leadership Development Program assigns selected GS-9 through GS-12  employees to developmental assignments in new areas of work, and  provides leadership training that broadens their perspective of the  agency\u2019s mission.", "Encourage details, rotations, and other mobility opportunities.  According to our group interviews with CHCOs and interviews with human  capital experts and federal management groups, upward and lateral  mobility opportunities are important for retaining employees. CHCOs also  said that in some cases, lateral mobility opportunities such as rotations,  details, and opportunities to gain experience in other sectors can help  employees gain new skills more cost effectively than training, particularly  for rapidly changing skill sets such as those related to the sciences. We  previously reported that effective interagency rotational assignments can  develop participants\u2019 collaboration skills and build interagency networks.", "Further, providing supervisory candidates with details or rotational  opportunities could help them develop and demonstrate supervisory  competencies.", "Regarding upward mobility, the 2017 FEVS found that only 37 percent of  respondents were satisfied with opportunities to get a better job in their  organization. Agencies can use details and rotations to meet employees\u2019  desire for mobility, according to our CHCO group interviews and  interviews with human capital experts and federal employee and  management groups. However, according to OPM data, few federal  employees moved horizontally in 2017 (see table 4).", "Few employees move horizontally because managers are sometimes  reluctant to lose employees, according to federal manager group  representatives and our previous work. Furthermore, federal budgeting  and account structures create disincentives to share resources across  agencies. Additionally, barriers to rotations in other sectors may include  challenges identifying willing industry partners and addressing concerns  regarding conflict of interest and access to sensitive information.  Meanwhile, federal employees who have left for another sector must  apply competitively to return at a higher level.", "We have previously made recommendations that could help address  these challenges. In 2014, we recommended that OPM review the extent  to which new capabilities are needed to promote mechanisms for  increasing employee mobility within an agency and government-wide.  OPM agreed with the recommendation and since October 2016 has been  exploring a pilot project, GovConnect, that tests models for workforce  agility that includes cloud-based skill deployment across organizational  components and employee-initiated innovation initiatives. In November  2018, OPM officials also stated that the President\u2019s Management Council  Interagency Rotations Program offers rotational assignments across  agencies. We will continue to monitor OPM\u2019s efforts in this  recommendation.", "In 2015, we recommended that OPM determine if promising practices,  such as providing detail opportunities or rotational assignments to  managerial candidates prior to promotion, should be more widely used  across government. OPM partially concurred with this recommendation  and agreed to work with the CHCO Council to explore more government- wide use of rotational assignments. However, OPM noted that agencies  already have authority to take these actions. As of October 2018, OPM  had not provided us with information regarding how it plans to implement  the recommendation.", "In looking at human capital practices in foreign governments, we found  that the UK encourages rotation and promotion opportunities through its  developmental programs for entry-, mid-, and senior-level employees. For  example, participants in its entry-level program, called Fast Stream, are  centrally employed in the UK Cabinet Office. For the first 3 to 4 years,  Fast Stream participants rotate among agencies and receive technical  training in a specific field, such as accounting, finance, or human capital.  While evaluating Fast Stream\u2019s feasibility in the federal workforce, one  federal employee group representative emphasized the need to provide  career development opportunities to all employees, not just selected  program participants."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Acting Director of OPM for review  and comment.

We also analyzed data from OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human  Resources Integration (EHRI) system. EHRI contains personnel action  and onboard data for most executive branch and some legislative branch  federal civilian employees. We analyzed government-wide EHRI data on  demographics, including veterans status; employee movement such as  details and transfers; and retirement eligibility. We analyzed 10-year  trends from fiscal years 2008 to 2017, the most recent, complete fiscal  year of data available at the time of our review.", "For our analysis of demographic trends, we included permanent,  temporary, and term-limited employees. However, we focused on  permanent employees in our analysis of personnel movement and  retirement eligibility because these employees (1) comprise most of the  federal workforce and (2) become eligible to retire with an annuity, for  which temporary and term-limited employees are ineligible.", "To calculate the number of federal civilian employees, we included all  onboard staff, regardless of their pay status. Cases with missing values  on a variable were excluded from the reported statistics for that variable.  To calculate eligibility for retirement within the next 5 years, we computed  the date at which the employee would be eligible for voluntary retirement  with an unreduced annuity, using length of service, birth date, and  retirement plan coverage. Since work schedule does not affect retirement  eligibility, we included permanent employees with full-time schedules and  part-time, seasonal, and other schedules in these results.", "We assessed the reliability of the EHRI data through electronic testing to  identify missing data, out-of-range values, and logical inconsistencies. We  also reviewed our prior work assessing the reliability of these data and  corresponded with OPM officials knowledgeable about the data to discuss  its accuracy and the steps OPM takes to ensure reliability.

To assess key trends in the workforce, we  analyzed data from the CPS, a national survey designed and  administered jointly by BLS and the Census Bureau. The CPS is a key  source of official government statistics on employment and  unemployment in the United States, and also contains data on poverty  rates, earnings, and labor market demographics. We analyzed 2017  annual averages on age, racial or ethnic minority status, disability status,  veteran status, and educational attainment of the U.S. civilian labor force.", "The CPS uses a probability sample conducted monthly. As with all  samples, estimates produced from the CPS are subject to sampling and  nonsampling error. Sampling error results from the fact that the samples  are one of a large number of random samples that might have been  drawn. We followed the BLS technical guidance for estimating the  standard errors of annual average totals from CPS data. We used the  standard errors to construct 95 percent confidence intervals for each  estimate presented in this report. This is the interval that would contain  the actual population value for 95 percent of the CPS samples that the  BLS could have drawn. All estimates from the CPS presented in this  report have a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points or  fewer at the 95 percent confidence level. Nonsampling error results from  issues such as inability to obtain information about all people in the  sample, or the inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct  information in the self-reporting process. We assessed the reliability of  CPS data by reviewing related technical documentation from the BLS  website on the concepts and methodology of the CPS, and obtaining BLS  feedback on our analysis. We conducted manual data testing for obvious  errors and compared selected underlying data to CPS annual reports. We  found the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of comparing  characteristics of the federal workforce to those of the U.S. civilian labor  force.", "Key trends in the workplace. To assess key trends in the workplace, we  reviewed our prior work on human capital management and trends in  government and the workforce. We also reviewed OPM reports on  human capital trends and management, including the 2018 Work-Life  Survey Governmentwide Report, 2018 Federal Workforce Priorities  Report, and 2016 Federal Employee Benefits Survey Results. We  interviewed OPM officials knowledgeable on these topics to better  understand the methodology used to obtain report findings, and to  understand previous and current efforts to assess federal human capital  policies.

To obtain information on federal  employee attitudes toward work and the workplace, we analyzed  employee responses to questions from OPM\u2019s 2017 FEVS, the most  recent data available at the time of our analysis. The FEVS provides a  snapshot of employees\u2019 perceptions about how effectively agencies  manage their workforce. The FEVS includes a core set of 84 questions.", "Agencies have the option of adding questions to the surveys sent to their  employees. The 84 questions address the following areas: (1) work  experience, (2) work unit, (3) agency, (4) supervisor, (5) leadership, (6)  satisfaction, (7) work-life, and (8) demographics. OPM has administered  the FEVS annually since 2010.", "The FEVS is based on a sample of full- and part-time, permanent,  nonseasonal employees of departments and large, small, and  independent agencies. The total sample size for the 2017 FEVS was  1,139,882 employees and the response rate was 45.5 percent. According  to OPM, the 2017 sample size was sufficient to ensure a 95 percent  chance that the true population value would be between within 1 percent  of any estimated percentage for the total federal workforce. Since each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of the FEVS statement estimates using the  margin of error at the 95 percent level of confidence. This margin of error  is the half-width of the 95 percent confidence interval for a FEVS  estimate. A 95 percent confidence interval is the interval that would  contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples that  could have been drawn.", "For our analysis, we selected FEVS questions related to work unit  recruitment, satisfaction with compensation and incentives, management,  employee involvement, and career opportunities.

To identify key strategies for managing a high- performing workforce, we conducted semistructured interviews with 22  experts in the areas of human capital, strategic foresight, and the future of  work. See appendix II for a list of experts interviewed. We selected these  experts using a nonprobability sample based on our literature review,  suggestions from OPM officials and our own human capital experts, and  relevance of their expertise to our objectives. We selected experts from a  range of organizations to ensure our analysis included a variety of  viewpoints. During these interviews, we asked about, among other things,  future trends that are likely to affect the federal workforce and innovative  practices to recruit and retain a high-performing workforce.", "We analyzed the interviews using qualitative analysis software to  describe employees\u2019 shifting attitudes toward work, and to categorize the  practices into key strategies for managing a high-performing workforce.

To  identify examples of human capital practices for managing a high- performing workforce, we conducted semistructured interviews with  human capital managers from four private organizations (Noblis, Deloitte,  Accenture, and NetImpact Strategies) and officials from three foreign  governments (Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom). We selected  the private organizations based on (1) the similarities of their talent pool  to that of the federal government, (2) accolades received for being a good  place to work, and (3) size of the organization and types of services  offered. We selected foreign governments based on (1) similarities to the  United States in terms of percent of the labor force in civil service, and (2)  the country having recently improved human capital policies or practices,  or having been recognized for having human capital practices that  positively affect recruitment and retention. In our report, we included  examples of human capital practices that managers and officials told us  were helpful to improving their organization, and that could feasibly be  implemented within the federal government.", "Interviews with federal employee and management group  representatives. We interviewed representatives from federal employee  and management groups to assess the feasibility of applying the  identified examples to the federal sector, including identifying any  opportunities or challenges. We selected employee groups that  represented the broadest population of blue- and white-collar federal  employees from all 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies: the  American Federation of Government Employees and the National  Treasury Employees Union. We selected the Federal Managers  Association due to its representation of federal managers, supervisors,  and executives.", "Group Interviews with CHCOs. We also held two virtual, moderated  group interviews with a nongeneralizable sample of CHCOs. We invited  23 CHCOs from the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies; of those,  nine were available and participated (see table 6). To ensure the  questions were valid and understandable, we pretested the questions  with our CHCO and Deputy CHCO. During each group interview, one of  our own moderators used a standard set of discussion questions to ask  participants to (1) assess the feasibility of specific examples for improving  employee recruitment and retention, (2) explain challenges to  implementing these examples in specific agencies, and (3) identify other  agency examples. At the group interviews, at least two analysts took and  reconciled their notes to summarize the results. We reviewed our  summaries of the group interviews to identify key themes discussed.  When highlighting examples from CHCOs, we provided summaries of the  examples to the CHCOs for comment and incorporated technical edits,  where appropriate.
