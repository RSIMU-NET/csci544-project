This process eliminates personal biases and subjectivity from the selection process and allows study results to be generalized to a larger group. On this basis, IRS could study compliance for a specific taxpayer subpopulation by randomly selecting a sample of taxpayer returns from that subpopulation for audit. The results of these audits could be projected to that entire subpopulation. Indications of noncompliance would not be considered in the random selection of returns for audit.", "Traditionally, the only IRS program using widespread random selection has been the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program (TCMP). Under TCMP, IRS auditors did line-by-line audits of randomly selected tax returns from large taxpayer populations such as individuals, partnerships, or small corporations. TCMP was IRS\u2019 program for gathering comprehensive and reliable tax compliance data. IRS used the data for measuring compliance levels, estimating the tax gap, identifying compliance issues, developing DIF formulas for objectively selecting returns for audit, and allocating audit resources. In addition, Congress used TCMP data for policy analysis, revenue estimating, and research. IRS did the last TCMP for individuals who filed returns for tax year 1988; these audits were generally done during 1990, 1991, and 1992. IRS had planned a TCMP for tax year 1994 but postponed it indefinitely because of concerns about the costs to IRS and the burdens on taxpayers.", "Outside TCMP, IRS\u2019 Examination Division initiates audit projects at IRS district offices and service centers to improve the selection of the audit workload. Also IRS\u2019 Compliance Research function runs research projects at IRS districts and service centers through District Research Offices. IRS occasionally does research projects, such as the ongoing series of EIC studies, through other functions. All of IRS\u2019 projects focus on measuring the extent and nature of noncompliance for specific tax issues or specific groups of taxpayers in which compliance problems have occurred. These projects also tend to focus on finding solutions to the compliance problem that use nonenforcement means, such as taxpayer assistance, rather than enforcement means, such as audits.

We used the returns as the basis of our analysis in order to make some comparisons to the overall audit universe. However, when IRS selects one taxpayer\u2019s return for audit, through whatever means, it may also audit other returns filed by the taxpayer in that or another tax year. Although the first selection may be random for the subpopulation, the selection of additional returns may not. In reporting the overall number of random audits, we distinguished between the number of taxpayers and number of returns.", "Within this context, we responded to your 12 questions through 5 objectives on IRS\u2019 use of random audits during fiscal years 1994 through 1996. Our objectives were to provide information on (1) the number of audits selected overall and at random for tax returns filed by all taxpayers and by IRS employees across the nation and in Georgia; (2) the profile of the taxpayers subjected to the random audits by state, type of taxpayer return, taxpayer income level, and taxpayer occupation; (3) the results of the random audits in terms of number of audits for which additional taxes were recommended as well as the amount of these additional taxes and the number of referrals to IRS\u2019 CID; (4) the known burdens imposed on taxpayers subjected to random audits; and (5) the alternatives other than random selection that IRS might have used to meet its objectives.", "To identify the number of audits done nationwide and in Georgia as well as of returns filed by IRS employees for fiscal years 1994 to 1996, we collected related data from IRS officials in the National Office and Georgia District. We also used data from IRS\u2019 database on closed audits\u2014the Audit Information Management System (AIMS)\u2014for each of these fiscal years. We interviewed Examination Division officials in the National and Georgia District offices to understand these data as well as IRS\u2019 procedures for selecting and doing audits. We collected data on IRS procedures, including those on audits of IRS employees.", "To identify the number of audits that used random selection, we first reviewed IRS\u2019 audit selection procedures and interviewed Examination Division and Research Division officials in the National Office to discuss the types of audits that may use random selection. These types included audits done for IGPs in the Examination Division, research projects in the District Office Research and Analysis (DORA) unit, and EIC project audits. IRS does not track the use of random selection, so we asked officials to query the district offices and DORAs about projects that may have used it.", "We reviewed all the information IRS had available on the projects in the National and Georgia District offices to see whether we could identify other uses of random selection. Some information was unavailable, particularly for projects that started in earlier years. Examination officials explained that IRS is not required to maintain these records. They also said some records were discarded or lost in consolidating from 63 to 33 district offices and in shifting responsibilities for record maintenance during recent reorganization efforts. As a result, we are not sure whether all projects that used random selection have been identified. IRS officials said any omission would be minor because IRS lacks the resources to use random selection extensively.", "For one of the six projects that IRS identified as using random selection, the EIC project, our analyses included the first two EIC studies for filing years 1994 and 1995 but not the third, because IRS was still checking the EIC and other claims for filing year 1996. IRS officials would not share the approximately 2,000 taxpayer identification numbers (TIN) associated with the tax year 1995 returns that were randomly selected for the 1996 EIC study, because IRS was still analyzing the audit results and wanted to prevent early release of data on EIC noncompliance. Our having the TINs and AIMS data, however, would not have allowed us to accurately compute the level of noncompliance. IRS provided some summary data on 789 taxpayers whose returns were in the tax year 1995 sample and had been audited, but we did not incorporate those data into our responses to the questions because we could not analyze and verify the data to the extent we could have done with the AIMS data. Appendix II summarizes the data provided by IRS.", "For any project that we or IRS identified as randomly selecting returns for audit, we asked for the TIN on the audited returns. We used these TINs in two ways. First, we matched them to data on IRS employees in 1994, 1995, and 1996 to identify IRS employees subjected to random audits. Second, we matched the TINs to AIMS data to answer the questions about the profile of the taxpayers (e.g., income level and state location) and audit results (e.g., additional taxes recommended and referrals to Criminal Investigation).", "For the taxpayer profile and audit results, we reported the available AIMS data on each random audit. We did not test the reliability of the AIMS data. We did not report estimates that may be developed from the data because we did not evaluate the statistical validity of IRS\u2019 random selection; further, most of the random audits were not finished. For these reasons, in combination with the small number of random audits compared with all audits, we did not attempt to draw conclusions about the profile and results. Also, we did not report results of audits involving fewer than three taxpayers because of IRS disclosure rules that protect taxpayer privacy.", "To identify IRS\u2019 efforts to measure taxpayers\u2019 costs and burdens, we talked to Examination officials and collected data on IRS\u2019 plans and surveys to define and measure taxpayer burden.

We reviewed IRS\u2019 1992 and 1996 survey results for measuring taxpayer burden and attitudes of large corporations. We did not attempt to evaluate these surveys or plans.", "To identify whether IRS had any alternatives to random audits, we first interviewed IRS officials and collected IRS data about the objectives of each project using random selection. Next, we reviewed our prior reports as well as a Price Waterhouse report on compliance data and the trade-offs with alternative sampling strategies.
