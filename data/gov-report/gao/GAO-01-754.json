Although these findings are welcome, GAO also found three areas of concern. The first is the relatively small proportion of women in early small-scale safety studies. These early studies provide important information on drugs' toxicity and safe dosing levels for later stages of clinical development, and many of the NDAs GAO examined found significant sex differences in a drug's pharmacokinetics, or how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, excreted, and concentrated in the bloodstream. Second, GAO is not confident that either NDA sponsors or FDA's reviewers took full advantage of the available data to learn more about the effects of the drug in women and to explore potential sex differences in dosing. This is because NDA summary documents are not required to include analyses of sex differences, and many of them do not. Third, FDA lacks appropriate management systems to monitor how many women are in clinical trials, to be certain that NDAs and investigational new drug applications (IND) annual reports comply with regulations for presenting outcome data by sex and tabulating the number of women included in ongoing trials, and to confirm that its medical officers have adequately addressed sex-related issues in their reviews. Although FDA has taken some promising initial steps to address these deficiencies, it is important that the agency finalize the pilot programs it has underway and give sustained attention to these management issues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Men and women sometimes respond differently to the same drug.

In 1992, we reported that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was not adequately ensuring the representation of women or the study of sex differences in clinical drug trials conducted by the pharmaceutical industry. Although FDA subsequently has taken some steps to increase the participation of women in clinical drug trials, concerns remain that women continue to be underrepresented and that sex differences in responses to drugs continue to go unexamined during drug development.", "You asked us to investigate FDA\u2019s progress in addressing the inclusion of women in clinical drug trials since our 1992 report. In response to your request, our work addressed: (1) what FDA guidance documents and regulations govern the inclusion of women in clinical drug trials; (2) are the regulations being followed; (3) are appropriate numbers of women included in the clinical drug trials to ensure the safety and efficacy of drugs for women; and (4) how does FDA oversee the collection, presentation, and analysis of data related to sex differences?", "To address these questions, we reviewed new drug applications (NDA) for new molecular entities (novel drugs subject to FDA review for the first time), submitted to FDA from August 10, 1998 through December 31, 2000.Out of 82 original NDAs for new molecular entities (NME) submitted during that period, we reviewed all 36 of the NDAs that met our selection criteria, namely that FDA had approved them or categorized them as approvable by December 31, 2000, and had labeled them for use in both men and women. We excluded NDAs for biologic products, such as vaccines, diagnostic drugs used in medical imaging, drugs for sex-specific conditions, and pediatric drugs. For each NDA, we analyzed three critical summary documents submitted by the drug\u2019s sponsor\u2014the Integrated Summary of Safety, the Integrated Summary of Efficacy, and the Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability Summary\u2014and the FDA Medical Officer Review. These documents were chosen because they summarize clinical trial data and because pertinent regulations direct NDA sponsors to include relevant information in the safety and efficacy summary documents submitted to FDA. We also randomly sampled 100 annual reports for investigational new drugs. These are drugs in development for which drug manufacturers typically have not yet sought FDA\u2019s approval for marketing. In addition, we interviewed FDA officials, pharmacology and drug safety experts, and representatives of the pharmaceutical industry. We also reviewed relevant literature.

In the 1970s, FDA recommended the exclusion of women of childbearing potential from early clinical drug trials because of concerns for the health of the women and of their potential offspring."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Role of FDA", "paragraphs": ["FDA, an agency in the Department of Health and Human Services, is charged with helping to ensure that safe and effective food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics reach the United States market. FDA assists drug manufacturers in designing clinical drug trials, reviews proposals for conducting clinical drug trials, and approves drugs for sale in the United States based on its determination that the clinical benefits of a drug outweigh its potential health risks. FDA also approves drug labeling, which indicates the medical conditions and patient populations for which the drug has been tested and approved as safe and effective. Once a drug reaches the market, FDA continues to monitor its safety and efficacy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Drug Development and Approval Process", "paragraphs": ["Before any new drug can be tested on humans, a drug\u2019s sponsor must submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to FDA that summarizes the investigations conducted prior to trials in humans, lays out a plan for how the drug will be tested in humans, and provides assurances that appropriate measures will be taken to protect study participants. Specifically, the IND application demonstrates that the drug is reasonably safe for subsequent testing in humans based on laboratory and animal testing and exhibits enough potential effectiveness to justify its commercial development. Unless FDA determines that a proposed study is unsafe, clinical testing may begin 31 days after the IND application is submitted to FDA. The sponsor then proceeds with the three main stages of clinical drug testing:   Phase 1 small-scale safety trials generally study small numbers of healthy volunteers to determine toxicity and safe dosing levels. These trials also study a drug\u2019s pharmacokinetics, or how it is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted, and its concentration in the bloodstream;   Phase 2 small-scale efficacy trials generally study patient volunteers with the disease or condition against a comparison group to assess drug efficacy and side effects; and   Phase 3 full-scale safety and efficacy trials study thousands of patient volunteers against a comparison group to further evaluate efficacy and monitor adverse responses to the drug. Drugs for life-threatening diseases for which there is no other effective course of treatment sometimes cannot be compared against another treatment and will sometimes use historical information about patient outcomes as a point of comparison.", "Drug sponsors are required to submit IND annual reports to FDA during the typically 2- to 10-year span of the clinical drug trials. When the sponsor wants to market a new drug, it submits a new drug application (NDA). FDA regulations on NDA content and format require that the NDA include integrated summaries of the evidence demonstrating the drug\u2019s safety, including adverse events suffered by those in the clinical drug trials, and effectiveness. Evidence is also required to support the dosing section of the labeling, including the recommended dose and modifications in dose for specific population subgroups. Each NDA must include at least one pivotal clinical trial, generally an \u201cadequate and well-controlled\u201d Phase 3 study that demonstrates the drug\u2019s efficacy, or effectiveness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Importance of Ensuring Women\u2019s Representation in Trials", "paragraphs": ["There are many examples in the medical literature of sex differences in the way men and women absorb, distribute, and metabolize drugs. The effects of women\u2019s hormones and the variations in body size between men and women are the likely causes of many sex differences in responses to drugs. Women metabolize some drugs differently if they are pregnant, lactating, pre- or postmenopausal, menstruating, or using oral contraceptives or hormone replacements. Women\u2019s generally smaller body weight compared to men can result in higher levels of drug concentration in the bloodstream.", "These and other established physiological and anatomical differences may make women differentially more susceptible to some drug-related health risks and demonstrate the importance of including women in all stages of drug development. For example, phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a common ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription cough and cold medications and OTC weight-loss products, was found to increase the risk of bleeding into the brain or tissue around the brain in women, but not in men. Certain classes of drugs can in some circumstances prolong the interval between the heart muscle\u2019s contractions and induce a potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia. Women have a higher incremental risk of suffering such an arrhythmia after taking these drugs than do men, probably because (1) the interval between heart muscle contractions is naturally longer for women than for men and (2) male sex hormones moderate the heart muscle\u2019s sensitivity to these drugs. We recently reported that four of the ten prescription drugs withdrawn from the U.S. market in the last 3 years posed a greater health risk to women than to men because they induced arrhythmia. Similarly, there is evidence that not all drugs are effective in both sexes. For example, one class of painkillers, kappa opioids, has been found to be twice as effective in women as in men."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Women Were Historically Excluded From Some Clinical Drug Trials", "paragraphs": ["Discoveries of birth defects and other problems resulting from fetal exposure to certain drugs between the 1940s and early 1970s prompted societal interest in protecting women and their fetuses from the potentially devastating effects of clinical drug research. For example, diethylstilbestrol (DES) was taken by women in the 1940s and 1950s to protect against miscarriages. About 20 years later, many daughters of women who had taken the drug developed reproductive abnormalities and had an increased risk of developing vaginal cancer. Similarly, in the 1960s many women outside of the United States took thalidomide to prevent early miscarriages, and the drug caused over 10,000 birth defects worldwide. In 1977, partially in response to the thalidomide scare, FDA recommended that women of childbearing potential be excluded from participating in small-scale safety and efficacy trials unless the drug was intended to treat a life-threatening disease. As a result, women were typically excluded from these clinical drug trials. Through the next decade there were growing concerns that the 1977 guideline may have restricted the early accumulation of information about women\u2019s responses to drugs that could be used in designing later clinical drug trials and that it stifled the production and analysis of data on the effects of drugs in women.", "In 1994, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported that the FDA guidance that discouraged the participation of women of childbearing potential in initial small-scale trials led to the widespread exclusion of women in later large scale trials. In addition, analyses of published clinical drug trials for life-threatening conditions have concluded that many past clinical trials included few or no women, making it uncertain whether the studies\u2019 results applied to women. These conditions include cardiovascular disease and HIV."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Previous Studies on the Participation of Women in Clinical Drug Trials", "paragraphs": ["This report is our second to address FDA and women in clinical drug trials.

Surveys of NDAs in 1983 and 1988 found that, in general, both sexes were represented in clinical drug trials in proportions that usually reflected the prevalence of the disease in the total population but were not necessarily statistically sufficient to prove the safety or efficacy of the drug for either sex. Despite the participation of women, few analyses of the data were being conducted to detect possible sex differences in drug safety or efficacy. FDA has also looked at the tabulation of demographic data in IND annual reports. FDA recently reported that in IND annual reports filed with the agency women made up 44 percent of participants in clinical drug trials in which sex was identified.

Of the 82 original NDAs for NMEs submitted to FDA during this period, we examined all 36 that were either approved for marketing or judged approvable by FDA by December 31, 2000, and that met our other selection criteria. We narrowed our focus to only approved and approvable NDAs because these drugs are the most likely to reach the public. We excluded diagnostic drugs used in medical imaging, drugs for sex-specific conditions, pediatric drugs, and drugs that were not approved for use in both men and women. We also did not examine biologic products, such as vaccines. As a result of our sampling criteria, the clinical drug trials for some drug classes that have been cited by experts as including insufficient numbers of women were not well represented. For example, our sample included only one cardiovascular drug.", "We requested from FDA and reviewed critical summary documents for each NDA, including the Integrated Summary of Safety, the Integrated Summary of Efficacy, the Pharmacokinetics and Bioavailability Summary, and the FDA Medical Officer Review. We obtained and reviewed other NDA documents only when the summary documents referred to relevant information. We reviewed the NDA summary documents because the 1998 regulations specifically require NDA sponsors to present data about drug safety and efficacy in the Integrated Summary of Safety and the Integrated Summary of Efficacy and because we were unable to review all of the documents in each NDA (an entire NDA can contain as many as 250 volumes). Our findings speak only to what was included in the summary documents or in the supplemental documents we examined; we did not systematically review other relevant data, such as data in clinical pharmacology reviews, that may have been presented in NDA volumes other than the critical summary documents.", "In our reviews of the critical summary documents we collected data on (1) the presentation of outcome data by sex, (2) the number of women participating in clinical drug trials by drug development stage, (3) the frequency and extent of sex-related analyses, (4) the detection of sex- related differences in drug response and their statistical significance, and (5) the relationship between body weight and sex-related differences.

That listing included a total of 3,636 IND applications. According to FDA\u2019s management information system, 15 of the IND applications in our sample had been withdrawn and were not active, and sponsors for 9 of the IND applications were not required to submit annual reports because they had not been active for a long enough period. We also found that FDA could not find one of the annual reports (see table 6). Because we randomly selected the IND annual reports we examined, our findings are generalizable to the entire set of IND annual reports. However, because of the small size of our sample, our estimate of the proportion of annual reports not fulfilling regulatory requirements is not precise.", "In our review of the remaining 75 IND annual reports, the reports were considered to have met regulatory requirements if the numbers of enrolled participants were reported by sex for at least one of the reported studies.

In weighting the percentage of women in our study by the percentage of participants in trials for each drug class used in the 1992 study, we were able to control for differences in the types of drugs sampled and compare the two studies as if our sample included the same drugs. For example, participants in cancer drug trials made up 7 percent of all participants in the 1992 study of clinical drug trials but only 5 percent of the participants in the small-scale efficacy and full-scale safety and efficacy clinical trials we examined in this study.

Standards for participation of women in clinical drug trials have included nominal thresholds for women\u2019s participation (e.g., in our 1992 report, we regarded NDAs that tested 250 or more women as having enough women) and the representation of the sexes in numbers that are proportional to those in the population for whom a drug is intended. For this study, we adopted the perspective that the clinical trials should include a large enough number of women to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug for women. To determine if enough women were tested in clinical drug trials to demonstrate the drugs\u2019 efficacy in women, we generally conducted a power analysis using the number of participants in, and outcome data from, pivotal trials. NDAs that reported a statistically significant improvement in women taking the drug compared to women in a control group clearly had enough women in the pivotal trials to meet this criterion. For NDAs that did not report this analysis, we took the largest effect size presented in the Integrated Summary of Efficacy (that is, the largest percentage improvement for those taking the drug), the total number of women participating in the treatment group for all of the pivotal trials, and the total number of women participating in the comparison group for all of the pivotal trials. We then calculated the critical ratio, and significance level, for that effect size and that number of cases. We found that all of the NDAs we examined in this way had enough women in the pivotal trials to demonstrate that the drug had a statistically significant effect.
