Other operations and maintenance costs that would have been saved by reducing the number of B-1Bs or eliminating a B-1B unit were not included in the estimates for these options. Such costs include depot maintenance, travel, and contractor logistics support.

Air Force officials could not explain why they estimated the cost savings in this manner. However, they noted that while they obtained complete operations and maintenance data for the Guard units, they did not obtain similar data for the active units. Using this methodology, the Air Force estimates for options that included a mix of active and Guard units understated the savings that could result from reducing and consolidating the fleet.", "Air Force officials said they considered other factors when they assessed the basing options. One factor was the impact that the consolidation might have on the individual B-1B bases. Air Force officials told us that they realized that they would have to select an option that included Ellsworth Air Force Base because, without the B-1B, Ellsworth would have no mission and the Air Force had no authority to close the base. A second factor was the need to avoid generating requirements for construction of new facilities since this would reduce the potential savings from the consolidation and might require the Air Force to seek construction funds from Congress. Several other factors that could have been considered but were not include: actual flying hour costs, mission capable rates, and aircrew experience levels for the active and Guard units.

The Guard attributed its lower reparables costs to the higher experience levels of its maintenance personnel. Apprentice mechanics in the Guard averaged over 10 years of military experience compared to slightly more than 2 years of military experience among apprentice active duty mechanics. Officials said that more experienced maintenance personnel are often able to identify a problem part and fix it at the unit, when appropriate, instead of purchasing a replacement part from the Air Force supply system.", "Our analysis also showed that the lower costs of consumables in the Guard also contributed to the lower flying hour costs (see table 4). Guard officials said that they are able to keep the costs of consumables down because their experienced maintenance crews are often able to isolate, identify, and fix malfunctioning parts without pulling multiple suspect parts off the aircraft. As a result, fewer consumable supplies are used.", "Flying hour costs represent only a portion of the overall costs of operating and maintaining B-1B bombers.

During those same years, the active duty mission capable rate performance averaged between 52 and 60 percent (see fig. 1).", "According to Air Combat Command officials, the active duty units\u2019 mission capable rate gain in fiscal year 2001 was primarily due to (1) increased aircraft availability following completion of an extensive modification program and (2) improvements in the Air Force\u2019s inventory of spare parts.", "In the 2 years prior to fiscal year 2001, both active and Guard B-1Bs underwent extensive modifications at the depot that improved the aircraft\u2019s survivability and equipped the aircraft with more advanced munitions. During this time, large portions of the B-1B fleet were at the depot for extended periods. According to Air Combat Command officials, active duty B-1B units experienced reduced mission capable rates because maintaining a normal operating tempo with fewer aircraft required each aircraft to be flown more frequently and resulted in more wear and tear to each aircraft. However, the Guard units\u2019 mission capable rates were less affected. Both Air Combat Command and Guard unit officials agreed that during this time the higher experience levels of Guard maintenance personnel and the Guard\u2019s lower operating tempo lessened the impact of having large portions of the fleet at the depot on the Guard units\u2019 mission capable rates. The Air Force completed most of these modifications by the end of fiscal year 2000, and the gap between the active and Guard mission capable rates narrowed in fiscal year 2001.", "According to Air Combat Command officials, the overall shortage of spare parts experienced by the Air Force during the late 1990s also negatively affected the active duty B-1B units\u2019 mission capable rates prior to fiscal year 2001.

DOD suggested using the direct and indirect costs included in the Air Force\u2019s Total Ownership Cost database to calculate flying hour costs. In conducting our analysis of flying hour costs, we relied on the Air Force\u2019s definition. The Air Force defines flying hour costs as the cost of fuel, depot-level reparables, and consumable parts divided by the number of hours flown. The Air Force does not include other costs such as software maintenance costs, contractor support costs, or military personnel costs when it calculates the cost per flying hour. DOD is correct when it states that there are other costs associated with operating a B-1B and our report recognizes that fact.", "In commenting on our analysis of active and Guard mission capable rates, DOD noted that the difference between active and Guard mission capable rates is not solely attributable to the experience level of Guard personnel.

Additionally, because the Air Force had no documents explaining its methodology for evaluating the various basing options it considered, we asked the Air Force, in early 2002, to document its methodology. The Air Force provided us with a statement explaining the methodology; however, it was unable to provide us with the cost figures used to estimate the savings. As a result, we could not verify the savings estimates that the Air Force attributed to each option.", "To supplement our document review, we interviewed several Air Force officials who were located in the Washington, D.C., area to determine what role each may have played in the decision to reduce the fleet and consolidate it at two bases. The officials were the Chief of Staff, U.S. Air Force; the Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Programs, U.S. Air Force; the former Director of the Air National Guard; and the Assistant for Operational Readiness, Air National Guard. We also spoke with officials responsible for overseeing the B-1B program in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Air and Space Operations, U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C, to determine if any analysis of current and future wartime requirements had been completed prior to the decision. We also had numerous meetings with officials in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff, Plans and Programs, who were responsible for developing the basing options and estimating the savings that would result for each option to discuss their methodology and the decision process. We also met with representatives of the Air Combat Command at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, to determine if they had any role in the decision to either reduce the number of B-1Bs or consolidate them at two active duty bases. Finally, we met with representatives of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); the Director, Program, Analysis, and Evaluation; and the Joint Staff to determine if they had completed any analysis of the Office of Secretary of Defense suggestion to eliminate the B-1B fleet or the Air Force\u2019s proposal to reduce the fleet. In addition, we reviewed the 1999 and 2001 Air Force bomber white papers and the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review to gather insight on current and future B-1B wartime requirements and copies of congressional testimonies by the Secretary of Defense, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force to document DOD\u2019s rationale for making the B-1B decision.", "To compare the flying hour costs and the capabilities of the various active and Air National Guard B-1B units, we collected and analyzed flying hour cost data for fiscal years 1999-2001 from the five B-1B units. To verify the data from these sources, we collected and analyzed cost data for the same years from the Air Combat Command; the Air Force Cost Analysis Agency, Washington, D.C.; and the Directorate of Logistics, Air National Guard, Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. We also collected and analyzed (1) mission capable rate data for fiscal years 1999-2001 from the Air Combat Command and the two Guard units and (2) collected and analyzed data on aircrew and maintenance crew experience from the Air Combat Command and the Air National Guard Bureau. To determine if there were significant differences in active and Guard units\u2019 wartime missions, we reviewed the wartime taskings of all five B-1B units. To compare the units\u2019 participation in peacetime activities, we reviewed documents provided by officials at the Air Expeditionary Force Center, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. We reviewed and compared the operational readiness inspections for the bomb wings located at Dyess, Ellsworth, and McConnell Air Force Bases and the partial operational readiness inspection for the bomb wing at Robins Air Force Base. The Inspector General staff completed an inspection of Robins\u2019 initial response capabilities in July 2001 but did not complete its inspection of the three remaining areas since the Air Force had already decided to remove the B-1Bs from Robins. The wing at Mountain Home had not undergone an operational readiness inspection at the time we completed our review. Our work also included visits to three B-1B units to interview officials and obtain documents: 184th Bomb Wing, McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas; 7th Bomb Wing, Dyess Air Force Base, Texas; and 116th Bomb Wing, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Sharron Candon, Judith Collins, Penney Harwell, Jane Hunt, Ken Patton, and Carol Schuster made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Air Force Bombers: Moving More B-1s to the Reserves Could Save Millions without Reducing Mission Capability.
