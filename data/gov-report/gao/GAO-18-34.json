This report assesses the extent to which (1) VA's implementation of MSPV-NG was effective in meeting program goals, and (2) VA awards contracts on an emergency basis. GAO analyzed VA's MSPV-NG requirements development and contracting processes, and identified key supply chain practices cited by four leading hospital networks. GAO also reviewed a non-generalizable sample of 18 contracts designated in VA's database as emergency procurements with high dollar values; and met with contracting, logistics, and clinical officials at 6 medical centers, selected based on high dollar contract obligations in fiscal years 2014-2016 and geographic representation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation (MSPV-NG) program to provide an efficient, cost-effective way for its facilities to order supplies, but its initial implementation was flawed, lacked an overarching strategy, stable leadership, and sufficient workforce that could have facilitated medical center buy-in. VA developed requirements for a broad range of MSPV-NG items with limited clinical input. As a result, the program has not met medical centers' needs, and usage remains far below VA's 40 percent target. VA also established cost avoidance as a goal for MSPV-NG, but currently only has a metric in place to measure broader supply chain cost avoidance, not savings specific to MSPV-NG. Also, starting in June 2015, VA planned to award competitive contracts for MSPV-NG items, but instead, 79 percent were added using non-competitive agreements. (See figure.) This was done primarily to meet VA's December 2016 deadline to establish the formulary, the list of items available for purchase through MSPV-NG.", "The roll-out of MSPV-NG ran counter to practices of leading hospitals that GAO spoke with, which highlighted key steps, such as prioritizing supply categories and obtaining continuing clinician input to guide decision-making. VA has taken steps to address some deficiencies identified in the first phase of implementation and is considering a new approach for this program. However, until VA addresses the existing shortcomings in the MSPV-NG program, such as the lack of medical center buy-in, it will face challenges in meeting its goals.", "Medical centers often rely on emergency procurements to obtain routine goods and services\u2014some of which could be made available at lower cost via MSPV-NG. Sixteen of the 18 contracts in GAO's sample were not competed, which puts the government at risk of paying more. For instance, one medical center procured medical gas on an emergency basis through consecutive non-competitive contracts over a 3-year period. VA policy clearly defines emergency actions; however, inefficiencies in planning, funding, and communication at the medical centers contributed to emergency procurements, resulting in the contracting officers quickly awarding contracts with no competition."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 10 recommendations, including that VA expand clinician input in requirements development, calculate MSPV-NG cost avoidance, establish a plan for awarding future competitive contracts, and identify opportunities to strategically procure supplies and services frequently purchased on an emergency basis.

In fiscal year 2015, VA obligated $465 million for these  types of supplies, and, in 2016, it stated that it planned to achieve $150  million in cost avoidance through a supply chain transformation effort,  which includes the Medical Surgical Prime Vendor-Next Generation  (MSPV-NG) program.

The program also includes hundreds of new contracts with individual  supply vendors and a new set of prime vendor contracts to distribute the  supplies. This transition represents a significant change to how medical  and surgical supplies are purchased, which has raised questions about  whether MSPV-NG will appropriately balance medical needs with  logistical efficiency. Effective supply chain management is an essential  part of delivering quality health care to veterans. For instance, in April  2017, the VA Inspector General released an interim report detailing  supply management issues at the District of Columbia VA Medical Center  that posed risks to patient care. Moreover, VHA\u2019s procurement of routine  goods on an urgent or emergency basis at medical centers, as our prior  work indicated has occurred, has the potential to strain VA\u2019s acquisition  workforce.", "You requested that we examine VA\u2019s transition to the MSPV-NG program  and the extent to which the department contracts for goods and services  on an emergency basis. This report assesses the extent to which (1) VA\u2019s  implementation of MSPV-NG has been effective in meeting program  goals; and (2) VHA awards contracts on an emergency basis for routine  supplies and ongoing services and what, if any, impact these awards  have on VHA\u2019s acquisition function.", "To review the extent to which VA\u2019s transition to MSPV-NG has been  effective, we reviewed policy, communications, briefings, and other  documents. We reviewed prior GAO reports on best practices for  organizational transformation, as well as internal control standards. We  also interviewed supply chain managers from four leading hospital  networks regarding their medical supply management practices. We  selected the hospital networks because they were identified by an  industry study as having leading supply chain practices. During  interviews, we asked these supply chain managers a standard set of  questions about processes followed to standardize their hospital  networks\u2019 supply chain. VA had also identified two of these hospital  networks as having leading supply chain practices, and used the industry  study to identify these hospital networks. We used this information from  the leading hospital networks to compare the key steps\u2014identified by  each of the four hospital networks\u2014followed in standardizing their  medical supply chains to those steps that VA followed when implementing  the MSPV-NG program. We also confirmed these key steps with the  leading hospital networks. To assess VA\u2019s MSPV-NG contracting  process, we obtained data on the contents of the formulary (a list of  specific items that medical centers are allowed to purchase), and  determined that it was sufficiently reliable for our reporting objectives by  tracing data to a sample of source documents, among other steps. We  analyzed the data to determine what acquisition instrument was used to  add items or change the composition of the formulary over time. We  conducted site visits to three Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISNs), selected based on highest total contract obligations in fiscal  years 2014 through 2016, geographic diversity, and other factors, and  interviewed VISN leadership. We visited two medical centers within each  selected VISN and interviewed officials, such as Chief Supply Chain  Officers, clinicians, and ordering officers. We also interviewed VHA- and  VA-wide procurement leaders, program office managers, and managers  and members of three integrated product teams who helped develop  requirements for supply items\u2014selected based on those responsible for  the largest number of items.

As we reported in 2016, this legacy program, however, prevented VHA  from standardizing items used across its medical centers and affected its  ability to leverage its buying power to achieve greater cost avoidance.  Standardization is a process of narrowing the range of items purchased to  meet a given need in order to improve buying power, simplify supply  chain management, and provide clinical consistency. For example, a  hospital network might find that it purchases 100 varieties of bandages,  but might ultimately determine\u2014with input from clinicians\u2014that it can  narrow those choices down to 10 varieties to fill most needs, which would  provide greater consistency and allow the hospital to negotiate lower  prices.

Direct matches \u2013 For some items, the exact same item a medical  center had been purchasing was available in the formulary. Identifying  these matches may not necessarily be simple, as the names and  identification numbers were not typically the same.  2.  Potential clinical equivalents \u2013 Many items that were no longer  available under the MSPV-NG formulary had close matches on the  formulary. However, because these were not exactly the same, work  was required to ensure that they were clinically equivalent\u2014in nearly  all cases, this required clinician input. Clinical Product Review  Committees at each medical center, which are comprised of clinicians  and others, are responsible for approving new supplies before they  are introduced to a medical center.  3.  Items without matches \u2013 Finally, there were some items that medical  centers had been purchasing for which logistics staff were not able to  identify a clinical equivalent in the MSPV-NG formulary. In these  cases, logistics staff sought non-MSPV methods of obtaining the  same items they had previously purchased\u2014usually via purchase  card transactions and, in a few cases, via requests to their local  contracting office to award new contracts for the items.", "Figure 7 shows the typical process for identifying MSPV-NG matches for  core list items at individual VA medical centers, as described by logistics  officials at the selected medical centers.", "According to logistics officials we spoke with, the MSPV-NG formulary  matching process was challenging for the selected medical centers, and  they had varying levels of success, in part, due to incomplete guidance  from the program office. The MSPV-NG program office provided some  guidance, including a tool for identifying direct matches, but three of the  Chief Supply Chain Officers at the selected medical centers stated that  they did not find it very helpful, in part, because it only included matches  for the highest-volume items. Based on our discussions with the MSPV- NG program office and selected medical centers, as well as our review of  communications provided to medical centers, the program office provided  various emails and held conference calls, but did not provide complete  guidance to summarize the steps medical centers should take to execute  the matching process. Without complete guidance, each selected VISN  and medical center approached the process somewhat differently. One  medical center devoted a great deal of effort to matching items early on,  had completed its review, and determined its purchasing strategy for  nearly all core list items before the transition period was complete. Others  devoted less attention to this and planned instead to rely on purchase  cards to continue buying the same items they had purchased under the  legacy MSPV program, which works against VA\u2019s goal of leveraging  buying power through MSPV-NG.", "The amount of clinician input on the matching process varied among  medical centers in our review, in part, because the various  communications from the program office did not provide complete  information on how to involve clinicians and Clinical Product Review  Committees at medical centers. While the program office asked medical  centers to involve clinicians, it did not specify a process for how to do so,  and centers were left to develop their own approaches. For example, in  one selected VISN, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer became involved  with the logistics office coordination effort and obtained active  participation from clinicians at each medical center, who formed working  groups to review potential clinical equivalent matches. In other VISNs and  medical centers, there was little concerted effort to involve clinicians at  this stage of the process, and only a few clinical equivalent items were  reviewed and matched with clinical input. Without effective matching to  the formulary, VA cannot achieve the MSPV-NG utilization rates it needs  to meet the program\u2019s goals. Without complete guidance, these centers  may be unable to effectively match their core lists to the MSPV-NG  formulary and, thus, increase their utilization of it.", "The MSPV-NG formulary also continued to change while the medical  centers were working to match their core list items, which made the  process more challenging. Several clinicians and logistics staff at the  medical centers we visited expressed frustration about the frequency by  which items were being added and deleted on the formulary and the  impact it had on their purchasing strategies. Our analysis found that in  April 2017, 690 items were added to the formulary, but, in June, 628  items were deleted. These medical center officials also noted that they  had not received any communications from the program office or SAC  regarding why items were being added and deleted, and were unsure  why the changes were taking place. SAC and MSPV-NG program office  officials stated that these continuing changes stemmed from several  factors, including elimination of duplicate items from multiple vendors and  addition of other items identified as necessary by VHA or medical centers.  In some cases, medical center officials told us that that they were less  willing to expend effort on the matching process because the formulary  was a moving target. Without visibility into or an understanding of the  criteria used by the program office on its process for adding or removing  items on the formulary, medical centers will likely continue to face  challenges in matching their items to the formulary. See Table 1 for the  number of items added and deleted from the formulary from January to  July 2017.", "Many medical centers were unable to find direct matches or substitutes  for a substantial number of items on their core lists, which negatively  impacted utilization rates for the initial formulary. In October 2015, the  program office estimated that the items on the initial formulary would  meet 80 percent or more of the medical centers\u2019 needs. However,  according to SAC, as of June 2017, only about a third of the items on the  initial version of the formulary were being ordered in any significant  quantity by medical centers, indicating that many items on the formulary  may not be those that are needed by medical centers. Senior VHA  acquisition officials attributed this mismatch to shortcomings in their initial  requirements development process as well as with VA\u2019s purchase data.", "VA set out a target that medical centers would order 40 percent of their  supplies from the MSPV-NG formulary, but utilization rates are below this  target with a nationwide average utilization rate across medical centers of  about 24 percent as of May 2017. Instead of fully using MSPV-NG, the  selected medical centers are purchasing many items through other  means, such as purchase cards or new contracts awarded by their local  contracting office, in part, because they said the formulary does not meet  their needs. These approaches run counter to the goals of the MSPV-NG  program and result in VA not making the best use of taxpayer dollars.  Specifically, Chief Supply Chain Officers\u2014who are responsible for  managing the ordering and stocking of medical supplies at the six  selected medical centers\u2014told us that many items they needed were not  included in the MSPV-NG formulary. As discussed above, the difficult  transition process also created a lack of clinician desire to find substitutes  on the formulary. As such, we found that these six medical centers  generally fell below VA\u2019s stated utilization target that medical centers  order 40 percent of their items from the MSPV-NG formulary. As shown in  figure 8, among the six selected medical centers we reviewed, one met  the target, while the remaining five were below 25 percent utilization. The  one facility that met the target, Hampton VA Medical Center, is  categorized by VA as a smaller, less complex facility, and had fewer  items to match, which could contribute to its higher utilization.", "The utilization rate is VA\u2019s primary metric for the success of MSPV-NG\u2014 broad usage of the formulary is necessary for VA to meet its goals of  more efficient supply purchasing, standardization, and cost avoidance.  Utilization is calculated by dividing the purchases made via MSPV-NG by  the total purchases under the medical supply budget category. This is the  same metric used under the legacy MSPV program, and most medical  centers were meeting the 40 percent target prior to the transition to  MSPV-NG. Officials stated that the current metric does not provide  enough information and, as a result, VHA is in the process of preparing a  new metric to more precisely assess MSPV-NG use and effectiveness,  and has begun conducting routine surveys of its medical centers to obtain  their feedback on MSPV-NG.", "Greater utilization of MSPV-NG is essential to VA achieving the cost  avoidance goal of $150 million for its supply chain transformation effort.  Under the legacy MSPV program, the National Acquisition Center tracked  cost avoidance achieved by comparing prices for competitively-awarded  MSPV supply contracts with prices available elsewhere. However, VHA  officials stated that they are not currently tracking cost avoidance related  specifically to MSPV-NG. VHA officials told us they plan to use a new  cost avoidance metric that compares total supply spending for VHA as a  whole across fiscal years. This new metric, however, does not measure  whether cost savings are being achieved specifically through MSPV-NG.  Officials stated the broader metric was more useful than measuring cost  avoidance specific to MSPV-NG.", "VA\u2019s practices are in contrast with those of the leading hospitals we met  with, which maintain detailed, item-level data on cost avoidance and use  them to inform future supply requirements and contracting. These  hospitals we interviewed reported substantial cost savings from their  standardization efforts. For example, the director of supply chain  management at one leading hospital network stated that it achieved a  goal of $100 million in cost savings on medical supplies in the first 2 years  of their standardization effort, and an additional $35 million annually in the  several years since. This hospital achieved these results despite its  purchasing power being less than VA\u2019s. Without calculating cost  avoidance attributable to MSPV-NG, VHA cannot assess whether the  program is meeting its goals, nor can it use cost avoidance data to guide  future MSPV-NG requirement development and contracting strategy  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Encouraged Greater Clinical Involvement in the Second Phase of Requirements Development, but Faced Further Staffing and Schedule Constraints", "paragraphs": ["In Phase 2 of MSPV-NG, the program office has taken some steps to  incorporate greater clinical involvement in subsequent requirement  development, but both its requirements development and SAC\u2019s  contracting efforts have been hampered by staffing and schedule  constraints.

The IPTs were to review categories of medical  supplies such as operating room surgical supplies and patient exam room  instruments and supplies. According to VA officials and our analysis, this  revised approach was based on a recognition that more robust  mechanisms were needed for incorporating clinician input, in part,  because VA had sought information on best practices from leading  hospital networks, and because of shortcomings with the Phase 1  requirements that became apparent in the contracting process. Similar to  the analysis performed in support of the initial formulary, the MSPV-NG  program office analyzed updated data on medical center supply  purchases to generate a list that had grown from the 6,000 items  established for the initial formulary to a new total of about 9,900 items for  these new IPTs to review.", "The program office set a March 2017 deadline to complete this second,  IPT-based phase of requirements development\u2014VHA ultimately met this  compressed timeline, but in a rushed manner that limited the impact of  the clinical involvement. Program officials said they had difficulty  recruiting clinicians to participate, and the program office\u2019s first IPTs were  not established until the fall of 2016. In December 2016, slightly more  than half (20 of the 38) of the IPTs had begun their work to review items  and develop updated requirements. Many of the remaining IPTs were still  looking for additional clinicians to participate. Program officials said they  received assistance from the Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health  for Administrative Operations in December 2016. According to program  officials, this involvement proved critical in successfully recruiting staff to  participate in some of the remaining IPTs, which were then able to make  progress in reviewing each item in the formulary.", "However, the program office did not provide training for the IPTs on how  to carry out their work until late January 2017, about 2 months before the  IPTs were scheduled to complete the development of all medical and  surgical requirements. Further, staff on the IPTs had to complete their  responsibilities while simultaneously managing their regular workload as  physicians, surgeons, or nurses. By early March 2017, the IPTs still had  about 4,200 of the 9,900 items to review. Faced with meeting this  unrealistic time frame, the MSPV-NG program office had 9 IPT members  travel to one location\u2014with an additional 10 members participating  virtually\u2014to meet for 5 days to review the remaining items. Members told  us that this time pressure limited the extent to which they were able to  pursue the goal of standardizing supplies, and that their review ended up  being more of a data validation exercise than a standardization review.", "In addition, the program office attempted to pursue standardization across  all supply categories rather than those with the greatest potential for  standardization and cost avoidance and continues to lack a strategy for  doing so going forward. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government state that management should define what is to be achieved  and who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the time frames for  achievement. In addition, this approach runs counter to how leading  hospitals standardize their supply chains by tackling individual categories  one at a time and obtaining deep clinician involvement.

Because they were made on a non-competitive basis, the  Phase 1 limited source blanket purchase agreements were established  for a period of one year. In order to keep the full formulary available, the  SAC director said his staff must award several hundred contracts before  the Phase 1 limited source agreements expire later this year. However,  the SAC director stated that doing so will be difficult because his staff  must award between 200 to 250 contracts in a 3-month period from the  end of September 2017 through December 2017. To adhere to this  ambitious schedule, each of the 15 contracting staff on the MSPV-NG  team would need to award between 13 to 17 contracts within 3 months,  equaling one contract per staff member every 5 to 6 days, which is  significantly faster than SAC\u2019s typical pace. SAC officials acknowledged  that it is unlikely that they will be able to award the 200 to 250 contracts  by the time the existing limited source agreements expire. According to  SAC officials, they are in the process of hiring more staff to deal with the  increased workload. Further, the SAC division director told us that they  cancelled all outstanding Phase 2 solicitations in September 2017 due to  low response rates, protests from service-disabled veteran-owned small  businesses, and changes in overall MSPV-NG strategy.

SAC officials stated that VA has not used these  types of agreements previously, and they pose a risk in that the supplier  is not required to perform and VA has no remedy if the supplier opts to  end the agreement or raise the price. These agreements also do not  allow VA to achieve its goal of achieving greater cost avoidance through  supply standardization and competitive contracts. Despite the unrealistic  time frames and the risks of the stopgap approach, VA has not developed  a plan for how to mitigate these risks, established an achievable schedule  for making the competitive Phase 2 contract awards, or prioritized the  various categories of supplies.

Once the initial formulary was established, medical centers faced  challenges matching supply items to the formulary and took varying  approaches, in part, due to incomplete guidance on key aspects of the  process and frequent changes in the items on the formulary. Providing  complete guidance and communicating the criteria and processes for  adding or removing items from the formulary would help centers more  effectively match items to the formulary, thereby increasing utilization,  which as of May 2017 was below VA\u2019s established target. Further,  because it does not calculate cost avoidance attributable to MSPV-NG,  VA cannot accurately measure the extent to which the program is  contributing to its overall cost avoidance goal.", "VA made changes during the second phase of requirements  development, in particular to encourage greater clinician involvement.  However, the program faces an unrealistic contracting schedule and has  not yet developed a plan for how to manage or mitigate the associated  risks.  Establishing such a plan is essential for risk mitigation, and supply  category prioritization could help VA target those categories most likely to  yield cost avoidance. In addition, while the program is planning to involve  national clinical program offices to obtain greater clinician buy-in, it has  not outlined whether or how it will use input from these groups to prioritize  its requirements development efforts. Without such input, VA will continue  to face challenges focusing on those supply categories that offer the best  opportunity for standardization and cost avoidance. Further, VA is  considering another major change in its MSPV program in which the  prime vendor may absorb some of the work currently conducted by SAC.   However, VA may face challenges in this new approach until it addresses  the existing shortcomings in the MSPV-NG program, such as the absence  of a documented overall strategy, insufficient clinician involvement in the  requirements development process, and lack of medical center buy-in.", "Meanwhile, among the 18 contract actions we reviewed, we found  shortcomings in planning and communication that led to medical centers\u2019  overreliance on emergency procurements to obtain routine goods and  services\u2014some of which could be made available via MSPV-NG\u2014 bypassing effective contracting practices like competition. These  emergency procurements can be a particular drain on resources,  especially those of contracting officers who must respond immediately to  fulfill emergency orders. Identifying opportunities to more strategically  purchase frequently purchased goods and services\u2014both at the local  levels and nationwide through the MSPV-NG program\u2014could help  minimize these workforce challenges and minimize costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making 10 recommendations to VA.", "The Director of the MSPV-NG program office should, with input from the  Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC), develop, document, and  communicate to stakeholders an overarching strategy for the program,  including how the program office will prioritize categories of supplies for  future phases of requirement development and contracting.

We also obtained and reviewed  additional program documentation, including communications to medical  centers and other stakeholders, briefings, and training and tools provided  to medical centers. We interviewed leaders in the VHA Procurement and  Logistics Office and Healthcare Commodity Program Executive Office  (the program office for MSPV-NG), as well as other staff involved in  planning and executing aspects of MSPV-NG.

The final site  visit to VISN 6 was also chosen as the VISN with the highest percentage  of contract actions designated as emergencies over the fiscal year 2014  through 2016 period. The selected medical centers in each VISN were  chosen based on our review of VA Electronic Contract Management  System (eCMS) data on emergency procurements within each VISN  (see  below) and geographic proximity to the VISN office location. At each  selected VISN, we interviewed the Chief Supply Chain Officer and other  members of leadership.
