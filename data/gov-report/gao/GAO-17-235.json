From 2003 through 2008, employees of one contractor at DOE's Hanford site in Washington state made hundreds of fraudulent purchases and solicited and received kickbacks. In another case, Hanford contractors agreed to pay a combined $125 million to settle disputed claims regarding federal dollars spent on nonnuclear-compliant parts. To help federal program managers combat fraud, in July 2015, GAO issued leading practices for managing fraud risks.", "GAO was asked to review DOE's processes, programs, and practices for managing its risk of fraud. This report examines (1) DOE's approach to managing its risk of fraud and other improper payments and challenges, if any, that may limit the effectiveness of this approach; (2) the extent to which DOE's approach incorporates leading practices; and (3) the application of data analytics in identifying potential indicators of fraud or other improper payments associated with selected DOE contracts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Energy (DOE) manages the risk of fraud and improper payments through its internal controls program, which includes, among other things, prepayment invoice reviews and post payment audits. However, several challenges limit the effectiveness of this approach. For example, DOE does not have a department-wide invoice review policy or well-documented procedures at five of the six sites with invoice review responsibilities. Consequently, DOE has no assurance that control activities at these sites are operating as intended. Time constraints also limit the effectiveness of invoice reviews. For example, some invoices can have numerous associated transactions and the reviews must be completed within a limited time frame before payment, which may be as short as 10 days.", "DOE's approach to managing fraud risk does not incorporate leading practices such as creating a dedicated antifraud entity to lead fraud risk management activities; conducting regular fraud risk assessments that are tailored to the program; developing and documenting a strategy to mitigate assessed fraud risks; or designing and implementing specific control activities, such as data analytic activities, to prevent and detect fraud. By not implementing leading practices, DOE is missing an opportunity to organize and focus its resources in a way that would allow it to mitigate the likelihood and impact of fraud. Moreover, the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015 establishes requirements aimed at improving federal agencies' controls and procedures for assessing and mitigating fraud risks through the use of data analytics. The legislation also directs the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to, among other things, establish implementation guidelines that incorporate fraud risk management leading practices. DOE officials told GAO that they plan to meet the requirements of the act but should not be expected to implement private industry leading practices prior to the issuance of OMB guidance. Incorporating leading practices could also help DOE more effectively implement the act's requirements once OMB guidance is available.", "It is not possible to fully employ data analytics as a tool to identify potential indicators of fraud or other improper payments at DOE because of limitations in contractor-maintained cost data. Much of the cost data maintained by the two DOE contractors GAO selected for data analytic purposes could not be used because these data did not include a complete universe of transactions that was reconcilable with amounts billed to DOE or did not contain details necessary to determine the nature of costs charged to DOE. Because DOE does not require its contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that are reconcilable with amounts charged to DOE, it is not well positioned to employ data analytics as a fraud detection tool. Effective fraud risk managers collect and analyze data and identify fraud trends and use them to improve fraud risk management activities, according to leading practices that GAO has previously identified. Without the detailed data necessary to conduct such analysis, DOE is missing an opportunity to develop, refine, and improve its experience with data analytic tools and techniques, and better position itself to meet the requirements of the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that DOE establish invoice review policies and procedures, employ leading practices such as data analytics to help manage fraud risk, and require that its contractors maintain sufficiently detailed cost data for reconciling with amounts charged. DOE generally concurred with five of GAO's six recommendations but did not agree to require contractors to maintain detailed data. GAO continues to believe that the recommendation is valid, as discussed in the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the largest contracting agency in the federal government outside of the  Department of Defense, the Department of Energy (DOE) relies primarily  on contractors to carry out its diverse missions and operate its  laboratories and other facilities, spending approximately 90 percent of its  annual budget of $27 billion on contracts and major capital asset projects  (i.e., those with an estimated cost of $750 million or more). DOE\u2019s history  of inadequate management and oversight of its contractors led us in 1990  to designate DOE\u2019s contract management, including both contract  administration and project management, as a high-risk area vulnerable to  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. In our 2013 High-Risk Update,  to acknowledge progress DOE had made in managing nonmajor projects  (i.e., those costing less than $750 million), we narrowed the focus of  DOE\u2019s high-risk designation to major contracts and projects but noted that  we would continue to monitor nonmajor projects to ensure that progress  in this area was sustained.", "Improper payments, which include fraudulent payments, are a significant  problem in the federal government, and over the past decade, there have  been a number of high-profile incidents involving fraudulent activity by  contractors at DOE. For example, from 2003 through 2008, contractor  employees at DOE\u2019s Hanford site in Washington State made hundreds of  fraudulent purchases using government purchase cards and solicited,  received, and accepted kickbacks. In this case, the contractor had been  alerted to weaknesses in its purchase card controls but failed to address  these weaknesses. In addition, the DOE Office of Inspector General  (OIG) has reported on numerous cases of fraud, including a case in which  a subcontractor and former state grants administrator conspired to submit  fraudulent documents and make false claims to obtain approximately $2  million in funds DOE had received under the 2009 American Recovery  and Reinvestment Act. More recently, in November 2016, DOE  contractors responsible for designing and constructing the Hanford Waste  Treatment Plant in Richland, Washington, agreed to pay a combined  $125 million to settle part of a lawsuit alleging, among other things, that  the contractors failed to comply with the nuclear quality requirements of  the Waste Treatment Plant contract in connection with the procurement,  fabrication, and installation of certain of its components. The settlement  also covers claims that one contractor improperly used federal funds for  lobbying purposes.", "To address the problem of improper payments, legislation enacted since  2002 requires, among other things, that federal agencies review their  programs and identify those that are susceptible to significant improper  payments\u2014a process known as risk assessment. In December 2014, we  found that DOE had developed a process to assess its programs\u2019 risk of  improper payments, but that the process was not followed by all DOE  programs. For example, 26 of DOE\u2019s 55 programs did not prepare risk  assessments in 2011. DOE, nonetheless, reported that it did not have  any programs susceptible to significant improper payments. We  recommended that DOE take steps to improve its risk assessments,  including revising guidance for its programs. DOE concurred with our  recommendations and has taken some steps to improve its guidance for  assessing its risk of improper payments.", "While legislation has focused federal managers\u2019 attention on addressing  improper payments, including such payments made as a result of fraud,  the deceptive nature of fraud makes it difficult to measure in a reliable  way. In addition, standards for internal control in the federal government  require managers to consider the potential for fraud when identifying,  analyzing, and responding to risks. In July 2015, to help federal program  managers combat fraud and ensure integrity in government agencies and  programs, we issued A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal  Programs. In this guide, we identified leading practices for managing  fraud risks and organized them into a conceptual framework called the  Fraud Risk Framework. One of the leading practices we identified was the  use of data analytics to prevent and detect fraud. Data analytics enable  an organization to analyze transactional data to obtain insights into the  operating effectiveness of internal controls and to identify improper cost  charges, potential indicators of fraud, or actual fraudulent payments or  activities. In June 2016, Congress passed the Fraud Reduction and Data  Analytics Act of 2015, which established requirements aimed at improving  federal agencies\u2019 controls and procedures for assessing and mitigating  fraud risks and capabilities to identify, prevent, and respond to fraud,  including improper payments, through the development and use of data  analytics. Furthermore, this legislation directed the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) to, among other things, establish guidelines for  agencies for implementing control activities to prevent, detect, and  respond to fraud, including improper payments; these guidelines are to  incorporate the leading practices identified in the Fraud Risk Framework.", "You requested that we review DOE\u2019s processes, programs, and practices  for managing its risk of fraud.

In  addition, we interviewed DOE officials from headquarters organizations,  including the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Office of the  Chief Risk Officer, and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). We  interviewed DOE\u2019s field CFOs and contracting officers at 10 DOE site  offices and DOE\u2019s contractors at each site, and we determined that 6 of  those sites oversaw at least one non-M&O contractor. In addition, we  collected DOE policies and procedures for oversight and review of  contractor costs from each site office. We reviewed and analyzed DOE  and contractor responses and information provided through the interview  process. We visited DOE\u2019s Hanford office in Richland, Washington, and  the National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s (NNSA) Office of Financial  Performance in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to gain an in-depth  understanding of the local DOE processes for oversight of contractors\u2019  costs.", "To examine the extent to which DOE\u2019s approach incorporates leading  practices, we reviewed the standards and guidance of the Institute of  Internal Auditors and our Fraud Risk Framework to identify leading  practices for managing the risk of fraud and improper payments in the  federal government, and we compared DOE\u2019s policies and procedures  with selected leading practices. To ensure that we had a cross section of  leading practices, we selected at least one leading practice from each of  the following components of the Fraud Risk Framework: commit to  combating fraud, assess fraud risk, and design and implement a strategy  for mitigating risk. The leading practices we selected from each  component were chosen because the use of these practices could be  objectively verified.", "To examine the application of data analytics in identifying potential  indicators of fraud or other improper payments for selected DOE  contracts, we selected data from Sandia Corporation, the management  and operating (M&O) contractor responsible for managing and operating  Sandia National Laboratories, and Bechtel National, Inc., the non-M&O  contractor responsible for the design and construction of the Waste  Treatment Plant at DOE\u2019s Hanford site, for transaction-level cost data for  fiscal years 2013 through 2015. We selected these contractors for in- depth review based on type of contractor (M&O and non-M&O), contract  size in dollars, and geographic location (for ease of access to contractor  data).To assess the reliability of the data we obtained, we interviewed  DOE officials responsible for the data to understand how the data were  maintained and performed data testing, including checking totals in the  data against control totals provided by DOE, and examining, among other  things, outliers and missing data. We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our engagement.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to March 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

DOE relies on contracts in general, and M&O contracts in  particular, to do much of this work.", "The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) authorizes DOE and other  agencies with sufficient statutory authority and the need for contracts to  manage and operate their facilities to use the M&O form of contract, but,  according to DOE, it is the only agency using such contracts. An M&O  contract is characterized both by its purpose and by the special  relationship it creates between government and contractor. For example,  the FAR recognizes that because of the nature of M&O contract work, or  because it is to be performed in government facilities, the government  must maintain special, close relationships with its M&O contractors and  the contractors\u2019 personnel in various important areas (e.g., safety,  security, cost control, and site conditions).", "DOE\u2019s use of M&O contracts has changed over time. Beginning in the  1990s, DOE undertook a detailed review of the then-existing M&O  contracts to determine if the mission requirements remained appropriate  for using such contracts. As a result of that review, DOE reduced the  number of M&O contracts from approximately 52 to 29 and began using  more non-M&O contracts, particularly for its environmental management  activities and for some large capital asset construction projects. Although  DOE uses fewer M&O contracts today than it did in the 1990s, they  remain the primary contract form it uses, in terms of contract spending. In  fiscal year 2015, for example, DOE had almost 6,700 non-M&O contracts  and 22 M&O contracts. That year, DOE spent almost $19 billion on its  M&O contracts\u2014three-quarters of its total $25 billion in spending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost-Reimbursement Contracts and Cost- Surveillance Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of the contract form used\u2014M&O or non-M&O\u2014the majority of  DOE\u2019s contracts are cost-reimbursement contracts.

This type of contract is  considered high risk for the government because the primary risk of cost  overruns is placed on the government. Cost-reimbursement contracts  also require significantly more government oversight than do fixed-price  contracts. For example, for cost-reimbursement contracts, the  government must determine that the contractor\u2019s accounting system is  adequate for determining costs related to the contract and update this  determination periodically. In addition, the government needs to monitor  contractor costs\u2014known as cost surveillance\u2014to provide reasonable  assurance that the contractor is using efficient methods and effective cost  controls.", "By employing cost-surveillance procedures under cost-reimbursement  contracts, the government can help ensure that the contractor is  performing efficiently and effectively and that the government pays only  for allowable, allocable, and reasonable costs applicable to the contract.  As we reported in September 2009, federal agencies use a range of  procedures for monitoring contractor cost controls. The procedures  generally used by the civilian agencies we reviewed called for invoice  reviews. Invoice reviews help to ensure that the goods and services for  which the government is being billed were actually received, that the  amounts billed are allowable, and that the government is not incurring  costs that are inadequately supported.

Moreover, several sites referenced DOE\u2019s Acquisition Guide as their  invoice review policy or procedure. However, as discussed above, DOE\u2019s  Acquisition Guide does not contain the details necessary to be an  operating procedure.

According to a 2013 DOE Acquisition Workforce Study commissioned by  DOE, insufficient capacity to properly administer contracts raises the risk  of fraud, waste, and abuse, which could result in extra cost and delay.  The core challenge facing DOE\u2019s acquisition community, according to the  study, is the pervasive lack of sufficient staffing in the majority of DOE  field procurement offices. As we have reported previously, having the  capacity to perform contractor oversight duties is an important criterion for  demonstrating progress toward addressing DOE\u2019s contract and project  management challenges\u2014an area we have designated as at high risk for  fraud, waste, and abuse. Because contracting officers and their  delegates play an important role in ensuring that the government makes  payments to contractors only for goods and services received and  accepted pursuant to contractual terms, these challenges also impact  DOE\u2019s ability to properly review contractor invoices.", "DOE\u2019s ability to perform comprehensive invoice reviews is also limited by  the large number of transactions associated with individual invoices and  the limited amount of time DOE has to submit payment after receipt of an  invoice. For example, the contractor responsible for the design and  construction of the Hanford Waste Treatment Plant submits biweekly  invoices for $20 million or more that average over 10,000 transactions  each. Upon receipt of the contractor\u2019s invoice, according to the terms of  the contract, DOE has 10 business days to submit its payment.  Consequently, officials responsible for performing invoice reviews may  not be able to determine, prior to payment, if the amounts billed to DOE  are allowable. For example, a reviewing official at the Hanford site  included a disclaimer on invoices he reviewed, stating that \u201cthe  appropriateness of the invoiced costs could not be determined in the time  allotted.\u201d", "Given the time constraints associated with prepayment review of invoices,  DOE\u2019s Hanford Office also selectively performs post payment invoice  review; it is the only one of the six site offices to do so. Specifically,  DOE\u2019s Hanford Office selects a non-statistical sample of between 75 and  100 invoiced transactions to review on a quarterly basis after the invoices  have been paid, according to the site\u2019s local procedures. Officials from  the Hanford Office told us that the items sampled are selected based on  risk and that risk is determined based on a variety of factors, such as the  results of internal and external audits. Using this approach, the Hanford  Office was able to select and review less than 1 percent of the  contractor\u2019s costs for fiscal years 2013 through 2015.

However, resource constraints limit the effectiveness of these audits. For  non-M&O contracts, DOE relies on DCAA to perform audits of  contractors\u2019 invoiced costs. However, resource issues and a backlog of  audits at DCAA have resulted in audit delays. According to a 2015 DOE  OIG report, some of DOE\u2019s non-M&O contracts have not been audited in  over 8 years. To try to address the DCAA audit backlog, DOE has used  independent public accounting firms, expanded internal audit functions,  and relied more heavily on invoice reviews and OIG audits and  assessments. However, DOE\u2019s OIG reported that these methods have  not been completely effective and do not meet audit standards in some  cases.", "For the 22 M&O contracts DOE had in fiscal year 2015, which accounted  for about 75 percent of DOE\u2019s spending, DOE did not perform post  payment reviews of contractor costs. We reported in August 2016 that  DOE officials told us they were able to monitor the appropriateness of  M&O contractors\u2019 withdrawal of funds in near real time. DOE officials  said that this was possible because M&O contractors are required to  integrate their accounting systems with DOE\u2019s accounts each month,  which provides DOE with visibility into contractor accounts. However, with  the exception of monitoring aggregate spending to ensure that costs do  not exceed budgetary limits, DOE policies and procedures do not require  that sites monitor M&O contractor withdrawals to determine the  appropriateness of costs incurred by the contractor. Specifically, none of  the cost-surveillance policies, procedures, or guidance used by DOE sites  discusses real-time monitoring of contractor withdrawals. Moreover, there  are logistical issues at some sites that make it unlikely that such  monitoring is occurring on a routine basis. According to DOE officials, not  all sites have direct access to or visibility into M&O contractors\u2019 systems.  For example, to monitor withdrawals, DOE officials at one site said that  they would need to gain access to the contractor\u2019s system by traveling to  the contractor\u2019s site to obtain information about specific cost transactions.  In addition, DOE does not require M&O contractors to submit invoices  before receiving payment and instead requires a \u201cpayments cleared  financing arrangement,\u201d which is the authority for contractors to draw  funds directly from federal accounts to pay for contract performance.  Under this arrangement, DOE does not use prepayment reviews to  determine the appropriateness of M&O contract costs.", "Moreover, for its M&O contracts, DOE does not use an independent third  party to audit contractors\u2019 costs and ensure that invoiced costs are  allowable under the contract. Instead, incurred cost audits are performed  by the M&O contractors\u2019 internal audit staff under a process known as the  \u201ccooperative audit strategy.\u201d Specifically, the M&O contractors\u2019 internal  audit organization is responsible for performing operational and financial  audits, assessing the adequacy of management control systems, and  conducting an audit of the M&O contractors\u2019 incurred cost statements. In  addition, M&O contractors are required to conduct or arrange for audits of  their subcontractors when subcontracts are structured as cost  reimbursement-type contracts, including time and materials and cost  reimbursable subcontracts. According to the OIG\u2019s audit manual, under  the cooperative audit strategy, each year DOE\u2019s OIG performs an  assessment of incurred cost statements for the 10 M&O contractors that  incurred and claimed the most costs that year.  For the remaining M&O  contractors, the OIG performs assessments based on risk. If not  considered high-risk, the OIG assesses the contractor at least once every  four years. The OIG assessments, however, do not represent  independent third-party audits. Although the OIG is an independent third  party, according to the DOE OIG audit manual, cost statement work  under the cooperative audit strategy is not an audit but instead follows  standards for review-level engagements, which are substantially less  broad in scope. According to the OIG, the framework of the Cooperative  Audit Strategy ensures the integrity and reliability of the review-level  engagements by confirming the independence of the M&O internal audit  organizations and through various oversite procedures.

The Fraud Reduction  and Data Analytics Act of 2015, which Congress passed in June 2016,  establishes requirements aimed at improving federal agencies\u2019 controls  and procedures for assessing and mitigating fraud risks and directs OMB  to establish implementation guidelines that incorporate the leading  practices identified in the Fraud Risk Framework.", "We compared the following leading practices in the standards and  guidance of the Institute of Internal Auditors and our Fraud Risk  Framework with DOE\u2019s policies and procedures.", "Dedicated entity to manage fraud risk.

DOE has not created a structure with a  dedicated antifraud entity to lead fraud risk management activities. In  August 2015, DOE established its first Chief Risk Officer to advance  department-wide approaches to enterprise risk management, which  may include fraud risk management. However, the Chief Risk Officer  has a broad focus on general risks to the department, and the specific  responsibilities of the position have yet to be defined. As a result, it is  not clear whether the position will include leading practices related to  an antifraud entity\u2019s responsibilities, such as serving as the repository  of knowledge on fraud risks and controls, managing the fraud risk  assessment process, and leading or assisting with training and other  fraud awareness activities.", "Fraud risk assessments and profile. According to our Fraud Risk  Framework, an effective antifraud entity tailors the approach for  carrying out regular fraud risk assessments to its programs. This  allows the agency to develop a fraud risk profile that fully considers  the specific fraud risks the agency or program faces, analyze the  potential likelihood and impact of fraud schemes, and then ultimately  document prioritized fraud risks. DOE has not conducted fraud risk  assessments that are tailored to its programs and that would allow the  department to create a fraud risk profile, which is considered a leading  practice for managing the risk of fraud. In March 2016, DOE revised  its internal control evaluation guidance with the stated purpose of  updating its focus on the identification of improper payment risks and  fraud risks, among other things. According to DOE\u2019s revised  guidance, DOE updated its internal control assessment tools to allow  its offices to identify and manage fraud risks. DOE provided us with  a list of fraud risks that they had identified for fiscal year 2016 using  the revised assessment tools. Examples of risks identified include  statements such as \u201cif costs are inaccurately reported, then  mischarging could occur, impacting budgets and financial statements\u201d  and \u201cif requisitions are not approved by the appropriate personnel,  then inappropriate purchases may be made.\u201d DOE\u2019s approach was  not tailored to DOE programs; instead, it provided all sites with the  same list of potential risks. According to our Fraud Risk Framework,  an effective antifraud entity tailors the approach for carrying out fraud  risk assessments to the program. More specifically, antifraud entities  that effectively plan fraud risk assessments identify specific tools,  methods, and sources for gathering information about fraud risks. This  information includes data on fraud schemes and trends from  monitoring and detection activities. Because DOE\u2019s approach to  assessing its fraud risk is not tailored to its programs, DOE is not  positioned to determine each program\u2019s fraud risk profile.", "Strategy to mitigate fraud risk. Managers who effectively manage  fraud risk, according to our Fraud Risk Framework, develop and  document an antifraud strategy that describes the program\u2019s  approach for addressing the prioritized fraud risks identified during the  fraud risk assessment. An effective antifraud strategy describes the  program\u2019s activities for preventing, detecting, and responding to fraud.  DOE has not developed or documented a DOE-wide antifraud  strategy or directed individual programs to develop program-specific  strategies, according to DOE officials. As discussed previously,  federal internal control standards require managers to design a  response to analyzed risks. Managers should consider the likelihood  and impact of the risks, as well as their defined risk tolerance. These  are key elements of a program\u2019s fraud risk profile. According our  Fraud Risk Framework, effective managers of fraud risks use the  program\u2019s fraud risk profile to help decide how to allocate resources to  respond to fraud risks.", "Specific control activities to prevent or detect fraud or improper  payments. Managers who effectively manage fraud risks design and  implement specific control activities, such as fraud awareness and  data analytic activities, according to our Fraud Risk Framework. DOE  has not designed and implemented specific control activities to  prevent and detect fraud and other improper payments. Of the 10 field  offices responsible for overseeing contractor costs, none required  employees responsible for reviewing contractor costs to attend fraud  awareness training. Moreover, DOE does not routinely use data  analytic techniques. Data analytics is a type of control activity that can  be effective in detecting fraudulent spending or other improper  payments. Of the 10 field offices responsible for reviewing contractor  costs, officials from 4 reported in their questionnaire responses that  they employed data analytic techniques to help detect fraudulent or  other improper costs in contractor invoices or charges.

According to their response to our questionnaire,  officials at the Hanford Office reported that they use data trending, risk  matrixes, cost data graphing, and key word searches to look for  anomalies. However, Hanford officials did not provide documentation  to illustrate their use of these data analytic techniques as we had  requested. In addition, the office\u2019s invoice review procedures do not  discuss the application of the data analytic techniques Hanford  officials reported using.

Moreover, given that DOE has not  conducted fraud risk assessments that are tailored to its programs, it is  unclear how DOE officials reached the conclusion that the department\u2019s  risk of fraud is low. As discussed previously, the deceptive nature of fraud  makes it difficult to measure in a reliable way. For example, the alleged  fraudulent activity discussed previously, which involved contractors at  DOE\u2019s Hanford site and resulted in a $125 million settlement, was  identified and reported by whistleblowers.

Of the nearly $1.8 billion in costs, $1.342 billion were  sufficiently detailed for the purpose of employing data analytics (see fig.  1). However, about $437 million in subcontractor costs were not  sufficiently detailed. Payments to subcontractors accounted for almost 25  percent of all expenses billed by the non-M&O contractor to DOE for this  period, but these transactions did not contain specific information  regarding the types of services or materials purchased from the  subcontractor. Without detailed cost data for the entire population of  subcontractor-related costs, analyses of these costs were not possible.  According to DOE officials, they review most types of costs as part of  their quarterly post payment invoice review process.

Specifically, as part of its regular selective invoice  reviews, the Hanford Office reviewed 4 relocation and temporary  assignment transactions identified as \u201cmiscellaneous other payments  or reimbursements,\u201d 4 of the subcontractor affiliated transactions, and  1 of the nearly 10,000 payroll cost transactions that were included in  the \u201cother direct costs\u201d data file instead of the \u201clabor\u201d file. The Hanford  Office did not review any of the $7.8 million in lump-sum per-diem  payments or the Christmas Day purchases on Amazon.", "In addition to the costs we identified above, we had initially identified $2  million in costs for equipment depreciation expenses billed to DOE that  we thought were unusual until DOE officials provided us with information  that clarified our understanding of the contractor\u2019s data. Specifically,  DOE officials explained that the entire description of the account we were  examining was \u201cdepreciation or purchase\u201d and that, in response to our  observations, the Hanford office reviewed two transactions from this  account and found that they were purchases and not depreciation.  Although DOE\u2019s clarification resolved our initial reason for flagging these  costs, the new information raised other questions regarding the use of a  single cost code to track dissimilar costs. The FAR requires that costs be  allowable, reasonable, and allocable to the contract. Unless contractor  costs are submitted in a manner that allows DOE to distinguish between  depreciation expenses and purchases without having to review every cost  submitted under a single cost code, it is unclear how DOE can ensure that costs are allowable and allocable. In addition, the contractor\u2019s use of  a single cost code to track dissimilar costs undermines DOE\u2019s ability to  identify potentially improper cost charges using data analytics.", "Data analytics, as discussed previously, enable an organization to  analyze transactional data to obtain insights into the operating  effectiveness of internal controls and to identify improper cost charges,  indicators of fraud, or actual fraudulent activities. Because automated  checks are less labor-intensive than traditional control mechanisms, such  as manual checks, automating data analytic tests can allow managers to  monitor large amounts of data more efficiently. Regarding the usefulness  of performing data analytics, DOE officials told us that a data analytic  analysis would not be cost-effective because it produced too many false  positives\u2014that is, unusual transactions that are later determined to be  legitimate. In addition, they said that until recently there was no  requirement to perform data analytics and, because it has not been  required, they have not devoted the time or manpower to developing and  implementing data analytic tools and techniques.", "DOE officials said that they agreed that our review may have helped  identify how the use of data analytics can be expanded at DOE but said  that performing data analytics would require DOE to complete \u201cother  steps\u201d in our Fraud Risk Framework before deciding to design and  implement additional analytics. However, practices in the Fraud Risk  Framework are not necessarily meant to be sequential or interpreted as a  step-by-step process. According to the Fraud Risk Framework, effective  fraud risk managers collect and analyze data on identified fraud trends  and use them to improve fraud risk management activities. For instance,  managers may revise data analytic tests based on identified fraud  schemes to better identify these schemes in the future. However,  because DOE has not employed data analytics, as discussed previously,  the department has not benefitted from the experience of designing,  implementing, and improving its analytic procedures.

The  effectiveness of DOE\u2019s approach, however, is hampered by shortcomings  in control activities (policies and procedures). Without a department-wide  invoice review policy or well-documented procedures, DOE management  does not have assurance that invoice reviews are being performed or that  these control activities are operating as intended.", "In addition, DOE has not used leading practices in its approach to  managing its risk of fraud and other improper payments. In particular,  DOE has not (1) created a structure with a dedicated entity to lead fraud  risk management activities; (2) conducted fraud risk assessments that are  tailored to its programs in order to develop a fraud risk profile; (3)  developed and documented a strategy to mitigate assessed fraud risks;  or (4) designed and implemented specific control activities, such as data  analytics, to prevent and detect fraud and other improper payments.

In its letter, DOE agreed to (1) establish a DOE-wide  invoice review policy that includes requirements for sites to establish well- documented invoice review operating procedures; (2) create a structure  with a dedicated entity within DOE to design and oversee fraud risk  management activities\u2014but stated that it will have to consider the cost,  benefits, and need for a separate organization before implementing a  dedicated antifraud entity to design and oversee fraud risk management  activities; (3) conduct fraud risk assessments that are tailored to each  program and use the assessments to develop a fraud risk profile; (4)  develop and document an antifraud strategy that describes the programs\u2019  approaches for addressing the prioritized fraud risks identified during the  fraud risk assessment; and (5) design and implement specific control  activities, including fraud awareness training and data analytics, to  prevent and detect fraud and other improper payments. DOE states that it  has already, or is in the process of, implementing each of these five  recommendations. We will continue to monitor DOE\u2019s efforts to implement  these changes and address our recommendations.", "In its letter, DOE did not concur with our sixth recommendation to require  contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data that  are reconcilable with amounts charged to the government. In its letter,  DOE states that it does not concur with this recommendation because the  recommendation establishes agency-specific requirements for DOE  contractors that are more prescriptive than current federal requirements  and that its M&O contractors, not DOE, are responsible for performing  data analytics and determining what data are needed to do so. Based on  DOE\u2019s response we are concerned that it does not fully appreciate its  responsibility for overseeing contractor costs. Specifically:", "DOE disagreed with our recommendation because it asserted that  implementing the recommendation would require DOE to establish  agency-specific requirements for DOE contractors that are more  prescriptive than current federal requirements. However, under the  FAR agencies are authorized to establish their own agency-specific  requirements governing contracts. Under federal internal control  standards, managers should use quality information to achieve the  entity\u2019s objectives. To do this, managers may identify information  requirements, obtain relevant data from reliable internal and external  sources, and process data into information that is appropriate, current,  complete, accurate, accessible, and provided on a timely basis.", "DOE also stated that its fiscal year 2017 internal control evaluations  guidance requires M&O contractors to apply data-analytics, as  appropriate, and that federal employees assess the contractors\u2019  implementation of fraud risk activities, such as the use of data analytic  tools to identify fraud risk factors. DOE\u2019s letter, however, does not  acknowledge that it has a responsibility for employing data-analytics  under the Fraud Reduction and Data Analytics Act of 2015. Instead,  DOE\u2019s letter states that under the M&O contracting model, the  contractor is responsible for performing data-analytics. The act\u2014 which is intended to improve federal agencies' development and use  of data analytics for the purpose of identifying, preventing, and  responding to fraud, including improper payments\u2014does not  specifically authorize DOE (or any other agency) to delegate its fraud  management responsibilities to a contractor or any other nonfederal  entity. The use of some data analytic techniques by its contractors  does not relieve DOE of its responsibility to establish and maintain an  effective fraud risk management framework.  In addition, as we  discuss in our report, the one M&O contractor we examined was  unable to produce data that were suitable for data-analytic techniques  to produce meaningful results. We continue to believe that the use of  data-analytic techniques by DOE employees could help mitigate some  of the challenges that limit the effectiveness of DOE\u2019s approach for  overseeing M&O contractor costs. However, effectively applying data- analytics is dependent upon the availability of complete and  sufficiently detailed contractor data. Therefore, we continue to believe  that DOE needs to implement our recommendation and require  contractors to maintain sufficiently detailed transaction-level cost data  that are reconcilable with amounts charged to the government.", "Although DOE did not concur with our sixth recommendation, DOE\u2019s  letter states that it will discuss the merits of government-wide guidance for  applying data-analytics to contract costs with the data-analytics working  group that OMB is required to establish as part of the Fraud Reduction  and Data Analytics Act of 2015. DOE stated that if the working group  determines that there is a need for contractors to retain and provide  additional data to support data analytic procedures, any proposed new  requirement should be discussed with the FAR Council; the OMB Office  of Federal Procurement Policy; and potentially, the OMB Office of  Intergovernmental and Regulatory Affairs. However, the purpose of the  working group is to share \"financial and administrative controls\" and  \"data-analytics techniques\". In other words, this is an information sharing  entity to facilitate the sharing of fraud management best practices. It is not  an implementing body, and agencies do not need its permission before  proceeding with fraud risk reduction efforts. The law does not prohibit  DOE (or any other agency) from acting unless and until there is  interagency consensus on an issue.", "In addition to DOE\u2019s response to our recommendations, DOE\u2019s letter  states that the department is concerned with the accuracy of statements  throughout the report. Specifically, DOE states that it has invoice review  procedures and uses data analytics in its internal control processes. We  disagree. As we discuss in our report, officials with the Office of the CFO  at DOE headquarters told us that DOE does not have department-wide  invoice review policies and procedures. Instead, according to these  officials, field CFOs and contracting officials are responsible for  developing appropriate invoice review policies and procedures. Notably,  in our query of all DOE sites, we found that most did not have well- documented invoice review procedures. Regarding the use of data- analytics, DOE officials stated that DOE\u2019s contractors use some data- analytic techniques.  However, as we discuss in our report, most DOE  sites in our query of all sites do not use data-analytics.  Further, as  discussed in the report, we reviewed one of DOE\u2019s large M&O contractors  and found that cost data is not maintained in a way to support  comprehensive data analysis and neither the contractor nor DOE was  doing such analyses.", "In its letter, DOE also states that the report should acknowledge DOE\u2019s  compliance with requirements in effect at the time of our review.

The Fraud Risk Framework consists  of four components\u2014commit, assess, design and implement, and  evaluate and adapt\u2014each of which are overarching fraud risk  management concepts and leading practices for carrying out the  overarching concept. To ensure that we had a cross section of leading  practices, we selected at least one leading practice from each component  of the Fraud Risk Framework: commit to combating fraud by creating an  organizational culture and structure that is conducive to fraud risk  management, plan regular fraud risk assessments and assess risks to  determine a fraud risk profile, and design and implement a strategy with  specific control activities to mitigate assessed fraud risks. After  determining that DOE had not adopted fraud risk management activities  that incorporated leading practices from the first three components, we  did not assess whether DOE was evaluating and adapting its use of  leading fraud risk management practices. The leading practices we  selected from each component were selected because the use of these  practices could be objectively verified. We then compared DOE\u2019s  approach to managing its risk of fraud and improper payments, including  our analyses and summary of its policies and procedures for oversight of  its contractors, with the key leading practices and identified similarities  and differences between these practices and DOE\u2019s approach.", "To examine the application of data analytics in identifying potential  indicators of fraud or other improper payments associated with selected  DOE contracts, we planned to review costs charged to DOE by one  management and operating (M&O) contractor and one non-M&O  contractor. We selected these contractors for in-depth review based on  type of contractor, contract size in dollars, and ease of access of  contractor data. Specifically, we selected one M&O and one non-M&O  contract to review because these types of contracts charge costs to DOE  differently and we wanted to capture this variation in our review. We  chose two contracts that were large in terms of dollars charged to DOE in  order to have two large data sets with many types of expenses to  analyze. We selected the non-M&O contractor at the Hanford Site for  ease of access to the data and proximity to our offices for follow-up on  data questions and issues. We selected the M&O contractor because it is  co-located with DOE\u2019s NNSA Office of Financial Performance, the field  office responsible for oversight of all NNSA contractors, also making it  much easier to follow up on data questions and issues.", "We requested 3 years of cost data charged to DOE by each contractor  during fiscal years 2013 through 2015.", "Non-M&O contractor analysis.
