The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services from interfering with price negotiations between Part D plan sponsors and drug manufacturers and pharmacies. Some Members of Congress have proposed amending the statute to allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers on behalf of Part D beneficiaries.

This testimony provides an overview of such efforts (1) by governments in other countries; (2) by U.S. private payers, such as employer-based health plans; and (3) by federal programs other than Medicare Part D. This testimony is based on previous GAO reports from 2002 through 2006 on federal programs that purchase or cover prescription drugs and other relevant literature from congressional agencies and federal or international organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Governments in other countries use a range of approaches to limit the amount they pay to acquire drugs. Ceiling prices establish a maximum price manufacturers may charge for their products. Purchasers may sometimes negotiate more favorable prices directly with drug manufacturers. Reference prices use local or international price comparisons of drugs classified in a group as therapeutically similar to determine a single or maximum price for all drugs in that group. Profit limits control how much profit a drug manufacturer may earn per product or within a specified period of time. Other factors--such as scope of coverage and national formularies, which are generally lists of preferred drugs--influence drug price negotiations. In the U.S. private health insurance market, health plans typically contract with pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) to help manage their prescription drug benefits. PBMs negotiate rebates or payments with drug manufacturers, encourage substitution of generic drugs for therapeutically similar brand drugs, and negotiate discounted prices with networks of retail and mail-order pharmacies, passing along at least some of the savings to health plans and enrollees. PBMs influence price negotiations with manufacturers through formulary development and management and through the large market share they often represent. Approaches for negotiating drug prices vary among federal programs in the United States. In part, these approaches depend on whether the programs purchase and distribute drugs directly or reimburse retail pharmacies or other providers for dispensing or delivering drugs. While the approaches used by federal programs in the United States reflect U.S. laws, markets, and health care delivery and financing, there are also elements common to some of the approaches used by other countries and by private payers. Some federal programs set ceiling prices, others establish prices by referencing prices negotiated by private payers in the commercial market, and still others rely on negotiations with manufacturers, directly or through private health plans. For example, the Departments of Veterans Affairs's and Defense's prices for a prescription drug may be the lowest of a ceiling price, other established price, or a price negotiated with the manufacturer. State Medicaid programs, joint federal-state programs that finance medical services for certain low-income adults and children, reimburse retail pharmacies for drugs dispensed to beneficiaries at set prices. The programs receive rebates from manufacturers that are meant to take advantage of the prices for drugs in the commercial market and are required to reflect discounts and rebates negotiated by private payers with manufacturers. For health benefits offered to federal employees, retirees, and dependents, rather than negotiating with manufacturers, the government contracts with participating health plans that typically use PBMs to negotiate drug prices and offer other pharmacy benefit, administrative, and clinical services."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you examine approaches for prescription  drug pricing and negotiations. In the United States and in other countries,  the rising cost of prescription drugs continues to pose significant financial  burdens on governments, private payers, and individuals responsible for  paying for drugs. This has led to a wide range of market-based and  governmental approaches to reduce drug spending. Some of these  approaches rely on negotiations between payers for prescription drugs  and drug manufacturers.", "In the United States, prescription drugs are a particular focus for the  federal government as Medicare\u2014the federal health insurance program  that serves nearly 43 million elderly and disabled individuals\u2014begins the  second year of its voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit. This  benefit, known as Medicare Part D, was established by the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA)  beginning January 1, 2006. Medicare beneficiaries may choose a Part D  plan from multiple plans offered by private sponsors, largely commercial  insurers, under contract with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) that administers Medicare. These plans differ in the drugs  they cover, the pharmacies they use, and the prices they negotiate with  drug manufacturers and pharmacies. In addition, costs to the enrollee for  the monthly premium, the annual deductible, and copayments for covered  drugs vary by plan.", "While the Medicare Part D benefit is characterized by multiple competing  prescription drug plans that are overseen by CMS, MMA prohibits the  Secretary of Health and Human Services from interfering with price  negotiations between Part D plan sponsors and drug manufacturers and  pharmacies. Some Members of Congress, contending that the combined  purchasing power on behalf of all Medicare Part D beneficiaries could be  used as leverage, have proposed amending the law to provide for the  Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with drug  manufacturers.", "As Congress considers these issues for Medicare Part D, you asked that we  broadly describe the variety of approaches used to negotiate drug prices.  Specifically, my remarks today will provide an overview of the approaches  used to negotiate drug prices by governments in other countries, by  private payers in the United States, and by federal programs other than  Medicare Part D. My remarks are primarily based on our previous reports  from 2002 through 2006 on federal programs that purchase or cover  prescription drugs, which were done in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards, as well as other relevant  literature on approaches in the United States and other countries prepared  by congressional agencies and international and federal organizations.", "In summary, a wide range of approaches is used by other countries and by  private payers and federal programs in the United States to negotiate drug  prices. The approaches governments in other countries use include the  following:    Ceiling prices restrict market negotiations by setting maximum prices  purchasers can pay for drugs. Ceiling prices allow purchasers to negotiate  lower prices directly with drug manufacturers.", "Reference prices use local or international price comparisons of drugs  classified in a group as therapeutically similar to determine a single or  maximum price for all drugs in that group.", "Profit limits establish controls on drug manufacturers\u2019 profits that require  manufacturers to pay rebates or lower prices if profits exceed certain  levels.", "Other key factors\u2014such as scope of coverage and national formularies,  which are generally lists of preferred drugs\u2014influence drug price  negotiations.", "Private payers in the United States, including employer-based health plans  and private insurers, typically contract with pharmacy benefit managers  (PBM). PBMs negotiate rebates or payments with manufacturers and  prices with retail pharmacies, and they provide other related  administrative and clinical services. PBMs compete in the private market  based on their ability to negotiate reduced prices and contain costs, and  PBMs may receive compensation from health plans and from retaining  some of the savings they negotiate with pharmacies or manufacturers.  PBMs influence price negotiations with manufacturers through formulary  development and management and through the large number of health  plan enrollees they typically represent.", "Approaches for negotiating drug prices vary among federal programs in  the United States. Factors contributing to this variation include the use of  formularies and whether the programs purchase and distribute drugs,  reimburse retail pharmacies or other providers for drugs dispensed and  delivered, or contract with private health plans that provide and manage  pharmacy benefits. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)  and the Department of Defense (DOD) often purchase drugs from  suppliers, then distribute drugs to beneficiaries through internal facilities  or mail-order pharmacies. State Medicaid programs, on the other hand,  reimburse retail pharmacies for drugs dispensed to beneficiaries at set  prices. While the approaches used by federal programs in the United  States reflect the laws governing them, markets, and health care delivery  and financing, there are also elements common to some of the approaches  used by other countries and by private payers. Some federal programs set  ceiling prices, others establish prices by referencing prices negotiated by  private payers in the commercial market, and still others rely on  negotiations with manufacturers, either directly or through private health  plans. For example, VA\u2019s and DOD\u2019s prices for particular prescription  drugs included on their formularies may be the lowest of a ceiling price, a  price listed on a federal supply schedule (FSS), or the price negotiated  with a manufacturer. For health benefits offered to federal employees,  retirees, and their dependents, the federal government uses a different  approach, modeled after other large U.S. employers\u2019 health benefits. Under  this approach, rather than the government negotiating with manufacturers,  the government contracts with participating health plans that typically use  PBMs to negotiate drug prices, manage formularies, and offer other  pharmacy benefit, administrative, and clinical services."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prescription drug spending, paid for by a mix of public and private payers,  has outpaced total health care spending in the United States and other  countries in recent years.

On average, growth in drug spending outpaced the growth  in spending for total health expenditures. Among OECD member  countries, the share of public and private spending for prescription drugs  varies, but in 2004 public sources accounted for the bulk of spending in  most countries.", "In the United States, rising prescription drug prices and increased  spending have been a concern to federal and state governments and to  private payers, including private insurers and employer-based health  plans. CMS reports that total national spending by all public and private  payers for prescription drugs from retail outlets increased on average by  about 11 percent a year from 1998 through 2005\u2014faster than the average   7 percent a year increase in total U.S. health expenditures for the same  period. CMS also reports that national spending by all public and private  payers for prescription drugs from retail outlets totaled about $201 billion  in 2005. Nearly three-quarters (73 percent) of this spending came from  private funds\u2014including private insurance and out-of-pocket payments\u2014 while the remaining share came from public sources. The public share  includes the federal government\u2019s share of total spending for prescription  drugs from retail outlets. Federal spending for prescription drugs was  about 16 percent of the total, or $33 billion, in 2005. However, these data  precede the 2006 establishment of Medicare Part D, which increased  public and federal shares of prescription drug expenditures.", "In the face of rising prescription drug spending, the governments of other  countries, U.S. private payers, and federal programs have applied both  demand- and supply-side measures to contain prescription drug spending.  Demand-side measures are aimed at wholesalers, retailers, doctors, and  patients and include such strategies as prescribing guidelines, generic  substitution policies, and fixed and tiered copayments. Supply-side  measures are aimed at limiting the cost of prescription drugs by  negotiating prices and by requiring or encouraging the use of certain drugs  through formularies established by a government, health plan, or federal  program. Formularies have long been used to control the cost and  utilization of prescription drugs. Some formularies are more restrictive  than others; open formularies provide coverage for both listed and  nonlisted drugs, and closed formularies generally provide coverage only  for drugs that are included on the list. Many other formulary approaches  fall somewhere in between, encouraging the use of listed drugs by  charging higher copayments for those not listed. Under a tiered cost- sharing approach, for example, generic and preferred drugs require lower  copayments than brand and nonpreferred drugs. Health plans that use  formularies typically have provisions that enable enrollee access to  nonformulary drugs when they are medically necessary and allow patients  to appeal coverage decisions.", "In the U.S. private market, PBMs offer health plans a variety of  prescription drug management services, including negotiating rebates with  manufacturers, negotiating price discounts with retail pharmacies,  operating mail-order prescription services, managing drug formularies,  and processing claims. PBMs also provide health plans with clinical  services, such as formulary development and management, prior  authorization and drug utilization reviews to screen prescriptions for such  issues as adverse interactions or therapy duplication, and substitution of  generic drugs for therapeutically equivalent brand drugs. Health plans pay  PBMs fees for these administrative and clinical services as well as for  retail and mail-order drug costs. PBMs may also retain savings from or  have other financial incentives to negotiate lower drug prices and rebates.  In 2004, an estimated 200 million people, or about 68 percent of the U.S.  population, were enrolled in private health plans that used PBMs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Programs", "paragraphs": ["Beyond Medicare Part D, a range of federal programs, established by  statute, in the United States offer drug benefits to individuals meeting  various eligibility criteria.

In general, medications must be prescribed by a VA provider, filled  at a VA pharmacy or through a VA Consolidated Mail Outpatient  Pharmacy, and listed on the VA national drug formulary, which comprises  570 categories of drugs. In addition to the VA national drug formulary, VA  facilities can establish local formularies to cover drugs not on the national  formulary. VA may provide nonformulary drugs in cases of medical  necessity. In 2005, VA spent $4.2 billion on drugs and medicines.", "The DOD pharmacy benefit is provided to TRICARE beneficiaries,  including active duty and retired uniformed service members. In addition  to maintaining a formulary, DOD provides options for obtaining  nonformulary drugs. Beneficiaries can get prescription drugs through  network retail pharmacies, nonnetwork retail pharmacies, DOD military  treatment facilities, and DOD\u2019s TRICARE Mail Order Pharmacy.

While some benefits are  federally required, prescription drug coverage is an optional benefit that  all states have elected to offer. State Medicaid programs, though varying in  design, cover both brand and generic drugs. Drug coverage depends on the  manufacturer\u2019s participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program, through  which manufacturers pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for covered  drugs used by Medicaid beneficiaries. Retail pharmacies distribute drugs  to Medicaid beneficiaries, then receive reimbursements from states for the  acquisition cost of the drug and a dispensing fee. In 2004, Medicaid  outpatient drug spending peaked at $31 billion\u2014including $19 billion as  the federal share\u2014which was calculated after adjusting for manufacturer  rebates to states under the Medicaid drug rebate program. Medicaid  spending on outpatient prescription drugs is expected to decrease with the  transition of prescription drug coverage for dual eligibles\u2014those eligible  for both Medicaid and Medicare\u2014to the Medicare Part D program.", "The 340B drug pricing program gives more than 12,000 entities of various  types\u2014community health centers, AIDS clinics, and disproportionate  share hospitals among them\u2014access to discounted drug prices, called  340B ceiling prices. These entities must enroll in the program, which is  administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. The  program requires drug manufacturers to offer covered drugs to enrolled  entities at or below 340B ceiling prices. Enrolled entities establish their  own formularies and may dispense drugs through in-house pharmacies,  dispensing physicians, or contracted retail pharmacies. Enrolled entities  spent an estimated $3.4 billion on drugs in 2003.", "Medicare, the federal health insurance program that serves the nation\u2019s  elderly and certain disabled people, in addition to the outpatient  prescription drug benefit offered in Part D, covers certain other drugs  through Part B. Drugs covered by Part B are typically administered by  physicians or other medical professionals rather than by patients  themselves. These drugs include, for example, those furnished in  conjunction with dialysis services or durable medical equipment. In 2005,  Medicare paid more than $9 billion for drugs covered under Part B.", "The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) is the largest  employer-sponsored health insurance program in the country.

Ceiling prices restrict market negotiations by setting  maximum prices purchasers can pay for drugs. Ceiling prices allow  purchasers to negotiate lower prices directly with drug manufacturers.  One approach is for a government to set prices for drugs and prohibit sales  at greater prices. In France and Australia, for example, a government  committee sets the prices at which drugs must be purchased and  reimbursed. Alternatively, a government may set a price ceiling and allow  purchasers to negotiate more favorable prices with manufacturers  directly. In Canada, the Patented Medicines Prices Review Board sets the  maximum price a manufacturer can charge direct purchasers. It can  impose fines on any manufacturer that attempts to sell a drug at a price  greater than the established ceiling. An additional method used to control  prices is for a government to set reimbursement rates for new drugs at low  levels; because any price above the set reimbursement rate would be an  out-of-pocket expense to the consumer, the reimbursement rate effectively  becomes the market price.", "Reference prices. Reference prices use local or international price  comparisons of drugs classified in the same therapeutic group to  determine a single or maximum price for all drugs in that group. The  therapeutic group of drugs can encompass old and new drugs, including  brand or generic drugs. The lowest priced drug may then establish the  maximum price for the entire therapeutic group. Germany, for example,  sets such prices based on local price comparisons of drugs classified in the  same therapeutic group.", "Profit limits. Profit limits control the amount of profit a drug  manufacturer may earn on a product or within a specified period of time.  If the established threshold is exceeded, the manufacturer is required to  accept a price cut or pay rebates to the government. In the United  Kingdom, for example, there are limits on the profits that a drug  manufacturer can earn on sales to the National Health Service.", "Several other key factors can influence drug price negotiations in OECD  countries. Unlike the United States, many OECD countries, such as  Australia and France, have universal health care systems that allow a  mandated, relatively more unified approach to drug pricing. While these  countries vary in their government\u2019s respective share of drug spending,  some set national, uniform maximum prices to be paid by all purchasers,  including private payers.

PBMs negotiate rebates or payments with  manufacturers and prices with networks of retail and mail-order  pharmacies, passing along at least some of the savings to health plans and  enrollees. Manufacturers and pharmacies agree to these price concessions  in exchange for both the large number of enrollees PBMs represent and  the ability of PBMs to influence enrollee choice of drugs and pharmacies.", "One of the key ways PBMs influence price negotiations with  manufacturers is through formulary development and management. PBMs  may assist health plans in developing or managing a formulary that the  health plan will cover. Health plans often provide financial incentives,  such as lower enrollee cost-sharing, to encourage use of preferred drugs  listed on the formulary. Since PBMs represent a large number of  enrollees, manufacturers have a strong interest in having their drugs listed  on plan formularies. Manufacturers pay PBMs through rebates or other  payments to be included on plan formularies and to capture greater  market shares for their drugs. For example, many mail-order pharmacies  are owned by PBMs, and PBMs can obtain greater manufacturer rebates or  payments by dispensing a high volume of the manufacturer\u2019s drug.", "The extent to which pharmacy discounts and manufacturer rebates or  payments are shared with health plans and enrollees depends on  contractual arrangements with the health plan and the plan\u2019s benefit  design. For example, PBMs negotiate contracts with health plans and their  networks of pharmacies separately, which means that health plans may  pay PBMs higher prices for drugs than the PBM negotiated between itself  and the pharmacy. Similarly, PBMs often set up contractual arrangements  with manufacturers based on manufacturers\u2019 entire line of products rather  than per drug. Further, PBMs may retain a portion of the rebates or  payments they receive associated with individual health plans or all the  health plans they represent. PBMs may also obtain additional rebates or  payments from manufacturers for administering formularies or providing  certain services, such as encouraging the use of one therapeutically similar  drug over another."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Approaches Used by U.S. Federal Programs for Negotiating Drug Prices", "paragraphs": ["Approaches for negotiating drug prices vary among federal programs in  the United States.
