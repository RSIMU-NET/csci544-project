As part of its oversight responsibilities, DSS verifies the extent of the foreign relationship, works with the contractor to establish protective measures to insulate foreign interests, and monitors contractor compliance with these measures. In summary, GAO found that DSS cannot ensure that its approach to overseeing contractors under FOCI is sufficient to reduce the risk of foreign interests gaining unauthorized access to U.S. classified information. First, DSS does not systematically ask for, collect, or analyze information on foreign business transactions in a manner that helps it properly oversee contractors entrusted with U.S. classified information. In addition, DSS does not collect and track the extent to which classified information is left in the hands of a contractor under FOCI before measures are taken to reduce the risk of unauthorized foreign access. During our review, we found instances in which contractors did not report foreign business transactions to DSS for several months. We also found a contractor under foreign ownership that appeared to operate for at least 6 months with access to U.S. classified information before a protective measure was implemented to mitigate foreign ownership. Second, DSS does not centrally collect and analyze information to assess its effectiveness and determine what corrective actions are needed to improve oversight of contractors under FOCI. For example, DSS does not know the universe of all contractors operating under protective measures, the degree to which contractors are complying overall with measures, or how its oversight could be strengthened by using information such as counterintelligence data to bolster its measures. Third, DSS field staff face a number of challenges that significantly limit their ability to sufficiently oversee contractors under FOCI. Field staff told us they lack research tools and training to fully understand the significance of corporate structures, legal ownership, and complex financial relationships when foreign entities are involved. Staff turnover and inconsistencies over how guidance is to be implemented also detract from field staff's ability to effectively carry out FOCI responsibilities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) depends on numerous U.S. contractor  facilities to develop and produce military technologies, such as those used  in tactical aircraft and military satellites, that require access to classified  information.

DSS administers the National  Industrial Security Program on behalf of DOD and 23 other federal  departments and agencies. DSS is responsible for providing oversight,  advice, and assistance to more than 11,000 U.S. contractor facilities that  are cleared for access to classified information. Contractor facilities can  range in size, be located anywhere in the United States, and include  manufacturing plants, laboratories, and universities. About 221 industrial  security representatives work out of 25 DSS field offices across the United  States and serve as the primary points of contact for these facilities. DSS is  responsible for ensuring that these contractors meet requirements to  safeguard classified information under the National Industrial Security  Program. Contractors must have facility security clearances under this  program before they can work on classified contracts.", "To obtain a facility security clearance, contractors are required to self- report foreign business transactions on a Certificate Pertaining to Foreign  Interests form. Examples of such transactions include foreign ownership  of a contractor\u2019s stock, a contractor\u2019s agreements or contracts with  foreign persons, and whether non-U.S. citizens sit on a contractor\u2019s board  of directors. DSS\u2019s industrial security representatives provide guidance to  contractors on filling out the certificate. If a contractor declares no foreign  business transactions on the certificate, DSS places the certificate in the  contractor\u2019s file located in the field. When U.S. contractors with facility  security clearances have changes in foreign business transactions to  report, they are required to complete the certificate again and resubmit it  every 5 years, even if no foreign transactions take place. Because a U.S.  company can own a number of contractor facilities, the corporate  headquarters or another legal entity within that company is required to  complete the certificate.", "When contractors declare foreign transactions on their certificates and  notify DSS, industrial security representatives are responsible for ensuring  that contractors properly identify all relevant foreign business  transactions. They are also required to collect, analyze, and verify  pertinent information about these transactions. For example, by  examining various corporate documents, the industrial security  representatives can determine corporate structures and ownership and  identify key management officials. The representatives may consult with  DSS counterintelligence officials, who can provide information about  threats to U.S. classified information. If contractors\u2019 answers on the  certificates indicate that foreign transactions meet certain DSS criteria or  exceed thresholds, such as the percentage of company stock owned by  foreign persons, the representatives forward these FOCI cases to DSS  headquarters. DSS headquarters works with contractors to determine  what, if any, protective measures are needed to reduce the risk of foreign  interests gaining unauthorized access to U.S. classified information. DSS  field staff are then responsible for monitoring contractor compliance with  these measures. Figure 1 shows highlights of the FOCI process.", "On a case-by-case basis, DSS headquarters can approve the use by  contractors of one of six types of protective measures: voting trust  agreements, proxy agreements, special security agreements, security  control agreements, board resolutions, and limited facility clearances.  These protective measures are intended to insulate contractor facilities  from undue foreign control and influence and to reduce the risk of  unauthorized foreign access to classified information. Protective measures  vary in the degree to which foreign entities are insulated from classified  information and are not intended to deny foreign owners the opportunity  to pursue business relationships with their U.S.-based contractor facilities  working on classified contracts. Table 1 provides a general description of  each of these protective measures. In addition to these measures, DSS can  also require contractors to take certain actions to mitigate specific FOCI  situations such as termination of loan agreements or elimination of debt  owed to a foreign entity.", "For contractors operating under voting trust, proxy, special security, or  security control agreements, industrial security representatives are  supposed to conduct annual FOCI meetings with contractor staff who are  responsible for ensuring compliance with these protective measures. In  preparation for these annual meetings, contractors are required to  produce and submit to DSS annual FOCI compliance reports that can  describe specific acts of noncompliance with protective measures,  changes in organizational structure or changes in security procedures at  the contractor, and other issues that have occurred over the course of a  year. Industrial security representatives should then review the reports to  determine how contractors are fulfilling their obligations under the  protective measures. In addition, DSS generally conducts security reviews  annually for facilities that store classified information or every 18 months  for facilities that do not have classified information on site. However, for  contractors operating under voting trust, proxy, special security, or  security control agreements, industrial security representatives are  required to conduct a security review every 12 months whether the  contractor has classified information on site or not. These reviews are  designed to determine security vulnerabilities and contractor compliance  with National Industrial Security Program requirements and to evaluate  the overall quality of the facility\u2019s security program, including compliance  with protective measures to mitigate FOCI.", "DSS will not grant a new facility security clearance to a contractor until all  relevant FOCI have been mitigated. In addition, DSS shall suspend an  existing clearance if FOCI at a contractor facility has not been mitigated. A  contractor with a suspended facility clearance can continue to work on an  existing classified contract unless the government contracting office  denies access to the existing contract. In addition, the contractor cannot  be awarded a new classified contract until the clearance is restored."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DSS\u2019s Approach to Overseeing FOCI Contractors Is Insufficient", "paragraphs": ["DSS does not systematically ask for, collect, or analyze foreign business  transactions in a manner that helps it properly oversee contractors  entrusted with U.S. classified information, nor does DSS aggregate and  analyze information to determine the overall effectiveness of its oversight  of FOCI contractors.

DSS industrial security representatives are responsible for  advising contractors that timely notification of foreign business  transactions is essential. The National Industrial Security Program  Operating Manual requires contractors with security clearances to report  any material changes of foreign business transactions previously notified  to DSS but does not specify a time frame for doing so. DSS is dependent  on contractors to self-report transactions by filling out the Certificate  Pertaining to Foreign Interests form, but this form does not ask  contractors to provide specific dates for when foreign transactions took  place. In addition, DSS does not compile or analyze how much time passes  before DSS becomes aware of foreign business transactions. DSS field  staff told us that some contractors report foreign business transactions as  they occur, while others report transactions months later, if at all. During  our review, we found a few instances in which contractors were not  reporting foreign business transactions when they occurred. One  contractor did not report FOCI until 21 months after awarding a  subcontract to a foreign entity. Another contractor hired a foreign national  as its corporate president but did not report this transaction to DSS, and  DSS did not know about the FOCI change until 9 months later, when the  industrial security representative came across the information on the  contractor\u2019s Web site. In another example, DSS was not aware that a  foreign national sat on a contractor\u2019s board of directors for 15 months  until we discovered it in the process of conducting our audit work.  Without timely notification from contractors, DSS cannot track when  specific foreign business transactions took place and therefore is not in a  position to take immediate action so that FOCI is mitigated, if necessary.", "In addition, DSS does not determine the time elapsed from reporting of  foreign business transactions by contractors with facility clearances to the  implementation of protective measures or when suspensions of facility  clearances occur. Without protective measures in place, unmitigated FOCI  at a cleared contractor increases the risk that foreign interests can gain  unauthorized access to U.S. classified information. During our review, we  found two cases in which contractors appeared to have operated with  unmitigated FOCI before protective measures were implemented. For  example, officials at one contractor stated they reported to DSS that their  company had been acquired by a foreign entity. However, the contractor  continued operating with unmitigated FOCI for at least 6 months. In the  other example, a foreign-purchased contractor continued operating for 2  months with unmitigated FOCI. Contractor officials in both examples told  us that their facility clearances were not suspended. According to the  National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, DSS shall  suspend the facility clearance of a contractor with unmitigated FOCI. DSS  relies on field office staff to make this determination. Because information  on suspended contractors with unmitigated FOCI is maintained in the  field, DSS headquarters does not determine at an aggregate level the  extent to which and under what conditions it suspends contractors\u2019  facility clearances due to unmitigated FOCI."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DSS Does Not Maintain Aggregate Information to Assess Overall Effectiveness of the FOCI Process", "paragraphs": ["DSS does not centrally collect and analyze information to determine the  magnitude of contractors under FOCI and assess the effectiveness of its  oversight of those contractors. For example, DSS does not know how  many contractors under FOCI are operating under all types of protective  measures and, therefore, does not know the extent of potential FOCI- related security risks. Although DSS tracks information on contractors  operating under some types of protective measures, it does not centrally  compile data on contractors operating under all types of protective  measures. Specifically, DSS headquarters maintains a central repository  of data on contractors under voting trust agreements, proxy agreements,  and special security agreements\u2014protective measures intended to  mitigate majority foreign ownership. However, information on contractors  under three other protective measures\u2014security control agreements,  limited facility clearances, and board resolutions\u2014are maintained in paper  files in the field offices. DSS does not aggregate data on contractors for all  six types of protective measures and does not track and analyze overall  numbers. In addition, DSS does not conduct overall analysis of foreign  business transactions reported by contractors on their Certificate  Pertaining to Foreign Interests forms or maintain aggregate information  for contractors\u2019 responses. Consequently, DSS does not know the universe  of FOCI contractors operating under protective measures, and DSS cannot  determine the extent to which contractors under FOCI are increasing or if  particular types of foreign business transactions are becoming more  prevalent. This information would help DSS target areas for improved  oversight. According to DSS officials, centralizing and tracking  information on contractors under all types of measures would require  more resources because information is dispersed in paper files in DSS  field offices around the country.", "DSS does not systematically compile and analyze trends from its oversight  functions to identify overall compliance trends or concerns with  implementation of protective measures by contractors. DSS industrial  security representatives are responsible for ensuring compliance of FOCI  contractors under certain protective measures through annual FOCI  meetings where they discuss contractors\u2019 compliance reports. Industrial  security representatives notify headquarters of the results of the meetings  and place compliance reports and their own assessments in paper files  located in field offices. However, DSS headquarters does not use annual  compliance reports to assess trends to evaluate overall effectiveness of the  FOCI process.", "Finally, the use of protective measures at FOCI contractor facilities was  designed in part to counter attempts to gather classified information  through unauthorized means. DSS does not assess trends from its own  counterintelligence data or information gathered by other intelligence  agencies to evaluate whether protective measures are effectively  mitigating FOCI risk across the board. For example, a 2004 DSS  counterintelligence report states that foreign information targeting  through e-mail and Internet communication and collection methods is on  the rise. However, according to DSS officials, not all protective measures  at FOCI contractors include provisions to monitor e-mail or other Internet  traffic. By assessing counterintelligence trends to analyze the effectiveness  of protective measures in countering foreign information collection  attempts, DSS could identify weaknesses in its protective measures and  adjust them accordingly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DSS Industrial Security Representatives Face Challenges in Carrying Out FOCI Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["DSS\u2019s field staff face numerous challenges: complexities in verifying FOCI  cases, limited tools to research FOCI transactions, insufficient FOCI  training, staff turnover, and inconsistencies in implementing guidance on  FOCI cases.", "For industrial security representatives, verifying if a contractor is under  FOCI is complex. Industrial security representatives cited various  difficulties verifying FOCI information. To verify if a contractor is under  FOCI, industrial security representatives are required to understand the  corporate structure of the legal entity completing the Certificate  Pertaining to Foreign Interests form and evaluate the types of foreign  control or influence that exist for each entity within a corporate family.  DSS officials informed us that tracing strategic company relationships,  country of ownership, and foreign affiliations and suppliers, or reviewing  corporate documentation\u2014such as loan agreements, financial reports, or  Securities and Exchange Commission filings\u2014is complicated. For  example, representatives are required to verify information on stock  ownership by determining the distribution of the stock among the  stockholders and the influence or control the stockholders may have  within the corporation. This entails identifying the type of stock and the  number of shares owned by the foreign person(s) to determine their  authority and management prerogatives, which DSS guidance indicates  may be difficult to ascertain in certain cases. According to DSS field  officials, verifying information is especially difficult when industrial  security representatives have limited exposure to FOCI cases. In some  field offices we visited, industrial security representatives had few or no  FOCI cases and, therefore, had limited knowledge about how to verify  foreign business transactions.", "Some industrial security representatives in one field office told us they do  not always have the tools needed to verify if contractors are under FOCI.  As part of their review process, industrial security representatives are  responsible for verifying what a contractor reports on its Certificate  Pertaining to Foreign Interests form and determining the extent of foreign  interests in the company. Industrial security representatives conduct  independent research using the Internet or return to the contractor for  more information to evaluate the FOCI relationships and hold discussions  with management officials, such as the chief financial officer, treasurer,  and legal counsel. DSS headquarters officials told us additional  information sources, such as the Dun and Bradstreet database of millions  of private and public companies are currently not available in the field.  However, some industrial security representatives stated that such  additional resource tools would be beneficial for verifying complex FOCI  information.", "In addition, industrial security representatives stated they lacked the  training and knowledge needed to better verify and oversee contractors  under FOCI. For example, DSS does not require its representatives to have  financial or legal training. While some FOCI training is provided,  representatives largely depend on DSS guidance and on-the-job training to  oversee a FOCI contractor. In so doing, representatives work with more  experienced staff or seek guidance, when needed, from DSS headquarters.  In a 1999 review, DSS recognized that recurring training was necessary to  ensure industrial security representatives remain current on complex  FOCI issues and other aspects of the FOCI process. DSS headquarters  officials said that they have held regionwide meetings where they  discussed FOCI case scenarios and responded to questions about the FOCI  process. However, we found that the training needs on complex FOCI  issues are still a concern to representatives. In fact, many said they needed  more training to help with their responsibility of verifying FOCI  information, including how to review corporate documents, strategic  company relationships, and financial reports. DSS field officials said the  DSS training institute currently offers a brief training unit on FOCI  covering basic information. DSS established a working group of DSS field  and headquarters staff to look at ways to improve the training program,  including more specific FOCI training. The group submitted  recommendations in March 2005 to field managers for their review. DSS  is also planning to work with its training institute to develop additional  FOCI courses to better meet the needs of the industrial security  representatives.", "According to field staff, industrial security representatives operate in an  environment of staff turnover, which can affect their in-depth knowledge  of FOCI contractors. Officials from one-third of the field offices we  reviewed noted staff retention problems. DSS officials at two of these field  offices said that in particular they have problems retaining more  experienced industrial security representatives. Field officials said that  when an industrial security representative retires or leaves, the staff  member\u2019s entire workload is divided among the remaining representatives,  who already have a substantial workload. In addition, DSS guidance  advises field office officials to rotate contractor facilities among industrial  security representative every 3 years, if possible, as a means of retaining  DSS independence from the contractors. DSS officials told us the rotation  can actually occur more frequently because of staff turnover. DSS  headquarters officials said they are formulating a working group to help  improve staff retention in the field.", "Compounding these challenges are inconsistencies among field offices in  how industrial security representatives said they understood and  implemented DSS guidance for reviewing contractors under FOCI. For  example, per DSS guidance, security reviews and FOCI meetings should  be performed every 12 months for contractors operating under special  security agreements, security control agreements, voting trust agreements,  and proxy agreements. However, we found that some industrial security  representatives were inconsistent in implementing the guidance. For  example, one representative said a contractor under a special security  agreement was subject to a security review every 18 months because the  contractor did not store classified information on-site. In addition, two  industrial security representatives told us they did not conduct annual  FOCI meetings for contractors that were operating under a proxy  agreement and security control agreement, respectively. We also found  that industrial security representatives varied in their understanding or  application of DSS guidance for when they should suspend a contractor\u2019s  facility clearance when FOCI is unmitigated. The guidance indicates that  when a contractor with a facility clearance is determined to be under  FOCI that requires mitigation by DSS headquarters, the facility security  clearance shall be suspended until a protective measure is implemented.  However, we were told by officials in some field offices that they rarely  suspend clearances when a contractor has unmitigated FOCI as long as  the contractor is demonstrating good faith in an effort to provide  documentation to DSS to identify the extent of FOCI and submits a FOCI  mitigation plan to DSS. Officials in other field offices said they would  suspend a contractor\u2019s facility clearance once they learned the contractor  had unmitigated FOCI."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The protection of classified information has become increasingly  important in light of the internationalization of multibillion-dollar  cooperative development programs, such as a new-generation fighter  aircraft, and a growing number of complex cross-border industrial  arrangements.

Given the growing number of DOD contractors with  connections to foreign countries, it is critical for DSS to ensure that  classified information is protected from unauthorized foreign access. In  carrying out its responsibilities, DSS is dependent on self-reported  information from the contractors about their foreign activities, creating  vulnerabilities outside of DSS\u2019s control. Within this environment, unless  DSS improves the collection and analysis of key information and provides  its field staff with the training and tools they need to perform FOCI  responsibilities, DSS will continue to operate without knowing how  effective its oversight is at reducing the risk of foreign interests gaining  unauthorized access to U.S. classified information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve knowledge of the timing of foreign business transactions and  reduce the risk of unauthorized foreign access to classified information,  we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the director of DSS to  take the following three actions:    clarify when contractors need to report foreign business transactions    determine how contractors should report and communicate dates of  specific foreign business transactions to DSS, and    collect and analyze when foreign business transactions occurred at  contractor facilities and when protective measures were implemented  to mitigate FOCI.", "To assess overall effectiveness of DSS oversight of contractors under  FOCI, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the director of  DSS to take the following three actions:    collect and analyze data on contractors operating under all protective  measures as well as changes in types and prevalence of foreign  business transactions reported by contractors;    collect, aggregate, and analyze the results of annual FOCI meetings,  contractors\u2019 compliance reports, and data from the counterintelligence  community; and    develop a plan to systematically review and evaluate the effectiveness  of the FOCI process.", "To better support industrial security representatives in overseeing  contractors under FOCI, we recommend the Secretary of Defense direct  the director of DSS to formulate a human capital strategy and plan that  would encompass the following two actions:    evaluate the needs of representatives in carrying out their FOCI  responsibilities and    determine and implement changes needed to job requirements,  guidance, and training to meet FOCI responsibilities and explore  options for improving resource tools and knowledge-sharing efforts  among representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of our report, DOD disagreed with our  conclusions that improvements are needed to ensure sufficient oversight  of contractors under FOCI, and it also disagreed with our  recommendations to improve oversight. Overall, DOD\u2019s comments  indicate that it believes that the actions DSS takes when it learns of FOCI  at contractors is sufficient. However, DOD has not provided evidence  necessary to support its assertions. In fact, we found two cases in which  contractors appeared to have operated with unmitigated FOCI before  protective measures were put into place. Unmitigated FOCI at contractors  increases the risk that foreign interests can gain unauthorized access to  U.S. classified information. Further, DOD states that we did not establish a  link between collecting and analyzing FOCI data and the effectiveness of  DSS\u2019s oversight or the protection of classified information. We found that  DSS lacks fundamental FOCI information\u2014including information on the  universe of FOCI contractors and trends in overall contractor compliance  with protective measures\u2014that is needed to determine the effectiveness  of the FOCI process and the sufficiency of oversight. Ultimately, without  making this determination, DSS cannot adequately ensure it is taking  necessary steps to reduce the risk of foreign interests gaining  unauthorized access to classified information. Unless our  recommendations are implemented, we are concerned that DSS will  continue to operate on blind faith that its FOCI process is effective and its  oversight is sufficient.", "DOD did not concur with seven of our recommendations and only partially  concurred with the eighth.  Regarding our first three recommendations,  which aim to improve DSS\u2019s knowledge of the timing of foreign business  transactions and reduce the risk of unauthorized foreign access to  classified information, DOD argues that having such information will not  help protect classified information.

However, without this information, DSS limits its ability to  identify vulnerabilities in the FOCI process and to target areas for  improving oversight of contractors, including potential changes to  protective measures. DOD also argues that it has three mechanisms to  systematically evaluate DSS\u2019s processes: DSS\u2019s Inspector General, a  management review process for industrial security field office oversight,  and a standards and quality program. However, DOD has not provided  evidence in its comments that these mechanisms are focused on  systematically reviewing and evaluating the effectiveness of the FOCI  process.", "Regarding our last two recommendations\u2014to formulate a human capital  strategy and plan that would better support industrial security  representatives in overseeing FOCI contractors\u2014DOD does not believe  that its industrial security representatives need additional support. DOD  supports this belief with two points. First, DOD states that because less  than 3 percent of the approximately 12,000 cleared companies overseen by  DSS have any FOCI mitigation, most DSS industrial security  representatives do not oversee such contractors. Yet it is unclear how  DOD arrived at these figures because DSS does not collect and analyze  information on all contactors operating under protective measures.   Regardless of the number of these contractors, industrial security  representatives must have adequate support\u2014including training and  guidance\u2014to verify if contractors are under FOCI and to ensure  contractors comply with any protective measures put in place. In the  course of our review, we found that industrial security representatives are  not sufficiently equipped to fulfill their FOCI responsibilities. Second,  DOD noted that DSS is under new leadership and is exploring operational  improvements as well as implementing a new industrial security  information management system.  While it is too early to assess the effect  of these proposals, it is also unclear how these efforts will bring about any  needed changes to industrial security representatives\u2019 job requirements,  guidance, tools, and training.", "As we concluded in our report, DSS\u2019s dependence on self-reported  information from contractors about their foreign activities creates  vulnerabilities outside of DSS\u2019s control.

If DSS continues to operate without knowing how  effective its oversight is and does not support the representatives in  carrying out their FOCI responsibilities, then the value of DSS\u2019s  management and the FOCI process should be open for further  examination.

In addition, we visited 8 of the  27 contractor facilities and spoke with security officials, corporate  officers, and board members to obtain additional clarification on the types  of protective measures and the FOCI process.", "We spoke with DSS headquarters and field staff regarding actions taken to  implement protective measures and reviewed supporting documentation  maintained by DSS and contractor facilities. During our visits to nine field  offices, we discussed the contents of selected contractor facility file  folders to understand how DSS oversees contractors\u2019 implementation of  protective measures, determines unmitigated FOCI, and assesses the  effectiveness of the FOCI process. Because we did not take a statistical  sample of case files, the results of our analyses cannot be generalized.  However, we confirmed that the data used to select the files that we  reviewed were consistent with the information in the facility files that we  reviewed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Defense\u2019s letter  dated June 29, 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  It is unclear how DOD came to the conclusion that our report lacks an  understanding of the national policy governing contractors\u2019 access to  classified information, given that our description of the policy and  process in the background of our report is taken directly from  documentation provided by DSS. Further, DOD did not provide in its  technical comments any suggested amendments to remove perceived  misunderstandings from our report.  2.  Cleared U.S. citizens need not break the law for foreign interests to  gain unauthorized access to classified information or adversely affect  performance of classified contracts.  Classified information can be at  risk when foreign nationals at a cleared FOCI contractor facility are  not identified and timely protective measures are not established to  mitigate their influence.  3.  DOD\u2019s position that there is little in our report that would enable DSS  to improve the FOCI process or justify the cost of implementing our  recommendations underscores the department\u2019s failure to grasp the  gravity of our findings. DOD has neither systematically evaluated the  effectiveness of its FOCI process nor identified opportunities to  strengthen its oversight for contractors under FOCI. Our  recommendations specifically target correcting these weaknesses.  Further, raising concerns about cost without evaluating the  effectiveness of its FOCI process is shortsighted.    4.  According to the National Industrial Security Program Operating  Manual, contractors are required to report material changes to FOCI  information previously reported and every 5 years, even if no change  occurs. We added a footnote to further clarify the definition of foreign  business transactions used in our report.   5.  DOD\u2019s response concerning self-reporting underscores the  department\u2019s complacency regarding its responsibility to take actions  needed to prevent foreign interests from gaining unauthorized access  to U.S. classified information. While we recognize that DSS is  dependent on self-reporting and that some vulnerabilities are outside  of DSS\u2019s control, there are numerous steps DOD could take to mitigate  these vulnerabilities. For example, if DSS implemented our  recommendation to clarify when reporting should occur and require  reporting dates when specific foreign business transactions took place,  then DSS could monitor whether contractors are reporting foreign  transactions on time and put mitigation measures in place, as  appropriate.   6.  While DOD maintains that contractors are to report material changes  concerning FOCI information as they occur, we found that the  National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual does not  state this. As we reported, DSS field staff told us that while some  contractors report transactions as they occur, some do not report  transactions until months later, if at all. Specifying a time frame for  contractors could result in more timely reporting of these transactions.   7.  As we reported, the FOCI process begins when a contractor reports  FOCI information. Having information on when foreign transactions  occur would enable DSS to take timely action to impose safeguards or  restrictions authorized by the National Industrial Security Program  Operating Manual.  8.  Unmitigated FOCI at a cleared contractor increases the risk that  foreign interests can gain unauthorized access to U.S. classified  information. During our review, we found two cases in which  contractors appeared to have operated with unmitigated FOCI before  protective measures were put in place. Therefore, it is important to  know the length of time between when a foreign transaction occurs  and when protective measures are put in place to mitigate FOCI.  9.  According to the National Industrial Security Program Operating  Manual, a contractor under FOCI with an existing facility clearance  shall have its clearance suspended or revoked unless protective  measures are established to remove the possibility of unauthorized  access to classified information or adversely affect performance on  classified contracts. DOD\u2019s characterization of DSS having the option  to suspend the clearance of contractors with unmitigated FOCI seems  to differ from what is stated in the manual.   10.  It is unclear why DOD does not see the value in collecting information  on contractors operating under all six protective measures, when DSS  already centrally collects information on contractors operating under  three measures.  DSS cannot assess the overall effectiveness of its  FOCI process unless it has a complete and accurate account of  contractors operating under all types of protective measures.   11.  It is unclear how DOD determined that less than 3 percent of its  cleared contractors are operating under all six protective measures  because DSS does not centrally collect and analyze this information  for all six measures. In addition, the most recent information provided  to us by DSS indicated that there are about 11,000 contractor facilities  participating in the National Industrial Security Program, rather than  the 12,000 cited in DOD\u2019s comments. Further, DOD did not provide  technical comments to revise the number of contractor facilities stated  in our report.   12.  Industrial security representatives may use the results of annual  meetings, compliance reports, and counterintelligence data to assess  an individual contractor\u2019s security posture. However, as stated in our  report, DSS does not systematically compile and analyze trends from  these oversight activities. Aggregating overall compliance and  counterintelligence trends is valuable because it would allow DSS to  identify actual or potential weaknesses, evaluate effectiveness, and  take actions as needed to improve its FOCI process.   13.  Citing how long the program has been in existence misses the point,  and DOD does not provide evidence that the needs of representatives  are well known. As we reported, industrial security representatives  face numerous challenges in carrying out their FOCI responsibilities,  which formulates the basis of our recommendation to evaluate the  needs of the representatives. Assessing their needs is particularly  important given the increasingly complex environment\u2014characterized  by international cooperative defense programs and a growing number  of cross-border defense industrial relationships\u2014in which industrial  security representatives work.   14.  As stated in our report, industrial security representatives told us they  lacked the training and knowledge they needed to verify complex  FOCI cases and oversee contractors under FOCI."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
