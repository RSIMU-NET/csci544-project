The ability to detect missile launches,  track missiles throughout their flights, and counter these threats is  essential to ballistic missile defense. The primary mission of SBIRS-low is  to detect launches and track missile flights. SBIRS-low accomplishes this  by using infrared sensors to detect the heat missiles radiate.

In 1994, DOD studied consolidating various infrared  space requirements, such as for ballistic missile warning and defense,  technical intelligence, and battlespace characterization, and it selected  SBIRS to replace and enhance the capabilities provided by the Defense  Support Program. The Defense Support Program is a strategic surveillance  and early warning satellite system with an infrared capability to detect  long-range ballistic missile launches that has been operational for about 30 years. DOD has previously attempted to replace the Defense Support  Program with the Advanced Warning System in the early 1980s; the Boost  Surveillance and Tracking System in the late 1980s; the Follow-on Early  Warning System in the early 1990s; and the Alert, Locate, and Report  Missiles System in the mid-1990s. These attempts failed due to immature  technology, high cost, and affordability issues. SBIRS is to use more  sophisticated infrared technologies than the Defense Support Program to  enhance the detection of strategic and theater ballistic missile launches  and the performance of the missile-tracking function.", "The SBIRS development effort consists of two programs\u2014SBIRS-high and  SBIRS-low. SBIRS-high is to consist of four satellites operating in  geosynchronous earth orbit and sensors on two host satellites operating in  a highly elliptical orbit. SBIRS-high will replace Defense Support Program  satellites and is primarily to provide enhanced strategic and theater  ballistic missile warning capabilities. The SBIRS-high program includes the  consolidation of the three existing Defense Support Program ground  facilities\u2014two overseas and one in the United States\u2014at a single U.S.  ground station to reduce operations and maintenance costs. The program  is in the engineering and manufacturing development phase, with a  scheduled launch of the first SBIRS-high satellite in fiscal year 2005.", "The SBIRS-low program is currently in the program definition and risk  reduction acquisition phase and is expected to consist of about 24  satellites in low earth orbit, but it could consist of more or less satellites,  depending on the results of contractor cost and performance studies. The  primary purpose of SBIRS-low is to support both national and theater  missile defense by tracking ballistic missiles and discriminating between  the warheads and other objects, such as decoys, that separate from the  missile bodies throughout the middle portion of their flights. Its  deployment schedule is tied to fiscal year 2010, the date when these  capabilities are needed by the National Missile Defense System. According  to DOD, the first SBIRS-low satellites need to be launched in fiscal  year 2006 if full deployment is to be accomplished by fiscal year 2010.", "Due to the importance Congress has placed on the deployment of a  National Missile Defense System, Congress has maintained a high level of  interest in the SBIRS-low program and has included in legislative  provisions dates by which the first satellites are to be launched and initial  operational capability is to occur. The National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2000 is the latest expression of such interest. It defines, in  section 231, the SBIRS-low baseline schedule as a program schedule that  includes a first launch of a SBIRS-low satellite to be made during fiscal year 2006. This provision also requires that before the Secretary of the Air  Force makes any changes to the SBIRS-low baseline schedule he must  obtain the approval of the Director of the Ballistic Missile Defense  Organization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SBIRS-low Program Employs a High-Risk Acquisition Strategy", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force\u2019s current SBIRS-low acquisition schedule is at high risk of  not delivering the system on time or at cost or with expected performance.

The software required for SBIRS-low to  perform all its missions is to be developed concurrent with the deployment  of the satellites and is not to be completed until more than 3 years after the  first SBIRS-low satellites are to be launched."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "On-Orbit Test Results Will Not Be Available to Support Production Decision", "paragraphs": ["Under the Air Force\u2019s previous schedules for SBIRS-low, the results of an  on-orbit flight demonstration of crucial satellite functions and capabilities  were to be available and used to support the decision to enter satellite  production; however, the current schedule does not provide such test  results in time to support the production decision. In February 1999, the Air  Force established the current acquisition schedule (see fig.1) for the  SBIRS-low program, which includes a program definition and risk  reduction phase, a concurrent development and production phase, and  a 1-year on-orbit test with the first six SBIRS-low satellites produced (to be  launched with two launches\u2014three satellites per launch).", "The decision to enter the engineering and manufacturing development  phase and production phases is to be made in the third quarter of fiscal  year 2002. The 1-year on-orbit test, which is intended to test and finalize the  design of the satellites, will not be completed until January 2008, more than  5 years after development and production is to start. In contrast, under  previous schedules (see app. I), the Air Force had stressed the importance  of on-orbit tests, stating they were critical to support the decision to enter  production. According to the Air Force, its decision to enter the  engineering and manufacturing development and production phases will  now be based on information obtained from the ground demonstrations  performed under the program definition and risk reduction contracts and  from other completed on-orbit demonstration programs such as the  Midcourse Space Experiment and the Miniature Sensor Technology  Integration Program. These program results, however, may be of limited  utility to SBIRS-low. For example, according to Air Force officials, they  plan to use information on midcourse discrimination collected by the  Midcourse Space Experiment in their decision concerning SBIRS-low  development and production. However, according to DOD\u2019s Director of  Operational Test and Evaluation, the Midcourse Space Experiment did not  collect discrimination data on objects representative of those that  SBIRS-low must be able to discriminate.", "According to the Air Force, launches are not to be resumed until after the 1-year on-orbit test period has been completed, test results have been  reviewed, and modifications, if required, have been made to the remaining  satellites. However, the production of satellites will not stop during the 1-year on-orbit test. As a result, by the time the test is to be completed in  fiscal year 2008, 9 satellites will have been produced (including the first 6  used for flight-testing), an additional 21 satellites will be in various stages  of production, and at least $1.9 billion of the $2.4 billion (then-year) cost for  these 30 satellites will have been expended or committed. Because the  on-orbit test results for crucial functions and capabilities is not to be  available until more than 5 years after the start of production, there is a risk  that design changes will be required for satellites in production. For  example, if parts that have already been purchased for the SBIRS-low  operational satellites became obsolete because their acquisition was based  on the initial system design, new parts may be required, program costs will  increase, and the schedule will slip. Also, additional changes may be  necessary to the satellite configuration that could affect not just long lead  items, but also modifications may be required to satellite components  already produced.", "In a July 1999 memorandum to the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition and Technology, DOD\u2019s Director of Operational Test and  Evaluation expressed concern that the new (current) schedule eliminated  critical on-orbit experiments that were to be conducted under the flight  demonstration. The Director stated that while the restructured program  schedule includes ground demonstrations that were previously lacking  from the SBIRS-low program, considering the many technical challenges  and high risk in the program, DOD must seek every opportunity to obtain  early on-orbit experience. According to the Director, many of the functions  and capabilities that must be demonstrated (and would have been  demonstrated under the flight demonstration) before SBIRS-low exits the  program definition and risk reduction phase and enters the engineering and  manufacturing development phase are impossible to demonstrate with only  ground tests. For example, the Director stated that DOD has no flight  experience where two or more satellites in low earth orbit have  communicated with each other. He stated that this was challenging  because of the dynamically changing positions of orbiting satellites relative  to each other and the high data rates needed to transmit data between  satellites thousands of kilometers apart. Another example cited by the  Director where DOD has no flight experience is with coordinating the  operation of acquisition and tracking infrared sensors, both of which are to  be mounted on each SBIRS-low satellite. Specifically, when the acquisition  sensor detects the heat from a missile\u2019s booster motor, it must determine  and relay highly accurate information on the missile\u2019s position to the  tracking sensor. The tracking sensor must then point to the proper location  in space, find the missile, and begin tracking the missile. All of these  activities must occur within short time frames (seconds) to support missile  defense.", "We have reported on numerous occasions about the risks associated with  program concurrency and of initiating production without adequate  testing. In a 1990 testimony, we cited the Navy\u2019s F/A-18 aircraft, the Air  Force\u2019s B-1B Bomber, and the Navy\u2019s AEGIS Destroyer as examples where  a rush to production without adequate testing resulted in increased costs,  lower than expected performance, or both. In 1994 and 1995, we reported  that programs are often permitted to begin production with little or no  scrutiny and that the consequences have included procurement of  substantial inventories of unsatisfactory weapons requiring costly  modifications to achieve satisfactory performance, and in some cases,  deployment of substandard systems to combat forces. In 2000, we reported  that programs were allowed to begin production before the contractors and  the government had conducted enough testing to know whether the  systems\u2019 design would meet requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Evolutionary Software Development Plan Increases Program Risk", "paragraphs": ["In December 1999, the SBIRS-low program office concluded that  development of software to perform all SBIRS-low missions, as originally  scheduled, could not be completed 1 year before the scheduled first launch  of SBIRS-low satellites in fiscal year 2006. According to the Air Force, this  conclusion was based on lessons learned from other programs under which  software development efforts were underestimated. As a result, to maintain  the fiscal year 2006 first launch, the program office plans to use an  evolutionary software development approach under which software is to  be developed in increments. The software needed to support all SBIRS-low  missions will not be completed (ready for use for satellite operations) until  March 2010, over 3 years after the first satellites are launched.", "According to Air Force officials, DOD traditionally completes software  required to support satellite systems 1 year before the scheduled first  launch of a new satellite system. DOD established this practice to reduce  risk by ensuring that all system problems have been identified and  resolved, and that the personnel operating the systems have been  adequately trained. This was the original plan for the SBIRS-low program.", "Under the evolutionary approach, software will be developed to support  satellite launches, early on-orbit testing, ballistic missile defense, and  integration with SBIRS-high, followed by the software needed to support  ancillary missions, such as technical intelligence and battlespace  characterization. Figure 2 shows the schedule for the incremental  development and completion of the software relative to the launch and  testing schedule for the SBIRS-low satellites.", "As figure 2 shows, by the time the on-orbit test period for the first six  SBIRS-low satellites is to begin in fiscal year 2007, the first two increments  of software are to be completed. According to program office officials,  these two increments of software will provide all of the capabilities the  ground control system and the satellites need to support and perform the  on-orbit test. The third increment, the ground control and space related  software required to operate the full satellite constellation in support of  ballistic missile defense, is not to be completed until fiscal year 2008. The  fourth software increment, which is to be completed in mid-fiscal  year 2009, is to integrate SBIRS-low with SBIRS-high. The fifth increment,  which is to be completed in mid-fiscal year 2010, is to add the software  required for SBIRS-low to perform ancillary missions such as technical  intelligence, battlespace characterization, and space surveillance. Thus, the  software required to support all of SBIRS-low missions is not to be  completed until over 3 years after the first satellites are launched. While  this evolutionary approach reduces schedule pressure for completing the  ground control and space software before the first launch in fiscal year  2006, it increases the risk that software may not be available when needed  or perform as required.

Specifically, the report states that properly deployed ship-based radars can  provide a forward-based radar warning and tracking function against many  of the potential ballistic missile threats to the United States, and that  because the radars would be difficult to target due to the mobility and  unknown locations of ships, the radars would add robustness against  enemy attacks, particularly before SBIRS-low is available.", "In a 1999 RAND issue paper that dealt with an assessment of the planning  for the National Missile Defense System, the authors suggest that  ground-based radars could potentially be used to provide midcourse  tracking and cueing for interceptors.

However, the first  year of the flight demonstration would still have been completed about  4 months before the start of the engineering and manufacturing  development and production phases, which were still scheduled to begin in  the first quarter of fiscal year 2001 as they were under the original  schedule. As a result, DOD would have had the information from the first  year of the demonstration satellites\u2019 performance, which it considered the  most critical in deciding whether the system should enter these phases, to  support a fiscal year 2004 deployment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Technology Readiness Levels and Their Definitions", "paragraphs": ["Lowest level of technology readiness.

We are cognizant of the fact that the National Missile Defense program  is driving the need date for SBIRS-low and not the converse. We do not  intend to suggest that the SBIRS-low acquisition schedule be a driver  for the National Missile Defense program schedule. Our primary goal in  making this recommendation is to help ensure SBIRS-low is acquired at  lower risk and will satisfy critical missile defense requirements. This is  why we are also making our second recommendation\u2014to develop  alternative approaches to satisfy critical missile defense midcourse  tracking and discrimination requirements in case SBIRS-low (under a  new lower risk schedule) cannot be deployed when needed.  2. We disagree that we misstate the risks of the SBIRS-low incremental  software development strategy. We recognize that an evolutionary, or  incremental, approach to software development is valid. However, an  acquisition approach such as the original SBIRS-low approach that  calls for the completion of all software prior to the first launch poses  less risk than one that does not, that is, the evolutionary or current  approach. From the perspective of meeting the schedule for a first  launch in fiscal year 2006, the evolutionary software development  approach may reduce schedule risk because, according to the Air  Force, the first launch date would be unachievable under the original  strategy due to an underestimation of the software development effort.  However, from the perspective of comparing the evolutionary software  development approach with the original approach, there is increased  program risk associated with the evolutionary approach because there  is less assurance the software will be completed when needed with the  mission capabilities specified. 3. While we agree that a revised acquisition strategy would likely increase  costs, cost increases associated with program delays or rework could  also occur under the current schedule. Due to the highly concurrent  acquisition schedule, we believe that there is substantial risk that  delays and rework resulting from the production of hardware and  software that fail to satisfy requirements may occur\u2014resulting in cost  increases if the current schedule is strictly adhered to. We believe that  early effort to understand acquisition options and the associated costs  is important."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Ted B.
