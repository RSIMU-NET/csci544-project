The regulations implementing NAHASDA were developed by a negotiated rulemaking committee. The committee had 58 members, 48 of them from geographically diverse small, medium, and large tribes; the other 10 were HUD employees. After review by the Office of Management and Budget, HUD published the final rule implementing NAHASDA on March 12, 1998; it went into effect on April 13, 1998.", "NAHASDA eliminated 9 of HUD\u2019s 14 separate Indian housing programs, replacing them with a single block grant program with one set of funding criteria for HUD to administer and, according to HUD officials, one system for managing and accounting for funds.

This change resulted in the number of housing entities more than doubling, from 217 housing authorities to 575 tribally designated housing entities.

Each program had its own criteria for awarding and allocating funds and its own system for managing and accounting for the funds. For nine of the programs, Indian housing authorities or tribes competed for funding. The Indian housing authorities and tribes submitted project proposals, which HUD then scored and ranked, awarding grants for the highest-ranked projects. For the other five programs, HUD allocated funds to Indian housing authorities or tribes noncompetitively through a formula or on a first-come, first-served basis.

In fiscal year 1997, the last year these programs were funded separately, funding was approximately $562 million, of which almost $322 million, or 57 percent, was awarded through competitive programs.

HUD determined that the Department was legally constrained from considering the past management performance of Indian housing authorities. The formula also did not factor in $929 million provided in past years but not yet spent by the Indian housing authorities and tribes. Most of the unspent funding was provided in fiscal years 1993 through 1997 for the Development and Modernization programs, which were intended to assist Indian housing authorities in building new housing and modernizing existing units.

A housing entity\u2019s total block grant amount is the sum of the amounts determined under each of these two components\u2014or the amount an Indian housing authority received in fiscal year 1996 for modernization and operating subsidy.", "To determine funding for the first component\u2014operating and modernizing\u2014HUD calculates the number of existing housing units an entity has and the operating costs of providing that housing. HUD then calculates the modernization costs of keeping these units in good working order. These two cost figures are combined as the entity\u2019s funding amount under the first component of the NAHASDA formula. To calculate funding of the second component of the NAHASDA formula\u2014need for affordable housing\u2014HUD uses various factors. These factors reflect each housing entity\u2019s Native American population, income levels, local housing costs and housing conditions, and the extent of housing shortages. Hence, it is through the calculation of this component that tribal housing needs are considered in the distribution of NAHASDA funding.", "In allocating funds in the first year of the NAHASDA program, HUD recognized that the data used to calculate block grants may need to be improved. HUD has hired a contractor to review alternative data sources to use when applying the NAHASDA formula.

Indian housing authorities\u2019 past performance came under the requirements and regulations for programs created under the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, requirements and regulations that are no longer in effect since NAHASDA eliminated most of these programs. According to HUD\u2019s Office of General Counsel, there is no provision under NAHASDA allowing HUD, when awarding block grant funding under the act, to consider Indian housing authorities\u2019 failure to comply with requirements and regulations that are no longer in effect. Consequently, the housing entities were given the opportunity to demonstrate good management and performance under NAHASDA. However, HUD does have the authority and has, in several instances, placed conditions, such as additional monitoring and oversight, on the use of grant funds by a housing entity that has a history of poor performance in administering federal grant programs. For example, for a tribe with problems administering its Indian Community Development Block Grant and HOME programs, HUD plans to more closely monitor expenditures of NAHASDA block grant funds and to require that the tribe submit quarterly program and financial reports.", "In future fiscal years, regulations permit HUD, when dispensing new grants, to consider how well housing entities have managed past NAHASDA grants. NAHASDA regulations allow HUD to sanction poorly managed housing entities by (1) reducing or eliminating future grant funding or (2) replacing the housing entity managing the program. Such actions may be taken if HUD determines, through activities such as reviewing reports provided by tribes or making site visits, that housing entities are substantially noncompliant with NAHASDA regulations. HUD plans to closely monitor housing entities that are having performance problems and to provide them with technical assistance to help them comply with NAHASDA requirements. To monitor and assist these entities, HUD is using Internet e-mail to facilitate the submission and review of Indian housing plans and to respond to housing entities\u2019 questions about the program.", "Providing additional monitoring and technical assistance may pose a challenge for HUD, given the Department\u2019s decreasing resources.

The Deputy Assistant Secretary, Office of Native American Programs, estimated that 221 staff years will be needed to fully implement Indian housing programs. Meanwhile, several changes are planned to accommodate the future workload with the present staffing level of 178 employees. The planned changes include addressing the length and frequency of site visits, modifying some work processes, and using technology to improve efficiency. The Deputy Assistant Secretary added that because of the resource limitations, the office may have to reduce the number of site visits to tribal housing entities during fiscal year 1999. HUD plans to visit only 20 percent of the housing entities, instead of 33 percent as originally planned.", "Under NAHASDA regulations, the tribes also have a responsibility to monitor the performance and compliance of their housing entities.

For the NAHASDA block grants, HUD separately calculates grant amounts that reflect the operating and modernizing needs of each of these types of housing units. An entity\u2019s funding reflects these needs and is the sum of two calculations.", "Table II.1 shows a hypothetical sample calculation of an entity\u2019s funding for operating housing. In calculating funding for operating housing, HUD uses the 1996 national average funding for each of the three types of housing. In our hypothetical sample calculation, we assume that the inflation cost adjustment is 5.3 percent and that the entity\u2019s geographic cost factor is 14 percent above the national average. We also assume that the entity is responsible for operating 150 low-income housing units, 50 Section 8 housing units, and 20 Turnkey III and Mutual Help units. We use the fiscal year 1996 national average funding amount for each type of housing unit in our hypothetical calculation.", "The national average funding amount for low-income units in fiscal year 1996 was $2,440 per unit. We increase this amount by 5.3 percent for inflation and by 14 percent for operating costs above the national average, and consider that the entity operates 150 low-income units. Given these assumptions, our hypothetical housing entity would receive a grant amount of $439,354 for low-income units. Similar calculations for Section 8 units and for Turnkey III and Mutual Help units yield grant amounts of $217,576 and $12,676, respectively. Adding these three figures together yields a total operating housing grant amount of $669,606.", "In calculating funding for modernizing housing, HUD bases the average 1996 funding amount on the number of low-income and Turnkey III and Mutual Help units. Section 8 units are excluded in this calculation. The national average funding amount for modernizing housing units in fiscal year 1996 was $1,974 per unit. The block grant uses the same inflation adjustment factor for both operating and modernizing housing. Consequently, we assume a 5.3-percent inflation adjustment for this calculation. Under the block grant, the geographic cost factor for modernizing housing differs from that used for operating housing. In our sample calculation, we assume that the entity\u2019s geographic cost factor is 2 percent below the national average. The resulting grant calculation for modernizing housing is shown in table II.2.", "We increase the fiscal year 1996 modernizing funding amount by 5.3 percent for inflation, reduce it by 2 percent for below average costs, and consider the 170 housing units the entity operates (150 low-income units and 20 Turnkey III and Mutual Help units). These calculations result in a modernizing grant amount of $346,298.

These categories include the Native American population, low-income households, households with housing cost exceeding half their income, low-income households in need of housing, and households living in overcrowded conditions or without kitchen or plumbing facilities. Table II.3 shows each factor and its associated weight.

This factor receives a weight of 11 percent in the formula. Multiplying the entity\u2019s share of the American Indian and Alaska Native population by the factor\u2019s weight produces the entity\u2019s weighted share for the factor.
