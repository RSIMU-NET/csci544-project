In 2009, its authorizing legislation  was amended to also honor Stewart L. Udall\u2019s public service legacy. The  Foundation is committed to educating a new generation of Americans to  preserve and protect their national heritage through scholarship,  fellowship, and internship programs focused on environmental and Native  American issues. The Foundation consists of the Morris K. Udall and  Stewart L. Udall Trust Fund, which is used to operate the Foundation\u2019s  education programs, and the Environmental Dispute Resolution Fund.  The latter fund is available to the Foundation to operate the U.S. Institute  for Environmental Conflict Resolution, which was established by the  Environmental Policy and Conflict Resolution Act of 1998 to promote the  principles and practices of environmental conflict resolution and to assist  in resolving conflict over environmental issues involving federal agencies.

Under FMFIA and implementing guidance, federal executive  agencies must establish internal control and financial systems that  provide reasonable assurance of achieving the following three objectives  of internal control: effectiveness and efficiency of operations, compliance  with regulations and applicable laws, and reliability of financial reporting.

According to the Executive  Director, after discussion and approval from the Chair and Vice Chair of  the Board, the Foundation entered into a 5-year interagency agreement  for assisted acquisitions on March 11, 2013, with the DOI Interior  Business Center\u2019s (IBC) Acquisition Services Directorate. IBC provides  comprehensive acquisition services to federal agencies, managing the  entire process from planning, soliciting, and evaluating offers to awarding  and administering contracts through closeout. We determined that the  design of this action is consistent with internal control standards and  applicable guidance for federal executive agencies. Specifically, the  Foundation\u2019s interagency agreement with IBC for managing  environmental conflict resolution contracts is generally consistent with  OMB\u2019s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) 2008 policy  guidance on management and use of interagency acquisitions. The  formal agreement generally follows OFPP\u2019s model agreement for an  assisted acquisition, including delineating the roles and responsibilities of  both the requesting (Foundation) and servicing (IBC) agencies throughout  the acquisition life cycle. The agreement is an appropriate strategy for  addressing the findings identified by the DOI OIG in this area and meeting  internal control standards for proper implementation and oversight of  agency contracting activities.", "Pursuant to the terms of the interagency agreement, IBC has agreed to  assist the Foundation on contracts related to environmental conflict  resolution activities, including mediation, facilitation, and assessment  services. An IBC official serves as the Contracting Officer for contracts    that IBC awards to private service providers on the Foundation\u2019s behalf. IBC also will provide contracting officer\u2019s representatives (COR) until such  time that Foundation Program Managers become qualified to be  authorized CORs by completing existing training requirements and  receiving Federal Acquisition Institute certification as CORs.agreement, IBC will help the Foundation comply with the bona fide needs  rule by managing funds according to the Foundation\u2019s guidance,  recording transactions in a timely fashion, and implementing and  exercising controls to ensure compliance with all applicable statutory and  regulatory fiscal requirements.", "Further, per the agreement, the Foundation will provide IBC with  information on project objectives, deliverables, and schedule milestones,  and IBC will select an appropriate award type based on the nature of the  requirement and associated risk. IBC is responsible for ensuring that the  environmental conflict resolution contracts comply with competition  requirements, including seeking competition unless an exception is  justified and approved at the appropriate level; requiring the Foundation  to furnish supporting rationale and appropriate documentation to support  an exception to competition; and reviewing the sufficiency of the  Foundation\u2019s justification and documentation before approving and  proceeding with a noncompetitive action. The interagency agreement with  IBC also defines the roles and responsibilities for evaluating proposed  contract modifications. Per this agreement, the Foundation is to work with  IBC to evaluate proposals for changes and, if requested by the IBC  Contracting Officer, to participate in negotiation of changes, modifications,  and claims. Further, the Foundation is responsible for ensuring that it is  not authorizing work (making commitments or promises, issuing  instructions to start or stop work, or directing changes), changing any  contractual documents, modifying the scope of work (including the period  of performance), authorizing accrual of costs, or otherwise providing  direction to the contractor, except as expressly authorized in the COR  appointment by IBC\u2019s Contracting Officer. IBC is responsible for working  with the Foundation to evaluate proposals for changes and ensuring that  any modifications to the requirements or price of the award remain within  the overall scope of the original award. The agreement should help in  improving management and oversight on those environmental conflict  resolution contracts being serviced by IBC. The total amount paid on  these environmental conflict resolution contracts was approximately   $2.7 million in fiscal year 2013.", "The Foundation has retained responsibility for administrative contracts  and leasing activities. According to the Foundation, in fiscal year 2013, it  paid approximately $780,000 for administrative contracts managed by the  Foundation. Most of the administrative contract costs were onetime  expenditures to address DOI OIG audit findings, such as contracting for  organizational development work, the internal control review, legal review  and assistance, and the cost of the DOI OIG audit. Other administrative  costs are recurring, such as payroll and financial services provided by the  General Services Administration under memorandums of understanding,  and the cost of the annual financial statement audit. The Foundation also  spent $361,000 on leased space at two locations.", "The Foundation plans to draft guidance on internal contracting processes  that will be reviewed by the Foundation\u2019s General Counsel and Executive  Director.

The Foundation expects  the policy to state that the FAR guidance should be followed, including its  contract documentation requirements and prohibitions related to personal  services contracts.
