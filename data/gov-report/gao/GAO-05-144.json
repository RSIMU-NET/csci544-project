Although TSA has issued a limited threat assessment of general aviation, and the FBI identified that terrorists have considered using general aviation to conduct attacks, a systematic assessment of threats has not been conducted. In addition, to assess airport vulnerabilities, TSA plans to issue a self-assessment tool for airport operators' use, but it does not plan to conduct on-site vulnerability assessments at all general aviation airports due to the cost and vastness of the general aviation network. Instead, TSA intends to use a systematic and analytical risk management process, which is considered a best practice, to assess the threats and vulnerabilities of general aviation. However, TSA has not yet developed an implementation plan for its risk management efforts. TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have taken steps to address security risks to general aviation through regulation and guidance, but still face challenges in their efforts to further enhance security. For example, TSA has promulgated regulations requiring background checks of foreign candidates for U.S. flight training schools and has issued security guidelines for general aviation airports. However, we found limitations in the process used to conduct compliance inspections of flight training programs. In addition, FAA, in coordination with TSA and other federal agencies, has implemented airspace restrictions over certain landmarks and special events. However, FAA has not established written policies or procedures for reviewing and revalidating the need for flight restrictions that limit access to airspace for indefinite periods of time and could negatively affect the general aviation industry. Non-federal general aviation stakeholders have partnered with the federal government and have individually taken steps to enhance general aviation security. For example, industry associations developed best practices and recommendations for securing general aviation, and have partnered with TSA to develop security initiatives such as the Airport Watch Program, similar to a neighborhood watch program.

To identify what additional steps the federal government has  taken to address national security risks from general aviation, we obtained  and analyzed data from the FAA, including the number of flight  restrictions that affect general aviation and information from TSA on  efforts to ensure compliance with general aviation regulations and provide  security guidelines for airport operators. We sought to determine the  reliability of these data by, among other things, discussing methods of  inputting and maintaining data with agency officials. On the basis of these  discussions, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this review. To identify what steps nonfederal aviation  stakeholders have taken to enhance the security of general aviation, we  judgmentally selected 31 general aviation airports to observe security  measures implemented since September 11, 2001, and discuss security- related issues. We selected these airports based on characteristics  including size, location, and aviation activity. Because of the limited  number of airports in our sample, and because the selected airports did  not constitute a representative sample, the results of our case study  analysis cannot be projected to the universe of general aviation airports.

In 2002, recreational flying accounted for about   41 percent of all general aviation hours flown. The remaining categories  include activities such as medical services, aerial advertising, aerial  mapping and photography, and aerial application of seeds or chemicals.", "Various types of aircraft can be used in general aviation operations,  including single-engine and multi-engine piston aircraft, turboprops,  turbojets, helicopters, gliders, and experimental aircraft. The general  aviation fleet in the United States consists of about 211,000 active aircraft.  While this fleet is diverse, certain activities are generally associated with  specific types of general aviation aircraft. For example, corporate flying  generally involves the use of turboprop and turbojet aircraft, while  personal and instructional flying generally involves the use of single- engine propeller-driven aircraft. The largest category of general aviation  aircraft is single-engine propeller, which in 2002 made up 68 percent of the  general aviation fleet. Types of general aviation aircraft and their uses are  described in figure 2.", "There are approximately 14,000 private-use and 4,800 public-use general  aviation airports in the United States, and about 550,000 active general  aviation pilots and instructors.  Non-U.S. citizens can also possess active  student pilot certificates in the United States, according to FAA. Although  general aviation aircraft can take off and land at almost any airport,  including most of the nation\u2019s commercial service airports, there is an  extensive system of general aviation airports nationwide. Figure 3  identifies the categories of airports in the United States.", "Public-use general aviation airports can range in size and complexity from  the short, grass landing strip in rural areas to the very busy urban airports  with multiple paved runways of differing lengths that can accommodate  large jet aircraft.

Although these guidelines were issued after we conducted our survey of  general aviation airport managers, we found that the majority of airport  managers surveyed stated that they would use a security  review/vulnerability assessment tool if it were provided. To produce these  security guidelines, TSA partnered with industry associations participating  in the Aviation Security Advisory Committee\u2019s Working Group on General  Aviation Airports Security. The guidelines include an airport characteristic  measurement tool that allows airport operators to assess the level of risk  associated with their airport to determine which security enhancements  are most appropriate for their facility.

In addition, intelligence information may  be classified or sensitive, thus limiting with whom it can be shared. TSA  partners with industry associations that are part of a General Aviation  Coalition as a primary means for communicating threat information and  developing security guidelines for general aviation airport managers.  Specifically, rather than notifying general aviation airport operators  directly, TSA communicates threat advisories to these industry  associations, which in turn are to provide it to their members. A majority  of general aviation airport managers we surveyed reported that they had at  least some contact with nonfederal entities such as state aviation officials  or industry associations such as the American Association of Airport  Executives or the National Business Aviation Association. Additionally, a  majority indicated that they had established procedures for disseminating  security-related information to airport employees and tenants.", "TSA issued threat advisories for dissemination by general aviation  associations to general aviation airports. However, industry association  representatives and state aviation officials we spoke with stated that these  security advisories were general in nature and were not consistently  received. An example of one of TSA\u2019s threat advisories is shown in figure 5  below.", "Timely, specific, and actionable information are three key principles of  effective risk communication. However, TSA faces inherent challenges in  applying risk communication principles because of: (1) the generality of  intelligence information received from the intelligence community, (2) a  limited capability to identify appropriate officials and airports to receive  threat information, and (3) potential restrictions placed on communicating  classified or sensitive security information to general aviation  stakeholders. Providing threat information to the public or those with a  need to know in accordance with these principles is challenging and  extends beyond threat communications related to general aviation.", "The first challenge TSA, along with other federal agencies, faces in  applying risk communication principles is the generality of intelligence  information and the difficulties the government faces in developing such  information. According to TSA, gathering specific threat information is  difficult because the threat posed by a particular person or group varies  over time with changes in the terrorist organization\u2019s structure, objectives,  methodologies, and capabilities. Targets also change depending on the  security of the target in question; likelihood of success; mission  complexity; and potential psychological, emotional, and financial impact  of the attack. These variations in groups and targets make predicting how  and when a terrorist event could occur difficult. Nonetheless, we have  reported that public warning systems should, to the extent possible,  include specific, consistent, accurate, and clear information on the threat  at hand, including the nature of the threat, location, and threat time frames  along with guidance on actions to be taken in response to the threat.  According to risk communication principles, without adequate threat  information, the public may ignore the threat or engage in inappropriate  actions, some of which may compromise rather than promote the public\u2019s  safety.", "A second challenge faced by TSA in communicating threat information to  general aviation airports is the lack of current, reliable, and complete  information about who to contact to facilitate communication. General  aviation airport operators are widely spread among a diverse range of  airports that have historically been subject to little or no federal regulation  or contact. As a result, contact information about who the owners or  operators of individual airports are may not be complete, current, or  readily available. Neither FAA nor TSA maintains a current database with  contact information for all general aviation airports. Thus, identifying who  should receive threat information at the nearly 19,000 airports poses a  significant challenge. While general aviation industry associations typically  maintain contact information on their members, association officials  stated that when they need contact information on general aviation  airports they generally use data from the FAA.", "A third challenge TSA faces in providing classified threat information to  general aviation airport operators is determining which airport officials  have a need and clearance to receive classified or sensitive intelligence  information. In general, the more detailed and specific the threat  information, the more likely the information is classified and, therefore,  not available to those without appropriate security clearances. TSA  officials said they had sanitized threat information in order to issue the  five security advisories to general aviation industry associations in an  unclassified format. TSA officials said they had also granted security  clearances to individuals at certain industry associations who were willing  to undergo the required background check process. However, although  TSA has developed the ability to communicate classified threat  information to some general aviation industry representatives, the agency  still faces limitations on its ability to ensure that airport operators with a  need to know have access to classified threat information, and have the  appropriate clearances.", "According to TSA officials, the agency\u2019s approach to risk management  should improve its ability to communicate threat information to the  general aviation community by addressing the three challenges mentioned  above. Specifically, once TSA completes threat and criticality assessments  and\u2014in coordination with general aviation airport managers\u2014  vulnerability assessments, the agency will have a greater sense of the  threats that individual general aviation airport managers should be aware  of and therefore be able to communicate more useful and specific threat  information.

Since then, presidential TFRs have had a radius of   30 nautical miles, with a ceiling of 18,000 feet. The rationale for  increasing the size of presidential TFRs, according to FAA, was based on  the difficulty the military might have in preventing an airborne attack on  the President once an aircraft was within the 3-nautical mile zone. Figure 7  illustrates the area now covered by a presidential TFR over the Crawford  Ranch in Texas when the President is in residence.", "In the case of the national capital region and selected military installations,  the duration of TFRs implemented for national security reasons has been  put in place and subsequently extended for indefinite periods of time. For  example, temporary flight restrictions in and around the national capital  region were established shortly after September 11 and according to FAA  officials, no set date has been established for their removal. These  restrictions in and around Washington, D.C., are the flight-restricted zone  and the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Air Defense Identification Zone, as  shown in figure 8.", "In addition, FAA issued 21 TFRs around various military facilities  throughout the country because of security concerns at these facilities  after the terrorist attacks of September 11. While 8 of these TFRs have  since been canceled, 13 were still in effect as of July 27, 2004, with no  scheduled date for removal or documented analysis to justify their  continued need. According to FAA officials, the agency plans to convert   11 of these areas to national security areas. Once FAA publishes revised  aeronautical charts reflecting the new, permanent advisories  recommending that pilots avoid the airspace, FAA officials said they plan  to cancel the TFRs. In January 2004, FAA issued proposals for converting  the remaining two TFRs to permanently prohibited airspace (where no  flights are permitted). At the time of our review, FAA was still reviewing  comments on the proposal to permanently restrict the surrounding  airspaces. Figure 9 shows the status of security-related TFRs FAA  established over military installations since September 11."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TFRs May Negatively Affect the General Aviation Industry", "paragraphs": ["TSA, FAA, and general aviation industry stakeholders we spoke with  stated that TFRs negatively affect primarily general aviation operators and  airports. According to aviation industry representatives we contacted and  FAA, the increase in the number, size, and duration of TFRs and, at times,  limited notice given prior to their establishment since September 11 has  resulted in numerous inadvertent violations of restricted airspace. For  example, the Washington, D.C. Air Defense Identification Zone has been  violated over 1,000 times, constituting over 40 percent of all TFR violations  since September 11, 2001. As figure 10 shows, since September 2001, the  number of violations of all TFRs has increased dramatically. General  aviation has accounted for most TFR violations committed within U.S.  airspace. Further, about 95 percent of all TFR violations occurred in  airspace secured for either presidential security or other national security  purposes.", "Although no TFR violations have been shown to be terrorist related,  violators are subject to disciplinary action. According to FAA officials,  violations of a TFR typically result in a suspension of the pilot\u2019s certificate  ranging anywhere from 15 days to 90 days. They said that the most  common reason for TFR violations is pilots not reading the Notices to  Airmen for the flight area, a required preflight procedure. Other reasons  for violations included weather problems, mechanical failures, and pilot  in-flight disorientation (i.e., getting lost). FAA officials stated that the  number and severity of disciplinary actions imposed on pilots violating  TFRs have increased since September 11. However, FAA officials were  unable to provide statistical information on the number and severity of  disciplinary actions for pilots violating TFRs before or since September 11.", "The imposition of TFRs can also have an economic impact on general  aviation operations. TSA, FAA, and industry associations we spoke with  stated that the costs associated with restricting airspace can be significant.  The National Business Aviation Association commissioned a study to  estimate the economic impact TFRs have had on general aviation since  September 11. While we did not independently assess the validity of the  association\u2019s assumptions or calculations, the study estimated that general  aviation passengers and firms lost over $1 billion because of increased  costs to passengers and lost revenues and additional operating costs for  general aviation firms.", "We visited St. Mary\u2019s Airport in Brunswick, Georgia, to discuss the  economic impact of TFRs with an affected general aviation airport  operator. St. Mary\u2019s is located approximately 3 miles south of the Kings  Bay Naval Base, where FAA issued a security-related TFR shortly after  September 11. The airport operator stated that the loss of much of the  general aviation traffic through his airport resulting from the TFR had  significantly reduced his ability to generate revenue to sustain operations.", "According to the operator, the airport\u2019s proximity to the TFR around the  base significantly deters pilots from using the airport. Other airport  operators we visited that were affected by TFRs also cited their negative  economic impacts. A sign warning pilots to avoid restricted airspace near  the St. Mary\u2019s Airport is pictured in figure 11.", "Although TFRs may have economic and other negative impacts on the  general aviation industry, FAA did not establish a systematic process for  periodically reviewing the continuing need for TFRs over the national  capital region and the 13 TFRs over military installation, or determine the  long-term economic or other impacts on general aviation operations of  these restrictions. While FAA officials said they frequently reviewed TFRs  on an informal basis, they did not conduct routine assessments of the  continuing need for indefinite TFRs based on a consistent, documented set  of criteria or determine the impact of these restrictions on general  aviation. In June 2004, FAA officials, in reporting to Congress on the Air  Defense Identification Zone, did not cite specific criteria or the process  used to determine the continuing need for the restrictions. Instead, FAA  based its report primarily on unspecified security reasons submitted by  TSA. TSA officials cited the continuing threat posed to the national capital  region by organizations such as al Qaeda. While the air defense  identification zone around the national capital region is unique, it is  possible that future circumstances may warrant the issuance of other  temporary flight restrictions of indefinite duration. Without documented  procedures and criteria, FAA cannot ensure that future reviews of flight  restrictions issued for indefinite periods are properly conducted, or  consistently ensure that restrictions on airspace are still needed.", "We also found that TSA and FAA were limited in their ability to mitigate  the threat of airborne attack. This is a result of limitations in airspace  restrictions, and the practice of granting pilots waivers to enter  temporarily restricted airspace."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enhancing Security at General Aviation Airports Is Difficult because of Funding Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Enhancing general aviation security is difficult because of funding  challenges faced by the federal government and general aviation airport  operators. General aviation airports have received some federal funding  for implementing security upgrades since September 11, but have funded  most security enhancements on their own. General aviation stakeholders  we contacted expressed concern that they may not be able to pay for any  future security requirements that TSA may establish. In addition, TSA and  FAA are unlikely to be able to allocate significant levels of funding for  general aviation security enhancements, given competing priorities of  commercial aviation and other modes of transportation.", "About 3,000 general aviation airports are eligible to receive FAA Airport  Improvement Program grants. General aviation airports can use Airport  Improvement Program grant funds for projects that provide safety and  security benefits. For example, 6 of the 31 airport managers we  interviewed, including one of the largest general aviation airports in the  country, said they used Airport Improvement Program grants to pay for  some of their security enhancements after September 11, 2001. In fiscal  year 2002, general aviation airports received $561 million in Airport  Improvement Program grants, of which $3.2 million (or about 0.6 percent)  was awarded for security projects, and in fiscal year 2003, $680 million, of  which $1.3 million (or about 0.2 percent) was awarded for security  projects. Because general aviation airports are generally not subject to  any federal regulations for security, in order to meet eligibility  requirements for their grants, general aviation airport projects are  generally limited to those related to safety but have security benefits, such  as lighting and fencing, as well as the acquisition and use of cameras,  additional lighting, and motion sensors. FAA officials stated that if new  security requirements were established for general aviation airports,  security-related enhancement projects related to these requirements  would be eligible and receive priority for Airport Improvement Program  funding. However, given the competing demands of commercial airports,  the large number of general aviation airports eligible for such funding, and  the limitations of the Airport Improvement Program, funding could be  uncertain for general aviation airport operators to meet any new security- related requirements.", "The Office for Domestic Preparedness within the Department of  Homeland Security administers two grant programs that could benefit  general aviation airports\u2014the State Homeland Security Grant Program  and the Urban Areas Security Initiative. Under these programs, states  may purchase equipment to protect critical infrastructure, including  equipment for general aviation airports, if the state declares general  aviation airports critical infrastructures. During the course of our review,  we learned of one state that plans to spend a small amount of Department  of Homeland Security grants to improve the security of general aviation  airports. According to officials in Wisconsin, the state plans to use at least  $1.5 million of its $41 million Homeland Security Grant in 2004 to enhance  security at general aviation airports located along the Great Lakes.", "Vision 100 also authorized the Department of Homeland Security to  establish a $250 million Aviation Security Capital Fund administered by  TSA to alleviate some of the demand on the Airport Improvement Program  for security enhancement grants. Of this amount, $125 million is  discretionary, with priority given to the installation of baggage-screening  equipment at commercial airports while the balance is allocated by  formula based on airport size and other security considerations. TSA  officials noted that Congress did not provide an appropriation for fiscal  year 2004 for the fund. If Congress decides to make appropriations in the  future for these purposes, general aviation airports will still have to  compete with commercial airports for this discretionary funding. Given  the extent of unmet security funding needs at commercial airports, it  seems unlikely that a significant proportion of funding would be available  for general aviation. For example, estimates to install explosive detection  system machinery with commercial airport baggage systems range from   $3 billion to $5 billion. At the time of our review, $1.2 billion had been  appropriated for this effort, and according to the House Committee on  Appropriations, airports will be funded, at best, for about half of their  installation needs. Even if funds were available, TSA would face a  challenge in establishing and prioritizing security projects eligible for  Aviation Security Capital Fund grants across a wide spectrum of general  aviation airports with diverse characteristics.

As the 9/11  Commission concluded, homeland security and national preparedness  often begins with the private sector. While the federal government can  provide guidance and some amount of funding for security enhancements,  long-term success in securing general aviation depends on a partnership  among the federal government, state governments, and the general  aviation industry.", "Even with such a partnership, enhancing security at general aviation  airports presents TSA and the general aviation community with challenges  that will not be easily or quickly resolved. For example, TSA\u2019s planned risk  management approach for general aviation could assist the agency in  providing guidance and prioritizing funding for security enhancements by  assessing vulnerabilities and threats to better target its efforts. However,  without a documented implementation plan for assessing threats and  vulnerabilities that sets forth time frames and goals and the resources  needed to achieve these goals, there is limited assurance that TSA will  focus its resources and efforts on areas of greatest need, monitor the  progress of its efforts, and hold responsible officials accountable for  achieving desired results. In addition, completing vulnerability and threat  assessments in partnership with general aviation airports should help TSA  better communicate threat information. However, because TSA must rely  on other federal agencies to provide threat information and follow federal  requirements governing disclosure of classified information, it is difficult  for TSA to adhere to risk communication principles, particularly in  providing specific and actionable information. Nevertheless, effective  communication of threat information is important because misallocation  of limited resources and disruption of operations are possible effects of  communicating nonspecific or incorrect threat information.", "While TSA and FAA have promulgated regulations to help reduce security  risks associated with access to aircraft and airspace, the intended security  benefit of these regulations may be limited for a variety of reasons. For  example, we found limitations in TSA\u2019s process for monitoring flight  training providers and operators of private charter aircraft, and in granting  waivers to pilots to fly through security related flight restrictions. In  addition, FAA has not documented its process for reviewing and  revalidating the need for continuing security-related flight restrictions on  airspace that are established for indefinite periods.

Proximity to potential terrorist targets such as large population centers  versus sparse population areas, as well as near to and far from other  critical infrastructures and symbolic landmarks.  4.  Airport characteristics, including number, length, and type (turf or  paved) of runways, and primary types of general aviation operations  such as recreational aviation, business and corporate aviation, charter  services, and flight training.", "Because we judgmentally selected these general aviation airports, we  cannot draw generalized conclusions based on airport managers\u2019 interview  responses. However, the anecdotal information provided is intended to  complement the findings of our random survey of 500 general aviation  airports.", "To obtain examples of what some states have done to enhance general  aviation security, we judgmentally selected 10 states with efforts to  enhance general aviation security ranging from issuing new security  requirements to those in the early stages of determining how they would  address general aviation security. To select this range of states, we  conducted a literature search to determine which states had proposed or  enacted new security laws, regulations, or requirements. We also  requested recommendations from the National Association of State  Aviation Officials and other industry associations such as the Aircraft  Owners and Pilots Association, and noted which state aviation directors  had participated in the National Association of State Aviation Officials\u2019  Task Group on General Aviation Security. We also considered whether a  state participated in FAA\u2019s block grant program in which FAA provides  airport improvement program grant money to a state in a lump sum and  the state determines which airport projects to fund, rather than each  airport applying directly to FAA for grant funds on a project-by-project  basis. Finally, on the basis of our resources, we considered those states in  which we also planned to visit general aviation airports. Because we did  not randomly select the states in which we obtained information, we  cannot draw generalized conclusions about all states. However, the  information obtained from these 10 states serves to provide examples of  what some states have done to enhance general aviation security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Transportation Security Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Leo Barbour, Grace Coleman,   Chris Ferencik, Kara Finnegan-Irving, Dave Hooper, Stan Kostyla,   Thomas Lombardi, Mark Ramage, Robert Rivas, Jerry Seigler, and   Richard Swayze were key contributors to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
