This $12.7 billion represents 13 percent of the $95.2 billion obligated from the DRF for the 650 major disasters declared during this time frame. FEMA's average administrative cost percentages for major disasters during the 10 fiscal years 2004 to 2013 doubled the average during the 10 fiscal years 1989 to 1998. FEMA recognized that administrative costs have increased and has taken steps intended to better control and reduce these costs, such as setting a goal in its recent strategic plan to lower these costs, and creating administrative cost targets. However, FEMA does not require these targets be met, and GAO found that had FEMA met its targets, administrative costs could have been reduced by hundreds of millions of dollars. GAO also found that FEMA lacks an integrated plan with time frames and milestones to hold senior officials accountable for achieving its goals to reduce and more effectively control costs. Such a plan could help FEMA to better oversee and control these costs. In addition, GAO found that FEMA does not track administrative costs by major disaster program, such as Individual or Public Assistance, and has not assessed the costs versus the benefits of tracking such information. Doing so could provide FEMA with better information to manage these costs.", "From fiscal years 2004 through 2013, FEMA obligated $1.7 billion to reimburse grantees (states) and subgrantees (localities) for administrative costs related to Public Assistance (PA) grants, and its 2007 policy change has led to additional complexity and workload for FEMA and its grantees. FEMA's 2007 rule was intended to simplify and clarify the method FEMA uses to reimburse grantees and subgrantees for certain costs incurred for administering PA grants. However, according to FEMA, the 2007 rule led to an unexpectedly high rate of claims for direct administrative costs. Grantee, subgrantee, and FEMA officials told GAO that FEMA policies and guidance do not adequately specify the requirements for determining reasonableness, eligibility, and supporting documentation to support reimbursement of direct administrative costs. Clarifying the agency's guidance and minimum documentation requirements would help grantees and subgrantees submit, and FEMA review requests for administrative costs reimbursement."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FEMA (1) develop an integrated plan to better control and reduce its administrative costs for major disasters, (2) assess the costs versus the benefits of tracking FEMA administrative costs by DRF program, and (3) clarify the agency's guidance and minimum documentation requirements for direct administrative costs.

FEMA\u2019s disaster assistance programs include Individual Assistance,  which provides financial assistance directly to individuals, and Public  Assistance (PA), which provides financial assistance to state, tribal,  territorial, and local governments. FEMA\u2019s DRF is the major source of  federal disaster recovery assistance when a disaster is declared.

We also conducted an analysis of FEMA\u2019s  administrative costs for 539 major disasters declared during the same  period that showed administrative cost percentages frequently exceeded  FEMA\u2019s targets, although FEMA did not require that the targets be met.  To help FEMA control its administrative costs, we recommended that  FEMA implement goals for administrative cost percentages and monitor  performance to achieve these goals. In August 2014, FEMA reiterated  that it partially concurred with our recommendation and that it continues  to develop and implement more systematic approaches that will either  directly or indirectly improve its ability to monitor administrative costs and  performance.

It  also comprises the time period after FEMA was merged into the newly  created DHS, on March 1, 2003, and predates Hurricane Katrina in 2005.  We focused primarily on fiscal years 2004 through 2013; however, to  provide historical context and to compare results across similar periods,  we also reviewed obligations data during fiscal years 1989 through 2013.  We calculated the percentage of total federal assistance that was  obligated for administrative costs for all major disasters declared during  fiscal years 1989 through 2013.

For example, one subgrantee we  interviewed reported having a direct administrative cost claim or estimate  approved by FEMA field staff, only to have it reduced during a higher- level review. The subgrantee told us that this lack of consistency makes it  difficult for them to budget for their administrative expenses. FEMA PA  officials in headquarters and in regional offices said that disputes over  direct administrative cost claims or estimates have led to a more  contentious environment among FEMA, grantees, and subgrantees.", "According to FEMA PA officials, reviewing and processing direct  administrative costs reimbursements is labor-intensive and has increased  the agency\u2019s workload. FEMA PA officials from 4 regional offices said  they spend considerable resources reviewing and determining whether  direct administrative cost claims meet the criteria in FEMA\u2019s policies and  guidance. For example, for each project wherein direct administrative cost  are claimed, FEMA officials may have to review time keeping, payroll, and  travel records as well as salary information for all grantee and subgrantee  personnel assigned to work on a particular project. FEMA PA officials  from all 10 regional offices reported that reviewing a direct administrative  cost claim can vary from 10 minutes to several weeks or months.  According to FEMA headquarters officials, the increased workload  associated with reviewing these claims reduces the amount of FEMA staff  available for other essential tasks.", "Two-thirds, or 14 of 21, of grantees and subgrantees we interviewed  stated that the time and resources necessary to document and claim  direct administrative costs increases their administrative burden. In  addition, three grantees and two subgrantees we interviewed reported  that they do not always have the personnel or resources needed to track,  document, and submit all potential claims. To receive reimbursement,  grantees and subgrantees must track their time by project. Although  doing so is not required by FEMA, three grantees we interviewed said  that they track their administrative expenses in 15 minute intervals.", "Eight out of 21 grantees and subgrantees reported to us that they have  employed private contractors to perform grant management functions  because of the administrative burden and complexity of FEMA\u2019s  reimbursement process. According to FEMA officials, the greater use of  contractors among grantees and subgrantees has raised the cost to  FEMA because contractors tend to charge higher hourly rates than state,  tribal, territorial, and local government officials. However, FEMA officials  also said that, in some cases, contractors perform grants management  functions that assist grantees and subgrantees. In addition, one grantee  we interviewed said that it hired a contractor for grants management  related to Hurricane Sandy because the relatively small number of state  personnel available for disaster recovery was insufficient given the  severity of the damage, which FEMA officials estimate may result in as  many as 5,100 PA projects. The grantee said that the contractor was  more effective at seeking reimbursement from FEMA than their state or  local officials would have been, given the contractor\u2019s expertise and  experience working with FEMA. According to the grantee, the contractor  has increased the amount of funds FEMA obligated to the state. For  example, the grantee said that the contractor discovered $8 million in  eligible funding that FEMA PA staff had not included on the approved  project worksheet. The contractor stated that, in less than 1 year, it had  increased the amount of FEMA PA funding to the grantee by more than  $60 million while charging about $10 million for its services. In response  to these claims, FEMA officials told us that these under-obligated projects  could have been noticed and corrected during project closeout.", "FEMA headquarters officials we interviewed said that the number of  appeals related to administrative costs have increased. Under the PA  program, grantees and subgrantees may appeal any FEMA decision  regarding eligibility for, or the amount of assistance. From November  2007 to May 2014, FEMA reported receiving 182 first appeals and closing  21 second appeals related to direct administrative costs. FEMA officials  stated that prior to the 2007 rule, there were no appeals related to  administrative costs and that these new claims have increased the  agency\u2019s administrative burden by pulling resources from more pressing  areas. Furthermore, the number of both first and second appeals is likely  understated because many large, complex projects have not been  completed. One subgrantee told us that they chose not to appeal FEMA\u2019s  decision to reduce their direct administrative costs claim, as the appeal  process may take months or years to resolve and the amount in question  was small relative to the total project funding.", "As discussed above, FEMA officials and grantees reported that FEMA  policies and guidance do not provide sufficient instruction to determine  whether a claim is eligible or reasonable and that clarifying such guidance  would help to address these issues. In addition, without clear and specific  guidance on how to evaluate and approve or deny direct administrative  costs claims, FEMA regional officials and field staff must make difficult,  subjective determinations when evaluating claims. This leads to  inconsistent application of the direct administrative costs policy and  guidance, creating confusion and frustration among grantees and  subgrantees, and leading to additional appeals. OMB\u2019s Final Bulletin for  Agency Good Guidance Practices states that \u201cwell designed guidance  documents serve many critical functions in a regulatory program.

According to FEMA officials, this pilot program will be  designed specifically for Hurricane Sandy recovery operations and may  use a sliding-scale or fixed percentage administrative allowance, which  could reduce the administrative burden and complexity associated with  the current direct administrative costs process because administrative  costs will be agreed upon before the project begins. In addition, as  described earlier in the report, FEMA PA officials stated that the agency is  developing proposals for modifying the November 2007 rule. According to  the PA officials, these modifications could also change the rules for direct  administrative costs; however, changes would only affect major disasters  declared after the release of the new rule. As of April 30, 2014, 516, or 79  percent, of the 650 disasters declared during fiscal years 2004 through  2013, have not been completed.

We focused on this time frame because it contains current data for  major disasters. It also comprises the time period after FEMA was  merged into the newly created DHS, on March 1, 2003, and predates  Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Fiscal year 1989 is the earliest year for which  FEMA maintains obligations data. We focused primarily on fiscal years  2004 through 2013; however, to provide historical context and to compare  results across similar periods, we also reviewed obligations data during  fiscal years 1989 through 2013. To determine FEMA\u2019s administrative cost  percentages for disaster declarations, we obtained actual and projected  DRF obligations for all 1,332 major disasters declared during fiscal years  1989 through 2013. To assess FEMA\u2019s current practices, we compared  FEMA\u2019s administrative cost percentages for disasters declared during  fiscal years 2004 through 2013 with FEMA\u2019s target ranges for  administrative cost percentages. Specifically, we calculated the  percentage of total federal assistance that was obligated for  administrative costs for each disaster in our scope. Next we determined  whether these percentages were above or below FEMA\u2019s administrative  cost targets and whether FEMA\u2019s administrative costs would have  changed during the period had FEMA met the targets. To identify  potential trends over time, we compared FEMA\u2019s administrative cost  percentages during fiscal years 1989 through 1998 with FEMA\u2019s  administrative cost percentages during fiscal years 2004 through 2013.  According to FEMA officials, administrative costs are typically higher in  the early months of a declaration, typically decreasing as the declaration  matures (that is, as labor-intensive response activities decline). In order to  ensure the results of our analyses were not skewed by major disasters  that had not yet matured and whose administrative costs were high, we  analyzed actual administrative costs for disaster declarations that were  closed as of April 30, 2014. For declarations that were still open as of  April 30, 2014, we analyzed actual obligations as of April 30, 2014, plus  the amount that FEMA projected to obligate in the future until the  declarations are eventually closed. To determine whether the IFMIS data  were reliable, we reviewed the data that FEMA officials provided,  discussed data quality control procedures with relevant FEMA officials,  and reviewed documentation such as DHS audits that included IFMIS to  ensure the integrity of the data. We determined that the IFMIS DRF data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "In addition, we obtained and analyzed FEMA policies, procedures, and  guidance specific to FEMA\u2019s administrative costs. We obtained FEMA\u2019s  Financial Information Tool for a small and large disaster to better  understand FEMA\u2019s categories of administrative costs.", "To determine what actions, if any, FEMA is taking to reduce the costs of  delivering disaster assistance, we interviewed officials from FEMA\u2019s  Office of Chief Financial Officer and obtained and analyzed  documentation to determine what, if any, internal standards FEMA utilizes  to determine the reasonableness of its administrative costs and whether  FEMA implemented administrative cost goals and tracks performance  against the goals. We also interviewed three Federal Coordinating  Officers to determine their ability to control costs and the respective  outcomes.

To facilitate project review, approval, and funding, FEMA classifies  PA projects as either small or large based on annually adjusted cost  thresholds.", "FEMA funds small projects through a process known as Simplified  Procedures that is intended to expedite the processing of grant funding by  obligating funds for small projects based on FEMA\u2019s approval of the  project\u2019s cost estimate. At the beginning of fiscal year 2014, the small  project minimum and maximum thresholds were $1,000 and $68,500,  respectively. If the estimated total project amount is between the  minimum and maximum thresholds, the project is processed as a small  project using Simplified Procedures. The Sandy Recovery Improvement  Act of 2013 (SRIA) required FEMA to complete an analysis to determine  whether or not an increase in the small project thresholds was  appropriate. Subsequently, FEMA raised the minimum threshold to  $3,000 and the maximum threshold to $120,000. These new thresholds,  which will both be adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Consumer  Price Index for all Urban Consumers published by the Department of  Labor, apply to all projects for disasters declared on or after February 26,  2014. Prior to SRIA, only the maximum threshold was adjusted annually.  Under Simplified Procedures, FEMA does not perform a final inspection  of completed small projects, but will review, or validate, a sample of an  applicant\u2019s small projects to ensure that the project scope of work and  damage assessment are complete and that all special considerations  have been identified, among other things.", "After FEMA approves a project, funds are obligated\u2014that is, they are  made available\u2014to the grantee, which, in turn, passes the funds along to  subgrantees. Funding for small projects is generally fixed; however,  FEMA may approve a cost estimate or scope of work for a project after  project approval when new information comes to light. For example, if an  applicant discovers that the actual costs for a project are higher than  FEMA\u2019s estimate, the applicant may apply to FEMA for additional funds.  Before the disaster is closed, the grantee must certify that all such  projects were completed in accordance with FEMA approvals and that the  state contribution to the nonfederal share has been paid to each  subgrantee.", "FEMA funds large projects, those with an estimated cost greater than the  small project maximum threshold, based on actual documented costs. As  with small projects, FEMA initially approves a cost estimate for a large  project and obligates the federal share of the funds to the grantee. Funds  are generally made available to the subgrantee on a progress payment  basis as work is completed and actual costs are documented. When all  work associated with the project is complete, a subgrantee must submit  documentation to the grantee to account for all incurred costs. The  grantee then determines the final cost of the eligible work and submits a  report to FEMA certifying that the subgrantee\u2019s costs were incurred in the  completion of the eligible work.
