However, the health outcomes of veterans with service-connected conditions, such as changes in the severity of symptoms or the incidence of mortality, are not well understood. Information about health outcomes is central to ensuring veterans' wellness and assessing improvement in their disability status. According to VA researchers GAO spoke with and academic studies GAO reviewed, various challenges have limited research on this population. For example, data reside in different VA systems and use different identifiers for medical conditions, hindering use of the data. While VA has begun to consider ways to analyze health outcomes, it has not yet established a plan for this effort, including the scope, specific activities, and timeframes for addressing the identified research challenges.", "VA does not glean information from the results of reevaluations to help manage its disability compensation program. Disability reevaluations help VA gauge whether veterans' service-connected conditions have changed, and whether disability compensation should be modified to reflect those changes (see figure).", "However, VA does not fully use key management information, such as:", "trends in how frequently certain conditions are reevaluated, including those required by VA regulations to be reevaluated; and", "outcomes of reevaluation decisions for individual conditions (i.e., whether conditions worsened or improved).", "Both trend and outcome information could help VA better target its resources toward reevaluating conditions more likely to change.", "VA recently updated its procedures manual to specify which staff may determine whether a veteran's condition should be reevaluated, but has not clearly defined skill sets and training needed to consistently implement these procedures. Specifically, the updated procedures do not indicate the knowledge, skills, and abilities staff need to determine when to conduct reevaluations.

Of this  total, about 19,000 were reevaluations, of which fewer than 5 percent  were in the backlog. VBA uses additional timeliness measures to hold  regional offices accountable by tracking the timeliness of their work in  each of five steps or cycles in the claims process, as managed under  the National Work Queue (VBA\u2019s system for distributing the claims  workload).

VA uses national, regional office, and individual-level data  from its accuracy reviews to oversee the quality of rating claims  decisions, including reevaluations. Each regional office is to meet the  national STAR issue-based target of 96 percent accuracy for the year.  For reevaluations, VBA reported both claim-based and issue-based  accuracy of about 95 percent for fiscal year 2018. According to VBA  officials, in response to a recommendation in the VA OIG\u2019s report on  unwarranted reevaluations, in October 2018 VBA updated the STAR  national quality review checklist with additional questions on (1) the  need for a reevaluation, and (2) the timeframe for future reevaluation.  At the individual claims processor level, VA measures accuracy using  the results of Individual Quality Reviews as part of claims processors\u2019  performance evaluations. For example, a rater is considered fully  successful by achieving 92 to 96 percent accuracy on Individual  Quality Reviews for a month, depending on the rater\u2019s experience.  In fiscal year 2018, VBA reported that for Individual Quality Reviews,  claims processors had a 98.4 percent accuracy rate for reevaluations.  Overall, few reevaluations are reviewed because reevaluations are a  small proportion of VA\u2019s claims workload. Specifically, of about  102,000 reevaluations completed in fiscal year 2018, about 1,500  were reviewed under STAR and about 10,000 were reviewed in  Individual Quality Reviews.

VBA discusses quality review information, including trends in claims  processing errors, through newsletters and periodic conference calls with  regional office managers and quality review teams.

The OIG found that  VSRs were ordering exams without raters\u2019 pre-exam reviews, resulting in  an estimated 15,500 unwarranted exams (about 29 percent of the cases  from the study\u2019s review period). These exams were determined to be  unwarranted based primarily on exclusions identified in VA\u2019s procedures  that exempt certain veterans from reevaluation (see text box). The report  found that, rather than sending claims to raters for pre-exam review,  VSRs were ordering exams despite not having the proper training and  experience to decide on whether a reevaluation was warranted, such as  the specialized knowledge needed to review medical evidence.", "Officials in regional offices we visited expressed concern about VSRs  performing this role. Specifically, staff in three of the four regional offices  we spoke with\u2014including raters, supervisors, quality assurance staff, and  managers\u2014told us that raters do the pre-exam review in their respective  offices because they are the only staff qualified to perform this duty. For  example, raters have more experience and training than VSRs in  reviewing medical evidence to determine the need for a reevaluation,  according to officials from one office. In contrast, supervisors we spoke  with at another regional office told us they have opted to have VSRs do  the pre-exam review as a way to manage the claims workload and enable  raters to focus exclusively on rating claims. However, these supervisors  expressed concern that VSR reviews could have a negative impact on  quality.", "VBA officials said they have not outlined guidance for the skills needed to  perform the pre-exam review.

Further, VBA  officials told us that the recent update to the agency\u2019s procedures did not  reflect a policy change broadening which staff can do pre-exam reviews,  but rather clarified existing practice under which VSRs were already  permitted to perform this task. However, given the OIG findings that VSRs  performing this task resulted in many unwarranted exams, defining the  knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for the pre-exam review could  provide assurance that staff who do so are qualified.

As entry- level staff, claims processors receive national training from VBA related to  their job duties. For raters, this initial training covers reevaluations,  including instruction on when and when not to schedule reevaluations,  and case studies exploring how to make reevaluation decisions based on  medical and other evidence, among other topics. VSRs may also receive  general training on reviewing and evaluating evidence and are introduced  to reevaluations as they learn about general claim development and  ordering exams. In addition to initial training, claims processors must  complete 40 hours of training per year consisting of 15 hours of training  mandated by VBA and 25 hours determined by each regional office. VBA  officials told us that regional offices vary in what training and when  delivered to their staff.", "In addition to this general training, VBA officials told us that VA added  controls to the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS) system to  restrict claims processors\u2019 ability to schedule potential reevaluations,  which could reduce the possibility of unqualified staff ordering  unwarranted exams during the pre-exam review. Specifically, these  controls prevent claims processors from scheduling review dates for  potential reevaluations when certain exclusions apply (such as that  outlined in VA regulation exempting from reevaluation veterans with the  minimum rating for a given condition). Further, claims processors have  the ability to request to override the restrictions when they believe a  reevaluation is warranted based on the circumstances of the case.
