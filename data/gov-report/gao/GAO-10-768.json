The National NAGPRA office, within the Department of the Interior's National Park Service (NPS), facilitates the government-wide implementation of NAGPRA. GAO was asked to determine, among other things, the (1) extent to which agencies have complied with their NAGPRA requirements, (2) actions taken by National NAGPRA, and (3) extent of repatriations reported by agencies. GAO reviewed records for eight key agencies with significant historical collections, surveyed agencies to obtain repatriation data, and interviewed agency, museum, and tribal officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Almost 20 years after NAGPRA, key federal agencies still have not fully complied with the act for their historical collections acquired on or before NAGPRA's enactment. GAO examined NAGPRA implementation in detail for eight key federal agencies with significant historical collections: Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and NPS; Agriculture's U.S. Forest Service; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps); and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). First, all of the agencies acknowledge that they still have additional work to do to fully comply with the act's requirements to identify all of their NAGPRA items, establish cultural affiliations when possible, and create summaries and inventories of the items. Overall, the Corps, the Forest Service, and NPS did the most work to identify their NAGPRA items. BLM, BOR, and FWS did some work, and BIA and TVA have done the least amount of work. Second, some of the eight agencies, along with some other federal agencies, have not fully complied with NAGPRA's requirement to publish notices of inventory completion for all of their culturally affiliated human remains and associated funerary objects in the Federal Register. Until agencies (1) identify all of the possible NAGPRA items in their historical collections, (2) establish cultural affiliations to the extent possible, and (3) publish the required notices, they cannot repatriate their Native American human remains and objects. To fulfill the Secretary of the Interior's responsibilities under NAGPRA, National NAGPRA has taken some actions consistent with the act, such as publishing notices in the Federal Registerand administering a grants program. However, GAO identified some actions of concern. National NAGPRA developed a list of Indian tribes eligible under NAGPRA that was inconsistent with BIA's official list of federally recognized tribes and departmental policy. Furthermore, National NAGPRA did not always screen nominations for Review Committee positions properly and, in a few cases, inappropriately recruited nominees for Review Committee positions. Through fiscal year 2009, 55 percent of the human remains and 68 percent of the associated funerary objects that have been published in notices of inventory completion had been repatriated, according to agency data and GAO's survey results. Agencies are required to permanently document their repatriations, but they are not required to compile and report that information to anyone. Only three agencies--the Corps, the Forest Service, and NPS--centrally track their repatriations. These three agencies, however, along with the other federal agencies that have published notices, generally do not report any of their data on repatriations to National NAGPRA or to Congress. As a result, policymakers, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiians organizations do not have access to readily available information about culturally affiliated NAGPRA items that have not been repatriated. According to officials, the remaining items have not been repatriated for a variety of reasons, such as a lack of repatriation requests and financial constraints."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, and the Interior as well as TVA report to Congress the actions that they need to take to fully comply with the act and that they report the status of their repatriations to National NAGPRA.

The Department of Defense did not provide comments on the report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many federal agencies and museums have acquired Native American  human remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural  patrimony over hundreds of years. When the Native American Graves  Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) was enacted, on November 16,  1990, it was estimated that federal agencies and museums had tens of  thousands of such items in their historical collections. NAGPRA required  federal agencies and museums to (1) identify their Native American human  remains, funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of cultural  patrimony, (2) try and determine if a cultural affiliation exists with a  present day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, and  (3) generally repatriate the culturally affiliated items to the applicable  Indian tribe(s) or Native Hawaiian organization(s) under the terms and  conditions prescribed in the act.

We examined NAGPRA implementation in detail for eight  key federal agencies with significant historical collections: Interior\u2019s  Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Bureau of Land Management (BLM),  Bureau of Reclamation (BOR), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and  NPS; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps); the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s U.S. Forest Service; and the Tennessee Valley Authority  (TVA). For each of these agencies we reviewed records on NAGPRA  compliance, such as inventories, summaries, Federal Register notices, and  correspondence. We interviewed both headquarters and field staff for each  agency, except TVA, to discuss their NAGPRA implementation. For TVA  we interviewed its entire staff responsible for NAGPRA implementation.  TVA\u2019s NAGPRA staff are located at its headquarters in Knoxville,  Tennessee. We also reviewed information for other federal agencies that  had published NAGPRA notices and included basic data on their  submissions in our analysis. To determine how the Review Committee has  carried out its role of monitoring and reviewing NAGPRA implementation  and what challenges it faces, we attended two Review Committee  meetings and interviewed 10 out of 23 current and former Review  Committee members who represented a variety of experiences. We  interviewed some federal, tribal, museum, and scientific organization  officials on the role of the Review Committee. We also analyzed the  Review Committee\u2019s recommendations to the Secretary of the Interior on  disposition requests for culturally unidentifiable human remains and its  recommended resolutions of disputes. To examine how National NAGPRA  has carried out its role of facilitating NAGPRA implementation, we  reviewed National NAGPRA\u2019s list of eligible Indian tribes, Review  Committee nomination files, National NAGPRA annual reports, and we  interviewed the National NAGPRA program staff. To measure the extent to  which federal agencies have repatriated items published in notices of  inventory completion, we obtained data from the three agencies that track  their repatriations\u2014the Corps, the Forest Service, and NPS. For other  agencies that had published notices of inventory completion\u2014four other  key federal agencies as well as eight additional federal agencies\u2014we  deployed a survey. A more detailed description of our scope and  methodology is presented in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 to July 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["NAGPRA covers five types of Native American cultural items, which we  refer to collectively, in this report, as NAGPRA items (see table 1).", "Since the early 1800s, federal agencies have amassed archeological  collections with items numbering in the millions. Some, such as NPS,  acquired their collections through archeological excavations intended to  advance scientific knowledge and preserve cultural resources. Others,  such as the Corps and TVA, have made discoveries during the massive  construction projects that are part of their missions. Forest Service  officials estimated that an overwhelming majority of the agency\u2019s  collections resulted from non-Forest Service initiated activities, such as  research by museums and universities or as a result of the construction of  highways, reservoirs, and pipelines; or mining claims. Interior\u2014with its  land-management agencies\u2014has the largest collection outside of the  Smithsonian Institution, with an estimated 146 million objects and  documents that cover archeology as well as disciplines such as art and  zoology. Federal agency archeological collections are currently stored at a  variety of repositories, both federal and nonfederal, located throughout  the country. For example, BLM\u2019s collections are stored at three BLM  facilities and 121 other repositories. According to TVA officials, TVA\u2019s  collections are stored at universities in Alabama, Kentucky, Michigan,  Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee. These federal collections  include tens of thousands of Native American human remains and  hundreds of thousands of funerary objects, sacred objects, and objects of  cultural patrimony subject to NAGPRA.", "NAGPRA defines a federal agency as any department, agency, or  instrumentality of the United States, except the Smithsonian Institution,  and defines a museum as any institution or state or local government  agency, including any institution of higher learning, that receives federal  funds and has possession of, or control over, Native American cultural  items, except the Smithsonian Institution. The eight federal agencies with  significant historical collections that we reviewed\u2014BIA, BLM, BOR, FWS,  NPS, the Corps, the Forest Service, and TVA\u2014manage various amounts of  federal land in conjunction with their missions and differ in organizational  structure (see table 2). They also have long histories over which they came  into possession or control of NAGPRA items.", "In addition, the missions of the agencies vary widely. For example, NPS\u2019s  mission is to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and  values of the national park system for the enjoyment, education, and  inspiration of this and future generations. In contrast, the mission of TVA  is to serve the Tennessee Valley through energy, environment, and  economic development. Because of their varying missions, the scope and  treatment of their archeological programs have also differed.", "Since 1906, federal agencies have been issuing permits to individuals,  universities, and corporations to perform archeological excavation and  research on the federal land they manage. Although the permitting  system has changed over time, these permits generally allowed the entities  conducting the excavation and research to preserve the excavated  materials in public museums. Thus, in theory, archeological materials  legally excavated from federal lands since 1906 are recorded in agency  reports and records, or in permitting records located in agency files, the  Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Anthropological Archives, or the  National Archives. However, due to the age of some of the permits, the  large number of permits, and administrative processes that have changed  over time, it can be difficult for some agencies to know where all of their  collections are currently located. For example, a recent Interior Inspector  General report stated that Interior agencies\u2019 collections are held in  625 Interior facilities and at least 1,020 non-Interior facilities, but that four  of its agencies were not aware of the location of their collections held in  the non-Interior facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NAGPRA Requirements for Historical Collections", "paragraphs": ["NAGPRA\u2019s requirements for federal agencies, museums, and the Secretary  of the Interior, particularly the ones most relevant to their historical  collections, which are the focus of this report, include the following:    Compile an inventory and establish cultural affiliation. Section 5 of  NAGPRA required that each federal agency and museum compile an  inventory of any holdings or collections of Native American human  remains and associated funerary objects that are in its possession or  control. The act required that the inventories be completed no later than  5 years after its enactment\u2014by November 16, 1995\u2014and in consultation  with tribal government officials, Native Hawaiian organization officials,  and traditional religious leaders. In the inventory, agencies and museums  are required to establish geographic and cultural affiliation to the extent  possible based on information in their possession. Cultural affiliation  denotes a relationship of shared group identity which can be reasonably  traced historically or prehistorically between a present day Indian tribe or  Native Hawaiian organization and an identifiable earlier group. Affiliating  NAGPRA items with a present day Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian  organization is the key to deciding to whom the human remains and  objects should be repatriated. If a cultural affiliation can be made, the act  required that the agency or museum notify the affected Indian tribes or  Native Hawaiian organizations no later than 6 months after the completion  of the inventory. The agency or museum was also required to provide a  copy of each notice\u2014known as a notice of inventory completion\u2014to the  Secretary of the Interior for publication in the Federal Register. The items  for which no cultural affiliation can be made are referred to as culturally  unidentifiable.", "Compile a summary of other NAGPRA items. Section 6 of NAGPRA  required that each federal agency and museum prepare a written summary  of any holdings or collections of Native American unassociated funerary  objects, sacred objects, or objects of cultural patrimony in its possession  or control, based on the available information in their possession. The act  required that the summaries be completed no later than 3 years after its  enactment\u2014by November 16, 1993. Preparation of the summary was to be  followed by federal agency consultation with tribal government officials,  Native Hawaiian organization officials, and traditional religious leaders.  The summary was to describe the scope of the collection, kinds of objects  included, reference to geographical location, means and period of  acquisition and cultural affiliation, where readily ascertainable. After a  valid claim is received by an agency or museum, and if the other terms and  conditions in the act are met, a notice of intent to repatriate must be  published in the Federal Register before any item identified in a summary  can be repatriated. In contrast to a notice of inventory completion for  NAGPRA items listed in inventories, notices of intent to repatriate for  NAGPRA items listed in summaries are not published until after an Indian  tribe or Native Hawaiian organization has submitted a claim for an item.", "Repatriate culturally affiliated human remains and objects. Section 7 of  NAGPRA and its implementing regulations generally require that, upon the  request of an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization, all culturally  affiliated NAGPRA items be returned to the applicable Indian tribe or  Native Hawaiian organization expeditiously\u2014but no sooner than 30 days  after the applicable notice is published in the Federal Register\u2014if the  terms and conditions prescribed in the act are met.

The act and its implementing  regulations did not provide a specific list of activities or actions that  federal agencies and museums had to take in order to identify their  NAGPRA items. However, the act clearly stated that the summaries and  inventories had to contain the NAGPRA items each agency or museum  was in possession or control of. We believe that without conducting a level  of activities that would provide a federal agency with a reasonable  assurance that the summaries and inventories were complete, federal  agencies cannot be confident that they have complied with NAGPRA\u2019s  inventory and summary requirements. Even those agencies that have done  the most work acknowledge that they still have some individual units that  have more work to do. For example, the Corps reports that as of the end  of fiscal year 2009 the Louisville, Nashville, Mobile, and Tulsa Districts  have not yet produced their inventories. Additionally, some agencies said  they do not know exactly how much work is left in order to be confident  that they have identified all of their NAGPRA items.", "In addition to the completeness of agency summaries and inventories, we  found that two other important requirements affecting the quality of these  documents\u2014consultations with Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations and the establishment of cultural affiliations\u2014were also  lacking in some instances. We found that the confusion over when  consultations should occur and when cultural affiliations should be  established appeared to be rooted in the confusion among some NAGPRA  practitioners about the differences between summaries and inventories.  Specifically, summaries described collections, and consultation was to  occur after the summary document was prepared; and cultural affiliations  were to be included in summaries where readily ascertainable. In  contrast, inventories were item-by-item descriptions, consultation was to  occur before the inventory document was completed, and cultural  affiliations were to be made to the extent possible. However, we found  examples where agency officials treated inventories like summaries in that  the consultation occurred and cultural affiliation determinations were  made after the preparation of the inventory. Also, several tribal officials  stated that the frequency and thoroughness of consultations throughout  the NAGPRA process for historical collections varied widely depending on  the agency and agency personnel involved. However, agency officials also  reported challenges in consulting with tribes, such as certain tribes not  wanting to attach any cultural affiliations to NAGPRA items because of  deeply-held spiritual beliefs. If agencies did not perform these initial  critical steps to fully identify and disclose the NAGPRA items that they  have in their historical collections, the repatriation process cannot move  forward."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Publication of Some Notices of Inventory Completion Has Been Delayed, and Some Agencies Have not Published All Required Notices", "paragraphs": ["According to information from National NAGPRA\u2019s database, as of  September 30, 2009, 16,302 Native American human remains, or 55 percent  of all the Native American human remains inventoried by agencies, had  been published in notices of inventory completion and 13,519 had been  listed in inventories for federal collections as culturally unidentifiable  (see table 4). Of the associated funerary objects inventoried by federal  agencies, 193,324 objects, or 74 percent, had been published in a notice of  inventory completion and 66,918 had been listed as culturally  unidentifiable.", "However, we found that in some cases the publication of these notices  encountered significant delays. When agencies made cultural affiliation  determinations for Native American human remains and associated  funerary objects listed in their inventories, they were required to notify the  affiliated Indian tribe(s) or Native Hawaiian organization(s) within  6 months and at the same time submit a copy of the notice to National  NAGPRA for publication in the Federal Register. NAGPRA and its  implementing regulations do not contain a deadline for when the notice  actually had to be published. If a notice of inventory completion is  published and later is found to be inaccurate or new information emerges,  agencies are to work with National NAGPRA to publish a correction  notice. Through fiscal year 2009, federal agencies had published  309 notices of inventory completion and 28 corrections (see fig. 1).", "According to agency officials and National NAGPRA, several reasons  contributed to the delays in publishing notices of inventory completion.  First, during its review process National NAGPRA determined that some  inventories had not been properly prepared and, as a result, agencies had  prepared improper draft notices. For example, one improperly prepared  draft notice included unassociated funerary objects, which are to be  included in summaries and notices of intent to repatriate. This may have  been partly because the regulation for the inventory process was not  finalized until December 4, 1995, after the deadline for preparing  inventories had passed. National NAGPRA officials said they returned  improperly prepared draft notices to the agencies. A second reason for  delays in publishing notices, according to some agency officials, was the  highly complex nature of their consultations with the tribes, which  resulted in the agencies needing additional time to finalize their cultural  affiliations before publishing their notices. Third, some agencies treated  inventories like summaries and waited for a culturally affiliated entity to  request repatriation before submitting a notice for publication. Fourth,  some agencies relied on non-federal repositories (such as universities and  museums) that held their historical collections to compile the summary  and inventory documents and submit them directly to National NAGPRA.  According to one former National NAGPRA official, in one case the  P.A. Hearst Museum at the University of California, Berkeley was granted  an extension to the 5-year deadline for compiling inventories for their own  collections, and some agencies believed that this extension also applied to  their federal collections held by the museum.", "Additionally, we found that a number of federal agencies have not fully  complied with NAGPRA\u2019s requirement to publish notices of inventory  completion for all of their culturally affiliated human remains and  associated funerary objects in the Federal Register, thereby complicating  efforts of Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations to make  repatriation requests for those items (see table 5). Agency officials  provided several reasons for their lack of compliance with this  requirement. For example, TVA staff stated that, because of personnel  turnover and poor communication\u2014with a repository and with National  NAGPRA in the 1990s\u2014320 human remains preliminarily culturally  affiliated to the Creek and Cherokee tribes have not yet been published in  notices. In addition, an official at BOR\u2019s Great Plains Regional Office  stated that, even though the office had listed culturally affiliated human  remains in its inventory, National NAGPRA rejected the inventory in the  1990s because it was not properly formatted. The BOR official stated that  resources have not been available to revise the inventory and publish the  required notices.", "National NAGPRA and the Makah Indian tribe, with the National  Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers, have conducted  studies to identify culturally affiliated human remains and associated  funerary objects listed in agency NAGPRA inventories but for which no  notices of inventory completion have been published. However, our  analysis has shown that none of these studies has been comprehensive  and complete. National NAGPRA is currently in the process of reconciling  all the inventories submitted with its electronic database in order to  determine which culturally affiliated human remains and associated  funerary objects have not been included in a notice of inventory  completion. Program officials expect this effort to be completed by  October 2010. Until federal agencies have published notices of inventory  completion in the Federal Register for culturally affiliated human remains  and associated funerary objects that they have listed in inventories, items  cannot be repatriated according to the provisions of NAGPRA. Although  National NAGPRA will have more information on the level of compliance  by federal agencies from the reconciliation of data, this may not lead to  improved compliance because NAGPRA and its implementing regulations  do not provide National NAGPRA or any other federal office with  authority to ensure federal agency compliance with the act.

First and foremost, officials at all of the eight key federal agencies that we  spoke with and a December 2009 Interior Inspector General report all  noted that the lack of funding is one of the most significant challenges to  complying with NAGPRA. Officials noted that without funding, their  cultural resources management programs have not been adequately  staffed to comply with NAGPRA. For example, BIA has one curator for the  estimated 5.7 million items in its collections across the entire agency, and  FWS\u2019s Service Archaeologist estimated that it would cost $35 million and  take 28 years to properly review all of FWS\u2019s historical collections for  NAGPRA items. Second, NAGPRA compliance for historical collections is  generally a collateral duty among all the other tasks that agency cultural  resource staff must perform, including section 3 NAGPRA responsibilities  for new intentional excavations and inadvertent discoveries. Officials at  almost all of the eight agencies we reviewed confirmed that compliance  with sections 5 and 6 of NAGPRA for historical collections is a collateral  duty for most federal agency staff that work in this area. For example,  BLM staff stated that their state archaeologists prioritize compliance with  section 3 of NAGPRA, section 106 of the National Historic Preservation  Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. Even the national-level  NAGPRA coordination staff at many agencies, such as BLM, BOR, FWS,  and BIA, told us that they do not spend the majority of their time on  NAGPRA compliance.

National NAGPRA has provided periodic  information to the Review Committee on the quantity of agency and  museum submissions of summaries, inventories, and publications in the  Federal Register. Also in two meetings in the late 1990s, the Review  Committee heard reports from representatives of more than 13 federal  departments and agencies about their efforts to comply with NAGPRA\u2019s  requirements, consult with Indian tribes, and determine the cultural  affiliation of human remains and objects. Officials from some agencies and  museums, including NPS and the Forest Service have also regularly  attended Review Committee meetings and provided updates on their  efforts.

In its annual reports to Congress,  the Review Committee has recommended several amendments to  NAGPRA but none have been enacted to date.

While legislation  has been introduced that would make this change, it has not yet been  enacted. Similarly, in its annual reports to Congress covering 1995 through  2001, the Review Committee recommended that Congress amend  NAGPRA to include language that would protect Native graves on state or  private lands from grave robbing and destructive activities. An amendment  adding this language to NAGPRA has not yet been enacted.

After assisting with the main rule, in 1997, the Review Committee turned  its attention to providing input into the rule addressing the disposition of  culturally unidentifiable human remains (see app. IV for a discussion of  this rule), and in 2002 to the rules addressing civil penalties for  noncompliant museums, and the future applicability rule for newly  recognized tribes and other situations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Review Committee Recommendations on the Disposition of Culturally Unidentifiable Human Remains Were Implemented, but Some Actions Recommended Exceeded NAGPRA\u2019s Scope", "paragraphs": ["Through fiscal year 2009, the Review Committee has made  recommendations to the Secretary on 61 disposition requests for culturally  unidentifiable human remains.

Twenty-two of  the 61 requests involved federal agencies, and 19 of the 22, were fully  implemented. Parties generally agreed in advance to their preferred  manner of disposition and, in accordance with the regulations, came to the  Review Committee to complete the process and obtain a final  recommendation from the Secretary.

According to former Review Committee  members we spoke with, the principles of agreement stated that  appropriate repatriation solutions included the return of human remains  that were culturally unidentifiable for which there was a shared group  identity with a non-federally recognized Indian group. The Review  Committee had concluded that NAGPRA intended and did not prohibit  funerary objects associated with culturally unidentifiable human remains  from being repatriated.", "In instances where human remains were deemed culturally unidentifiable  because they were culturally affiliated to non-federally recognized Indian  groups, Review Committee members believed that it would be  scientifically dishonest to recommend disposition to Native Americans not  culturally affiliated with the human remains, thus they recommended  dispositions to non-recognized Indian groups.", "Review Committee members recommended disposition of objects  accompanying culturally unidentifiable human remains because they had  heard from tribal representatives that it was culturally unacceptable to  separate human remains from the objects buried with them.", "Some members lacked strong knowledge of the complexities of the law.", "Although attorneys with Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor attend Review  Committee meetings and provide legal advice, one attorney stated that the  Solicitor\u2019s Office allowed Review Committee members wide leeway with  regard to their recommendations because the Committee\u2019s  recommendations are not binding.", "Nevertheless, we found that the Review Committee has not recommended  dispositions to a non-federally recognized Indian group since 2001, and the  Review Committee, National NAGPRA, and Interior officials have  generally addressed the issue of the Review Committee recommending  actions that are outside the scope of NAGPRA. First, for the culturally  unidentifiable associated funerary objects, since 2008, letters from the  Designated Federal Officer to the affected parties informing them of the  Review Committee\u2019s recommendations have included the stipulation that  NAGPRA does not authorize disposition of these objects. The letters state  that a federal agency or museum may choose to repatriate such objects  under other authorities they may have. Under the recently issued rule on  the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains, agencies may  repatriate these objects if state or federal law does not preclude it.  Further, an attorney with Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor reported  advising the Review Committee of this in the late 1990s. Second, according  to National NAGPRA officials, since the fall of 2008, the Designated  Federal Officer has requested that all parties seeking Review Committee  consideration describe the issue that they wish to present. The officer  reports using this information to help determine what type of issue is  being presented and whether the issue is outside the scope of NAGPRA  and therefore ineligible for consideration. In addition, with regard to tribal  coalitions, attorneys with Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor told us that they  believe NAGPRA authorizes repatriations to coalitions of tribes as long as  agency or museum records indicate that actual repatriation was made to a  federally recognized tribe.", "We also found that, through January 2007, letters from the Review  Committee\u2019s Designated Federal Officer to the parties receiving a  recommendation did not clearly indicate whether the Secretary of the  Interior\u2019s recommendation was the result of an independent assessment of  the facts, NAGPRA, and the Review Committee\u2019s recommendations. The  importance of whether the Secretary\u2019s recommendation is the result of  Interior\u2019s independent assessment of the request is two-fold. First, the  Review Committee is advisory and its recommendations cannot bind the  Department or the parties. Second, NAGPRA regulations require that  agencies and museums retain possession of culturally unidentifiable  human remains pending promulgation of an applicable regulation, unless  legally required to do otherwise, or recommended to do otherwise by the  Secretary. An attorney with Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor confirmed to  us that the Secretary\u2019s recommendation reflects Interior\u2019s independent  assessment of the disposition requests for culturally unidentifiable human  remains, and the Review Committee\u2019s recommendations. However, we  found that letters sent between 1994 and January 2007 did not clearly state  that the Secretary had considered the facts or whether the Secretary had  independently assessed the requests in concurring with the Review  Committee recommendation. Letters sent since January 2007 have  clarified the Secretary\u2019s independent assessment of and concurrence with  the Review Committee\u2019s recommendations and in two cases stated that  Interior disagreed in part with the Review Committee\u2019s recommendation  and did not recommend disposition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Review Committee Recommendations on Disputes Were Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to the amicable nature of disposition requests, disputes are  generally contentious and the Review Committee\u2019s recommendations have  had a low implementation rate.

This has led some to question the Committee\u2019s objectivity.

From  2006 through 2009, the Review Committee regularly reported that the lack  of data prevented it from assessing whether required consultations  between Indian tribes and federal agencies were taking place. Further, in  its annual report covering 2008, the Review Committee requested that  Congress hold open hearings for agencies, as well as museums and tribes  to provide the Review Committee and other stakeholders with more  information on the challenges that NAGPRA practitioners have  encountered. National NAGPRA officials noted that in addition to the  biennial reports provided to the Review Committee on the status of  NAGPRA compliance, National NAGPRA also produced a 2006 report on  the status of Native American human remains in the control of federal  agencies.", "Limited resources.

National NAGPRA\u2019s inclusion of ANCSA  corporations in its list of Indian tribes does not appear to be consistent  with Interior\u2019s legal and policy positions regarding the status of Alaska  Native villages and ANCSA corporations. Specifically, the inconsistency  stems from the inclusion of village, regional, group, and urban  corporations established pursuant to ANCSA that are not on BIA\u2019s list of  federally recognized Indian tribes or the modified ANCSA list of Alaska  Native villages.", "NAGPRA\u2019s enactment and National NAGPRA\u2019s original development of the  list of Indian tribes for the purpose of carrying out NAGPRA coincided  with an ongoing debate within Interior about the status of ANCSA  corporations. Although BIA currently does not recognize any of the  ANCSA corporations as eligible for the special programs and services  provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians,  at various times they have been included in BIA\u2019s list of federally  recognized tribes. For example, in 1982\u2014the first time Alaska Native  entities were included in the BIA list\u2014the ANCSA corporations were  excluded because they are not governments. However, the 1988 BIA list  included ANCSA corporations, raising a number of questions with respect  to the effects of the list, as BIA later recognized. After a 1993 legal opinion  by the Solicitor that concluded that ANCSA corporations do not qualify as  Indian tribes for the purposes of federal law, BIA published a revised list  in 1993 that did not include any ANCSA corporations. Subsequent lists also  have not included ANCSA corporations. Accordingly, BIA has not  recognized and does not treat ANCSA corporations as federally recognized  tribes.", "Moreover, none of the ANCSA corporations are included in the modified  ANCSA list of Alaska Native villages. The Solicitor has noted that a  number of post-ANCSA statutes, such as NAGPRA, have included Alaska  Native villages within their definition of Indian tribe by reference to the  ANCSA definition of Native village and that these references are to this  modified ANCSA list. Therefore, the inclusion of ANCSA corporations in  National NAGPRA\u2019s list is at odds with the Solicitor\u2019s legal position that  the Alaska Native villages on the modified ANCSA list are Indian tribes for  purposes of federal law.

We identified similar, albeit fewer, problems in the 1996 and 2000  nominating rounds. As a result of this improper screening, the Secretary  has appointed members who were nominated by ineligible entities several  times since 1991.", "National NAGPRA has taken steps to improve the screening process. For  example, in its April 2002 Federal Register notice soliciting nominations,  National NAGPRA included the requirements for both nominators and  nominees and required submission of additional information with  nominations. Specifically, the notice required (1) nominations submitted  by Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations to be signed by the  leader of the tribe or organization and (2) that traditional religious leaders  making nominations identify themselves as such. It also clearly stated that  nominations from other individual tribal members could not be  considered. Also, beginning in 2002, National NAGPRA began to confirm  the status of Native American traditional religious leaders, both as  nominators and nominees, by contacting both sources to verify this  information. The June 2003 nomination notice further required that  nominations from Indian tribes or museum and scientific organizations  include a statement indicating that the official is authorized to make the  nomination. Moreover, it required that nominations from traditional  Native American religious leaders include a statement by the nominator  that the nominee is a traditional Native American religious leader. The  August 2006 nomination notice further required that the nominator explain  how he or she meets the definition of traditional religious leader.", "Despite National NAGPRA\u2019s efforts to improve the screening process,  some issues still remain. For example, two nominees forwarded to the  Secretary recently were nominated by ineligible individuals or entities. In  the first case, an individual was nominated by a tribe\u2019s director of cultural  resources and the nomination letter did not include a statement that the  director was authorized by the tribe to make the nomination. This  individual was appointed by the Secretary and currently serves on the  Review Committee. After we brought this issue to their attention, National  NAGPRA officials contacted the tribe and obtained an official letter from  the chairman of the tribe supporting the individual\u2019s nomination. In the  other case, a nomination was made by a non-federally recognized tribe.  Interior officials confirmed that nominations must be submitted by a  federally recognized tribe. Again, we alerted National NAGPRA to this  issue, and officials responded that although the individual\u2019s name was on  the list sent to the Secretary, he was not actually considered because he  was not eligible.", "In addition to its lack of adequate screening of nominating entities,  National NAGPRA has also bypassed the nomination process by  essentially making its own nominations. In one case in 2004, National  NAGPRA actively recruited a nominee and the nominee accepted the offer  6 months after the deadline for submitting nominations had passed.  National NAGPRA then sought and received permission from a nominating  entity to use a 7-year-old nomination for the current nominating round  even though the entity had already nominated a different individual in  response to the solicitation. The Secretary appointed the individual  recruited and recommended by National NAGPRA. According to an  Interior official involved in this recruitment effort, National NAGPRA  became involved in recruiting efforts because the Federal Register  solicitations had garnered an inadequate pool of nominees, and some  National NAGPRA officials believed that the Review Committee had  become too weighted toward the interests of the museum and scientific  communities and was seeking an individual more favorable to tribal  interests. In addition to this case, we identified two other instances in 2005  and 2006 where National NAGPRA recruited nominees. Both were  appointed to the Review Committee. The National NAGPRA Program  Manager pointed out that in these latter two instances, the nominees  initiated the contact and pursued the position.", "The lack of adequate screening and recruitment issues surrounding the  nomination process has damaged the credibility of both National NAGPRA  and the Review Committee and has contributed to the perception of a lack  of objectivity cited by some museum officials and Review Committee  members that we interviewed. For example, several Review Committee  members said that the appointment process is not transparent and fair and  some, referred to it as a \u201cblack box\u201d because they are not aware of what  happens to nominations once they are submitted to National NAGPRA.  The National NAGPRA Program Manager clarified that current policy is to  collect and forward all of the nomination submissions, to the NPS Policy  Office and subsequently to the Secretary of the Interior for further review."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Many NAGPRA Items Have Been Repatriated, but Repatriations Are Not Tracked or Reported Governmentwide", "paragraphs": ["According to agency data and our survey results, a total of 55 percent of  human remains and 68 percent of associated funerary objects have been  repatriated as of September 30, 2009.

Of the federal agencies  that have published notices of inventory completion, only three have  tracked and compiled agencywide data on their repatriations. These three  agencies, however, along with other federal agencies that have published  notices of inventory completion, do not regularly report comprehensive  data on their repatriations to National NAGPRA, the Review Committee, or  Congress. Agency officials identified several reasons why some human  remains and associated funerary objects have not been repatriated,  including a lack of a repatriation request from a culturally affiliated entity,  repatriation requests from disputing parties, a lack of reburial sites, and a  lack of financial resources to complete the repatriation.

In addition, through fiscal  year 2009, TVA has not published any notices of inventory completion and  as a result, it has not repatriated any Native American human remains or  associated funerary objects.", "One of NAGPRA\u2019s purposes was to set up a process by which federal  agencies and museums receiving federal funds would inventory their  holdings and work with culturally affiliated Indian tribes and Native  Hawaiian organizations to repatriate certain Native American human  remains and objects in their historical collections. However, as noted in  the data above only three of the eight key agencies with significant  historical collections presently consolidate agencywide data on the extent  of their repatriations. In addition, as they are not required to do so, these  agencies and others generally do not regularly report comprehensive  repatriation data by notice to National NAGPRA, the Review Committee,  or Congress. Therefore, policymakers do not have an overall sense of  how federal agency repatriation of NAGPRA items is progressing.  Similarly, Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations do not have  readily available information on which human remains and objects have  been culturally affiliated with them but have not been repatriated.  Regulations implementing NAGPRA require that federal agencies and  museums must permanently document the content and recipients of all  repatriations, but do not require museums and agencies to compile these  data and make them available to the public or to National NAGPRA.", "Because neither National NAGPRA nor the Review Committee receive this  information, they cannot include it in their annual reports. Without  repatriation data, we believe that National NAGPRA, the Review  Committee, and Congress are lacking valuable information on the progress  of NAGPRA implementation toward the overall goal of returning control of  human remains and objects to affiliated groups.", "The 2008 report on NAGPRA implementation by the Makah Indian tribe  and the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers found  that Congress has no means of periodically assessing the effectiveness of  NAGPRA implementation. The report recommended that federal agencies  and National NAGPRA compile information on all completed repatriations  reported by agencies and that National NAGPRA develop a database to  hold this information.", "National NAGPRA has started a \u201cCulturally Affiliated Native American  Inventories Database,\u201d which is to provide a snapshot on the current  status of human remains and associated funerary objects that have been  culturally affiliated as a result of consultation with Indian tribes and  Native Hawaiian organizations. National NAGPRA reports that all the  human remains and objects that are eventually listed in this database  should be represented in a notice of inventory completion. National  NAGPRA reported that the database was 75 percent complete as of  April 1, 2010, and expected it to be fully populated by summer 2010.  Completion of the database would provide reports on the minimum  number of individuals culturally affiliated but not yet in notices. Because  data on completed repatriations of culturally affiliated remains and objects  are already being documented by federal agencies, and National NAGPRA  already tracks the number of human remains and objects listed in each  notice, National NAGPRA staff told us that they could include the  repatriation status of the items appearing in each inventory and notice in  their database. National NAGPRA staff could collect voluntary repatriation  data from all agencies to provide a consolidated report, but there were no  specific plans or time frames for this."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some NAGPRA Items Have Not Been Repatriated Due to a Lack of Tribal Requests, Tribal Disputes, and Availability of Reburial Sites", "paragraphs": ["A total of 7,401 human remains and 61,198 associated funerary objects  published in a notice of inventory completion had not been repatriated as  of September 30, 2009. Repatriations did not occur for a variety of reasons.", "The most common reason that repatriations did not occur is that the  culturally affiliated Indian tribe(s) or Native Hawaiian organization(s) did  not make a request for the return of the human remains and associated  funerary objects, according to agency NAGPRA program officials and our  survey results. For example, Forest Service NAGPRA staff told us that the  most significant challenge to repatriations has been the lack of requests  from culturally affiliated entities. They noted that tribes are often not  prepared to deal with repatriation for a variety of reasons. In some cases,  Forest Service, NPS, and tribal officials told us that tribes lack cultural  protocols to deal with NAGPRA, and specific cultural protocols and new  ceremonies need to be developed before a request or transfer of human  remains and objects can be made. Responses to our survey of 12 agencies  to obtain the repatriation status of human remains and associated funerary  objects included in 147 notices of inventory completion show that the lack  of a request from culturally-affiliated Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations has prevented repatriations of human remains in 25 percent  of the cases.", "Another reason repatriations did not occur is because, in some cases,  multiple competing repatriation requests were received, and the federal  agency could not clearly determine which requesting party is the most  appropriate. Section 7(e) of NAGPRA provides that in these situations the  federal agency may retain the item until the requesting parties reach  agreement on its disposition or the dispute is resolved under NAGPRA\u2019s  provisions or in court. For example, in a case involving human remains  that represent approximately 1,400 individuals removed from the Tonto  National Forest in Arizona, there is a disagreement among some of the  culturally affiliated tribes over the place and manner of the final  disposition of the human remains. According to the Forest Service,  because this involves differing cultural views among culturally affiliated  tribes, it is leaving the matter to the tribes to resolve. As a result, the  repatriation cannot proceed until the disagreement is resolved.", "The availability of an acceptable burial site is also an important reason  why some repatriations were not completed promptly. This has been  challenging, in part, due to the federal agencies\u2019 reburial policies on their  lands, which have varied over time. Most of the key federal agencies that  manage land where NAGPRA items were found currently have policies  that allow the reburial of the remains and objects on the land they manage  (see table 10). BOR does not allow reburial on land that it manages. Tribes  have cited the lack of reburial sites as a challenge to repatriation.", "The lack of financial resources may also prevent or delay repatriations.  Repatriations may involve a variety of expenses, including preparing a  reburial site, transporting the items from their present location to the  reburial site, access roads, grave markers and security measures,  preparation of remains, and travel expenses of tribal officials involved  with the reburial. For example, officials from the Confederated Tribes of  the Umatilla Reservation said that funding for repatriation work is their  largest challenge. They said that one of the few sources of relief is  National NAGPRA grants, but that these grants are difficult to get. The  Caddo Nation historic preservation staff also told us that their office relies  on federal grants to carry out NAGPRA repatriation work and said more  funding is needed. In their 2008 report on NAGPRA implementation, the  Makah Indian tribe and the National Association of Tribal Historic  Preservation Officers recommended Congress provide more funding at the  federal and tribal levels. They found that many Indian tribes or Native  Hawaiian organizations do not have resources for training or repatriation  activities. As previously mentioned, the Review Committee has also  recommended additional funding for the grant program. The National  NAGPRA program has awarded an average of $53,893 annually in  repatriation grants to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations.  On average about six tribes per year receive these grants to help with  expenses associated with repatriating NAGPRA items from museums.  Repatriation grants are not available to tribes for repatriations from  federal agencies, according to National NAGPRA staff.", "The key federal agencies that we reviewed had different policies on the  extent to which they would fund repatriation expenses and reburial of  items from their historical collections (see table 11). For example, the  Corps\u2019 policy includes a specific list of allowed expenditures, while BIA  and FWS have no formal policy but will fund some expenses on a  case-by-case basis.

An agency official said that almost all of these  repatriations will proceed because, in accordance with NAGPRA, the  notices are based on the summaries, the agency already had consulted and  culturally affiliated the items, and that an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian  organization had made a repatriation claim prior to the publication of the  notice of intent to repatriate.

The difficulty  of the task was compounded at some agencies by overall poor  management and oversight of their museum collections over the years.  NAGPRA compliance was generally assigned to cultural resources staff as  a collateral duty, and trying to resolve the status of an item that the agency  may have had for over 100 years was frequently a low priority when  weighed against more immediate deadlines. While the act authorizes the  Secretary of the Interior to assess civil penalties against museums for  noncompliance, no enforcement mechanism exists to ensure federal  agency compliance except through litigation by private parties. Despite  the fact that key federal agencies have now had almost 20 years to comply  with the act, they still have not fully complied. Furthermore, it is difficult  for policymakers to determine how much work the federal agencies have  left to achieve full compliance because the agencies generally do not have  an estimate of the remaining work nor their needs for staff and resources  to complete their NAGPRA activities for their historical collections.", "In the cases where the federal agencies have completed inventories with  culturally affiliated human remains and associated funerary items, much of  the compliance work has already been accomplished. However, for a  variety of reasons, over the years, the publication of notices of inventory  completion for some of these items in the Federal Register did not occur.  Until agencies publish notices of inventory completion for the remaining  culturally affiliated human remains and associated funerary objects in the  Federal Register, they cannot be repatriated.", "NAGPRA\u2019s enactment and National NAGPRA\u2019s original development of the  list of Indian tribes for the purpose of carrying out NAGPRA coincided  with an ongoing debate within Interior about the status of ANCSA  corporations. However, Interior\u2019s Solicitor has since clarified the status of  the ANCSA corporations, and they are no longer on BIA\u2019s list of federally  recognized tribes. Accordingly, the rationale for National NAGPRA  continuing to include them as Indian tribes for the purpose of carrying out  NAGPRA is unclear.", "Because repatriation involves addressing both the interests of Native  Americans who want the remains of their ancestors and their cultural and  sacred objects returned to them and the scientific and research interests  of museums, it is important that all sides continue to be fully engaged in  the process and it is important that the Review Committee and National  NAGPRA be viewed as objective, balanced, and fair. In setting up the  Review Committee with three members nominated from each side, the act  tried to balance the interests of Native Americans and museums. However,  actions by National NAGPRA have fueled concerns about not only its but  also the Review Committee\u2019s objectivity and transparency, especially  through the inappropriate interference in the nomination process and  failing to ensure that all the nominations considered for appointment meet  the act\u2019s requirements.", "In addition, data on repatriations are not centrally tracked and reported or  readily available to affected Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations. As a result, neither National NAGPRA nor the Review  Committee can report this information in their annual reports to Congress.  Without this information, policymakers cannot assess the overall  effectiveness of the act. Furthermore, not making this information readily  accessible to Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations is an  impediment to repatriation because a list of published items not yet  repatriated would allow tribes to easily identify items that have been  affiliated to them and allow them to request more information and, in turn,  perhaps request repatriation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following five recommendations to improve NAGPRA  implementation:  To enhance federal agency NAGPRA compliance, we recommend that the  Secretaries of Agriculture, Defense, and the Interior, and the Chief  Executive Officer of the Tennessee Valley Authority direct their cultural  resource management programs to develop and provide to Congress    a needs assessment listing specific actions, resources, and time needed to  complete the inventories and summaries required by NAGPRA sections 5  and 6 for their historical collections; and   a timetable for the expeditious publication in the Federal Register of  notices of inventory completion for all remaining Native American human  remains and associated funerary objects that have been culturally  affiliated in inventories.", "To clarify which entities are eligible under NAGPRA, we recommend that  National NAGPRA, in conjunction with Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor,  reassess whether ANCSA corporations should be considered as eligible  entities for the purposes of carrying out NAGPRA given the Solicitor\u2019s  opinion and BIA policy concerning the status of ANCSA corporations.", "To improve the confidence in the Review Committee and its support  among NAGPRA practitioners, we recommend the Secretary of the  Interior direct National NAGPRA to strictly adhere to the nomination  process prescribed in the act and, working with Interior\u2019s Office of the  Solicitor as appropriate, ensure that all Review Committee nominations  are properly screened to confirm that the nominees and nominating  entities meet statutory requirements.", "To provide policymakers with information to assess the overall  effectiveness of the act and to provide Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations readily accessible information on items that are available for  repatriation, we recommend that the Secretaries of Agriculture, Defense,  the Interior, and the Chief Executive Officer of the Tennessee Valley  Authority direct their cultural resource management programs to report  their repatriation data to National NAGPRA on a regular basis, but no less  than annually, for each notice of inventory completion they have or will  publish.

The definition of \u201cIndian tribe\u201d in the  NAGPRA regulations published in 1995 included ANCSA corporations,  even though Interior\u2019s Solicitor and BIA had previously determined that  the ANCSA corporations are not federally recognized tribes. Moreover, at  various points in the past 20 years, ANCSA corporations have been  included in National NAGPRA\u2019s list of Indian tribes for the purposes of  carrying out NAGPRA and have been treated as eligible to make  nominations for the Review Committee, receive NAGPRA grants, and  make repatriation requests and claims. For example, on October 27, 1997,  National NAGPRA updated its list and ANCSA corporations were included  in it. In addition, prior to that list\u2019s publication, ANCSA corporations had  made nominations for the Review Committee, received NAGPRA grants,  and been the recipients of at least four separate repatriations.

After we discussed the issue with National NAGPRA  and the Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor, National NAGPRA removed the  ANCSA corporations from the list in May 2010. However, a notice of  inventory completion published on May 4, 2010, stated that repatriation of  human remains to an ANCSA corporation would proceed unless other  claimants came forward.

We reviewed NAGPRA and its  implementing regulations in 43 C.F.R. Part 10 and the final rule on the  disposition of culturally unidentified human remains published recently in  the Federal Register. For each agency we reviewed records on NAGPRA  compliance, such as inventories, summaries, Federal Register notices,  consultations, and agreements with Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian  organizations, collection records and repatriation forms or letters, other  correspondence, agency databases, if any, and the National NAGPRA  database and paper files. To check the reliability of the data on published  notices in the National NAGPRA database (officially called \u201cNAGPRA 20\u201d),  we compiled this data into one table and compared it to actual notices of  inventory completion and notices of intent to repatriate published in the  Federal Register. Of the 419 notices contained in the table we created  using NAGPRA 20 data, we found a small number of data entry errors that  we corrected. This data provides the basis for overall statistics on the  program and the universe of notices for which we needed to seek  repatriation data because not all of the agencies involved tracked and  reported it.", "Considering that NAGPRA implementation happens at field locations  around the country as well as at headquarters, we planned visits to some  of these locations.

During our review we maintained an open door policy and we  accommodated any Indian tribe, museum, organization, or Review  Committee member that wanted to meet with us or provide information in  writing. As a result, our methodology was supplemented by meetings with  additional Indian tribes, museums, and Review Committee members that  approached us on an ad hoc basis. While we had specific discussion topics  for each of these interviews related to one or more of our four objectives,  we did not impose a limit on the topics that could be discussed.

The database  contained the dates that National NAGPRA received inventories and  summaries from federal agencies and museums. To assess whether  summaries and inventories were generally prepared on time by agencies  we did the following. We determined that because the NAGPRA database  did not contain the date that the documents were prepared, it was only  partially useful for determining compliance with the statutory deadlines.  Therefore, if the summaries and inventories were received by National  NAGPRA before and near the statutory deadline, we determined that the  documents had been completed in compliance with the act. We also  reviewed agency files and interviewed agency officials in the eight key  agencies involved in our review for information on timeliness.

In addition, we assessed the reliability of relevant fields in the  tables for summaries and inventories in the database by electronically  testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, reviewing  information about the data and the system that produced them, and  interviewing National NAGPRA officials knowledgeable about the data.  When we found logical inconsistencies in the data, we clarified these with  National NAGPRA officials before conducting our analyses. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  using several fields related to when agencies submitted inventories and  summaries. However, we found the database to be unreliable for purposes  of tracking culturally unidentifiable human remains and objects because  the items entered into the culturally unidentifiable portion of the NAGPRA  20 database are not deleted when they are affiliated. Rather, in some  cases, a notation is made in the notes field. We analyzed text recorded in  the notes fields of the inventory data to assess whether human remains  and objects listed as culturally unidentifiable had been culturally affiliated.", "In addition to Inspector General, and other reports, we considered  relevant reports identified in literature searches or recommended by  NAGPRA experts, including a study by a National NAGPRA intern, the  Corps\u2019 Mandatory Center for Expertise for the Curation and Management  of Archeological Collections, several academic journal articles and other  materials concerning the curation of archeological collections, NAGPRA  implementation, and cultural resource management.", "To track agency compliance with NAGPRA, we reviewed each agency\u2019s  records at headquarters and the field, such as inventories, summaries,  Federal Register notices, and other documents. On our site visits, we  interviewed national, regional, state, and local agency staff about their  implementation of NAGPRA, in particular about the procedures they  followed to identify their historical NAGPRA collections, to determine  their level of confidence with their identification of NAGPRA items in their  archeological collections. Our analysis is based both on the testimonial  evidence and documents from agencies supplemented by Inspector  General reports. In addition, we interviewed selected tribal and museum  officials for their views on these efforts.", "In order to identify cases in which human remains and associated funerary  objects that were culturally affiliated in agency inventories, but not yet  published in Federal Register notices, we examined information from  three sources: (1) the June 2008 report by the Makah Indian tribe and the  National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers, (2) a report  on the topic by a National NAGPRA intern, and (3) inventory data from  NPS\u2019s \u201cNAGPRA 20\u201d database. We could not rely on National NAGPRA  data alone because it was incomplete. We created a list of federal agency  units mentioned in two or three of these reports, and then examined  records at National NAGPRA offices, including the original inventories and  published notices of inventory completion, to determine which units had  in fact not published the relevant notices. In order to reduce the risk of  undercounting, we examined the full agency-submitted inventories for  each of the agency units listed in our examples. Through our analysis,  we discovered that some agency units were listed erroneously in previous  reports because of typing errors, or because the affiliated human remains  had actually been correctly published in notices of intended disposition.", "To address our second objective to determine the actions taken by the  Review Committee to fulfill its role under NAGPRA and the challenges it  faces, we analyzed the Committee\u2019s annual reports to Congress, meeting  minutes, and reports by National NAGPRA.

We  interviewed current and former Review Committee members and Nationa NAGPRA officials to learn more about the Review Committee\u2019s activitiesand the extent and quality of the support provided by National NA GPRA.  We attended two Review Committee meetings (Seattle, Washington, in  May 2009, and Sarasota, Florida, in October 2009) and observed an online  training course on the role of the Review Committee in February 2010.", "To understand primary functions of the Review Committee\u2014 recommendations in cases of (1) requests for dispositions of culturally  unidentifiable human remains and in (2) disputes\u2014we reviewed files  maintained by National NAGPRA on behalf of the Review Committee.", "We reviewed Federal Register notices describing the Review Committee\u2019s  findings of fact and recommendations with regard to these disputes and  requests for disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains.  We interviewed officials with Interior\u2019s Office of the Solicitor and National  NAGPRA about the role of the Review Committee on behalf of the  Department of the Interior. With respect to dispositions, we examined  letters from the designated federal officer informing interested parties of  the Committee\u2019s recommendations to determine the extent of the  department\u2019s independent review of and concurrence with the  recommendations. Based on the sources above, we determined that for  dispositions, the Review Committee issued distinct recommendations  regarding particular culturally unidentifiable human remains in 61 cases.  National NAGPRA reports that the Committee considered 66 requests  related to culturally unidentifiable human remains as of September 30,  2009. National NAGPRA listed some of these requests with additional  subparts because the Committee considered the facts of the request at  more than one meeting. In one case, the Committee issued distinct  recommendations for each of two subparts, so we counted that request as  two cases. We reviewed all the requests and subparts and determined that  the Committee issued distinct recommendations 67 times. To focus our  analysis on requests related to the disposition of particular culturally  unidentifiable human remains we excluded 6 requests from our analysis.  In 2 of these, the Committee recommended approval of a protocol, and no  particular culturally unidentifiable human remains were involved. In 3 of  these, the Committee deferred issuing a recommendation, and 1 request  involved only objects (no human remains). Thus, we analyzed 61 cases  where the Review Committee made distinct recommendations regarding  the disposition of particular culturally unidentifiable human remains.  We determined the status of Review Committee recommendations in  disposition cases, and disputes by contacting officials with the involved  museums and federal agencies, and reviewing documents they provided.", "We identified challenges that the Review Committee faces and the  perceptions of the Review Committee through interviews of current and  former Review Committee members, officials from museum and scientific  organizations, Indian tribes, and tribal organizations.", "To address our third objective to determine the actions National NAGPRA  has taken to facilitate federal agency implementation of NAGPRA, we  reviewed the act and its implementing regulations for the duties assigned  to National NAGPRA, as delegated to it by the Secretary of the Interior.  We interviewed National NAGPRA staff, including the Program Manager  and staff responsible for publishing notices, administering the Review  Committee, running the grants program, and developing and maintaining  National NAGPRA\u2019s databases. To learn more about Interior\u2019s decision to  include Alaska Native corporations in the definition of Indian tribe, as  provided for in the regulations, we interviewed staff from Interior\u2019s Office  of the Solicitor, reviewed Review Committee meeting minutes and  transcripts, and analyzed National NAGPRA\u2019s \u201cList of Indian tribes for the  purposes of carrying out NAGPRA and Native Hawaiian organizations that  have appeared in notices.\u201d With regard to National NAGPRA\u2019s actions  regarding the nomination process we reviewed files on the 14 times  nominations were solicited for Review Committee openings since  NAGPRA was enacted.", "We reviewed NPS budget justifications for the NAGPRA program as well  as National NAGPRA annual reports. We reviewed a table developed by  National NAGPRA that provided information on 79 draft notices  withdrawn by museums (55) and federal agencies (24). We used this  information, along with supporting documents, to determine the status of  the 24 draft notices withdrawn by federal agencies. We obtained and  reviewed data on the grants program and interviewed three grants  panelists to understand the grants process. We determined that the grants  data was sufficiently reliable to provide a table with key grants data over  time by Indian tribe and museum, including numbers of applications  submitted and awarded and the funding requested and awarded. We  attended two online training courses (i.e., webinars) presented by National  NAGPRA\u2014one on notices provided in January 2010 and one on the  Review Committee provided in February 2010\u2014and discussed students\u2019  training evaluations with National NAGPRA staff to learn more about the  training program. In addition, we attended the NAGPRA Basics day-long  training sessions before the Review Committee\u2019s meeting in Seattle,  Washington, (May 2009) and Sarasota, Florida, (October 2009). We  reviewed information contained on the National NAGPRA Web site,  including the various databases provided.", "For our fourth objective to determine the extent to which federal agencies  have reported repatriating Native American human remains and objects  for notices of inventory completion published in the Federal Register, we  obtained data from the three agencies that track their repatriations\u2014the  Corps, the Forest Service, and NPS. For the other five key federal agencies  and others publishing NAGPRA notices of inventory completion, we  determined that there were no readily available sources of data on their  repatriations. We have examined the reliability of the data from the  three agencies that reported on repatriations and the data from National  NAGPRA database. We interviewed agency staff that compiled the data on  their methods and checks for accuracy to assess reliability of the data.", "We deployed a survey asking contacts in four key agencies and eight other  agencies with published notices that did not collect data about whether  the number of human remains or associated funerary objects included in  each notice of inventory completion had actually been repatriated through  fiscal year 2009, and if not, why not. We did not survey TVA because they  had not published any notices of inventory completion through fiscal year  2009. We sent initial notification emails to test e-mail addresses. We also  notified agency contacts by e-mail on how to access the survey and asked  for responses within 2 weeks. After the survey had been available for  2 weeks, we reminded respondents by e-mail to complete surveys, and  followed the e-mail with personal phone calls beginning a few days later.  Through these efforts we obtained a 99 percent response rate.  Respondents filled in surveys on 145 of 147 published notices of inventory  completion. Because this survey was not based on a sample, there were no  sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as non-sampling  errors. For example, difficulties in how a particular question is interpreted,  in the sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how  the data were entered into a database or were analyzed can introduce  unwanted variability into the survey results. We took steps in the  development of the questionnaire, the data collection, and the data  analysis to minimize these non-sampling errors. For instance, a survey  specialist designed the questionnaire in collaboration with GAO staff that  have subject-matter expertise. Further, the draft questionnaire was  pretested with a number of agency officials to ensure that the questions  were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend. When the data were  analyzed, a second, independent analyst checked all computer programs.", "We also sought information on the challenges to repatriation of human  remains or objects through interviews and documents from agency  officials, and from representatives of Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations. In addition, we asked agency officials for their policies on  reburial of human remains and objects on their lands and the extent to  which the agency would assist tribes with the expenses of repatriation\u2014as  both were identified as factors affecting the ability of native groups to  accept repatriations and rebury remains and objects. We sought data on  the extent of National NAGPRA grants to tribes for the purposes of  repatriation.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2009 to July 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

As discussed in the background section of this report, amid conflict of  interest concerns, the Secretary separated the functions of National  NAGPRA into Park NAGPRA, to handle NPS compliance, and National  NAGPRA, to facilitate NAGPRA implementation governmentwide. After  this separation, National and Park NAGPRA were housed in different  places within NPS and reported up a separate chain of command. Some  believe there is still a conflict of interest in having National NAGPRA  housed within NPS, as it is also an agency that must comply with the act.

They note that the committee report accompanying the  version of the bill debated on the House floor stated that the House  Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs looks forward to the Review  Committee\u2019s recommendations on the process for disposition of culturally  unidentifiable human remains. Second, museums and scientific  organizations argued that NAGPRA clearly limited repatriation to human  remains that could be culturally affiliated because the act balanced the  interests of Indian tribes and Native Hawaiians with those of museums and  scientists. In their view, the rule impermissibly expands the scope of the  act.", "Indian tribes either did not comment on Interior\u2019s statutory authority or  stated that they believed the rule was authorized. One tribe noted that  25 U.S.C. \u00a7 9 authorizes the President to prescribe such regulations as he  may think fit for carrying into effect the various provisions of any act  relating to Indian affairs and that Congress has routinely delegated broad  authority to the Executive Branch to manage Indian affairs. Based on  these other laws and NAGPRA\u2019s language and structure, this tribe argued  that the culturally unidentifiable rule is authorized as long as the rule was  consistent with and not precluded by the plain language of the act.  Furthermore, the tribe stated that the culturally unidentifiable rule was  plainly designed to carry out the act, reasonably related to the act\u2019s  purposes, and not precluded by the act.", "Interior contends that section 13 of NAGPRA, which authorizes Interior to  promulgate regulations implementing the act, provides the statutory  authority for the rule. The preamble to the final rule explains that  section (8)(c)(5) of the act made the Review Committee responsible for  recommending specific actions for developing a process for disposition of  culturally unidentifiable human remains because Congress anticipated that  not all items could be geographically or culturally affiliated with an Indian  tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. Therefore, Interior interpreted the  intent of Congress as authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to  promulgate regulations governing the disposition of culturally  unidentifiable human remains after considering the Review Committee\u2019s  recommendations.", "Interior has noted that an earlier version of the bill that became NAGPRA  directed the Review Committee to provide its recommendations regarding  the disposition of culturally unidentifiable human remains to the Secretary  and Congress. However, the language regarding the Secretary and  Congress was subsequently stricken from the bill. Interior has interpreted  this sequence of changes and the act\u2019s requirement that the Secretary  consult with the Review Committee in the development of regulations as  authorizing Interior to promulgate regulations governing the disposition of  culturally unidentifiable human remains after considering the Review  Committee\u2019s recommendations on the matter. Moreover, Interior has  stated that even if Congress did not expressly delegate authority or  responsibility to implement a particular provision or fill a particular gap in  the act, it can still be apparent from an agency\u2019s generally conferred  authority and other statutory directives that Congress would expect the  agency to be able to speak with the force of law when the agency  addresses ambiguities in the statute or fills a gap in the enacted law.", "In addition, Interior notes that 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 9 authorizes the Secretary to  make such regulations as he may think fit for carrying into effect the  various provisions of any act relating to Indian Affairs.

Some museums questioned the imposition  of this extra burden of consultation because National NAGPRA\u2019s online  database of culturally unidentifiable human remains contains sufficient  information for Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations to submit  requests. Interior has said that this provision restates the consultation  required under section 5 of the act and 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.9, which requires  museums and federal agencies to consult with Indian tribes from whose  tribal lands the human remains and associated funerary objects originated,  that are or are likely to be culturally affiliated to the remains and objects,  and from whose aboriginal lands the humans and objects originated while  preparing their inventories.

Museums argued that NAGPRA\u2019s  definition of right of possession ignores state property laws that give  museums legal title to human remains and items removed from private  property with the consent of landowners. Because museums have legal  title to these human remains and items, these groups argue that the return  of culturally unidentifiable human remains would violate the Takings  Clause of the Constitution. Museums and scientific organizations also  note that this rule would deprive the world of scientific information on the  biological and cultural development of humans and would impact many  museums\u2019 ability to educate the public about these issues.", "Interior has noted that NAGPRA\u2019s definition of right of possession created  an ownership presumption and that as a federal law it would preempt any  state property law on the same subject matter under the Supremacy  Clause of the Constitution. Interior also observed that the regulatory  requirement to offer to transfer control of culturally unidentifiable human  remains did not apply in circumstances where a court of competent  jurisdiction has determined that the repatriation of the human remains in  the possession or control of a museum would result in a taking of property  without just compensation within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.", "In addition to the right of possession issue, some museums and scientific  organizations also assert that the final rule requires museums and federal  agencies to offer to transfer control of culturally unidentifiable human  remains absent any request or claim from an Indian tribe or Native  Hawaiian organization. These museums and scientific organizations state  that this requirement is inconsistent with NAGPRA and greatly exceeds  the statute\u2019s scope because the act\u2019s requirement to repatriate culturally  affiliated human remains and objects is triggered only upon a request  being made. According to Interior, the requirement to offer to transfer  control is not triggered until an Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian  organization listed in the priority order makes a disposition request.  Absent such a request, Interior said that museums and federal agencies are  not required to offer to transfer control of culturally unidentifiable human  remains, however, Interior noted that 43 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.11(b)(ii) allows  museums and federal agencies to initiate the repatriation process without  a request, especially if they identify the tribes that occupied the land from  which the remains originated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Non-federally Recognized Tribes", "paragraphs": ["If none of the Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations in the priority  order agrees to accept control, the final rule allows museums and federal  agencies to transfer control of the culturally unidentifiable human remains  to other Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations or to non-federally  recognized Indian tribes, if the Secretary of the Interior recommends the  transfer. In their comments, some tribes objected to this provision  because it makes the transfer of control voluntary and at the discretion of  the museum or federal agency.

Along with the inventories,  federal agencies and museums also submit draft notices of inventory  completion and draft notices of intent to repatriate, which National  NAGPRA prepares for publication. National NAGPRA\u2019s Annual Report also  states that, during this same period, it published 1,295 notices of inventory  completion and 477 notices of intent to repatriate in the Federal Register  for federal agencies and museums.", "National NAGPRA has increased the number of notices it has published in  the Federal Register in recent years.

In our interviews with federal agency officials and Review  Committee members, a number of them complimented National NAGPRA  on its increased efficiency in publishing notices.", "In addition to recent increases in the number of notices published,  National NAGPRA has reduced a backlog of notices that were awaiting  publication. In 2004, the year the current National NAGPRA Program  Manager started in her position, there were about 300 draft notices  awaiting publication, some of which had been submitted close to a decade  earlier. These notices needed some action by the originator before they  could proceed to publication. Prior National NAGPRA management had an  \u201con-hold\u201d category for such notices and had taken them out of the  publication process, in a sense leaving them in limbo. In 2005, National  NAGPRA eliminated the \u201con-hold\u201d status and set out to clear this backlog  by contacting the originating entity of each notice and requesting that they  contact National NAGPRA to resolve it. National NAGPRA\u2019s  correspondence further stated that notices would be considered  withdrawn if the originating entity did not respond within a specified time  frame. Through fiscal year 2009, over 220 had been published, 21 were  awaiting publication, and 79 were withdrawn\u201424 by federal agencies  (see table 15). Notices were withdrawn by agencies and museums for a  variety of reasons, including:  the items had already been included in a published notice;  the agency or museum had revised the cultural determination to culturally  unidentifiable; and the agency or museum was actually not in control of the items.", "The withdrawal of these notices has been controversial and was the  subject of discussion at a congressional hearing in October 2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National NAGPRA\u2019s Grants Program", "paragraphs": ["National NAGPRA has administered a grants program to assist Indian  tribes, Native Hawaiian organizations, and museums in conducting  consultations and repatriations.

Of the total awarded,  $22.4 million, or about 68 percent, has gone to tribes and Native Hawaiian  organizations and $10.5 million, or about 32 percent, has gone to museums  (see table 16). Further, 513 grants worth about $31.8 million have been  awarded for consultation grants and 115 grants worth about $1.2 million  have been awarded for repatriation grants.", "The grants program has been controversial in part due to confusion over  how much funding was actually available for grants. NPS has allocated a  portion of the NAGPRA grants budget request line item to cover a portion  of National NAGPRA\u2019s operating expenses (another portion has been  provided by NPS\u2019s Cultural Resources Program), but did not indicate this  in its budget justifications until fiscal year 2011. Two investigations by  Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General on the alleged improper use of  NAGPRA funds found a lack of clarity over the use of the grants budget  request line item. Specifically, the Inspector General responded to  allegations that (1) NPS had illegally diverted millions in grant funding for  purposes not covered by NAGPRA and (2) the National NAGPRA Program  Manager had improperly reprogrammed grant funds for administrative  purposes. Both investigations found no wrongdoing, stating that NPS and  National NAGPRA had discretion to use the funds as it did. NPS\u2019s fiscal  year 2011 budget justification has addressed this issue by moving the  operating expenses out of the grants budget request and into the NPS  Cultural Resources Program budget request, thus separating the funding  for grants and operating expenses.

While these databases are providing more information to NAGPRA  practitioners, some federal agencies and museums have complained about  the databases containing incorrect information. The National NAGPRA  Program Manager told us that she is aware of this issue and is working to  correct the problems. The program manager explained that part of this  problem stems from earlier efforts to expedite the publication of notices,  but without reconciling data. Specifically, NPS staff as well as contract  employees hired in 2000 to publish notices did not reconcile the numbers  of human remains and objects listed in the notices with those listed in  inventories and summaries, and this left data inaccuracies. For example,  an agency or museum might have listed human remains as culturally  unidentifiable in an inventory, but later affiliated and repatriated those  remains and not informed National NAGPRA so they could update their  database.

Further, Corps and FWS  officials stated that, in some instances, their agencies had only begun  developing notices of inventory completion after receiving a repatriation  request from an Indian tribe for remains or associated funerary objects  that had been culturally affiliated in the agency\u2019s inventory; whereas  NAGPRA requires publication of these notices regardless of whether a  repatriation request has been received."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Comments from the Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: Comments from the Tennessee Valley Authority", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix X: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Jeffery D.
