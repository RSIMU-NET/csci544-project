CDHPs typically combine a high-deductible health plan with a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) or health savings account (HSA). HRAs and HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts used to pay enrollees' health care expenses, and unused balances may accrue for future use, potentially giving enrollees an incentive to purchase health care more prudently. The plans also provide decision-support tools to help enrollees become more actively involved in making health care purchasing decisions. Because CDHPs are relatively new, there is interest in the extent of enrollment and in other aspects of the plans. GAO was asked to review the prevalence of CDHPs, how the associated accounts are funded and used, and the factors that may contribute to the growth or limit the appeal of these plans. GAO examined survey data on CDHP enrollment and interviewed or obtained data from employers, insurance carriers, individuals, financial institutions, and other CDHP experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Enrollment in CDHPs accounts for a small but growing share of the 177 million Americans with private health insurance coverage. From January 2005 to January 2006, the number of enrollees and dependents covered by a CDHP--either an HRA-based plan or an HSA-eligible plan--increased from about 3 million to between about 5 and 6 million. An increasing number of health insurance carriers and employers began offering CDHPs during 2005. Most employers made a contribution to their employees' health accounts, and the share of account funds spent by enrollees varied. Employers commonly contributed to their employees' HRAs from $500 to $750 for individual coverage and $1,500 to $2,000 for family coverage in 2004. Most HRA-based plan enrollees spent some or all of these HRA funds in that year. For HSAs, industry representatives noted that not all HSA-eligible plan enrollees opened and contributed to an HSA, and survey data indicate that two-thirds of employers offering these plans contributed to their employees' HSAs. Industry representatives indicated that while most HSA account holders withdrew a portion of their account funds in 2005, some account holders used other, out-of-pocket funds, rather than their HSAs, to pay for medical care. According to industry officials and experts, the primary factor responsible for the growth of CDHPs is the rising cost of health care coverage. Prompting the growth of enrollment among individuals is the desire to lower premiums and accumulate tax-advantaged savings, according to the officials. Experts noted that employers would be more likely to offer a CDHP if the plans demonstrate the ability to restrain rising costs, and employees would be more likely to enroll in a CDHP if employers offered more comprehensive CDHP benefits coupled with education about the plans. Experts and industry officials cited several factors that may limit the appeal of CDHPs. Certain federal requirements for HSAs and HSA-eligible plans may preclude changes desired by some, such as higher annual contribution limits for HSAs. Certain state insurance requirements or income tax laws in eight states do not reflect federal statutory provisions for HSAs and HSA-eligible plans. Insurers are generally unable to determine the amount to be deducted from the patient's CDHP account at the time of service or offer decision-support tools that provide enrollees with sufficiently detailed data on the cost and quality of health care. GAO received technical comments from organizations that provided data for this report, and incorporated the comments as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2000, premiums in the group health insurance market, which covers  the majority of Americans, have risen nearly five times faster than the  overall rate of inflation and the rate of increase in workers\u2019 wages, leading  to debate about ways to reduce the growing cost of health care coverage.  Employers and insurance carriers are showing increasing interest in  consumer-directed health plans (CDHP), which combine a high-deductible  health plan (HDHP) with a tax-advantaged health reimbursement  arrangement (HRA) or health savings account (HSA) that enrollees can  use to pay for a portion of their health expenses. HRA accounts are  owned by the employer, and only the employer may contribute to them.  HSAs are owned by the enrollee; may be contributed to by both employer  and enrollee; and unlike HRAs, may be taken by the enrollee to a new  employer.", "Proponents of CDHPs contend that CDHPs can help restrain the growth in  health care costs. They maintain that because CDHP enrollees may use  account funds rolled over from one year to pay for health care in  subsequent years, enrollees have an incentive to seek lower-cost health  care services and to limit their discretionary spending on health care by  obtaining care only when necessary. The higher deductibles associated  with the HRA-based and HSA-eligible plans typically result in lower health  insurance premiums because the enrollee bears a greater share of the  initial cost of care. Although not required to do so, insurance carriers  typically provide CDHP enrollees with decision-support tools, such as  Web-based information on costs of services and quality of providers, to  help them become more actively involved in making health care  purchasing decisions.", "Critics, however, question whether CDHPs will help restrain the growth in  health care coverage costs, and whether they will do so by changing  consumer behavior or merely by attracting healthier individuals who use  fewer health care services. If CDHPs do attract a larger share of healthier  individuals, premiums for traditional plans could rise faster than they  otherwise would because of a disproportionate share of less-healthy  enrollees with higher health care expenses remaining in those plans.  Critics also worry that employers will use CDHPs to shift the cost of  health coverage to employees, either by failing to reduce employee  premium contributions or by insufficiently funding their employees\u2019  accounts.", "Because the CDHP is a relatively new concept in the design of health care  plans, there is interest in determining the extent to which insurance  carriers and employers are offering such plans, how the accounts are  funded and used, and the factors that may contribute to the growth or  limit the appeal of these plans. You requested that we explore these and  other issues related to CDHPs. We examined the following questions:  1.  How prevalent are CDHPs?  2.  How are the associated health accounts funded and used?  3.  What factors may contribute to the growth of CDHP enrollment?  4.  What factors may limit the appeal of CDHPs?", "To determine the prevalence of CDHPs, we summarized existing literature  and industry surveys regarding the extent to which employers offer and  individuals enroll in CDHPs, and the extent to which insurance carriers  and financial institutions offer the plans and their associated accounts.", "To determine how the associated accounts are funded and used, we  interviewed representatives of five of the largest CDHP insurers, six of the  largest financial institutions that administer HSAs, CDHP experts, and  industry officials. We obtained HRA funding and use data from three of the  insurers we contacted, obtained HSA account funding and use data from  one of the financial institutions we contacted, and obtained tax data on  HSA contributions and deductions from the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS). IRS data may not be nationally representative of HSA account  holders because the data do not capture individuals who opened HSAs and  made no individual contributions, even if their employers contributed, or  those who did not claim an HSA deduction. We did not independently  verify the account data we received from insurers and financial  institutions; however, we performed certain quality checks, such as  determining consistency between data elements provided and discussing  data reliability and limitations with the private entities providing the data,  and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Individuals are eligible to open and fund an HSA when  they have a high-deductible HSA-eligible plan and no other health  coverage, with limited exceptions. In order to be considered an HSA- eligible plan, a health plan must meet certain criteria, including a minimum  deductible amount\u2014$1,050 for single coverage and $2,100 for family  coverage in 2006\u2014and a maximum limit on out-of-pocket spending\u2014 $5,250 for single coverage and $10,500 for family coverage in 2006.  Preventive care services may be exempted from the deductible  requirement; however, coverage of most other services, including  prescription drugs, is subject to the deductible. Health insurance carriers  offer HSA-eligible plans to employers in the group market and to  individuals in the individual market. HSA-eligible plan enrollees are not  required to open or contribute to an associated HSA. A financial  institution, such as a bank or insurance company, typically administers the  HSA. An employer may partner with a financial institution to offer an HSA  alongside the HSA-eligible plan offered to employees, or it may defer to  employees to open the account. Both employers and individuals may  contribute to HSAs, and individuals may claim a deduction on their federal  income taxes for the HSA contribution regardless of whether they itemize  deductions or claim the standard deduction. Account balances can accrue  without limit, and the accounts are fully portable. Contributions,  withdrawals, and interest earned on the accounts are not federally taxed if  used for health care; however, enrollees may use accrued balances for  purposes other than medical care subject to a tax penalty and, for  retirement income, subject to income tax.

These tools  may be provided by health insurance carriers to all health insurance plan  enrollees, but are likely to be more important to CDHP enrollees, who  have a greater financial incentive to make informed trade-offs between the  quality and costs of health care providers and services. Experts suggest  that in order to make informed provider choices, enrollees need data to  assess the quality of different providers. These data may include the  volume of procedures performed, the outcomes of those procedures, and  indicators demonstrating whether providers followed certain  recommended treatment guidelines.

An official representing the  broker noted that some individuals\u2014particularly low users of health care  services\u2014view HSA-eligible plans as an affordable way to protect against  a catastrophic health care expense, while providing greater control and  savings account features. Participants in our focus group who were  enrolled in employer-sponsored CDHPs also cited the desire to lower their  monthly outlay for premiums, build up savings to pay for retirement or  other nonmedical care expenses, and exercise greater control over health  care decisions as the reasons for selecting an HSA.", "Industry officials and CDHP experts reported that the key factors in  determining whether employees enroll in a CDHP when offered are the  level of employer contributions, both toward the CDHP premiums and  toward the associated savings accounts, and the communication and  education efforts undertaken by employers. The officials noted that the  appeal of CDHPs was increased where the employer offered a larger  contribution to the CDHP premium and associated savings account and  more comprehensive benefits. A survey of employers indicated that  employees were more receptive to CDHPs when the employees believed  that the employer was not switching to a CDHP solely to shift rising costs  onto them, but also to encourage them to take more control of their long- term health care needs. One employer in the survey achieved high levels  of employee engagement and satisfaction with its CDHP offering by using  its employees as advocates to explain the new benefit design and the  rationale for the benefit change to both employees and their spouses, and  comparing its plan to CDHPs offered by other companies. The company  also offered its employees financial incentives, wellness programs, and  training for online decision-support tools that allowed employees to  compare the cost and quality of different treatment and provider options."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Requirements, Inadequate Consumer Tools, and Other Factors Could Limit the Appeal of CDHPs", "paragraphs": ["Industry officials and CDHP experts we interviewed cited several factors  that could limit the appeal of CDHPs, including a lack of flexibility in the  federal statutory provisions and guidance establishing HSAs and HSA- eligible plans and insurance or income tax requirements in eight states  that do not reflect federal statutory provisions for HSAs. Officials of  provider associations and experts suggested additional factors, including  the inability of the patient or provider to know at the time service is  delivered the amount to be deducted from the patient\u2019s CDHP account,  and the inadequacy of decision-support tools provided by insurance  carriers to help enrollees assess the cost and quality of providers and  treatment options.

For example, these groups cited IRS guidance  stipulating that HSA-eligible plans may not provide coverage for most  prescription medication before the annual deductible is met as potentially  limiting the appeal of these plans. In contrast, traditional plans typically  allow enrollees to receive coverage for prescription drugs before the  deductible is met\u2014a benefit that is very common among employers. In  addition, annual contributions to an HSA for 2006 are capped at $2,700 for  single and $5,450 for family coverage. An industry official noted that  higher contribution limits could reduce the gap between the allowable  HSA contribution and the annual plan deductible, thereby encouraging  more individuals to enroll in these plans. However, increasing the  contribution amounts would result in additional revenue loss to the  federal Treasury because of the tax-exempt status of the accounts.", "IRS guidance precludes certain changes to CDHPs that health policy  analysts and experts believe could increase the appeal of CDHPs to certain  high-risk groups that typically incur higher medical expenses. For  example, some experts have suggested allowing financial incentives for  employees with chronic illnesses or for employees who participate in  wellness programs. With certain limited exceptions, IRS guidance  penalizes employers that vary the amount of the account contributions  they make to comparable classes of employees, based on factors such as  employee participation in a disease management program, by imposing a  tax equal to 35 percent of the amount of the employer contributions.", "An industry official also noted that IRS guidance can limit the flexibility of  HSAs for individuals who enroll in an HSA-eligible plan later in the  calendar year. If an HSA-eligible plan is purchased after the first of the  year, IRS guidance states that the allowable contribution must be prorated  based on the number of months left in the year, even though the enrollee is  subject to the full annual deductible.

HMO requirements in three states prevent them from  offering HDHPs coupled with HSAs. These three states\u2014Illinois, Missouri,  and New York\u2014all specify maximum combinations of deductibles and  copayments, allowable charges, or out-of-pocket costs that HMOs may  charge to enrollees, thereby preventing them from offering HDHPs  consistent with federal statutory provisions. New York also imposes  another requirement on all individual health insurance plans, requiring  them to provide coverage of certain standardized benefits, which include  major medical, comprehensive, or comparable benefits. Under the  Internal Revenue Code and applicable guidance, HDHPs coupled with  HSAs may not provide coverage for primary care or other services  intended to treat an existing illness, injury, or condition before the annual  deductible is met.", "The association also indicated that five states currently offer lower  incentives to HSAs because they do not allow state personal income tax  deductions for HSA contributions. These states are Alabama, California,  New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.

Enrollees typically do not pay for services from their HRAs or  HSAs when they receive care from a provider because the amount to be  withdrawn from their account is not yet known. Instead, an enrollee  authorizes the insurance carrier to debit his or her account after the claims  adjudication process is complete. Alternatively, the enrollee may elect to  write a check to the provider to settle the outstanding charge after the  claim is adjudicated by the CDHP insurance carrier. CDHP experts and  provider association officials noted that the current system is confusing  for providers and patients. The association official cited an example  whereby a provider submits a claim to the insurance carrier after the  CDHP patient has been treated. The claim is adjudicated by the insurance  carrier, which sends the provider an explanation of benefits detailing what  the insurance carrier will pay and what the patient must pay out of his or  her HSA. Based on this explanation\u2014sometimes received up to 6 weeks  after the service was delivered\u2014the provider bills the patient directly and  is left wondering when payment will be received. During this period, the  patient, who may incur other health care expenses, is left uncertain of the  amount that will be withdrawn from the HSA, and therefore cannot  determine the remaining balance.", "A few vendors have, or are developing, technologies that can  electronically determine the amount to be deducted from the patient\u2019s  CDHP account at the point of service and execute this transaction shortly  thereafter. For example, a major CDHP insurance carrier recently  introduced an integrated, real-time claims adjudication process that it  anticipates will simplify administrative tasks and help physicians obtain  payment for services from the patient more quickly. The insurance carrier  reported that instead of duplicative manual keying of claims and benefit  information, the new system submits the claim and returns the adjudicated  claim before the patient leaves the doctor\u2019s office. Similarly, a company  that handles commercial credit card transactions recently partnered with a  major nationwide health insurance carrier to launch a real-time debit card  for HSAs. According to the insurance carrier, the debit card can be used at  the physician\u2019s office or hospital, or to pay bills online. The card is swiped  by the patient at the point of service, allowing funds to be withdrawn from  the HSA automatically and a payment for the insurance carrier\u2019s portion of  the medical claim to be made directly to the provider simultaneously.  Financial institutions we interviewed have expressed a desire to switch to  these new technologies as they become available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Decision- Support Tools May Hinder Appeal of CDHPs", "paragraphs": ["According to CDHP experts and employers, the tools provided by  insurance carriers to assist consumers in assessing the price and quality of  health care providers and services do not provide sufficient information to  allow enrollees to fully assess the cost and quality trade-offs of health care  purchasing decisions. The decision-support tools we reviewed from five  of the largest CDHP insurance carriers included hospital- and physician- specific quality data and provider cost information that was limited. For  example, five of the insurance carriers provided three or more measures of  hospital quality, such as outcomes data, procedure volumes, and patient  safety ratings; however, none provided similar process or outcome  measures to assess individual physician quality. Three insurance carriers  provided information on medical board certifications, and each carrier  provided other information about physicians, such as medical education  and hospital affiliation. Three of the insurance carriers provided average  hospital payment rates and average physician payment rates within a  specified geographic area for selected services, but none provided the  actual payment rates that would be charged to enrollees that the carrier  had negotiated with specific hospitals or physicians. All insurance  carriers provided information that allowed enrollees to track their account  balances, and all provided some information on health education.  Appendix I summarizes the information included on each CDHP insurance  carrier\u2019s Web site.", "Other recent assessments of CDHP decision-support tools found similar  limitations. For example, one study concluded that most CDHP decision- support tools did not provide sufficiently detailed measures of cost and  quality to allow enrollees to identify higher value treatment options.  Another survey found that almost 90 percent of the insurance carriers  surveyed did not adjust their cost information and 67 percent did not  adjust their quality information to reflect severity of illness.", "CDHP experts and representatives of health care providers cited several  reasons that existing decision-support tools contain limited quality and  cost data. A provider association reported that the biggest challenge is  providing the cost and quality data in a way that consumers can  understand and interpret. The association also stated that there are  potential legal barriers to greater price transparency, such as antitrust  laws and health plan contracts, which may preclude the sharing of  negotiated pricing. Additionally, there are many complexities involved in  making providers\u2019 prices more transparent, as well as a lack of consensus  on what would make ideal quality measures. Furthermore, experts note  that providers may resist making quality information more transparent,  allowing consumers to shop for medical services based on price and  quality, and the data needed to build the cost and quality tools for patients  are dispersed among several publicly funded health programs, as well as  private insurers and self-funded employers.", "Representatives of insurance carriers whose tools we reviewed told us  that they are currently limited in their ability to provide some of the  information experts identified as important. Multiple representatives  expressed concern over the lack of consensus across the industry on what  constitutes ideal quality measures and methodologies for developing  quality data. A representative noted that his company does not offer  patient satisfaction ratings for hospitals or physicians because of concerns  over the difficulty in achieving a meaningful rating that is based on a high  enough volume of respondents. Another representative told us that  physician-specific cost and quality data would be difficult to collect and  report until the physician community agreed that the value of providing  these kinds of information to consumers outweighed any potentially  negative personal ramifications. These representatives stated that they  were planning to offer actual negotiated physician costs in selected  markets in the coming years and that one insurance carrier has plans to  offer hospital process indicator data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Factors May Limit the Appeal of CDHPs", "paragraphs": ["Other factors were cited by some CDHP experts and industry officials as  potentially affecting the wider adoption of CDHP plans. An industry  official said that CDHPs have been priced too high by insurance carriers,  and as a result, the difference in premiums between CDHPs and traditional  low-deductible preferred provider organization (PPO) plans has not been  enough to attract more attention from employers interested in reducing  the cost of health care coverage. For example, a national broker of health  insurance in the individual market reported that in 2005 its nationwide  average single-coverage monthly premium for HSA-eligible plans with  deductibles between $2,000 and $2,999 was $166, compared to $213 for  non-HSA plans with deductibles under $500. Surveys by benefit  consultants indicate that some employers have been hesitant to offer or  promote CDHPs or HSAs, instead taking a \u201cwait and see\u201d attitude. One  survey reported that almost one-third of employers not considering a  CDHP think the concept is too new and want to gauge other employers\u2019  experiences with CDHPs before deciding to offer one themselves.", "Recent studies also raise questions about whether CDHPs can appeal to  certain segments of the population\u2014such as the aged or the sick\u2014who  may not have the inclination to select a CDHP or the desire to actively  participate in making complex health care decisions. These studies  caution that high users of medical services are more likely to prefer to  remain in traditional plans, and that some employers are concerned that  regardless of the amount of education they provide, spending accounts are  too complex for certain segments of their workforce. Three-quarters of  individuals polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation cited the fear of high  medical bills when asked about HDHPs. Focus group participants who  are enrolled in PPO plans cited lower and predictable out-of-pocket costs,  satisfaction with their current plan, and an unwillingness to manage their  own health care as the reasons for not enrolling in an HSA-eligible plan.  The focus group participants also noted that HSA-eligible plans were  confusing and complicated. For example, participants complained that the  HSA booklets were too confusing and convoluted and that the HSA- eligible plan was more complicated and required more of the enrollee\u2019s  time for reviewing paperwork.", "Employers we interviewed cited challenges they faced as they  implemented their CDHPs. These included the administrative complexity  of billing and claims processing, limited or insufficient information on the  quality and cost of provider and treatment options, and employees\u2019  unfamiliarity with and apprehension about CDHPs. (See table 3.)", "Similarly, employers responding to a benefit consultant survey said that  the key challenges they faced in implementing their CDHPs were  providing education and promoting understanding of the CDHP product,  pricing the CDHP product properly relative to other health plan options,  contending with the potential for the CDHP product to attract primarily  healthier employees, and selecting the right health insurance carrier and  financial institution to administer the plan and accounts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, federal and state governments have taken steps to  authorize and encourage the development of CDHPs, and insurance  carriers and employers have begun including the plans as an option within  their broader portfolios of health insurance offerings. While enrollment in  the plans is growing, CDHPs currently cover a relatively small share of the  privately insured population. In addition, a significant share of individuals  who enrolled in an HSA-eligible plan did not open and contribute to an  associated HSA to set aside funds to pay for health care expenses under  the higher deductibles. Nevertheless, the factors that have stimulated the  initial development and acceptance of these plans, such as the rising cost  of health care coverage and the desire to stimulate more cost- consciousness among plan enrollees, are not likely to abate in the near  term.", "Further enrollment growth in CDHPs will depend on several factors. The  likelihood that employers will increasingly offer CDHPs may be influenced  by how, or if, the plans demonstrate cost savings. On the one hand, the  plans may restrain costs by encouraging employees to become more  informed, cost-conscious purchasers of health care. This may depend in  part on the ability of health insurance carriers to improve and expand  upon the cost and quality information they make available to enrollees. On  the other hand, apparent CDHP cost savings may result primarily from a  cost shift from healthy to less healthy employees if healthier employees  disproportionately migrate to these plans, thus causing traditional plan  premiums to rise faster. The likelihood that individuals will increasingly  select a CDHP where given a choice may be influenced by the generosity  of the CDHP benefit package relative to other health plans offered by  employers and the experiences of early plan enrollees.
