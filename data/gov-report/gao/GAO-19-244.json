In the 2018 National Defense Strategy, DOD emphasized the  importance of maintaining a dynamic, flexible force for the department\u2019s  new focus on long-term, interstate strategic competition. The strategy  describes a corresponding priority on the investment in prepositioned  stocks to provide key logistical support for the department\u2019s missions.", "In the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014,  Congress required DOD to maintain a strategic policy regarding the  department\u2019s programs for prepositioned stocks that takes into account  national security threats, strategic mobility, service requirements, and the  requirements of the combatant commands. In addition, the act required  DOD, not later than 120 days after the enactment of the law, to develop  an implementation plan on its prepositioned stock programs. The  implementation plan is to address required elements in the law, such as  how the department will achieve the vision for prepositioning programs  and the resources required. In March 2017, DOD issued a strategic policy  for the management of prepositioned stock programs, and in August 2017  the department finalized the implementation plan.", "For many years, we have identified the potential for duplication in the  services\u2019 respective prepositioning stock programs due to a fragmented  management approach within DOD, and we have made related  recommendations. For example, in May 2011, we recommended that  DOD develop a department-wide strategy and strengthen joint oversight  to integrate and synchronize at a DOD-wide level the services\u2019  prepositioned stock programs, in order to maximize efficiency in  managing prepositioned stocks across the department and to reduce  potentially unnecessary duplication. In July 2017, we reported that the  strategic policy that DOD issued on March 7, 2017, for managing its  prepositioned stock programs did not address five of the six mandated  elements and that DOD had not yet completed the mandated  implementation plan. We recommended that DOD revise or include in  other department-wide guidance a description of the department\u2019s vision  and desired end state for its prepositioned stock programs as well as  interim goals to achieve the vision and end state. DOD concurred with our  recommendations and stated that it would issue an implementation plan  that would include these elements.", "Section 321 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2014 includes a provision for us  to review and report on DOD\u2019s implementation plan for managing  prepositioned stock programs as well as provide additional information  relating to the plan as appropriate.

One GAO analyst  coded the information and a different analyst checked the initial coding for  accuracy. The analysts discussed and reconciled any coding  disagreements and then tallied their responses. We assessed an element  as \u201caddressed\u201d if DOD\u2019s implementation plan addressed all parts of the  element. We assessed an element as \u201cpartially addressed\u201d if one or  more\u2014but not all\u2014parts of the required element were explicitly  addressed. We assessed an element as \u201cnot addressed\u201d if the plan did  not explicitly address any part of the required element. In addition to  assessing how the implementation plan met the seven elements in  section 321, we assessed the plan using Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government, which call for, among other things, agencies to  establish objectives defined in specific and measureable terms that  clearly define what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be  achieved, and the time frames for achievement. We also interviewed  officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff  regarding the implementation plan and its development.", "To address objective two, we reviewed key DOD documents related to  prepositioned stocks (i.e., DOD\u2019s strategic policy, joint service  instructions, services\u2019 policies for prepositioned stock programs), recent  DOD prepositioned stock annual reports to Congress, and other DOD  guidance documents. We assessed the joint oversight language found in  those documents against Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, which state that objectives should be defined in specific and  measureable terms that clearly define what is to be achieved, who is to  achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the time frames for achievement  as well as that management should evaluate performance and hold  individuals accountable for their responsibilities. We also reviewed our  past work in the area of duplication, overlap, and fragmentation related to  the services\u2019 respective prepositioning stock programs. \u201cFragmentation\u201d refers to those circumstances in which more than one organization within  an agency is involved in the same broad area of national need and  opportunities exist to improve service delivery. We also reviewed  documentation and observed a meeting of DOD\u2019s Global Prepositioned  Materiel Capabilities Working Group, which DOD identified as responsible  for addressing joint issues concerning war reserve materiel requirements  and positioning. In addition, we interviewed officials from the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the four military services, and a  geographic combatant command to determine the extent to which DOD  was employing joint oversight through the working group and key  guidance documents.

The  implementation plan notes that DOD submits a comprehensive list of  materiel to Congress each year per 10 U.S.C. \u00a72229a. However, the  annual report to Congress does not include a comprehensive list of the  department\u2019s prepositioned materiel and equipment programs. Rather,  the annual report describes most of the department\u2019s prepositioning  programs but it omits one Army and six Air Force programs not listed in  the implementation plan. Apart from the statutory requirement, Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that management  should communicate quality information externally so that external parties  can help the entity achieve its goals and address risks. Without a  comprehensive list of prepositioned materiel and equipment programs,  DOD decision makers do not have all of the information they need to  conduct effective oversight to assist the department in achieving its vision  and goals.", "Element three (detailed description of how the plan will be  implemented, partially addressed). The plan identifies policy,  governance, and assessment initiatives through which the department  aims to achieve its goals. However, the plan does not provide a  detailed description of how the department will implement these three  initiatives.", "Specifically, the plan states that DOD will identify policy gaps and  revise or develop policy at all levels to better oversee prepositioned  stocks; assigns the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology, and Logistics, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  and the services to review and revise the current prepositioning  policies as appropriate; and tasks the geographic combatant  commanders to ensure that theater campaign plans provide clear  guidance for service prepositioned stock planning. However, the plan  does not provide details on when geographic combatant commanders  should finalize clear guidance for service prepositioned stock planning  or describe what the guidance should include. The plan also states  that DOD will use a governance body composed of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the geographic combatant  commanders; and the services to provide joint oversight of the  prepositioned stock programs. However, the plan is unclear as to  whether the Global Prepositioned Materiel Capabilities Working Group  is the governance body. For example, the plan states that DOD\u2019s joint  oversight framework will include the Global Prepositioned Materiel  Capabilities Working Group but also assigns the group to present  capability shortfalls and gaps to a governance body and implement  governance body decisions. Further, the plan states that DOD will use  current systems of record and established metrics to evaluate  performance and measure prepositioned stock status and capability.  However, these are existing mechanisms to monitor the services\u2019  programs and do not provide details on how the department will  assess implementation of the plan itself.", "In 2017, a Joint Staff official told us that the implementation plan  would be broad and high-level but would be more detailed than the  DOD\u2019s strategic policy. However, the plan\u2019s descriptions of the  implementation initiatives lack sufficient detail on what the department  will do to implement the plan. Apart from the statutory requirement,  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government establish  that objectives should be defined in specific and measureable terms  that clearly define what is to be achieved. Without sufficient detail,  DOD risks being unable to fully support the emphasis and high priority  that the 2018 National Defense Strategy gives to prepositioned  stocks.", "Element six (description of the resources required to implement  the plan, not addressed). DOD\u2019s implementation plan does not  describe the resources required to implement the plan. Rather, the  plan states that prepositioning programs are resourced and managed  by the services in support of combatant command operational and  training requirements. In describing the joint oversight framework, the  plan states that DOD will leverage the processes that already exist to  resource prepositioning stock requirements including a focused effort  on prepositioning as part of the annual planning, programming,  budget and execution process, and the Joint Capabilities Integration  Development System. Officials from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy told us when they were developing the  implementation plan that they understood this element as requiring  information about the resources such as funding, personnel, and  technology that would be needed to implement the plan. However, the  plan does not include a description of the funding, personnel, or  technology resources required to implement the plan. DOD officials  reported that the services received $1.2 billion for prepositioned  stocks in fiscal year 2018 and that the annual report to Congress also  contains further information on the funding. However, this information  does not describe the resources needed to implement DOD\u2019s plan for  prepositioned stocks as required by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2014.  Apart from the statutory requirement, Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government establish that organizations should gather  relevant operational and financial information for effective monitoring.  Without a description of the resources required for implementation,  decision makers do not have enough information to understand  whether the department has sufficient resources to implement the  plan.", "Element seven (description of how the plan will be reviewed and  assessed to monitor progress, partially addressed). DOD\u2019s  implementation plan describes how the department will monitor the  services\u2019 prepositioned stock capabilities and readiness but does not  describe how the department will review and assess the plan itself.  The plan states that the department will use standard metrics  contained in the readiness reporting systems of record to monitor  prepositioning capability and readiness of the services\u2019 programs. The  plan assigns the services and combatant commands to assess  prepositioned stock programs and posture annually and notes that all  of the services are to begin reporting through the Defense Readiness  Reporting System in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. However,  similar to element three, the plan does not fully address the mandated  element in that it does not describe how the department will review or  assess the plan as a tool toward achieving the stated vision and  desired end state.

The document states that all service prepositioned stock  programs require joint alignment with national priorities and global  combatant command requirements across the full range of military  operations. The instruction specifically directs the Joint Staff to  develop a framework for joint oversight processes for synchronizing  the services\u2019 prepositioning strategies to minimize duplicative efforts  and to maximize efficiencies and return on investment for  prepositioned stocks. However, this document does not detail how the  Joint Staff is to develop this framework and does not describe the  elements that are to be included as a part of an effective approach for  joint oversight.", "In March 2017, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics issued its Pre-Positioned War  Reserve Materiel Strategic Policy. One of the purposes of the  document is to establish joint oversight of the military services\u2019 pre- positioning efforts to maximize efficiencies across DOD. The directive  assigns the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the  responsibility to develop a framework for synchronizing the services\u2019  prepositioning strategies to minimize duplicative efforts and to  maximize efficiency and return on investment across DOD. However,  similar to the instruction above, this document does not detail how the  Joint Staff is to develop this framework or describe the elements that  are to be included as a part of an effective approach for joint  oversight.", "In August 2017, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Logistics and  Materiel Readiness finalized DOD\u2019s implementation plan for managing  prepositioned stock programs, which we discuss earlier in this  report. The plan calls for improved DOD guidance that builds a  framework and establishes joint oversight to synchronize service  prepositioned stock programs with DOD\u2019s strategic guidance and  priorities. The plan also calls for balancing service prepositioned stock  programs to maximize effectiveness and efficiency while minimizing  potential duplication across the department. However, in addition to  the shortcomings of the plan that we discuss earlier in this report, the  plan also does not provide a detailed discussion of what is needed to  implement a department-wide framework for joint oversight. Further,  although the plan states that clear policy is the foundation for joint  oversight, the plan itself was not issued as formal guidance, and, as  noted earlier, most prepositioning service officials we spoke with were  not aware of the plan\u2019s existence. DOD officials stated that they are  continuing to update existing guidance as needed and that the  services are responsible for implementing and managing their own  prepositioned stock programs.", "DOD also provides Congress annual reports on the status of the services\u2019  prepositioned stock programs. However, in June 2015, we reported that  the annual report provided inconsistent information among the services\u2019  programs using a nonstandardized definition of \u201cprepositioned stocks\u201d  and that the annual report is not an effective tool for joint oversight. We  recommended that DOD develop a standardized definition of  \u201cprepositioning\u201d for its annual report that is consistent with the definition  used in the department\u2019s joint service guidance and apply this definition  consistently to identify prepositioning materiel and equipment across  DOD. DOD concurred with our recommendations. However, as of  October 2018, DOD continued to use varying definitions of prepositioned  stocks. A broad definition exists at the strategic level, but service-level  definitions vary depending on what each service\u2019s prepositioned stock  needs are. For example, the Army\u2019s definition of prepositioned stocks is  based on the equipment and stocks required to meet the unique mission  requirements of brigade combat team configurations. Within this  definition, the Army includes equipment sets used for training units, but  the other services do not. DOD officials stated that although there is a  broad definition of prepositioned stocks, the services are responsible for  managing their individual programs to include what equipment and stocks  are a part of their respective programs based on their mission and needs.", "Further, in 2008, DOD directed the establishment of the Global  Prepositioned Materiel Capabilities Working Group and assigned it  responsibility for addressing joint issues concerning war reserve materiel  requirements and positioning. According to DOD\u2019s prepositioned stock  implementation plan, the working group is DOD\u2019s focused joint oversight  framework effort to execute the following for prepositioned stock  programs: analyze service and combatant commander input in the annual report  identify potential opportunities to enhance efficiency and reduce  operational risk, present capability shortfalls/gaps to a governance body for  implement governance body decisions in coordination with the  services and combatant commands, and assess actions to ensure desired results are achieved.", "According to DOD guidance, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Sustainment and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff appoint co- chairs for the working group, which will include members from the military  services, the Defense Logistics Agency and the combatant commands    and meet annually or more often, as needed. However, since 2011, our  work has shown that DOD has been unable to ensure that the working  group\u2019s activities include the full range of the tasks the group was  established to perform because the working group lacks clear oversight  and reporting relationships to authoritative bodies within DOD. We  recommended that DOD assess the continued relevance of the Global  Prepositioned Materiel Capabilities Working Group\u2019s assigned tasks, and  DOD concurred. In September 2012, we reported that, according to DOD  officials, the main responsibility of the working group had been to  consolidate the services\u2019 individual submissions on their prepositioned  stock programs into DOD\u2019s annual report for Congress, and that the  working group had met only sporadically and had not yet addressed many  of the duties specified in its charter. This continues to be the case. We  found that, according to DOD officials, quarterly working group meetings  were frequently postponed, attendance was not fully representative of all  stakeholders, and the discussions during a September 2018 meeting we  observed were primarily focused on gathering information from the  services for preparations for the upcoming annual report to Congress and  receiving service updates on the current status of their respective  prepositioned stock programs.", "DOD has not fully implemented joint oversight of the services\u2019  prepositioned stock programs because the department\u2019s guidance lacks  detail and the department has not fully implemented requirements within  other intended joint oversight efforts, such as the working group. Instead,  DOD\u2019s approach has been for the services to manage their own  respective programs with limited oversight at the department level.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  objectives should be defined in specific and measureable terms that  clearly define what is to be achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be  achieved, and the time frames for achievement. These standards also  state that management should evaluate performance and hold individuals  accountable for their internal control responsibilities. In addition, the  NDAA for Fiscal Year 2014 mandates a framework for joint departmental  oversight that reviews and synchronizes the military services\u2019  prepositioned stock strategies to minimize potentially duplicative efforts  and maximize efficiencies in prepositioned stocks across the DOD.  Further, our prior work in the area of fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication in the federal government has found that Congress and  executive branch agencies have opportunities to contribute toward fiscal  sustainability and act as stewards of federal resources. These include  taking actions to reduce, eliminate, or better manage duplication, overlap,  or fragmentation among federal agencies and programs; achieve cost  savings; or enhance revenues. \u201cFragmentation\u201d refers to those  circumstances in which more than one organization within an agency is  involved in the same broad area of national need and opportunities exist  to improve service delivery.", "Without strengthening joint oversight across the department, DOD  continues to have a fragmented approach to its management of  prepositioning programs, which has led to inefficiencies. For example,  according to Joint Staff officials, there is no uniform process by which the  services are reporting the readiness of prepositioned stock assets. Joint  Staff officials also said that having a joint oversight approach would help  them have a more complete picture on the readiness of prepositioned  stocks across the services and help the services in developing more  consistent reporting methods. Service officials we interviewed have also  noted that there may be duplication among DOD\u2019s prepositioned stock  programs resulting from limited joint oversight. For example, Navy  officials stated that because each service utilizes medical assets as a part  of its prepositioned stock programs, there is potential duplicative medical  equipment across the services, which may result in inefficiencies. Finally,  our ongoing classified work is finding a lack of joint oversight related to  DOD\u2019s management of prepositioned stocks in Europe.", "Although DOD\u2019s current approach relies on the services managing their  own prepositioned stock programs and Title 10 requires the services to  train, man, and equip their forces, without fully implementing joint  oversight\u2014including providing more detailed information on how to  implement such an approach in its guidance and reviewing its other  efforts, such as the working group\u2014DOD will continue to experience  fragmented management of its prepositioned stock programs.
