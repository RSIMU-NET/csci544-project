For example, section 202 of UMRA generally requires federal agencies (other than independent regulatory agencies) to prepare \u201cwritten statements\u201d containing specific information for any rule for which a proposed rule was published that includes a federal mandate that may result in the expenditure of $100 million or more in any 1 year by state, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector. A \u201cmandate\u201d is defined in UMRA as an \u201cenforceable duty\u201d that is not a condition of federal assistance and does not arise from participation in a voluntary federal program. For those rules requiring a written statement, other sections of UMRA require the following:", "Section 205 of UMRA requires agencies to consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives and select the one that is the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome and that achieves the purpose of the rule.", "Section 203 of UMRA states that agencies must develop plans to involve small governments in the development of regulatory proposals that have a significant or unique effect on those entities.", "Section 204 of UMRA requires agencies to develop processes to consult with representatives of state, local, and tribal governments in the development of regulatory proposals containing \u201csignificant ederal intergovernmental mandates.\u201d", "Section 206 of UMRA requires the Director of OMB to collect the written statements prepared under section 202 and periodically forward them to the Director of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "Section 207 of UMRA requires the OMB Director to establish pilot programs in at least two agencies to test regulatory approaches that reduce the burden on small governments.", "Title IV of UMRA sets forth the extent to which agencies\u2019 compliance with the written statement and small government plan requirements in the act are subject to judicial review.", "This report responds to your request that we review federal agencies\u2019 implementation of UMRA. The overall objective of our review was to determine what effect title II of UMRA has had on agencies\u2019 rulemaking actions. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed agencies\u2019 implementation of the substantive provisions of title II (secs. 202 through 205) for \u201ceconomically significant\u201d rules published in the Federal Register between March 22, 1995, and March 22, 1997. Because of the large number of agencies that issue rules, we focused some of our efforts on the four agencies that issued the greatest number of economically significant rules and produced the greatest number of written statements during this period: the Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Transportation (DOT) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also examined pilot projects established by OMB under section 207 of UMRA and searched for court decisions resulting from the judicial review provisions in title IV of the act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The process of issuing and enforcing regulations is one of the basic tools of government. The main elements of the federal rulemaking process are described in section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which was enacted in 1946. The APA generally requires agencies to (1) publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register; (2) allow interested persons an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process by providing \u201cwritten data, views, or arguments\u201d; and (3) publish the rule 30 days before it becomes effective. The notice of proposed rulemaking must include reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed and state the time, place, and nature of public rulemaking proceedings. In some cases, agencies issue advance notices of proposed rulemaking before a formal notice is published to receive public reaction to a rule as early as possible.", "Although the federal government has long regulated economic activity, several major new statutes were enacted in the 1960s and 1970s that prompted regulation in such areas as environmental quality, workplace safety, and consumer protection. By the 1980s, an array of federal regulations were in place that affected many of the decisions made by businesses and by other governmental units. For some time, state, local, and tribal governments have expressed concerns about the difficulty of complying with federal regulatory mandates without additional resources. Business groups have voiced similar concerns about rising costs that they said were being imposed by federal regulations.", "Both the executive and legislative branches have responded to these public and private sector concerns by attempting to reform the federal regulatory process. For example, in 1981, President Reagan issued Executive Order 12291 on \u201cFederal Regulation,\u201d which gave OMB the authority to review all new regulations for consistency with administration policies. The order also required agencies to prepare a \u201cregulatory impact analysis\u201d for each major rule, describing the costs, benefits, and alternatives to the rule. In September 1993, President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866 on \u201cRegulatory Planning and Review,\u201d which, among other things, established \u201cprinciples of regulation\u201d (e.g., requiring agencies to \u201cidentify and assess alternative forms of regulation\u201d and to tailor their regulations to \u201cimpose the least burden on society\u201d) and specific processes that agencies had to follow (e.g., conduct cost-benefit analyses for all economically significant rules). This executive order also states that agencies must, wherever feasible, \u201cseek views of appropriate tate, local, and tribal officials before imposing regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect those governmental entities.\u201d", "In October 1993, the President issued Executive Order 12875 on \u201cEnhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership,\u201d which, among other things, requires each agency to \u201cdevelop an effective process to permit elected officials of state, local, and tribal governments to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory proposals containing significant unfunded mandates.\u201d The President also made regulatory reform one of the central elements of the administration\u2019s National Performance Review (NPR), which is a major management reform effort that was started in March 1993 under the direction of Vice President Gore and is intended to identify ways to make the government work better and cost less.", "Congress has been equally active in attempting to reform the federal regulatory process. For example, in 1980 Congress enacted the Regulatory Flexibility Act, which requires agencies to assess the impact of their regulations on small entities (e.g., businesses and governments) and to publish their plans for new regulations. During the 104th Congress, numerous legislative initiatives were introduced that attempted to reform the regulatory process. One of the first such efforts was UMRA, which was introduced as S. 1 in the Senate on January 4, 1995, and was enacted on March 22, 1995. Title I of UMRA established new procedures designed to ensure that Congress fully considers the potential effects of unfunded federal mandates before imposing them on state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector. Among other reforms, the procedures call for CBO to provide statements to authorizing committees about whether reported bills contain mandates and, if so, what their costs would be.", "Title II of UMRA, entitled \u201cRegulatory Accountability and Reform,\u201d contains the requirements imposed on federal agencies during the rulemaking process, and took effect on the day the act was signed by the President. Section 201 states that \u201cach agency shall, unless otherwise prohibited by law, assess the effects of ederal regulatory actions on tate, local, and tribal governments, and the private sector (other than to the extent that such regulations incorporate requirements specifically set forth in law).\u201d Other sections in title II require agencies to prepare a written statement containing specific descriptions and estimates for any proposed rule or any final rule for which a proposed rule was published that includes any federal mandate that may result in the expenditure of $100 million or more in any 1 year by state, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector\u2014one of the items required in the written statement is a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the federal mandate (sec. 202); \u201cidentify and consider a reasonable number of regulatory alternatives\u201d and select the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative (or explain why that alternative was not selected) for each rule for which a written statement is prepared (sec. 205); develop a plan in which agencies provide notice of regulatory requirements to potentially affected small governments; enable officials of those governments to provide input in the development of regulatory proposals; and inform, educate, and advise those governments on compliance with the requirements before establishing any regulatory requirements that might \u201csignificantly or uniquely\u201d affect small governments (sec. 203); and develop an effective process to permit elected officers of state, local, and tribal governments (or their designees) to provide input in the development of regulatory proposals containing significant intergovernmental mandates (sec. 204).", "Section 206 of UMRA requires the OMB Director to collect the written statements prepared by the agencies and periodically forward them to the CBO Director. Section 207 requires the OMB Director to establish pilot programs in at least two agencies to test innovative and flexible regulatory approaches to reduce the reporting and compliance burden on small governments while meeting statutory goals and objectives. Section 208 requires the OMB Director to submit annual reports to Congress detailing agencies\u2019 compliance with title II of UMRA.", "Title III of UMRA required the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations to conduct a study reviewing federal mandates, and title IV established judicial review under the act.", "The committee reports for the Senate bill that ultimately resulted in UMRA indicate that Congress was aware that the bill duplicated existing requirements in many respects. For example, the report by the Senate Committee on the Budget stated that, except for the requirement for small government plans, \u201cthe bill will not impose new requirements to implement in the regulatory process that are not already required under Executive Orders 12866 and 12875.\u201d However, the report by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs stated that the \u201cspirit and intent\u201d of the written statement requirements involving cost-benefit analysis were \u201cmeant to be entirely consistent with the relevant portions of [Executive Order] 12866.\u201d Therefore, Congress may have expected that the scope of these requirements would be the same as the scope of the executive order and would cover all economically significant rules."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "OMB Issued UMRA Guidance and Reports", "paragraphs": ["Within OMB, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has primary responsibility for monitoring agency compliance with title II of UMRA.

S. 981 addresses many of the same issues as Executive Order 12866 and UMRA, including cost-benefit analysis, examination of regulatory alternatives, and the transparency of the regulatory process. However, the bill goes beyond the executive order and UMRA\u2019s requirements in these areas and adds some new elements to the rulemaking process. For example, S. 981 would require agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses for all \u201cmajor\u201d rules that have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million\u2014a much broader standard than in UMRA ($100 million in expenditures by certain regulated entities). S. 981 also would require agencies to conduct risk assessments and peer reviews for these major rules, and the bill would apply to many of the independent regulatory agencies. Neither UMRA nor Executive Order 12866 specifically requires risk assessments or peer reviews, and neither applies to independent regulatory agencies.

To determine if there were rules for which written statements under section 202 of UMRA should have been on file at CBO but were not, we first obtained a list of rules from the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) that its database indicated were economically significant rules published in the Federal Register between March 22, 1995, and March 22, 1997\u2014the 2 years after the effective date of title II of UMRA. We focused our review on economically significant rules because rules that would result in the expenditure of $100 million in any 1 year by state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector (one of the factors necessitating an UMRA written statement) should be a subset of those rules that are considered economically significant according to Executive Order 12866.", "We reviewed each of the economically significant rules promulgated during this 2-year period for which written statements were not on file at CBO and noted any explanations presented in the rules regarding why they were not covered by UMRA\u2019s section 202 written statement requirements. We asked follow-up questions regarding why no written statement was on file at CBO for these rules at OIRA and at the four agencies that had promulgated the greatest number of both economically significant rules and rules for which written statements were on file\u2014USDA, HHS, DOT, and EPA. Using this and other information that we collected about the rules, we then determined whether any of them should have had an UMRA written statement on file at CBO.", "Certain terms in UMRA that dictate whether a written statement should be prepared are not defined in the act, the conference report, or OMB guidance. Therefore, we had to develop working definitions of those terms to determine whether agencies should have prepared written statements for the rules in our review. We defined an \u201cexpenditure\u201d as a payment made by either the public or private sector, but we did not include lost income by those groups or payments made by other entities (e.g., the federal government). We defined an \u201cenforceable duty\u201d as a responsibility or obligatory task that can be compelled by the force of government. We defined a \u201cvoluntary\u201d federal program as one in which participants are involved of their own choice.", "We had to define other terms to determine whether the written statements met UMRA requirements and whether the agencies should have prepared small government plans under section 203 and developed consultation processes under section 204. For example, we defined \u201cqualitative\u201d cost-benefit assessments as any nonnumerical measure of the effects of a rule (e.g., \u201csubstantial\u201d costs or \u201cwould save many lives\u201d). If an agency\u2019s written statement contained an estimate of the rule\u2019s cost in any forthcoming period, we considered that to be evidence of \u201cfuture compliance costs.\u201d We used definitions that were suggested or used by OMB or rulemaking agencies to describe the possible scope of other terms (e.g., a \u201csignificant ederal intergovernmental mandate\u201d that triggers the consultation process requirement in sec. 204).", "We reviewed all of the written statements that were on file at CBO (plus one statement that OMB had not forwarded to CBO) and, using a data collection instrument modeled on our interpretation of the statute, determined whether the statements met the specific requirements of section 202 of UMRA and whether the statements contained information relevant to section 205. We interviewed officials in the four selected agencies to (1) ensure that all required elements in their statements had been identified, (2) verify our coding of those elements, and (3) obtain other information. To determine what consultation processes the selected agencies established under section 204, we reviewed descriptions of those processes in OMB\u2019s annual reports on UMRA, interviewed officials in the four selected agencies, and obtained and reviewed copies of any relevant documents in those agencies.", "To determine whether the agencies had developed small government plans required under section 203, we focused on all final rules that had been promulgated during the 2-year period included in our review and that appeared on the list of rules that RISC identified as economically significant or that we identified as economically significant. We reviewed the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions to determine whether the agencies had previously identified the rules as having an effect on small governments. We also obtained comments from officials in the Small Business Administration\u2019s (SBA) Office of Advocacy on whether they believed that any of the final rules would have an effect on small governments. Finally, we asked officials in each of the four selected agencies whether they had developed small government plans.", "To determine the status of the pilot programs established by OMB under section 207, we interviewed appropriate officials in the two agencies with such pilots and reviewed any available documentation for those pilots. We also conducted a legal review to determine whether any judicial decisions had been issued regarding agencies\u2019 compliance with the written statement and small government plan requirements of UMRA. However, we did not identify cases that might have been filed with the courts regarding UMRA compliance but that had not yet been decided. We did not validate all of the databases we used in this review.", "The methodology we used in this review was not designed to identify all of the possible effects that UMRA may have had on agencies\u2019 rulemaking actions. For example, we did not attempt to determine whether UMRA prevented agencies from proposing rules with significant mandates or caused them to eliminate certain burdensome effects that otherwise would have been contained in the rules that were proposed.", "Although we attempted to determine whether agencies\u2019 written statements satisfied the basic requirements of sections 202 and 205 of UMRA, we did not assess the quality of the agencies\u2019 economic analyses prepared to satisfy these provisions. For example, although we determined whether the written statements contained qualitative and quantitative assessments of the anticipated costs and benefits of a federal mandate, we did not attempt to determine whether an agency\u2019s economic analysis used sound economic assumptions or methodologies. Neither did we determine whether all relevant quantitative and qualitative costs and benefits had been identified or whether the alternatives had been adequately considered. Any comments we received from officials in the four selected agencies are not generalizable to other federal agencies.", "We conducted our work between February 1997 and November 1997 at OMB, USDA, HHS, DOT, and EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We discovered that one of the three additional economically significant rules described what the issuing agency had done to comply with UMRA, but OMB had mistakenly not forwarded a copy of the written statement for the rule to CBO. We included this rule with the 29 for which written statements were on file at CBO. Subtracting these 30 rules from the 110 economically significant rules promulgated during this 2-year period yielded a total of 80 rules that were economically significant but for which no written statement had been prepared.

See app. II for a list of the 30 rules for which written statements were on file at CBO.)", "Of the 80 economically significant rules that were promulgated between March 22, 1995, and March 22, 1997, for which no written statement was on file at CBO, the issuing agencies frequently did not mention UMRA in the rules. Those agencies that did mention UMRA in their rules frequently said that the rules did not contain a federal mandate and/or did not result in $100 million in expenditures by state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector and, therefore, were not covered by sections 202 or 205 of the act.", "We compared the substance of these 80 economically significant rules to the requirements in UMRA and concluded that 2 of the rules were required to have an UMRA written statement on file at CBO. No written statements appeared to be required for 78 of the rules for a variety of reasons as follows.", "One DOT rule established the light truck fuel economy standard for 1998 at 20.7 miles per gallon\u2014the level at which Congress had required DOT to set the standard in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriation Act of 1996. Because this rule incorporated requirements that were specifically set forth in law, section 201 of UMRA allowed DOT not to assess the rule\u2019s effects on state, local, and tribal governments or the private sector.", "Eighteen of the rules were not notices of proposed rulemaking or final rules for which such notices had been published. Section 202 of UMRA states that a written statement must be prepared before promulgating any general notice of proposed rulemaking and before promulgating any final rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking was published.", "The rules without proposed rules included notices, advance notices of proposed rulemaking, and interim final rulemakings. For example, HHS issued six notices for the Medicaid and Medicare programs, each of which had associated costs of more than $100 million, but none of which had associated proposed rules. USDA issued a final rule involving the implementation of several farm programs with associated costs that the agency estimated at $36.8 billion. However, there was no notice of proposed rulemaking for this rule.", "Forty-seven of the rules had notices of proposed rulemaking but were not \u201cmandates\u201d as defined in UMRA. Section 202 of UMRA states that the written statement requirement applies to rules that include a federal mandate, which is defined in title I of the act as an \u201cenforceable duty\u201d that is not \u201ca condition of ederal assistance\u201d or \u201ca duty arising from participation in a voluntary ederal program.\u201d Three of the 47 rules did not appear to impose an enforceable duty. For example, one USDA rule allowed the importation of meat from Argentina and Mexico. Although USDA estimated that the rule could cause American livestock producers to lose as much as $190 million in income each year, the rule did not impose an enforceable duty on those producers. Forty-four of the 47 rules appeared to impose an enforceable duty, but that duty was either as a condition of federal assistance (33 rules) or arose from participation in a voluntary program (11 rules). For example, although USDA\u2019s 1996 upland cotton program regulation appeared to impose the requisite enforceable duty (that farmers not plant cotton), the duty arose only as a condition of federal assistance. USDA estimated that this regulation would cost the federal government between $0.5 and $1.5 billion in 1996.", "Twelve of the rules met all of the aforementioned standards but were unlikely to result in expenditures of more than $100 million in any 1 year. For example, one of the rules issued by the Food and Drug Administration within HHS established new food labeling requirements. The rule was considered economically significant because the agency had estimated its benefits at more than $100 million per year. However, the agency estimated that the rule would cost the private sector only $4 million in the first year, and that costs would decline in subsequent years.", "Figure 1 summarizes this information, showing how many of the 110 economically significant rules that were promulgated during this 2-year period did and did not have written statements on file at CBO, and why many rules did not appear to require such statements.", "Table 1 shows the number of economically significant rules for which written statements were and were not on file at CBO and the total number of such rules, by department or agency.", "The two rules that we concluded should have had UMRA written statements on file at CBO but did not were EPA\u2019s proposed national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter. As we said in our August 1997 report on these rules, we disagree with EPA\u2019s interpretation of UMRA\u2019s requirements regarding the written statements in one respect. EPA contended that a written statement was not required for these rules under section 202 of UMRA, which states that a statement need not be prepared if \u201cotherwise prohibited by law.\u201d However, although EPA was not required to include cost estimates described in sections 202(a)(2), (3), and (4) of UMRA because of Clean Air Act prohibitions, it was still required to identify the provision of federal law under which rules were being promulgated and to describe its outreach efforts with state, local, and tribal governments under sections 202(a)(1) and (5).

Nevertheless, all but 1 of the 30 written statements that were submitted during the first 2 years of UMRA\u2019s implementation included some discussion of the regulatory alternatives that the agencies considered and the alternatives they selected. In most cases, the number of regulatory alternatives that the agencies considered was clear, but in other cases the number of alternatives was more difficult to tally. For example, one of the rules contained five basic options, each of which had four suboptions. Therefore, it was unclear whether the agency considered 5 alternatives or 20 alternatives for this rule.", "Most commonly, the agencies considered between three and seven alternatives for each of the rules, with the types of options considered varying widely. For example, the Department of Energy (DOE) identified six major policy alternatives in its proposed rule on energy conservation standards for refrigerators and freezers, including no new regulatory action, informational action, prescriptive standards, financial incentives, voluntary targets, and the proposed performance standards. DOE said it selected the proposed standards as the basis of its regulatory action because none of the other alternatives saved as much energy and all of the other options would have required legislation. Other agencies said that they selected the regulatory alternative being proposed because it was the least costly and/or least burdensome option.

OMB\u2019s April 1997 annual report on agencies\u2019 compliance with title II indicated that OMB had designated three pilot projects in two agencies\u2014one at USDA and two at EPA.", "The USDA pilot involved consolidation of its regulations on grants and loans for water and waste disposal from the former Rural Electrification Administration and the former Farmers Home Administration into the Rural Utilities Service. This consolidation was initiated because of a reorganization of responsibilities within USDA. Legislation implementing the new organizational structure was passed and signed into law in October 1994.

Under the final policy, issued in November 1995, EPA will defer to a state\u2019s decision to provide a small community compliance assistance and waive part or all of the noncompliance penalty if the community is working diligently and in good faith to achieve compliance. An EPA official said that the project was started because representatives of Oregon and Idaho came to EPA in 1994 and requested that the agency develop a program to work with small local governments to identify environmental compliance problems and develop new methods of addressing them. At the time of our review, only Oregon and Nebraska had active small community environmental compliance assistance programs; however, according to the EPA official, five additional states had applied to participate.", "The other EPA pilot involves a number of activities in which the agency worked with the Environmental Council of the States (ECOS) to facilitate its interactions with state and local governments. According to OMB\u2019s 1997 annual report on title II compliance, one of the key priorities of the effort was to promote flexible approaches to regulatory compliance for small governments.

The reorganization that USDA officials said prompted their pilot was recommended by the NPR in its September 1993 report. The EPA pilots appear related to an NPR recommendation that EPA improve environmental protection through increased flexibility for local governments. In our December 1994 report assessing the implementation of the recommendation, we noted that EPA had already formed its Small Town Task Force Advisory Committee to advise the EPA Administrator and recommend ways to increase flexibility for local governments. We also noted that EPA had established pilot projects in three states, one of which involved reviewing a community\u2019s environmental risks and developing priorities to target the most pressing environmental needs.

For example, we concluded that 78 of the 80 economically significant rules for which section 202 written statements were not on file at CBO did not require such a statement under the terms of the statute. Economically significant rules that may cost individuals or businesses more than $100 million per year are not covered by UMRA\u2019s requirement to develop a written statement if they (1) do not have an associated notice of proposed rulemaking; (2) do not impose an enforceable duty; (3) impose such a duty but only as a condition of federal assistance or as part of a voluntary program; or (4) do not involve an expenditure of $100 million in any 1 year by the private sector or by state, local, and tribal governments. Because section 205 of UMRA only applies to those rules for which a written statement is required, its reach is equally limited. The remaining two rules, which we believe should have had written statements, were EPA rules that complied with the substance of the UMRA written statement requirements.", "Sections 203 and 204 of UMRA also appeared to have had little impact on agencies\u2019 rulemaking actions. Agencies did not prepare small government plans for any of the 73 final rules that we examined. Officials in the 4 agencies that we contacted\u2014USDA, HHS, DOT, and EPA\u2014said that none of the 50 final rules within this group that they promulgated had a significant or unique effect on small governments requiring a section 203 small government plan. Officials in SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy generally concurred with the agencies\u2019 conclusions. OIRA and federal agencies said that only 2 of the 110 rules promulgated during the first 2 years of UMRA were significant federal intergovernmental mandates that required the development of a consultation process under section 204. Both of the rules were issued by EPA. Although two other EPA rules might have been significant intergovernmental mandates, the consultation process that the agency used for the other rules would satisfy the section 204 requirement for any mandates the agency developed.", "The second reason UMRA does not appear to have had much effect on the agencies\u2019 rulemaking actions is that it does not require agencies to take the actions required in the statute if the agencies determine that the actions are duplicative of other actions or that accurate estimates of the effect of the rule are not feasible. For example, section 202(c) of UMRA says that the written statement required in section 202(a) may be prepared \u201cin conjunction with or as part of any other statement or analysis\u201d as long as that statement or analysis contains the required information. Because the agencies\u2019 rules commonly contain the information that section 202(a) requires in the written statements, the agencies only rarely prepared a separate UMRA written statement. Subsection 202(a)(3) of UMRA says agencies\u2019 written statements must contain estimates of future compliance costs and any disproportionate budgetary effects \u201cif and to the extent that the agency determines that accurate estimates are reasonably feasible.\u201d Subsection 202(a)(4) says that the written statements must contain estimates of the effect on the national economy \u201cif and to the extent that the agency in its sole discretion determines that accurate estimates are reasonably feasible and that such effect is relevant and material.\u201d Therefore, an agency can omit these estimates from any written statement if it considers them inaccurate, unfeasible, or, in the case of subsection 202(a)(4), irrelevant or immaterial.", "The third reason UMRA does not appear to have had much effect on the agencies\u2019 rulemaking actions is that the act requires agencies to take certain actions that are either identical or similar to actions that they were already required to take or had completed, or that were under way. Because the scope of the previous requirements was usually much broader than the UMRA requirements, the following UMRA requirements did not appear to significantly alter the agencies\u2019 rulemaking actions:", "Section 202(a) of UMRA requires agencies to prepare a written statement containing an assessment of the costs and benefits of proposed federal mandates. Section 206 of UMRA says that the Director of OMB must collect the written statements from the agencies. However, Executive Order 12866, which was issued more than a year before UMRA, already required agencies to provide OIRA with assessments of the costs and benefits of all economically significant proposed rules, including some rules that were not mandates.", "Section 205 of UMRA requires agencies to identify a number of regulatory alternatives for proposed mandates and to select the least costly, most cost-effective, or least burdensome alternative that achieves the objectives of the rules.

The executive order also says that agencies\u2019 regulations should be cost-effective and impose the least burden on society.", "Section 204 of UMRA requires agencies to develop a process to consult with representatives of state, local, and tribal governments. However, the basic elements of the UMRA consultation process can be traced to the notice and comment requirements in the APA, which was enacted nearly 50 years before UMRA. More specifically, Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to seek the views of state, local, and tribal officials before imposing regulatory requirements that might significantly or uniquely affect them. Executive Order 12875, which was also issued more than a year before UMRA, requires agencies to \u201cdevelop an effective process to permit elected officials of state, local, and tribal governments to provide meaningful and timely input in the development of regulatory proposals containing significant unfunded mandates\u201d\u2014language that is almost identical to section 204 of UMRA.", "Officials in the agencies where the section 207 pilot programs were established said that the pilots were not initiated to satisfy UMRA requirements. Two of the pilots began before the enactment of UMRA, and all three pilots were similar or related to initiatives already under way as part of the administration\u2019s NPR management reform initiative.", "The committee reports for the Senate bill that led to the adoption of UMRA indicate that Congress was aware that the bill duplicated existing requirements in many respects. For example, the report by the Senate Committee on the Budget stated that, except for the requirement for small government plans, \u201cthe bill will not impose new requirements for agencies to implement in the regulatory process . . . .\u201d", "Regulatory reform legislation currently under consideration by Congress also contains some requirements that are similar to those in Executive Order 12866 and existing statutes. For example, S. 981 would require agencies to conduct cost-benefit analyses for what are essentially economically significant rules and, as part of those analyses, to evaluate a reasonable number of alternative approaches reflecting the range of regulatory options that would achieve the objective of the statute. Therefore, if agencies are already performing those analyses to comply with the executive order, codification of the requirements through S. 981 would not impose significant additional requirements for those rules.", "However, the provisions in S. 981 are different from existing requirements in several other respects. First, the bill would cover more rules than are covered by UMRA or Executive Order 12866. For example, S. 981 would cover many independent regulatory agencies, whereas both UMRA and the executive order exclude independent regulatory agencies. Also, the analytical requirements in S. 981 would be broader than those in UMRA. UMRA requires that cost-benefit analyses be conducted for only a small group of rules that contain a narrowly defined mandate and that may result in expenditures of $100 million in any 1 year by state, local, or tribal governments, in the aggregate, or the private sector. S. 981, on the other hand, generally would cover all rules that have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or that the Director of OMB declares to be a major rule.", "S. 981 also would address a number of topics that are not addressed by either UMRA or Executive Order 12866. For example, the bill includes requirements that agencies conduct risk assessments for certain rules and have those risk assessments and any cost-benefit analyses peer reviewed. Neither UMRA nor the executive order contain such requirements.
