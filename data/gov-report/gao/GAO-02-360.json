We  agreed to determine (1) whether damage, vandalism, or pranks occurred in  the White House and the adjacent Eisenhower Executive Office Building  (EEOB) during the transition by obtaining the observations of Executive  Office of the President (EOP) staff and preparers of White House office  space during the transition and reviewing any available documentation, as  well as obtaining the comments of former Clinton administration staff; (2)  to the extent possible, how the 2001 presidential transition compared with  previous presidential transitions in terms of damage, vandalism, or pranks;  and (3) what steps, if any, should be taken to help prevent and document  any vandalism during future presidential transitions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["On January 29, 2001, you wrote us that you had become increasingly  concerned about media reports of damage to the White House and the  EEOB that was discovered by the incoming Bush administration and asked  that we investigate whether damage may have been deliberately caused by  former Clinton administration staff.  We subsequently asked EOP and the  General Services Administration (GSA) whether they had any information  that may be responsive to your request.  On April 18, 2001, the director of  the Office of Administration (OA), an EOP unit, wrote us a letter indicating  that the White House had no record of damage that \u201cmay have been  deliberately caused by employees of the prior dministration\u201d and that  \u201c.\u2026repair records do not contain information that would allow someone to  determine the cause of damage that is being repaired.\u201d", "In late May and early June 2001, these allegations resurfaced in the news  media and on June 4, you asked us to investigate the matter further.  On  June 5, 2001, the counsel to the president provided us with a list of damage  that was discovered in the White House complex during the first days of the  Bush administration.  In his transmittal letter, the counsel to the president  said that the list \u201c\u2026may be responsive to your earlier request for written  records documenting damage deliberately caused by employees of the  prior dministration\u2026.\u201d  Further, the counsel said that the list was not the  result of a comprehensive or systematic investigation into the issue and  should not be considered a complete record of the damage that was found.   The list was prepared by OA, which provides common administrative  support and services to units within the White House complex, which may  include the procurement and maintenance of computers, telephones,  furniture, and other personal property.  OA prepared the list on the basis of  the recollections of five EOP officials with responsibilities in the areas of  administration, management, telephones, facilities, and supplies.  It listed  missing building fixtures, such as doorknobs and a presidential seal;  computer keyboards with missing \u201cW\u201d keys; damaged and overturned  furniture; telephone lines pulled from the wall; telephones with missing  telephone number labels; fax machines moved to the wrong areas and a  secure telephone left open with the key in it; offices left in a state of  \u201cgeneral trashing,\u201d including the contents of desk drawers dumped on the  floor, a glass desk top smashed and on the floor, and refrigerators  unplugged with spoiled food; writing on the walls; and voice mail greetings  that had obscene messages.  The list also indicated that six to eight 14-foot  trucks were needed to recover usable supplies that had been thrown away.", "The EOP consists of a number of units, including the White House Office,  the Office of the Vice President, the National Security Council (NSC), and  OA.  The White House Office is composed of staff who directly support  and advance the president\u2019s goals and are commonly referred to as \u201cWhite  House staff.\u201d  Offices of the White House Office include, but are not limited  to, advance, cabinet affairs, communications, counsel, the first lady,  legislative affairs, management and administration, political affairs,  presidential personnel, press secretary, public liaison, and scheduling.   Although White House Office staff generally leave their positions at the end  of an administration, many EOP staff at agencies such as the NSC and OA  hold their positions during consecutive administrations.  In this report, we  referred to staff who are working or worked in the White House complex  during the current administration as \u201cEOP staff\u201d and staff who worked in  the previous administration and no longer worked in the White House  complex after January 20, 2001, as \u201cformer Clinton administration staff.\u201d", "The White House complex consists of several buildings, including the  White House, the adjacent EEOB, and the New Executive Office Building  (NEOB).  This report focuses on observations that were made in the West  Wing of the White House and the EEOB during the transition, and not the  White House residence or the NEOB.  Excluding military staff, most White  House Office staff work in the East and West Wings of the White House or  the EEOB.  GSA maintains the White House office space, including cleaning  the offices and repairing the physical structure.  OA asks GSA to repair  furniture in the White House complex.  Some EOP agencies, such as the  Office of the Vice President, also handle some of their own administrative  functions.  The Secret Service, a unit of the Department of the Treasury, is  responsible for the security of the White House complex and its occupants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To obtain information regarding observations of damage, vandalism, and  pranks, we interviewed the five EOP officials who contributed to the June  2001 list (the OA director, the OA associate director for facilities  management, the OA associate director for general services, the  management office director, and the telephone service director); the OA  associate director for information systems and technology; an on-site  manager for a contractor providing telecommunications services in the  White House complex; the Secret Service deputy special agent in charge,  presidential protection division, White House security branch; the director  of GSA\u2019s White House service center; the chief usher for the executive  residence; and four GSA cleaning crew leaders who worked in the White  House complex during the transition.", "We also sent letters to 518 EOP staff who worked in the West Wing and  EEOB during the first 3 weeks of the Bush administration, asking those  who observed any damage, vandalism, or pranks during the weeks  surrounding the 2001 transition to arrange a meeting with us through the  Office of White House Counsel.  We believed that staff who were in the  complex during the first 3 weeks of the administration were the most likely  staff to have observed damage, vandalism, or pranks.  The Office of White  House Counsel arranged for interviews with a total of 78 EOP staff, and an  associate counsel to the president was present during our interviews with  EOP staff.  Of the 78 staff, 23 worked for the EOP before January 20, 2001,  and 55 began working for the EOP on or after January 20.  The interviews  with EOP staff were conducted between June 2001 and May 2002.  Because  these interviews were conducted between 5 and 16 months after the  transition, we recognize that recollections could have been imprecise. It  was not possible to determine whether, in all cases, the reported incidents  had occurred, when they occurred, why they occurred, and who may have  been responsible for them.  More detailed information about our  methodology in reporting the observations is contained in appendix I.", "To determine if any documentation existed that may not have been  previously located, we asked the EOP, GSA, and the Secret Service to  provide any documentation they had regarding damage or theft reports,  requests for repairs, and invoices for items that had to be purchased.  In a  June 6, 2001, letter to an associate counsel to the president, we said that  \u201cwe will need access to any records and documents maintained by the  White House, GSA, the Secret Service, or other organizations at the White  House that relate to the alleged damage as well as to federal employees and  contractors working at the White House who might have information  bearing on the allegations.\u201d", "We also interviewed a total of 29 GSA staff who prepared the office space  for the new administration.  In addition, we interviewed two National  Archives and Records Administration (NARA) staff who worked in the  White House complex to assemble presidential materials during the last  days of the Clinton administration about their observations; a contract  employee who helped discard keyboards from the EOP after the transition;  and an official from the White House Communications Agency (WHCA),  which handles communications equipment for the White House.", "After interviewing EOP and GSA staff about their observations, we  interviewed a total of 72 former Clinton administration staff to obtain their  comments on the allegations during the 2001 transition and to obtain their  observations about the 1993 transition.  We interviewed 35 former Clinton  administration staff who were identified by the senior advisor for  presidential transition during the Clinton administration as having worked  in the White House complex during the 1993 or 2001 transitions.  We also  contacted an additional 37 former Clinton administration staff because  they were former directors, managers, or representatives from the primary  offices where observations were made.  We did not, however, obtain  comments from former Clinton administration staff regarding every  observation.  Of the 72 former Clinton administration staff we interviewed,  67 worked in the White House complex during the 2001 transition and 19  worked there during the 1993 transition.  Five of the 72 former Clinton  administration staff we interviewed left before the end of the  administration, but had worked in the White House complex during the  1993 transition.", "We obtained repair or replacement costs for some of the observed  incidents.  However, as explained in more detail later in this report, we did  not request cost information associated with all of the observations  because we did not believe certain costs would be material or readily  available.  We also believed that the effort that would have been needed to  obtain and verify cost data for all observed incidents would not have been  commensurate with the benefit of having reported the information.   Further, although certain repair and replacement costs were provided, it  was unclear what portion of these costs was incurred or will be incurred  due to vandalism.", "To determine how the 2001 presidential transition compared with others in  terms of damage, we asked 14 EOP and 2 GSA staff who worked in the  White House complex during previous transitions about their recollections  of damage, vandalism, or pranks during previous transitions.  In addition,  we reviewed news media reports to identify any reported damage,  vandalism, or pranks during previous transitions.  We searched for news  reports concerning the 1981, 1989, and 1993 transitions.", "We assessed what steps could be taken to help prevent and document any  damage during future presidential transitions by discussing the issue with  GSA and EOP officials and by obtaining the check-out procedures for  departing Clinton administration staff.  We also discussed check-out  procedures with personnel responsible for the office space and equipment  at the U.S. Capitol, including staff from the Office of the Chief  Administrative Officer, House of Representatives; Office of Customer  Relations, Office of the Senate Sergeant-at-Arms; and Office of the Building  Superintendent, Office of the Architect of the Capitol.  We contacted them  because the change of staff and offices on Capitol Hill after elections  appeared somewhat comparable to the turnover of EOP staff at the end of  an administration.  We did our work from June 2001 to May 2002 in  Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["Damage, theft, vandalism, and pranks did occur in the White House  complex during the 2001 presidential transition.

In addition, documentation provided indicated that some  broken, missing, or possibly stolen items were repaired or replaced at the  beginning of the Bush administration.  Several EOP staff said they believed  that what they observed during the transition, such as broken furniture and  excessive trash left behind, was done intentionally.", "Some former Clinton administration staff acknowledged that they had  observed a few keyboards with missing \u201cW\u201d keys and some prank signs at  the end of the administration.  However, the former Clinton administration  staff we interviewed also said that (1) the amount of trash that was  observed during the transition was what could be expected when staff  move out of their offices after 8 years; (2) they did not take the items that  were discovered missing; (3) some furniture was broken, but not  intentionally, before the transition and little money was spent on repairs  and upkeep during the administration; and (4) many of the reported  observations were not of vandalism.  Further, two former Clinton  administration representatives told us that, in their opinion, most of the  observations were not true.", "Incidents such as the removal of keys from computer keyboards; the theft  of various items; the leaving of certain voice mail messages, signs, and  written messages; and the placing of glue on desk drawers, clearly were  done intentionally.  Any intentional damage at the White House complex,  which is a national treasure, is both inappropriate and a serious matter.   The theft of or willful damage to government property would constitute a  criminal act in violation of federal law.  Although it is clear that some of the  reported incidents were intentional, such as the removal and damaging of  keys on computer keyboards, it was unclear whether, in all cases, the  reported incidents occurred, when they occurred, how many occurred, and  who was responsible for them.  In addition, regarding the items reported  missing, it was not known whether all of them were thefts, and if they were,  who was responsible for them.", "Some documentation corroborating a number of the observations existed.   EOP facilities, computer, and telephone officials said that much repair and  replacement work was done during the transition without documentation  being prepared because of the need to complete the work quickly.  The OA  associate director for facilities management, for example, said that no  documentation was prepared regarding three to four missing office signs, a  doorknob, and two or three medallions (small metal presidential seals  affixed to office signs) that were replaced during that time.  Further,  documentation was provided indicating that much telephone service work  was done during the transition, but this information did not directly  corroborate allegations of vandalism and pranks involving the telephones."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Observations of EOP Staff and Related Documentation", "paragraphs": ["Seventy-eight EOP staff who worked in the White House complex during  the 2001 transition provided observations about the condition of the  complex shortly before or at the beginning of the administration.

The observations  generally reflected the types of incidents included in the June 2001 list and  also included additional items that were not on it.  In certain categories, the  observations of EOP staff differed from the June 2001 list in terms of the  total numbers of incidents or the alleged extent of the damage.  More  observations of damage, vandalism, and pranks were made on the first  floor of the EEOB in the offices of advance and scheduling, the counsel\u2019s  offices, and the offices of the first lady; and on the second floor of the  EEOB in the offices of the vice president, than in other offices.", "Summarized below are observations made in specific locations in the main  categories, related comments from former Clinton administration staff and  GSA staff, and any documentation relating to the observations.

They said some of these were derogatory and offensive in nature  about the president, and sometimes there were multiple copies in  certain locations. Six EOP staff also said that they had observed writing  on the walls (words) in a total of two rooms. Thirteen former Clinton  administration staff said that they saw a total of 10 to 27 prank signs in  the EEOB during the transition, but one former employee also said that  the prank signs that she saw were harmless jokes.", "In June and November 2001, EOP staff provided copies of 2 prank  signs that they said were found during the transition, which were  derogatory jokes about the president and vice president.  In August  and September 2001, we were also shown a roll of political stickers  that were left behind and 2 stickers affixed to a file cabinet and desk  containing derogatory statements about the president.", "Twenty-six EOP staff said that they observed a total of 30 to 64  computer keyboards with missing or damaged \u201cW\u201d keys.

EOP also  provided two blanket work orders and four individual work orders  that cited relabeling or placing labels on telephones for which the  summary document did not mention labels.

The former occupant of the main  room in that office suite said that he did not observe any computer or  telephone cords that were cut or torn out of walls, and that his office  only had 5 telephone and computer cords.", "Observations of damage, vandalism, or pranks were reported by EOP staff  in about 100 of about 1,074 rooms in the EEOB and in 8 of about 137 rooms  in the East and West Wings of the White House.  According to the OA  associate director for facilities management, approximately 395 offices  were vacated during the transition:  304 in the EEOB, 54 in the West Wing,  and 37 in the East Wing.  In the overwhelming majority of cases, one person  said that he or she observed a specific incident in a particular location.   However, more than one person observed most types of incidents.  In  addition, we were generally unable to determine when the observed  incidents occurred and who was responsible for them because no one said  he or she saw people carrying out what was observed or said that he or she  was responsible for what was observed, with three exceptions: (1) an EOP  employee who said she saw a volunteer remove an office sign from a wall,  (2) a former Clinton administration employee who said he wrote a  \u201cgoodwill\u201d message inside the drawer of his former desk, and (3) another  former Clinton administration employee who said that he left what he  believed to be a humorous voice mail message greeting at the end of the  administration.  Further, we were told that many contractor staff, such as  movers and cleaners, were working in the White House complex during the  weekend of January 20 and 21, 2001, but the White House did not provide  the data we had requested regarding visitors to the EEOB during that  time.", "From our interviews of EOP staff, we totaled the number of incidents that  were observed in the categories indicated in the June 2001 list of damage.   In certain categories, the observations of EOP staff differed from the list in  terms of the total numbers of incidents or alleged extent of the damage.   For example, regarding the statement contained in the June 2001 list that  100 keyboards had to replaced because the \u201cW\u201d keys were removed, EOP  staff provided different estimates of the number of keyboards that had to  be replaced because of missing or damaged keys, ranging from about 33  keyboards to 150 keyboards.  As a result, we could not determine how  many keyboards were actually replaced because of missing or damaged  \u201cW\u201d keys.  Regarding the statement contained in the list that furniture in six  offices was damaged severely enough to require a complete refurbishment  or destruction, we were told that 16 to 21 pieces of broken furniture were  observed during the transition.  This included 5 to 7 chairs with broken legs  or backs, but we did not obtain any documentation indicating that they  were either completely refurbished or destroyed.  The EOP provided  photographs of 4 pieces of furniture that, according to an associate counsel  to the president, were moved to an EOP remote storage facility that is now  quarantined.

However,  it was unknown whether other observations, such as broken furniture,  were the result of intentional acts, when and how they occurred, or who  may have been responsible for them.  Further, with regard to stolen items,  such as the presidential seal, because no one witnessed the thefts and  many people were in the White House complex during the transition, it was  not known who was responsible for taking them.  Moreover, regarding  other items reported missing, such as doorknobs, cellular telephones, and  television remote controls, it was unknown whether all of them were  thefts, and if they were, who was responsible for taking those items and  when they were taken.

Our report includes the  information (1) we agreed to provide to Representative Barr, (2) to support  our conclusions and recommendations, and (3) to comply with  Government Auditing Standards.  As provided for under our  congressional protocols when we receive congressional requests, we work  with the requesters to agree on a scope of work and an approach that takes  into consideration a number of factors.  They include the nature of the  issues raised; the likelihood of being able to address them in a fair,  objective, and complete manner; a consideration of professional standards,  rules of evidence, and the nature and sufficiency of evidence likely to be  available on the particular engagement; known or possible constraints  related to obtaining the information needed; and the time and resources  needed and available to accomplish the work.  For this review, after  independently taking these factors into consideration, we used a thorough,  reasonable approach to provide as complete and objective a picture as  possible of the damage that may have occurred during the 2001 presidential  transition, given that (1) we could not physically observe evidence of most  of the incidents that were reportedly observed, (2) limited definitive  documentation was available regarding these events, and (3) views of  interested parties would likely differ on many issues and would be difficult  or impossible to reconcile.  Accordingly, we agreed to respond to  Representative Barr\u2019s request by reporting on the documentation provided  by the White House; summarizing the observations made by occupants and  preparers of White House office space during the 2001 transition; and  obtaining explanations and other comments of former Clinton  administration staff related to any damage, vandalism, or pranks.  We  neither agreed to nor performed an investigation into who may have been  responsible for any damage, vandalism, or pranks identified, nor did we  agree to report each individual observation.", "We reported all observations in a summary fashion (i.e., total number of  observations in a particular category) and discussed some observations in  detail when warranted.  For example, in the section of appendix I regarding  furniture, we not only provided the total number of pieces of broken  furniture that people observed, but also described the specific problems  they observed.  However, regarding other categories of observations, such  as missing telephone labels, we did not provide details regarding each  observation because such information would not have been meaningful;  rather, we reported a range of the total number of telephone labels  observed missing.  Reporting each instance was not only unneeded, but  would have been redundant.  Further, we separately mentioned each  observation that was made in the White House itself.  Although we would  agree with the White House that the details about when, where, and by  whom observations were made may be relevant in assessing the credibility  of statements and determining the likely perpetrators, we do not believe  that reporting additional detail would have allowed readers to make sound,  independent conclusions.", "Although, as the White House correctly states, Government Auditing  Standards require audit reports to contain all the information needed to  satisfy audit objectives and promote a correct understanding of the matters  to be reported, these standards also recognize that considerable judgment  must be exercised in determining an appropriate amount and level of detail  to include.  Excessive detail can detract from a report, conceal the real  message, and confuse or discourage readers.  Consistent with these  professional standards, we believe that we have provided the appropriate  amount of detail needed to satisfy our objectives and support our  conclusions and recommendations.  In our view, reporting more detail  could, at a minimum, confuse readers and contribute to unproductive  speculation, rather than lead to sound conclusions.", "As we have reported, we believe that sufficient, competent, and relevant  evidence exists to support our conclusion that damage, vandalism, and  pranks did occur during the 2001 presidential transition, and we have  presented this evidence in our report.  However, we believe it is also  important to recognize that corroborating evidence was not provided for all  observations, and that definitive evidence regarding who was responsible  for the incidents observed generally was not provided.  In addition,  although a number of incidents appeared intentional by their nature, it  often was unknown whether other types of incidents were intentional,  malicious acts.  Accordingly, we do not believe it was appropriate to  include all of the details that the White House suggested because we did  not want to mislead readers into concluding that corroboration existed and  that all of the reported incidents occurred and were intentional, nor did we  believe it was appropriate to contribute to speculation about who may have  been responsible for any acts that were intentional for which credible  evidence was not provided.", "In its comments, the White House cited several cases where we failed to  report information regarding what staff said other people had seen or had  told them.  This is correct; in reporting the observations, we did not include  information people relayed to us from third parties.  We reported what  people told us they personally observed.  In addition, in certain cases, the  White House cited statements in its comments that it claimed staff had said  that were not contained in our interview records.  An associate counsel to  the president told us that, in preparing the White House\u2019s comments, she  discussed the accuracy of statements attributed to EOP staff in the report  draft with those individuals.  Had we known in advance that an associate  counsel to the president was going to recontact the EOP staff we  interviewed, we would have asked to participate in those discussions.   Since we did not participate in those discussions, we have no information  about the context or manner in which they took place.  Therefore, we  reported only what our interview records indicated EOP staff told us.", "Although we would typically confirm our understanding of statements  made to us during interviews directly with the interviewees whenever a  question or doubt arises, this was problematic in this review due to the  protocol established by the White House for our work.  Under this protocol,  we were asked to provide written requests for follow-up interviews or  additional documentation to the counsel\u2019s office, and all such interviews  were arranged by that office.  This was a time consuming process that at  times involved significant delays in gaining access to the individuals we  sought to interview.  Had we been granted direct, prompt access to the  people we needed to interview, we would have been in a better position to  have quickly and efficiently resolved any questions or misunderstandings  that may have arisen.  Nonetheless, with the exception of one follow-up  interview, at least two GAO staff attended interviews in the White House  complex, and we believe this approach provided reasonable assurance that  we accurately captured what the interviewees told us.", "Regarding the White House\u2019s statement that, in many cases, in reporting a  former staff member\u2019s comments in response to a particular observation,  we had not discussed the observation itself, each observation was included  in summary fashion, and in some cases, in detail, before we reported the  comments by former Clinton administration staff.  In a few cases, in  response to the White House\u2019s comments, we added additional detail  regarding an observation.  Moreover, although we reported every  observation in summary fashion, we did not obtain comments from former  Clinton administration staff regarding all observations, nor did we report  every comment provided by former Clinton administration staff.  Further,  we did not report positive actions that people said former Clinton  administration staff had taken to facilitate the transition or welcome new  staff because they did not directly relate to the allegations.", "Regarding the specific contents of graffiti, messages, and signs, we did not  believe that it was appropriate or necessary to report their specific  contents.  Although most of the messages reportedly observed or heard did  not contain profane language, some of them did.  However, we will not  report them and, thus, we decided to redact an obscene word that the  White House included in its comments in reference to a message that was  found. Further, although we did not report their specific content, we  described the general nature of those messages.  We believe that the White  House is being speculative in suggesting that reporting their specific  content would provide indications of who wrote them and when they were  written and would provide an insight into the mind-set of the person who  wrote them.  Further, although whoever left a vulgar or derogatory message  could have been responsible for other incidents that were observed near  the location of the message, no substantive evidence was presented linking  messages to other incidents that were observed.  We also do not believe  that reporting the specific contents would have provided a meaningful  opportunity to compare the 2001 transition to previous ones because we  also did not report the specific content of signs and messages that were  found during previous transitions, nor was there sufficient information  about the condition of White House office space during previous  transitions to make a meaningful comparison.", "In a draft of this report, we had characterized a sticker that said \u201cjail to the  thief\u201d as being \u201carguably\u201d derogatory to the president because we did not  know the intent of the person who left the message.

With respect to the White House\u2019s objection to our  redaction of a word contained in a sign found during the transition, the  word in question is clearly obscene and, in our independent and  professional judgment, should not be used in a public report that bears  GAO\u2019s name. As a result, we have deleted this word from the White House\u2019s  comments, used \u201c*\u201d to reflect the number of letters in the word, and  indicated that GAO deleted an obscenity. By doing so, we believe that  readers will know that an unacceptable word was used in a message left in  the White House complex during the 2001 presidential transition.  In  addition, because the word was part of its comments, we will refer  inquiries about this matter to the White House.

We believe this approach is the most accurate and objective  depiction of views that were shared with us.  Further, we did not conclude  what the precise numbers of incidents observed in various categories were  because they would have been impossible to determine.

To address the White House\u2019s comment that the term \u201cEOP\u201d may be  over-inclusive, we added a note to the report indicating that we did not  interview, for example, any staff who worked for the United States Trade  Representative, the Office of National Drug Control Policy, or the Office of  Homeland Security.

Notwithstanding this technicality, we had listed the  Executive Residence as an EOP component because it is shown as such in  the White House staff manual that was in effect at the time of the transition  and in the Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2003.  To  recognize the White House\u2019s comments about this issue, however, we  deleted the Executive Residence from our list of EOP components.", "On the other hand, we do not agree with the White House\u2019s objection to our  characterization of EOP components as agencies.

Rather, we tried to eliminate possible or actual  double-counting of observations, present the information fairly and  objectively, and avoid speculation.  Regarding the White House\u2019s statement  (1) that we omitted a reference to each reported instance of vandalism,  damage or a prank, as previously explained, all of the reported  observations were reported in a summary fashion (i.e., total number of  observations in a particular category) and some were also discussed in  detail.  We also disagree with the White House\u2019s statement (2) that we  underreported the number of observations in nearly every category of  damage and ignored additional observations that were made.  As  previously explained and discussed in appendix V in our response to the  White House\u2019s specific comments, we reported the number of observations  in various categories as a means of eliminating possible or actual double-  counting.  Regarding the White House\u2019s statement (3) that we omitted any  mention of several individuals who told us that the damage found during  this transition was worse than prior transitions, the letter portion of the  report summarized these individuals\u2019 observations, and appendix II  contained statements by six EOP staff that the condition of the White  House complex was worse in 2001 than during previous transitions.   Consequently, we did not revise the report.  Regarding the White House\u2019s  statement (4) that we ignored documents that showed requests were made  to repair telephone damage and clean offices, the report in fact cited  several facility requests for cleaning and telephone service orders, but we  could not conclude that they documented intentional damage.  This  conclusion is inconsistent with the OA director\u2019s April 2001 letter in which  he stated that repair records do not indicate the cause of repairs.  Further,  we did not ignore any of the documentation that the EOP provided, but  carefully reviewed all of the documentation that was provided.  Finally, the  White House did not provide us with copies of all of the documents related  to telephone repairs that it cited in its comments.", "Regarding the White House\u2019s statement (5) that we failed to quantify or  estimate certain real costs incurred to remedy or repair the damage, it was  not our objective to independently estimate or determine all such costs,  and we clearly stated in our report that we did not do so.  We did not obtain  repair and replacement costs for all reported incidents because we did not  believe that they would be readily available or material, nor did we believe  that the value of the information would have been commensurate with the  level of resources required to obtain and verify such data.  Regarding the  White House\u2018s statement (6) that we failed to report the content of graffiti  and signs that were found in the complex, as previously discussed, we did  not believe it was necessary or appropriate to include their specific content  in this report, but we did describe their general nature.  Finally, contrary to  the White House\u2019s assertion (7) that we were unwilling to conclude that the  vandalism, damage, and pranks were intentional, even where the  circumstances plainly indicated that they were, we stated in our  conclusions that incidents such as the removal of keys from computer  keyboards; the theft of various items; the leaving of certain voice mail  messages, signs, and written messages; and the placing of glue on desk  drawers clearly were done intentionally.  However, we also concluded that  it was unknown whether other observations, such as broken furniture,  were the result of intentional acts and when and how they occurred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government Auditing Standards", "paragraphs": ["In its specific comments, the White House identified instances in which it  did not believe that the oral evidence or the amount of detail included in  the report was sufficient to meet provisions of the Government Auditing  Standards pertaining to the competency of evidence or the objectivity and  completeness of reports.  Although we address the White House\u2019s specific  substantive points in appendix V of our report, we believe that it is  important to state here that the report does comply with Government  Auditing Standards.  In citing the particular standard in question, the  White House either did not cite the entire standard or all of the factors that  must be considered in interpreting the standard, or both.  For example, in  discussing the competency of the oral evidence provided by an EOP  employee, the White House described the employee\u2019s overall responsibility  for handling telecommunications problems during the first month of the  new administration and cited the following excerpt from Government  Auditing Standards 6.54(f): Testimonial evidence obtained from an individual who\u2026has complete  knowledge about the area is more competent than testimonial evidence  obtained from an individual who\u2026has only partial knowledge about an  area.", "However, in addition to excluding a portion of this standard, the White  House did not refer to other parts of standard 6.54 or other factors that  need to be considered.  Other relevant parts of standard 6.54 follow: 6.54  The following presumptions are useful in judging the competence  of evidence.  However, these presumptions are not to be considered  sufficient in themselves to determine competence. 6.54(e)  Testimonial evidence obtained under conditions where persons  may speak freely is more competent than testimonial evidence  obtained under compromising conditions (for example, where the  persons may be intimidated). 6.54 (f)  Testimonial evidence obtained from an individual who is not  biased or has complete knowledge about the area is more competent  than testimonial evidence obtained from an individual who is biased or  has only partial knowledge about the area.", "Thus, in considering the competency of oral evidence, other factors besides  a person\u2019s level of responsibility must be considered, such as the  circumstance under which they provide the oral information; whether they  are reporting what they observed versus what someone else said they saw;  factors that could influence their objectivity; the reasonableness or  consistency of the information presented compared to other information or  facts; and the extent to which corroborating or contradictory information  is provided.  We gave appropriate and careful consideration of all of these  factors in conducting this review.", "Similarly, in interpreting other Government Auditing Standards, such as  those related to the objectivity or completeness of reports, considerable  judgment must be exercised regarding the amount of detail provided to  promote an adequate and complete understanding of the matters reported  and to present the information in an unbiased manner with appropriate  balance and tone.  This must be done so that readers can be persuaded by  facts, as called for by the standards (7.50, 7.51, and 7.57).  In making  judgments about the level of detail to provide, it must be recognized that  too much detail can detract from a report, as previously discussed.  But,  even more importantly, aside from the level of detail, the competency and  sufficiency of the evidence and completeness of information must be  considered, including differentiating between uncorroborated oral  statements and substantiated facts.  In judging what details to report and  how to report them, it is also important to consider what information is not  known about particular situations so as to avoid misleading readers into  drawing inappropriate or premature conclusions.", "Notwithstanding our disagreement with the White House\u2019s interpretation of  Government Auditing Standards, we agree that efforts should be made to  avoid possible misinterpretation of information in audit reports.  In that  regard, we have clarified our report where we felt it was appropriate.", "Finally, both in its general and specific comments, the White House  expressed concern about our exclusion of certain EOP staff observations  in the report, or what it views as our lack of consideration of the  documentation it provided and our unwillingness to draw the same  conclusions it did based on the information at hand.  We believe that it is  important to note here that many of the observations in question involved  relaying views espoused by others, which we do not believe is acceptable  evidence in these cases.

However, regarding other  observations, we generally could not make judgments about whether they  were acts of vandalism because we did not have information regarding who  was responsible for them, when they occurred, or why they occurred.   Further, in most cases, we were unable to determine the exact number of  incidents.  When staff said they observed different numbers of incidents in  the same location and/or category, we did not attempt to make judgments  regarding which account was correct; rather, we used ranges.

In addition, when an  individual provided a range of the number of items that he or she saw, we  included that range in our calculation of the total range of observations for  that category.  When people said they observed incidents, but did not  provide a specific number, we did not estimate a number, but noted this  situation when relevant.

In early 2001, when the press first asked about damage found in the complex, the President said that \u201c t\u2019s time now to move forward.\u201d", "Members of this Administration went to great lengths to dampen public interest in the issue, hoping \u2013 as Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said at the time \u2013 \u201cto put it all behind us\u201d and to \u201cfocus  . . . just do the job that the American people elected President Bush to do.\u201d  We certainly did not instigate an investigation by the General Accounting Office (GAO), nor revel at the prospect of such an inquiry.  However, once the GAO agreed to undertake the investigation, we agreed to cooperate fully.   We have done so.  And we now believe that, if there is to be a report, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the facts are accurately and fully reported.", "With that goal in mind, and as a matter of comity between the legislative and executive branches, we provide the GAO with the following comments. We have now provided the GAO with two rounds of extensive comments on their draft.  Our first round of comments were provided on April 26, 2002.  Unfortunately, the GAO\u2019s revised draft, which we received on May 3, failed to address many of the concerns we had raised.  Accordingly, we have now provided a second set of detailed comments on the May 3rd draft. We now understand that GAO intends to publish a response to our comments as an appendix to its final report.  We are disappointed that we will not have an opportunity to consider or reply to GAO\u2019s responses to our comments prior to publication of the final report.", "Part I of the comments describes some general concerns about the overall structure, content, and use of terminology in the draft report.  Part II offers more specific comments.  And Part III addresses the GAO\u2019s proposed recommendations.  In preparing these comments, we have consulted with representatives of the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Administration, the United States Secret Service, and others, on issues involving those entities or their personnel.", "We have also identified to the GAO the source of all factual information and statements cited herein.", "Part I:  General Comments 1.  Failure To Report Material Facts.  The GAO has not included in its draft report many facts that a reader needs, in our view, to have a complete and accurate understanding of what happened during the 2001 transition.  In calling for this investigation, Congressman Barr asked the GAO to \u201cto fully document the reported examples of vandalism.\u201d  And section 7.51 of the Government Auditing Standards \u201crequires that  report contain all information needed to satisfy the audit objectives  promote an adequate and correct understanding of the matters reported.\u201d  In our view, neither Congressman Barr\u2019s directive nor the Government Auditing Standard has been met.", "For example, the GAO does not specifically identify anywhere in its report, including the appendices, each reported instance of vandalism, damage, or a prank.  The GAO\u2019s omission is troubling not only because it ignores the explicit request of the sole Member of Congress who requested the investigation (\u201cto fully document\u201d), but also because the GAO seems willing to detail each comment made by a former staff member.  Thus in many cases, the GAO has included a former staff member\u2019s comment in response to a particular observation without ever having discussed the observation itself.  We believe that the GAO should treat observations by current staff members in the same manner it treats comments by former staff members.  We also believe that the report should refer to each observation of damage individually.", "The GAO also omits from its report details about when, where, and by whom an observation was made.  When an incident was observed is often relevant to determining the likely perpetrator.  For example, the damage, vandalism, and pranks were often observed during the night of January 19 \u2013 before the cleaning staff began cleaning offices and before members of the Bush Administration entered the complex \u2013 and thus eliminating those individuals as the possible culprits.  Where damage was found is relevant, for example, because often more than one incident and type of damage was observed in the same location; a concentration of damage (such as that found in the Vice President\u2019s West Wing and EEOB offices) makes it less likely, in our view, that an innocent explanation exists.  Finally, who made the observation can bear on issues of credibility; if staff who served in the White House complex during many Administrations observed the damage, as was often the case, then a reader may find the observation more credible than if a member of the incoming Bush Administration reported the same observation.", "The report also does not contain the content of the graffiti, messages, and signs.  We were told that the GAO thinks it is \u201cnot appropriate\u201d to include such vulgar and disparaging statements about the President of the United States.  While we agree that the statements themselves are \u201cnot appropriate,\u201d particularly when affixed to government property, and while we certainly do not wish to propagate such maledictions, we believe that including the content in the report is important for at least five reasons.", "First, the content of the message can \u2013 and often does \u2013 indicate who wrote the message and when.", "Second, the content often provides an insight into the mindset or intention of the person who wrote the message.  This is important because it allows the reader to determine for himself whether the statements were \u201charmless jokes\u201d or \u201cgoodwill\u201d messages, as former Clinton Administration officials now claim (see Report at 10 and 17).", "Third, the content also allows the reader to infer that, if departing staff left a vulgar or derogatory message, those same individuals may also be responsible for other incidents that were observed near the location of the message.", "Fourth, the content of the messages and other details equip the reader to compare the 2001 transition and prior transitions.", "Finally, the content of the message allows the reader to assess whether the GAO\u2019s characterization of the observations is fair and objective.  For instance, in its report, the GAO describes a particular message as \u201carguably derogatory to the President.\u201d  Report at 10.  That message reads, \u201cjail to the thief.\u201d  But because the report does not reveal the content of the statement, readers have no way of knowing whether the GAO is accurate in describing the message as \u201carguably derogatory.\u201d  By disclosing the content of the messages and other important details about the reported observations, the GAO can best assure the objectivity of the entire report.", "Because we believe these details are important, many of our comments highlight facts that the GAO omitted.  These facts are undisputed.  The GAO omitted them from its report, we were told, not because it has reason to doubt their truth, but because the GAO concluded that it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d to include this level of detail and that the facts were not \u201cmaterial\u201d to the GAO\u2019s conclusions.  On this, we simply disagree.  By including these facts in our comments and explaining their relevance, we hope that the GAO will recognize the deficiencies in the current draft and revise the final report accordingly.  If not, the facts will be in our comments for the readers to judge for themselves. 2.  The \u201cJune 2001 List.\u201d   Throughout the draft report, the GAO refers to a \u201cJune 2001 list.\u201d", "The GAO structures its report around the list and compares the staff members\u2019 observations with the content of the list.  The GAO uses the list in this manner even though the Counsel to the President cautioned the GAO, in transmitting the list, that he list is not the result of a comprehensive or systematic investigation into the issue, and should not be considered a complete record of the damage that was found.  Rather, the list was prepared quickly and based on the recollections of a handful of individuals who witnessed or learned of the damage.", "Further, the GAO never even asked the individuals whose names appear on the list to explain how the list was prepared, who transcribed it, what its purpose was, or what each line refers to.  Nonetheless, the GAO features the list prominently in its draft report as some type of benchmark or guidepost against which the observations are measured.", "Worse, the GAO often misstates the contents of the list.  For instance, on page 3, the draft report states that \u201ct listed . . . offices with a lot of trash.\u201d  In fact, the list states that \u201cffices were left in a state of general trashing.\u201d  (And under that heading are three bullet points that read, \u201cContents of drawers dumped on floor,\u201d \u201cDesk top glass smashed and on the floor,\u201d and \u201cRefrigerators unplugged (spoiled food).\u201d)  We highlighted the GAO\u2019s error \u2013 that in today\u2019s parlance saying an office was \u201cgenerally trashed\u201d is not the same as saying it had \u201ca lot of trash\u201d \u2013 in our April 26 comments on the GAO\u2019s preliminary findings.  But for some reason, the GAO chose to ignore us.  We will continue to note this type of error in this set of comments to allow the GAO another opportunity to correct the record and, in all events, to inform the reader about what the list actually says. 3.  Flawed Analysis.  Rather than \u201cfully document\u201d each observation, the GAO generally states only \u201ca range\u201d of the \u201ctotal\u201d number of observations for each category of damage.  While we would prefer that that GAO simply provide the underlying data, if the GAO includes these ranges, they must be correct.  In our opinion, they are not.  The GAO materially understates the number of observations, and its methodology for calculating the ranges, in our view, is flawed.", "Here is the problem.  The GAO said that, in calculating the \u201ctotal\u201d observations, it is crediting as true each person\u2019s observation.  Yet, the GAO reports a range that takes the lowest number of observations in an office suite and then aggregates that lowest-possible number for each suite to arrive at the low end of the range.  For the high end, the GAO, by and large, adds up each observation and assumes that no observer is repeating an observation reported by anyone else.  Two examples \u2013 one taken from a data table which the GAO provided to us and the other a hypothetical \u2013 illustrate the flaw in this approach.", "No. for report (reason) 2-8 (used range for different recollections)", "Adv. (174, 185, 185\u00bd)", "1-7 (used range for different 4  (observed by three persons) recollections)", "Under the GAO\u2019s methodology, and this data, the GAO would say that 10 staff members reported \u201ca total of\u201d 3 to 15 damaged keyboards observed in the two office suites.  But that is incorrect if, as the GAO says, all observations are being treated as truthful.  One person alone said that he saw 7 or 8 keyboards with missing W keys; thus it could never be the case that total of only 3 keyboards was observed damaged.  Assuming the GAO\u2019s data were correct, the appropriate statement would be that 10 staff members reported a total of 11 to 26 (i.e., 7 to 18 in the Advance Office and 4 to 8 in Rooms 192-198); here, the range properly reflects the possibility that an observer may or may not be reporting a keyboard that was observed and reported by another.", "The comments in this table were, collectively, reported by 10 separate individuals. Unless otherwise indicated, each line reports an observation by one person.", "A simplified and hypothetical example may further clarify the point.", "No. observed (observer)", "No. for report (reason)", "1 (Washington) 25 (Adams) 100 (Jefferson) 1 (Madison) 50 (Monroe)", "Under the GAO\u2019s methodology, the number of \u201ctotal\u201d observations would be 1 to 126 for Office Suite A and 1 to 51 for Office Suite B \u2013 or a total of 2 to 177 for both offices.  But that would be an absurd conclusion since three people said that they each alone observed more than 2 damaged keyboards; so unless the GAO is going to simply ignore their observations, or find them not credible, the total must reflect what they said.  Therefore a proper range would be 100 to 126 for Office Suite A and 50 to 51 for Office Suite B, or a combined total of 150 to 177.", "It appears that this flaw in the GAO\u2019s methodology infects each of the ranges presented in the GAO report.  It also appears that some of the data is inaccurate in the data tables that the GAO has provided.  Without being provided copies of all of the data tables for each category of damage, we cannot know \u2013 and hence cannot comment specifically on \u2013 the factual accuracy of all data, nor on how each range was calculated.  Where the GAO has provided copies of the data table or has described the underlying data to us, we provide specific comments below. 4.  Use of the Term \u201cExecutive Office of the President.\u201d  Throughout the draft report, the GAO refers to organizational units that are housed within the White House complex \u2013 such as the White House Office (WHO), the Office of the Vice President (OVP), or the Office of Administration (OA) \u2013 individually and collectively, as the \u201cExecutive Office of the President\u201d or \u201cEOP.\u201d  As we explained to the GAO in our April 26 comments, it is not accurate to refer to each unit individually or all units collectively as the Executive Office of the President.  In this context, the term is both under- and over-inclusive.  It is under- inclusive because not all offices in the complex fall within the EOP umbrella.  And it is over- inclusive to the extent that it covers units that the GAO did not investigate.  Thus, for example, it is not accurate to say, as the GAO does, that it \u201casked EOP\u201d for information (Report at 1).  The GAO is also inaccurate when it refers to the EOP units as \u201cagencies.\u201d", "Report at 3 n.2, 4.  They are not.", "We therefore again recommend that the GAO state specifically the unit being referring to \u2013 whether it be the WHO, the OVP, the OA, the NSC, etc. 5.  Effort To Downplay the Damage Found in the White House Complex.  It appears that the GAO has undertaken a concerted effort in its report to downplay the damage found in the White House complex.  The following facts lead us to that conclusion: the GAO omits from its report a reference to each reported instance of vandalism, damage, or a prank; the GAO underreports the number of observations for nearly every category of damage; the GAO omits from its report any mention of several individuals (all but two of whom served during the Clinton Administration) who told the GAO that the damage found during this transition was worse than prior transitions; the GAO ignores documents that show requests were made to repair telephone damage the GAO fails to quantify or estimate certain real costs incurred to remedy or repair the the GAO fails to report the content of the graffiti and signs that were found in the the GAO is unwilling to conclude that the vandalism, damage, and pranks were intentional, even where the circumstances plainly indicate that they were (e.g., damaged W keys, graffiti and signs disparaging the President and the incoming Administration, damaged furniture that contained anti-Bush statements, more than 100 missing phone labels, vulgar and inappropriate voicemail greetings, etc.).", "Part II:  Specific Comments 1.", "PAGES 2-3.  The GAO misstates the contents of the June 2001 list:", "The GAO says that the list \u201clisted . . . offices with a lot of trash.\u201d  It does not.  It says that the \u201cffices were left in a state of general trashing,\u201d and then provides examples that the GAO omits \u2013 \u201contents of drawers dumped on the floor,\u201d \u201cesk top glass smashed and on the floor,\u201d and \u201cefrigerators unplugged (spoiled food).\u201d", "The GAO says that the list \u201clisted . . . cut telephone lines.\u201d  In fact, the list says \u201cen phone lines cut in the EOB \u2013 pulled from the wall.\u201d", "The GAO says that the list \u201clisted . . . a secure telephone left operational.\u201d  It does not.  It says that \u201ca stu3 phone . . . was left open with the key in it.\u201d", "2.", "PAGE 3.  The GAO misidentifies the units that comprise the EOP.  As stated above, not all of the units identified by the GAO fall squarely within the EOP.  See, e.g., Sweetland v. Walters, 60 F.3d 852, 854-55 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (\u201cthe Executive Residence is not a unit within the Executive Office of the President\u201d).  And none of the EOP units are \u201cagencies,\u201d as the GAO contends (see Report at 3 n.2 and 4).", "3.", "PAGES 7 and 23.  The GAO concludes that \u201camage, theft, and pranks did occur in the White House complex during the 2001 presidential transition.\u201d  Congressman Barr asked the GAO to address \u201cvandalism,\u201d and elsewhere in the report, the GAO discusses observations of vandalism.  Is the GAO unwilling to conclude that \u201cvandalism,\u201d as well as \u201cdamage, theft, and pranks\u201d occurred?  Or did the GAO simply inadvertently omit the word \u201cvandalism\u201d in these two instances?", "4.", "PAGE 8.  The GAO writes that \u201cultiple people said that . . . they observed (1) many offices that were messy, disheveled, or contained excessive trash or personal items.\u201d", "That is an understatement, to say the least.  The offices were not simply \u201cmessy\u201d and \u201cdisheveled.\u201d  Multiple observers told the GAO that the offices, for example, had more than 20 W keys glued to the walls; at least 14 to 19 pieces of furniture overturned; computers piled up or overturned on floor; telephones and fax machines unplugged and/or piled on the floor in 25 or more offices; at least a dozen fax lines switched; 5 or 6 glass desk tops broken; a plant dumped in the middle of the floor; drawers open and their contents dumped on the desk or the floor; food inside of desks; and beer, wine and liquor bottles littering offices.  When one knows the specific allegations, a reader can evaluate the explanation offered by \u201csome former Clinton administration staff\u201d that \u201cthe amount of trash that was observed during the transition was what could be expected when staff move out of their offices after 8 years.\u201d", "Further, if the GAO is going to include the statement by former Clinton administration staff that the amount of trash was \u201cwhat could be expected,\u201d it should also include the statements of longtime staff members who said the opposite.  For example, an individual who has worked in the White House complex since 1971 told the GAO that the amount of trash \u201cwas beyond the norm,\u201d and a different individual, who has worked in the White House complex for 17 years, said that the trash was \u201cworse this time\u201d than in prior transitions and that the offices were \u201cmore messy\u201d than what he had observed during other transitions.", "5.", "PAGE 8.  The GAO reports that some former Clinton Administration staff said that \u201csome reported observations were false.\u201d  We are disappointed that President Clinton\u2019s former staff would make such a reckless statement \u2013 a statement that is neither based on nor supported by a single shred of evidence.  We believe that self-serving accusations like this one illustrate why it is important to provide the reader with many of the details that the GAO omits.  If, for example, the reader is told that a particular observation was made by a staff member who worked in the complex for many years (including during the Clinton Administration), or that the damage was found in a location where others observed lots of other damage, then the reader can determine for himself the credibility of the observation.", "6.", "PAGE 9.  The GAO writes:  \u201cocumentation was provided indicating that much telephone service work was done during the transition, but this information did not directly corroborate allegations of vandalism and pranks involving the telephones.\u201d  We simply do not understand how the GAO can say the documentation does not corroborate the allegations.  Several staff members reported missing telephone labels, and the documentation shows, for example, a list of closed telephone service orders that shows, among other things, at least 28 a Telephone Service Request (TSR) that says,  \u201cNEED Button labels typed.

The GAO writes that \u201ceventy-nine EOP staff who worked in the White House complex on or after January 20, 2001, provided observations about the condition of the complex at the beginning of the administration.\u201d  This statement is inaccurate in two respects.

While, in some cases, the signs listed above were easily removed and, in a few cases, were probably meant as a joke, we believe the GAO should describe the signs more fully and with greater detail for the reasons stated in General Comment No. 1.

First, the GAO reports that \u201cone former employee . . . said that the prank signs that she saw were harmless jokes.\u201d  The reader is unable to determine whether the signs were truly \u201charmless jokes\u201d in some, many, or all of the cases, unless the content is included.  Second, the GAO reports that it was shown \u201c2 stickers affixed to a file cabinet and desk containing arguably derogatory statements about the resident.\u201d  The GAO is referring to a sticker that reads \u201cjail to the thief.\u201d", "We do not think that statement is \u201carguably derogatory,\u201d and we believe that many people would agree with us.

Again, we believe the range provided by the GAO (\u201c30 to 64\u201d) does not accurately reflect the number of observations reported.  According to our records, which we earlier provided to the GAO and the GAO did not dispute, staff members observed a total of 58 to 70 computer keyboards with missing or damaged W keys where a specific office or room was identified.

For example,", "With respect to the key broken off in a file cabinet in Room 197B, the key was found still hanging in lock by a metal thread (suggesting that the damage occurred not long before the transition) and, when the locksmith opened the cabinet, a Gore bumper sticker with the words \u201cBush Sucks\u201d was prominently displayed inside (suggesting that the damage was intentional and done by a member of the former Administration).", "Similarly, when the locked desk drawers were pried open in Room 103, two pieces of paper with anti-Bush statements were found displayed inside.  Again, in our view, these facts indicate that the damage was intentional, occurred shortly before the transition, and was done by a member of the former Administration.", "All of the obscene, inappropriate, and prank voicemail greetings must have been recorded shortly before the Inauguration (since many of the messages referred to the change of Administration and one presumes that former staff would not have left vulgar or inappropriate such messages on their phones during the Clinton Administration) and must have been recorded by the person who was assigned that telephone during the Clinton Administration (since a personal identification code is needed to change the voicemail greeting).", "According to an individual who worked as White House Director of Telephone Services from 1973 to 2001, some of the missing telephone labels \u201cwere replaced early on January 20 \u2013 before noon\u201d; but the labels were found \u201cmissing again later that day.\u201d  These facts show that the removal of at least some of the labels was an intentional act, occurred early on January 20, and outgoing staff members were almost certainly responsible.", "The oily glue-like substance that was smeared on desks in the Vice President\u2019s West Wing office; prank signs that were on walls and interspersed in reams of paper in printer trays and copy machines in the Vice President\u2019s West Wing office; and the \u201cvulgar words\u201d on a white board in that office were all discovered between midnight on January 19 and noon on January 20 by three different individuals.  Since we presume that Vice President Gore\u2019s staff did not generally work under these conditions, we can reasonably conclude that that this damage occurred shortly before the Inauguration and again, members of the former Administration were the likely perpetrators.", "Similarly, it is unlikely that Clinton Administration staff worked for long without having W keys on their keyboards, again suggesting that the vandalism occurred shortly before the Inauguration.", "In other cases, the person who observed the damage firsthand told the GAO that the nature of the damage itself, and the surrounding conditions, suggested that the damage was done shortly before the transition weekend.  For example, one employee told the GAO that she saw damaged furniture in offices where things had looked \u201cpretty good\u201d weeks or months earlier.", "In still other cases, the nature of the damage suggests that it occurred shortly before the Inauguration because the offices\u2019 prior occupants and cleaning staff would not have let the damage remain in the office for long.  For example, it is hard to believe that occupants would not fix or remove a bookcase with broken glass (with shards of glass still in the cabinet) or would allow chairs with broken legs and no backs to remain in an office suite for very long.", "In addition, and with all due respect, it is not true that the GAO \u201cwas generally unable to determine who was responsible.\u201d  The GAO simply failed to determine who was responsible.  The GAO was able to identify the \u201cformer Clinton administration employee who said he wrote a \u2018goodwill\u2019 message inside the drawer of his former desk\u201d because the GAO called that individual.  The GAO failed, however, to try to contact the occupants of the offices where other written messages \u2013 expressing things other than \u201cgoodwill\u201d \u2013 were left.  Similarly, the GAO could have contacted \u2013 but failed to contact \u2013 several former Clinton administration staffers who left inappropriate voicemail messages.  And the GAO did not contact all the former staff members who occupied offices where missing or damaged W keys, missing telephone labels, or other damage was found.  Therefore, it is inaccurate, in our view, to say that the GAO was \u201cgenerally unable to determine who was responsible.\u201d  Respectfully, in our judgment, the GAO simply decided not to pursue the inquiry in many cases.", "Finally, the GAO\u2019s suggestion (at page 17) that \u201ccontractor staff, such as movers and cleaners\u201d were responsible for the vandalism, damage, and pranks is, in our view, preposterous.  It is an insult to the men and women who worked so hard during the weekend of January 20 to clean up the conditions left by the prior Administration and prepare the complex for the new staff.", "29.", "PAGE 18.  The GAO writes that, for certain categories of damage, \u201cthe observations of EOP staff differed from the  list in terms of total numbers of incidents or  alleged extent of damage.\u201d  The GAO then provides, as an example, the statement included in the list that furniture in six offices was damaged severely enough to require a complete refurbishment or destruction.  But the GAO learned of at least 28 to 31 pieces of damaged furniture, including 5 or 6 chairs with broken legs (reported by four employees), 1 chair with its entire back broken out (reported by two employees), and a desk with its drawers kicked in (reported by one employee).  These pieces of furniture, at the very least, would have required a complete refurbishment or destruction; they simply could not have been used in their current condition.  In addition, when the GAO asked the Director of the Office of Administration what happened to the damaged furniture, he said that some of it was \u201cthrown in the dumpster.\u201d  Thus the observations of staff members did not, as the GAO suggests, differ from the June 2001 list.", "30.", "PAGES 19-20.

GSA charged $2,905.70 for that service.  As the GAO acknowledged earlier in its report (at page 12), this request was for an office suite that a White House Office \u201cemployee said was \u2018filthy\u2019 and worn and dirty furniture.\u201d  As noted above, that same employee, as well as others from her office, also told the GAO about significant damage to furniture in those offices, including a desk drawer with its drawer-fronts removed, chairs without legs, and a chair with its entire back broken off.", "The GAO\u2019s discussion of the \u201ccosts\u201d associated with telephone problems is both inaccurate and incomplete.  Based on extremely conservative estimates and straightforward documentation, the government incurred at least $6020 just replacing removed labels and rerouting the forwarded telephones.  The evidence shows:", "First, the GAO received, but fails to mention, a blanket work order and bill for work \u2013 including \u201crelabeling\u201d work \u2013 performed on Saturday, January 20, 2001.", "The techs billed 114 hours at a rate of $113.88 per hour for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on a particular job.  Consequently, if technicians spent only ten percent of their time relabeling phones and correcting forwarded telephones on Saturday (a conservative estimate given that there were between 112 and 133 specifically identified missing labels and roughly 100 forwarded phones), that means it cost the taxpayer  $1,298 for one day\u2019s work replacing the removed labels and fixing the forwarded phones.", "Second, and similarly, the GAO acknowledges that it received a work order and bill for work \u2013 including \u201creplacing labels on telephones\u201d \u2013 performed on Sunday, January 21, 2001.  But the GAO fails to estimate any costs associated with that work.  The bill shows that the techs worked 78.5 hours that day at a rate of $151.84 per hour for each hour or fraction of an hour spent on a particular job.", "That means that, if technicians again spent only ten percent of their time relabeling phones and correcting forwarded telephones, the taxpayer incurred an additional cost of $1,192 for that day\u2019s work replacing the removed labels and fixing the forwarded phones.", "Third, the GAO fails to estimate the costs associated with replacing labels even where it was provided both individual work orders and a summary of orders that specifically identify the relabeling work performed and the amount of time spent on the job.  Specifically, we provided the GAO with a document entitled \u201cOrders Closed 1/20/01 Thru 2/20/01\u201d that lists many orders (some of which are highlighted above) where a tech was asked to place one or more labels on the telephone sets.

If work requires a tech dispatch (e.g., replacing a label), then there is a minimum charge of $75.92 for each hour or portion of an hour ($113.88 on Saturdays and $151.84 on Sundays), even if it takes only minutes to perform the work.  Therefore, for service orders that requested, for example, both a telephone to be reprogrammed and its label to be replaced, the entire charge is attributable to replacing the label.  This is clear from the AT&T billing invoices (or \u201cActivity Reports\u201d) that show that the cost associated with the work orders is for \u201cLABOR CHARGES FOR EQUIP. MOVES/CHGS,\u201d and not for reprogramming expenses.", "In addition, for the service orders where the minimum charge of $75.92 was assessed, it is immaterial whether work in addition to replacing the label was performed; a charge of $75.92 would have been incurred for replacing the label(s) regardless of whether other work was performed within that first hour.", "Finally, the closed order list and the service orders do far more than \u201cmention labels,\u201d as the GAO suggests.

In estimating the cost to replace missing doorknobs, the GAO has \u201cdeducted the value of replacing one historic doorknob from the total number observed missing because . . . a GSA planner/estimator said that a facility request to install a doorknob in an office . . . was to perform maintenance on a doorknob with a worn-out part, not to replace a missing one.\u201d  We are puzzled that the GAO would decide to credit the recollection of the GSA planner/estimator, even though his recollection is inconsistent with both a contemporaneous facility request form that asks GSA to  \u201cput doorknob on\u201d interoffice door and the recollection of at least three current staff members who recall that no doorknob was on the door.  The GAO\u2019s decision simply makes no sense to us.

In describing how the 2001 presidential transition compared with previous transitions in terms of damage, vandalism, or pranks, the GAO fails to include the statements of several current staff members \u2013 all of whom served during prior administrations and many of whom served during the Clinton Administration \u2013 who told the GAO that the damage observed during the 2001 transition was worse than prior transitions.  The following statements are representative: \u201cThis was unusual. . . .

(An employee who has worked in the White House complex for 17 years)", "In addition, while pranks and damage may have been observed in prior administrations, the reported observations are not the same in number or kind as those observed during the 2001 transition.  Yet the GAO does not mention this in its report.  The reader, moreover, is hampered in drawing his own conclusion because the GAO fails to include details about how much damage was reported by current staff.", "In addition, the GAO seems to overstate the extent of the damage reported during prior transitions.  For example, while the GAO writes that the \u201cobservations included missing building fixtures like office signs and doorknobs,\u201d we understand there were no observations of \u201cmissing building fixtures\u201d other than office signs and doorknobs, and those observations were few in number.  A more accurate statement therefore might read \u201cobservations included \u2018no more than\u2019 10 missing office signs and 1 or 2 missing doorknobs.\u201d  Similarly, the GAO writes that the \u201cobservations included . . . messages written inside and carved into desks.\u201d  We understand that there was only one observation of a message written inside a desk \u2013 the same observation that that the GAO repeats, for some reason, in the sentence that follows.  And apparently there were only three observations of carving in desks by staff who served only during the Clinton Administration.", "Finally, while the GAO refers to \u201cpiles of . . . equipment\u201d (apparently referring to only one observation by a Clinton staffer of piles of telephones), the GAO fails to explain that the individual who has overseen telephone services since 1973, said that he \u201cnever encountered any problems with telephones\u201d during the 1993 transition; he said that \u201cperhaps some were unplugged, but that would be it.\u201d  This employee also told the GAO that, as the Clinton Administration entered office in 1993, he was instructed to \u201cget rid of  Republican phone system,\u201d which apparently resulted in the replacement of all the phones.", "34.", "PAGE 22.  The GAO says that \u201cormer Clinton administration officials told  that departing EOP staff were required to follow a check-out procedure that involved turning in such items as building passes, library materials, government cellular telephones at the end of the administration.\u201d  We have repeatedly told the GAO that some current staff members who served during the prior administration believe that the check- out procedures were often not followed and, in particular, building passes were not returned.  The GAO apparently did not ask the Clinton staff or the National Archives to produce copies of the check-out forms, so there is no documentation to shed light on the issue.  Consequently, we asked the GAO to include in its report the understanding of current staff \u2013 that some or all of the check-out procedures were not followed \u2013 and that there was no documentation to support or refute their claim.  Or, alternatively, we asked that the GAO delete from its report the description to the \u201ccheck-out procedures.\u201d  For reasons that were not explained to us, the GAO has chosen not to do so.", "35.", "PAGE 23.

The GAO states that \u201cit was unknown whether other observations, such as broken furniture, were the result of intentional acts and when and how they occurred.\u201d", "While that may be true with respect to a few pieces of the furniture, that is not a reasonable conclusion with respect to other items.  For example, in our view, it is not plausible that a key was broken off accidentally in the lock of a cabinet, the key was left hanging by a thread in the lock, and, when opened, a Gore bumper sticker with the words \u201cBush Sucks\u201d on it was prominently displayed.  Nor, in our view, is it reasonable to conclude that desk drawers were accidentally locked and just happened to contain two pieces of paper with anti-Bush statements displayed inside.  It is also not plausible to think the cleaning staff completely broke off the backs and legs of multiple chairs within the same office, and then left that furniture in the offices for the new occupants.  And it would certainly be odd behavior, in our view, for occupants of these offices to have broken those chairs through normal wear and tear and to have left those chairs in the office \u2013 unrepaired \u2013 for some period of time.  Likewise, the nature of some of the damage \u2013 e.g., two seat cushions slit in an identical manner on apparently new upholstery \u2013 indicates that it was not accidental.  And the GAO\u2019s conclusion that the furniture damage could have been accidental fails to take into account the testimony of one employee who served during the Clinton Administration and told the GAO that some of the upholstered furniture that she saw damaged during the transition looked \u201cpretty good\u201d when she visited the same offices weeks and months earlier.", "Similarly, it is not reasonable, in our view, to conclude that the furniture was overturned unintentionally.  First, most of the witnesses observed the overturned furniture before the cleaning staff or new occupants entered the rooms.  Second, it is not plausible to think that cleaning staff would have upended extremely heavy furniture in the manner described by the witnesses:", "At least two \u201cdesks turned over\u201d in the Advance Office (observed by employee with", "Desks and credenzas turned on their sides (observed by two witnesses)", "Coffee table standing on end, sofa upside down, and tables turned over in the 29 years of service in the White House)", "In the Counsel\u2019s Office, in each of the three offices and the secretarial space, almost every desk was overturned \u2013 \u201cat least one desk or table in each room\u201d \u201cCouple desks on side\u201d and a \u201ccouple of chairs\u201d turned over on the first floor of the EEOB (observed by employee with 31 years of service in the White House)", "Sofa overturned with broken legs In fact, the GAO was told by two employees of the GSA that cleaning staff would \u201cnot move\u201d large pieces of furniture in this fashion, and none of these things would happen in the normal course of \u201cmoving\u201d out of an office.", "Likewise, we know that the removal of at least some of the labels was an intentional act, occurred early on January 20, and outgoing staff members were almost certainly responsible.  The employee who oversaw White House telephone services from 1973 to 2001 told the GAO that some of the missing telephone labels \u201cwere replaced early on January 20 \u2013 before noon,\u201d but were found \u201cmissing again later that day.\u201d", "37.", "PAGE 28.  The GAO writes:  \u201cStaff we interviewed told us that they saw evidence of damage, vandalism, or pranks on or after January 20, 2001, when they started working in the White House complex.\u201d  This statement is misleading for two reasons.  First, it suggests that all observations were made by staff who \u201cstarted working in the White House complex\u201d \u201con or after January 20, 2001\u201d; in fact, many, if not most, of the observations were made by employees who worked in the complex long before Inauguration Day.  Second, the statement suggests that the staff members saw evidence of damage only \u201con or after January 20, 2001\u201d; in fact, many observations were made on January 19, 2001.  Therefore, to be accurate, this sentence should read:  \u201cThe staff we interviewed, many of whom worked here during the Clinton Administration, told us that they saw evidence of damage, vandalism, or pranks shortly before, on, and shortly after January 20, 2001.\u201d", "38.", "PAGE 28.  The GAO repeats a statement made on page 23 that, although \u201cncidents such as the removal of keys from computer keyboard, the theft of various items, the leaving of certain voice mail messages, signs, and written messages, and the placing of glue on desk drawers clearly were done intentionally,\u201d the GAO \u201cgenerally could not make judgments about whether  were acts of vandalism because  did not have information regarding who was responsible for them, when they occurred, or why they occurred.\u201d  Again, we respectfully disagree.", "The GAO\u2019s statement is categorical and speaks of an unwillingness to make any \u201cjudgments\u201d about the observations.  But the GAO certainly \u201ccould\u201d make a judgment about whether at least some \u2013 if not most \u2013 of the observations were acts of vandalism.", "As explained in Specific Comment Nos. 35 and 36, the GAO\u2019s list of \u201cclearly intentional\u201d acts is under-inclusive, and the GAO had considerable \u201cinformation regarding who was responsible for , when they occurred, or why they occurred.\u201d  The GAO, it seems, has simply decided to ignore that evidence.  It is simply not credible, in our view, for the GAO to claim that it cannot make a judgment about the incidents listed in Specific Comment No. 35.", "In addition, we believe the GAO should report the views of many current staffers (including employees who served during the Clinton Administration) who said that, based on their firsthand observations, the damage appeared to have been \u201cdeliberate,\u201d \u201cpurpose,\u201d and \u201cintentional.\u201d  For example, one employee who has worked in the White House since June, 1998 told the GAO that the missing phone labels \u201cmust have been intentional,\u201d and another employee said that the damage done to a desk in Room 102 was \u201cclearly\u201d intentional and \u201cnot just wear and tear.\u201d  A third person told the GAO that the broken file cabinet looked \u201cdeliberate.\u201d  And two others (one of whom has observed five White House transitions, the other of whom has worked at the White House since 1998) said that, in their view, people had \u201cdeliberately\u201d trashed their offices.  An employee who worked at the White House from August 1999-August 2001 likewise told the GAO that the condition of 30-40 NSC rooms \u201cwas intentional, not accidental.\u201d  Two other employees (one of whom has worked at the White House since 1971) also told the GAO that some of the \u201ctrashing\u201d was \u201cintentional.\u201d  A Bush Administration official said that the conditions he observed were \u201cmore than wear and tear.\u201d  And an employee who has worked in the White House since 1973 said it looked like the prior occupants had \u201cpurposely trashed the place.\u201d", "By including these sorts of statements, the GAO would not only be providing the reader with \u201cinformation needed to . . .  promote an adequate and correct understanding of the matters reported,\u201d the GAO would also then be treating statements made by current and former staff alike.  As drafted, the report contains the views of \u201cormer Clinton administration staff\u201d on whether the observed acts were intentional.  See, e.g., Report at 8 (Former Clinton administration staff said that some furniture was broken, \u201cbut not intentionally\u201d); Report at 46 (\u201cThe former senior advisor for presidential transition questioned whether as many as 60 keyboards could have been intentionally damaged. . . .\u201d); Report at 83 (\u201cormer employee said that she saw telephone lines pulled out of walls  and that they appeared to have been pulled out intentionally.\u201d).  But the GAO fails to report the views of the current staff members regarding precisely the same issue.", "39.", "PAGE 29.  We disagree with the GAO\u2019s statement that, \u201cn the overwhelming majority of cases, one person said that he or she observed an incident in a particular location.\u201d", "According to our records, in many (if not most) cases, more than one person reported seeing the same incident in the same location.  Indeed, the GAO reached that conclusion in its April 2002 preliminary draft report, where it stated (on page 22) that \u201ceveral people observed most incidents; however, in a few cases, only one person observed them.\u201d  The observations have not changed; we do not know why the GAO\u2019s conclusion has.", "40.", "PAGE 29.  The GAO states that, \u201c n some cases, people said that they observed damage, vandalism, or pranks in the same areas where others said they observed none, sometimes only hours apart.\u201d  In our April 26 comments on the GAO\u2019s preliminary draft, we explained that, without a description of the specific instances where one current staff member recalled seeing something and another expressly disavowed seeing the same thing, it was impossible to know whether the apparent conflict in testimony could be reconciled or whether the GAO\u2019s statement is factually accurate.  We also complained that this vague sentence provides no indication of how many such conflicts existed or what types of incidents are involved.", "The GAO provided us with only two specific instances to which this sentence refers.  The first example was an observation by two individuals \u2013 a Bush Administration official, and an employee who has observed five prior transitions -- of overturned furniture in the Counsel\u2019s Office suite (Room 128), which another person claimed could not be reconciled with a third person\u2019s alleged statement that he observed no overturned furniture in the same office.  First, according to our interview notes, when the GAO asked the third person (who has worked in the White House for 33 years) specifically about Room 128, and whether he had observed overturned furniture in that office, he told the GAO that he had \u201cno specific recollection of going into that room.\u201d  Second, this person told the GAO, during both interviews with him, that he entered rooms in the EEOB between approximately midnight and 2:30 a.m. on January 20, at which time his attention was diverted to the West Wing.  This person also told the GAO, during his first interview, that when he entered the Counsel\u2019s Office, \u201cthere were still people working\u201d there.  (This is consistent with the testimony provided by the prior occupants of that office, who said they left the EEOB close to noon on January 20.)  Consequently there is no conflict between this person\u2019s recollection and that of the other two individuals, who said that they did not enter Room 128 until after noon on January 20.  This person had no specific recollection of entering that office and, even if had recalled seeing no overturned furniture, he would have made that observation roughly 12 or more hours before the observations of the two other individuals, leaving plenty of time for someone to overturn furniture.", "The second example that the GAO provided was an observation by an employee who has observed five prior transitions, of a broken glass top and files on the floor in the Advance Office suite, which the GAO claims is inconsistent with \u201cother staff,\u201d who \u201csaid they didn\u2019t see that.\u201d  While again, the GAO has not identified who offered conflicting testimony, this employee\u2019s observations, which he made around 12:15 p.m. on January 20, are entirely consistent with another employee\u2019s recollection that he saw 5 or 6 broken glass tops when he surveyed the first few floors of the EEOB shortly after noon on January 20.  While current staff who occupy the Advance Office may not have seen the broken glass top or dumped files, that would not be surprising since they did not enter the building until much later, allowing time for the broken glass and files to have been removed.", "Thus we are aware of no instance where there is a direct conflict where one person said they observed damage in a location where others observed none.", "41.", "PAGE 31.  The GAO writes:  \u201cSix EOP staff told us that they observed a total of 5 to 11 missing office signs. . . .\u201d", "Four of the \u201cix EOP staff\u201d members are employees of the OA and served here during the Clinton Administration.  A fifth employee, who worked for the White House Office, also served during the Clinton Administration.", "One of the employees told the GAO that a former member of the Counsel\u2019s Office during the Clinton Administration told her that he too observed two missing brackets on the morning of January 20, 2001.", "42.", "These observations included an office sign that an EOP employee said that she saw someone remove on January 19 outside an office in the EEOB.", "The EOP employee said that the person who removed the sign said that he planned to take a photograph with it and that she reported the incident to an Office of Administration (OA) employee.  Further, the EOP employee said that the person attempted to put the sign back on the wall, but it was loose.", "This statement implies that the individual who pried the sign off the wall intended all along to put the sign back.  In fact, it was only when he was confronted by an OA employee that the individual claimed that he wanted to take a photograph with it and tried to put the sign back.  This employee does not believe that the volunteer intended all along to return the sign, as the GAO\u2019s sentence suggests.", "The GAO fails to mention that the same employee also said that a former member of the Clinton Counsel\u2019s Office told her that he saw that the sign was missing at some point during the night of January 19, 2001.", "43.", "PAGE  31.

We disagree with the GAO\u2019s statement that \u201cour EOP staff said they saw a total of 10 to 11 doorknobs, which may have been historic originals, were missing in different locations.\u201d  As explained above (in Specific Comment No. 19), the GAO was told that 11 to 13 doorknobs were missing.", "45.", "A GSA planner/estimator who said he was in charge of repairing and replacing building fixtures in the EEOB, including office signs, medallions, and doorknobs, said he received no written facility requests made to GSA for replacing missing office signs, medallions, or doorknobs during the transition.  He said that the February 7, 2001, GSA facility request was not to replace a missing doorknob, but to repair one that had a worn-out part.  He also said that over the past 20 years, doorknobs have been found missing about a half-dozen times in the EEOB, and not only during transitions.  In addition, he said that medallions are difficult to remove and that a special wrench is needed to remove them from an office sign.", "First, if the GAO says that this GSA employee \u201csaid he received no written facility requests made to GSA for replacing missing office signs, medallions, or doorknobs during the transition,\u201d it is important that the GAO also say: there is, in fact, a work request, dated April 19, 2001, for \u201creplacement of frames & medallions\u201d on 4 rooms, as well as the February 7 work request to \u201cput . . . on\u201d a", "An employee of the OA said he provided a written request (although perhaps not on a facility request form) to the GSA for the replacement of name brackets and", "An OA manager who has worked at the White House since 1971 recalled telling the GSA to replace missing knobs, brackets, and medallions and asking the GSA to check all signs and to take corrective actions; and", "A WHO employee told the GAO that the GSA noted that the office sign on Room 457 was missing when the GSA did a survey of the rooms.", "Second, we again ask that the GAO note that the employee\u2019s recollection that the doorknob was repaired (not replaced) is inconsistent with the facility request form and the recollection of at least three current staff members, including the individual who prepared the facility request form.", "46.", "PAGE 33.

We believe that the GAO should discuss these incidents separately.", "The employee who reported the remote controls missing in the Correspondence Office, worked for the Correspondence Office during the Clinton Administration.", "This is an important fact because this employee\u2019s prior tenure with the Clinton Administration placed her in a position to know if remote controls were in the rooms before the transition.", "47.", "PAGE 35.

The GAO was told, in writing, that the $350 purchase price would not purchase an exact replica of the brass seal that was stolen; that seal was purchased in the mid-1970s, and is no longer available.

The GAO\u2019s two paragraphs on the observations of computer personnel keyboards fail, in our view, to present the information that GAO received in a fair and objective manner.  These paragraphs (like the entire discussion of damaged keyboards) appear to be designed to downplay the extent of the damage reported.  The GAO writes: In addition to the EOP staff we interviewed about their observations regarding the keyboards, we met with EOP personnel who worked with computers during the transition.  The OA associate director for information systems and technology provided us with documentation indicating that on January 23 and 24, 2001, the EOP purchased 62 new keyboards.  The January 23, 2001, purchase order for 31 keyboards indicated that \u201ceyboards are needed to support the transition.\u201d  The January 24, 2001, purchase order for another 31 keyboards indicated \u201cecond request for the letter \u2018W\u2019 problem.\u201d  The OA associate director for information systems and technology said that some of the replacement keyboards were taken out of inventory for the new administration staff, but she did not know how many.  In an interview in June 2001, this official said that 57 keyboards were missing keys during the transition and 7 other keyboards were not working because of other reasons, such as inoperable space bars.", "After later obtaining an estimate from the branch chief for program management and strategic planning in the information systems and technology division, who worked with computers during the transition, that 150 keyboards had to be replaced because of missing or damaged \u2018W\u2019 keys, we conducted a follow-up with the OA associate director for information systems and technology.  In February 2002, the OA associate director for information systems and technology said that her memory regarding this matter was not as good as when we interviewed her in June 2001, but estimated that 100 keyboards had to be replaced at the end of the administration and that one-third of them were missing \u2018W\u2019 keys or were intentionally damaged in some way.  She also said that of those 100 keyboards, about one-third to one-half would have been replaced anyway because of their age.  This official said that she took notes regarding computers during the transition, but she was unable to locate them.", "We offer the following specific comments:", "The GAO basically ignores the comments of the IS&T Branch Chief, by relegating her observation to the passing phrase, \u201cfter later obtaining an estimate from the branch chief . . . worked with computers during the transition that 150 keyboards had to be replaced because of missing or damaged \u2018W\u2019 keys . . . .\u201d  While the report dismisses her observations, this employee may, in truth, have been the one person in the best position to assess the total damage.  This employee worked during the transition as the person with the cart who continually moved equipment around.  She moved the broken and old items out of offices and made deliveries of replacement equipment.  She thus personally saw many of the damaged keyboards, which she transported to a temporary workroom in the EEOB.  She did this throughout the Inaugural weekend and into the following week.  She specifically recalls that, on one of her  last deliveries of broken items to the temporary workroom, someone said that the count of damaged keyboards was up to 150.", "Contrast the GAO\u2019s treatment of the IS&T Branch Chief\u2019s observations with its discussion of another individual, the IS&T Associate Director.  The latter individual told the GAO (but the GAO fails to mention) that she was \u201cnot focused on keyboards\u201d during the transition and that she \u201cpersonally saw\u201d only about \u201c10 keyboards\u201d with missing W keys and only heard about others.  Her estimates of the total number of keyboards damaged were based purely on inferences drawn from what others may have said.  The GAO nonetheless details the IS&T Associate Director\u2019s statements, but not those of the IS&T Branch Chief.", "Even then, the GAO\u2019s reporting of the IS&T Associate Director\u2019s statements is incomplete.  The GAO fails to mention, for instance, that the IS&T Associate Director said that she \u201csaw personally\u201d a concentration of missing W keys in the former First Lady\u2019s Office and in the OVP; that there were \u201csome keyboards\u201d where the space bar had been glued down; and that she was \u201cvery upset at the condition\u201d in which some of the keyboards were left.  In describing her second interview, the GAO fails to mention that it asked her to estimate the number of keyboards with missing W keys, even though the GAO had asked the same question during her first interview (seven months earlier) and the GAO did not remind her about the earlier inquiry.  Nor did the GAO ask her whether she had any reason in February 2002 to question the accuracy of what she had said in June 2001.", "The GAO also fails to say that the IS&T Associate Director recounted what the contractor who packed the damaged keyboards, had said \u2013 namely, that there were \u201c6 boxes of 20 keyboards or more with \u2018W\u2019 problems or space-bar problems.\u201d  The GAO pressed the IS&T Associate Director to give her own estimate of damaged keyboards (again, even though she had told the GAO that she did not have personal knowledge about the keyboards), and she said that she \u201cthinks around 100 were damaged,\u201d and \u201cif there were 100,\u201d then roughly one-third might have had a \u201cW\u201d missing \u201cor looked like something intentional.\u201d", "The GAO says that it \u201cmet EOP personnel who worked with computers during the transition.\u201d  The GAO actually did not \u201cmeet\u201d the IS&T Branch Chief; the GAO interviewed her by telephone.  So we would recommend rephrasing the report to say that the GAO \u201cspoke to\u201d computer personnel.  Also, the IS&T Associate Director and the IS&T Branch Chief are both former employees of the OA and both served during the prior Administration.

Therefore, some of the damaged keyboards would have been replaced anyway.", "Below is a table showing the different costs that could have been incurred on the basis of different estimates that we were provided regarding the number of damaged keyboards replaced.  The cost estimates were calculated on the basis of the per-unit cost of the 62 keyboards that the White House purchased in late January 2001 for $4,850, or $75 per keyboard.", "This paragraph is followed by a table entitled \u201cEstimated costs of replacing damaged keyboards.\u201d   The table lists four estimates.  The first estimate, for $2,250-$4,800, is based on the GAO\u2019s \u201crange of 30 to 64 keyboards that were observed by EOP staff with missing or damaged keys.\u201d  The second estimate, for $2475, is based on a statement that the IS&T Associate Director made that she \u201cthinks around 100 were damaged,\u201d and \u201cif there were 100,\u201d then roughly one-third might have had a W key missing \u201cor looked like something intentional.\u201d", "The GAO\u2019s first estimate is simply wrong, in our view, because there were a total of 58 to 70 (not 30 to 64) keyboards with missing or damaged W keys where the witness specified the room or office where the keyboard was located.  In addition, contrary to the GAO\u2019s statement in the table, that range does not represent \u201ckeyboards that were observed by EOP staff with missing and damaged keys.\u201d  It represents only those where a room or office was specifically identified; it does not account for the observations of other \u201cEOP staff\u201d (including the IS&T Branch Chief) who told the GAO about additional damaged keyboards.", "It is remarkable to us that the GAO would include the second cost estimate when the GAO itself acknowledges that the IS&T Associate Director\u2019s February 2002 estimate of missing and damaged keyboards was unreliable.  See Report at 42 (\u201c[the IS&T Associate Director] said that her memory regarding this matter was not as good as when we interviewed her in June 2001.).  It is all the more peculiar given that the GAO is unwilling to engage in the same sort of cost estimation when it comes to estimating the cost of missing telephone labels, the repair and replacement cost for damaged furniture, and many of the other categories of reported damage.", "Also, as stated earlier, it is not accurate to represent that the IS&T Associate Director said \u201cone-third to one-half of the keyboards for EOP staff, including the ones provided to EOP staff at the beginning of the Bush administration, may have been replaced every 3 or 4 years because of their age.\u201d the IS&T Associate Director told the GAO that the keyboards would have been replaced \u201cif they had not been changed out in 4 or 8 years.\u201d  Again, it is not clear how many (if any) of the damaged keyboards were four years old or older.

In reporting on telephones that were unplugged and/or piled up, the GAO fails to state 25 or more offices in the EEOB had phones piled up or unplugged.

Given his more than 30 years of experience managing telephone services in the White House complex, this individual\u2019s observation is particularly noteworthy.  In addition, since this individual identified the unplugged phones as an example of the vandalism, damage, or pranks that he observed while surveying the EEOB on January 19 and the early morning of January 20, it is clear that the phones were not unplugged by the telephone services personnel or by the cleaning staff, who had not yet entered these rooms.  We believe that this information is important and, in its absence, the report is incomplete.

For instance, an individual who is employed by the OA and worked here during the Clinton Administration told the GAO that there was \u201cno working phone on south side of building.\u201d  Since there are a minimum of 26 offices on the south side of the first floor of the EEOB, each of which would contain at least one phone \u2013 and likely many more than that \u2013 the problem with non-working phones was extensive.", "79.", "PAGE 58.

All of the 29 service orders mentioning labels were part of orders for other telephone services.  In discussing these documents, the OA telephone service coordinator said that the requests for labels did not necessarily mean that the telephones had been missing labels with telephone numbers.

One employee said that she saw some fax machines sitting in the middle of the floor, unplugged.

Moreover, even if the GAO disagrees and believe that a fax machine could belong in the middle of the floor, that is a judgment that the reader should be allowed to make.", "More important, by recharacterizing the observation, the GAO deprives the reader of the facts that he or she needs to judge the relevance and credibility of the comments made by former staff members.  On page 66, the GAO reports that \u201che former director of an office where fax machines were moved to areas other than where they had been installed said that a fax machine may have been pulled around a corner, but it was not done as a prank.\u201d  But this explanation does not answer the charge: that multiple fax machines were placed in the middle of the floor, unplugged.  Unfortunately, the reader would not know that because the GAO fails to provide the details needed to have a complete and accurate understanding of the matters reported.", "89.", "PAGE 65.

See General Comment No. 3.  The existence of trash in offices was not, in our view, the problem; the problem was that many offices were trashed \u2013 and, as the observers told the GAO, it appeared that it was deliberately left in that condition.

In addition, the GAO should add similar statements by an employee who has worked at the White House since 1998, a second employee who has observed five prior transitions, a third employee (a Bush Administration official), and others who likewise told the GAO that it appeared that the offices were \u201cintentionally\u201d or \u201cdeliberately\u201d trashed.  The first of these individuals said that the NSC office was \u201cdeliberately made to look like someone was communicating a message.\u201d  The second said that it looked like there were a \u201clarge number of people who deliberately trashed the place.\u201d  And the Bush Administration official said the conditions he observed were \u201cmore than wear and tear.\u201d  The fact that many observers concluded that the acts were intentional is important, because, if many people reached the same conclusion, it is more likely that the conclusion was correct and a reader will perceive the conclusion to be correct.  In addition, since the GAO reports on page 72 that, \u201cnone of the 67 former Clinton Administration staff we interviewed who worked in the White House complex at end of the administration said that trash was left behind intentionally as a prank or act of vandalism,\u201d it is only appropriate that the GAO also report that many current staff members \u2013 including staff who worked for the Clinton Administration \u2013 believe otherwise.", "99.", "PAGE 71.  The GAO\u2019s discussion of the costs associated with cleaning the \u201ctrashed\u201d offices is incomplete.", "The GAO fails to mention the January 30, 2001, facility request form (No. 56713) which shows that Cabinet Affairs asked for someone to clean the carpet, furniture, and drapes in Rooms 160, 162, and 164.  GSA charged $2,905.70 for that service. As the GAO acknowledged earlier in its report (at page 12), this request involved an office that a White House Office \u201cemployee said was \u2018filthy\u2019 and worn and dirty furniture.\u201d  That same employee, as well as others from her office, also told the GAO about significant damage to furniture in those offices, including a desk drawer with its drawer-fronts removed, chairs without legs, and a chair with its entire back broken off.", "The GAO could \u2013 but did not \u2013 determine how much time and money was actually spent paying the cleaning staff and how much time and money should reasonably have been spent (based on the amounts spent during past transitions or estimates provided by administrative staff). The difference in those amounts would provide a rough estimate of the costs attributable to the poor condition of the offices.  We already know that the costs exceeded what was expected because the OA manager responsible for facilities management told the GAO that there was \u201clots of money that was spent that shouldn\u2019t have to be spent.\u201d", "Nor did the GAO include in its estimate of costs all of the facility request forms that show that the new staff had to request that carpets, furniture, and draperies be cleaned.  While in some cases, the GSA pays for the costs associated with such cleaning (and hence no dollar amount appears on the form), actual costs exist and presumably could be estimated.", "If the GAO is unwilling to estimate these costs, we believe that it should at least say that additional costs exist, and that the GAO did not attempt to quantify them.  And again, the problem was far more than simply \u201cexcessive trash that needed to be discarded,\u201d as the GAO reports. 100.  PAGE 72.  Although the GAO is willing to report that ormer Clinton administration staff generally said the amount of trash that was observed during the transition was what could be expected when staff move out of office space after 8 years,\u201d the GAO fails to mention that one employee, who also served during the Clinton Administration, told the GAO that what she observed \u201cwas way beyond what you\u2019d expect to see in a large move\u201d; she was \u201csurprised\u201d and \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the condition of the offices on Inaugural weekend; and she knew that the same offices were in pretty good shape during the weeks and months before the transition. 101.  PAGE 72.  The GAO states that \u201cne former employee who worked in an administrative office said that she did not observe much cleaning of offices before January 20, and she believed that GSA did not have enough supervisors and decision makers to oversee the cleaning.\u201d  We previously told GAO that, if the report was going to include this comment, it should also state (either here or elsewhere in the report) how many cleaning staff were on duty and the hours they worked.  Without that information, we believe the reader has no basis for evaluating the comments made by the former staff.", "In a letter sent to us in January 2002, the former director of the Office of Management and Administration and the former senior advisor for presidential transition said that, for months before the transition, they had been assured that additional cleaning crews would be detailed to the White House complex to assist GSA cleaning crews during the final week of the administration.   However, the former officials said that they did not observe any cleaning crews during the evening of January 19 or the morning of January 20.", "Again, we believe that if the GAO is going to include this criticism of the cleaning staff, it must also provide the reader with an estimate \u2013 based on the GAO\u2019s review of the GSA\u2019s work and payroll records (records that the GAO already has) \u2013 of the number of cleaning staff and contractors who worked that weekend and the numbers of hours worked.  Otherwise, the reader has no means of evaluating the comment \u2013 either its credibility or its relevance. 104.  PAGE 73.  The GAO reports that \u201che office manager for the office where an EOP employee told us that it appeared that a pencil sharpener was thrown against the wall and that pencil shavings were on the floor said the sharpener in that office did not work and may have been placed on the floor with other items to be removed.\u201d", "The employee told the GAO that two pencil sharpeners were found broken and on the floor along with shavings.  In addition, with respect to one of the two sharpeners, there was a distinct mark where the pencil sharpener struck the wall.  The comment of the former office manager thus does not rebut the employee\u2019s observations.", "Six EOP staff reported observing writing on the wall of a stall in a men\u2019s restroom that was derogatory to President Bush.  In addition, two EOP staff and one GSA employee said that they observed messages written on an office wall.  Two of those three employees said that the writing was on a writing board that could be erased.  Two other White House employees said that they saw pen and pencil marks on walls, but no written words.", "The graffiti in the men\u2019s restroom was vulgar, in addition to being derogatory to the President.  It said, \u201cWhat W did to democracy, you are about to do in here.\u201d  It was an act that was plainly intentional and, given its content, the GAO could reasonably conclude that it was written shortly before the transition.", "The writing on the wall in the Scheduling Office, while not profane in nature, said something like \u201cRepublicans, don\u2019t get comfortable, we\u2019ll be back,\u201d thus again indicating that it was written shortly before the transition and by a member of the outgoing staff.  One of the three observers who saw the room shortly after noon on January 20, told the GAO that he was certain that the writing was directly on the wall.", "The GAO\u2019s final sentence \u2013 that \u201cwo other White House employees said that they saw pen and pencil marks on walls, but no written words\u201d \u2013 does not, in our view, adequately describe what the GAO was told.  These were not observations of a stray pen mark, as the sentence suggests.  Rather, one White House employee said that an entire wall in one office was covered in lines that appeared at a distance to be cracks.  That observation was confirmed by an OA employee, who said that she too had heard that someone had etched a wall like marble.  A second White House employee said that a wall in or near Room 158 was covered in pencil and pen marks, which she described as \u201cslasher marks\u201d and \u201cbeyond normal\u201d wear and tear. 106.  PAGES 75-76.   We believe that the GAO has downplayed the number of the signs, the number of locations where they were observed, and their content.", "While in some cases such signs are easily removed and, in a few cases, were probably meant as a joke, we believe the GAO should describe the signs more fully and with greater detail for at least three reasons.  First, the number, tone, and location of the signs may indicate the mindset of certain former staff members in offices where other damage was found.  Second, these details allow the reader to compare the 2001 transition and prior transitions.  Notably, the GAO has included considerable detail about the number and content of signs found by former members of the Clinton Administration during the 1993 transition.  Yet the same level of detail is lacking when the GAO discusses the 2001 transition. Third, and similarly, if the report is going to include a former staff member\u2019s comment that the signs were \u201charmless\u201d (Report at 76) or not \u201cobscene\u201d (Report at 75), we believe that the GAO should provide the signs\u2019 contents, or how the observer described the signs (e.g. \u201cvulgar\u201d), so that the reader can decide whether the characterizations are accurate.", "We also believe that stickers that were permanently affixed to government property (copiers and cabinets) are not the same as prank signs or messages that were simply taped on a wall or placed in copy machines and printers.  Yet the GAO treats these things as equivalent.", "The tables below detail the number, location, and content of some of the signs that were SIGNS AFFIXED TO FURNITURE AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PROPERTY Sticker affixed to filing cabinet that reads \u201cjail to the thief\u201d; shown to Key broken off in file cabinet with Gore bumper sticker with the words \u201cBush Sucks\u201d stuck to the inside of the cabinet (observed by two persons)", "Gore bumper sticker stuck to the bottom of paper tray in the copier (not including signs affixed to property) \u201cVulgar words\u201d on white board** Sign comparing President Bush to a chimpanzee found \u201cin a number of printers\u201d; \u201claced\u201d throughout the reams of paper *** Three copies of the same sign taped to wall (observed by two persons)**, **** 15-20 copies of the same sign laced throughout ream of paper in fax machine and copier (observed by two persons)", "In location where people \u201cdumped\u201d supplies, a sign read \u201cGifts for the New President\u201d (Head Telephone Operator*****)", "Sign taped to a desk of a mock MasterCard ad that includes a picture of President Bush and reads, \u201cNEW BONG: $50, COCAINE HABIT: $300, FINDING OUT THAT THE GOOD-OLD-BOY NETWORK CAN STILL RIG AN ELECTION IN THE DEEP SOUTH:  PRICELESS.

PAGE 77.  It is not accurate, in our view, for the GAO to say that the statement that trucks were needed to recover new and usable supplies \u201cgenerally was not corroborated.\u201d", "OA\u2019s Associate Director for the General Services Division told the GAO that, because the excess supplies had been \u201cdumped\u201d in the basement hall and were piling up down there \u2013 leaving \u201cmuch of it unusable\u201d \u2013 he instructed his staff to take the supplies to the off-site warehouse where the staff could re-sort the supplies and salvage what was still reusable.  As the GAO itself reports, eight truckloads were needed to recover these new and usable supplies from the basement.  Had these trucks not been dispatched, all of the supplies (instead of just of portion) would have been rendered unusable.  Thus the statement in the June 2001 list was \u201ccorroborated.\u201d 108.  PAGE 78.  Two employees (not one) told the GAO that they had found classified materials left unsecured in multiple locations.  An employee with more than 30 years of service in the White House complex told the GAO that he found classified materials in an unlocked safe during the night of January 19, when he toured the offices.  In addition, a GSA employee said she found \u201cclassified information\u201d in \u201cquite a few rooms.\u201d  It is understandable if the Director of Records Management did not find these documents himself, since he toured offices looking for documents for less than two-and-one-half hours before his attention was diverted to the West Wing at approximately 2:30 a.m. on January 20.", "Also, as the GAO notes, a White House employee reported that he found a selection of sensitive documents, including some pardon-related materials and some fundraising materials, in the Counsel\u2019s Office in the EEOB.  It is not surprising that the Director of Records Management did not find these documents since the occupants of the Counsel\u2019s Office did not depart their offices until long after he stopped checking rooms in the EEOB at approximately 2:30 a.m. 109.  PAGE 80.  Appendix II addresses the condition of the White House complex during previous presidential transitions and compares that to the 2001 transition, where the GAO states that an \u201cEOP employee showed us writing inside a desk that was dated January 1993.\u201d  The writing in the desk is neither profane nor disparaging of the incoming President or his administration.  It reads:  \u201cTake care of this place.  We will be back in four (4) years! (1/93).\u201d 110.  PAGE 81.  The GAO has included only some of the statements made by current staff members about past transitions.  The GAO, for instance, fails to mention that several employees, including longtime staff members, said that the 2001 transition was \u201cworse\u201d (and not only with respect to the amount of trash) than what they had seen during past transitions.  Omitted statements include the following:", "After an individual employed at the White House since 1973 described problems found with the phones, the GAO asked, \u201cIs this sort of thing unusual?\u201d  This employee responded yes, \u201cthis was unusual\u201d; \u201cevery administration has pranks,\u201d but this was \u201cworse.\u201d", "When the GAO asked the same individual whether it looked like the prior occupants had \u201cpurposely trashed the place,\u201d he replied that it was \u201cnot sloppiness, it looked like one big party\u201d had been there and that he \u201cnever remembers seeing anything like this before.\u201d", "The same employee told the GAO explicitly that the offices \u201cshined\u201d during the Reagan Administration and that, when President George H.W. Bush left office, \u201c never encountered any problems with telephones\u201d; perhaps \u201cunplugging of phones, but that was it.\u201d", "An individual who observed the transitions from Nixon to Ford, Ford to Carter, Reagan to Bush, Bush to Clinton, and Clinton to Bush, said that he had \u201cnever seen anything like it\u201d and had \u201cnever seen this building  in such bad condition.\u201d", "Another individual, an OA employee for roughly 17 years, said that the trash was worse this time than in prior transitions; in addition, he told the GAO that the condition in which the building was left \u201cwas a bit juvenile\u201d and suggested the prior occupants were \u201cnot cognizant of responsibilities of people coming behind .\u201d", "A GSA manager told the GAO that there were \u201cfar more\u201d personal belongings left behind during the 2001 transition than during the 1989 transition.", "In addition to telling the GAO that the offices were \u201cdirtier than past transitions,\u201d an OA employee with more than 30 years of service said that the amount of trash \u201cwas beyond the norm.\u201d", "A Bush Administration official, who was in charge of the transition out of government in 1992, told the GAO that he personally took a tour of four floors of the OEOB and West Wing on January 20, 1993, and he saw \u201cnothing comparable\u201d to what he saw during this transition.  He twice told the GAO that the damage during this transition was \u201cmore than \u2019d seen in other transitions.\u201d", "An OA employee who has worked in the complex for 23 years and observed seeing problems during the 2001 transition, told the GAO that she \u201cdidn\u2019t notice anything at all\u201d during Bush-to-Clinton transition; nor did she recall anything when the Carter Administration left office.", "The OA associate director for facilities management said that every transition had had a problem with missing historic doorknobs.  Similarly, the director of GSA\u2019s White House service center said that doorknobs are favorite souvenirs of departing staff.  The telephone service director said that telephone cords were unplugged and office signs were missing in previous transitions and that unplugging telephones is a \u201cstandard prank.\u201d", "The GAO fails to mention that the GSA director has observed only two transitions \u2013 the 2001 transition and the 1989 transition.  He said that he had only heard that doorknobs went missing during the 1989 transition; he did not observe anything himself.", "The Director of White House Telephone Services did not say that office signs were missing in previous transitions.  He recalled that occurring in one prior transition.  He recalled that, when the Carter Administration left office, \u201cdoor signs were missing and cords unplugged.\u201d 112.  PAGE 82.  The GAO states that \u201che director of GSA\u2019s White House service center during the 2001 transition said that the condition of the office space during the 2001 transition was the same as what he observed during the 1989 transition.\u201d  But the GSA employee observed little in the way of pranks, damage, or vandalism during the 2001 transition; saying that he \u201csaw much the same thing\u201d during the 1989 transition means that he claims not to have observed much in either transition. 113.  PAGE 82.  The GAO\u2019s reference to what the GSA Acting Administrator said in his March 2, 2001, letter may be misleading to the reader.  The GSA\u2019s letter references only \u201cthe condition of the real property\u201d \u2013 and not the telephones, the computers, the furniture, the office signs, etc., which were the focus of the damage, vandalism, and pranks that occurred during the 2001 transition. 114.  PAGE 83.  The GAO reports that \u201ceven former employees . . . said that computers were not operational or were missing hard drives at the beginning of the Clinton administration.  Two of those employees said it took 1 to 2 weeks for the computers to work.\u201d  The GAO was told that computers were not working and hard drives were missing because the prior Bush Administration was required to remove the hard drives in connection with a case captioned Armstrong v. Bush.  The GAO obliquely refers to the case in footnote 64, but a reader will not understand the relevance without further explanation. 115.  PAGE 83.  The GAO reports that \u201cwo former employees said that telephones were piled on the floors or were disconnected.  (One of those former employees said she was told that staff would receive new telephones.)\u201d  An employee with over 30 years of service told the GAO that, when the Clinton Administration came into office, he was instructed to \u201cget rid of  Republican phone system.\u201d  This would explain why the former employees found phones disconnected and were \u201ctold that staff would receive new telephones.\u201d 116.  PAGE 83.  We again note the GAO\u2019s willingness to include a characterization by a former staff member who says that damage \u201cappeared to have been . . . intentional,\u201d but the GAO omitted from its report similar statements made by members of the current staff.", "The White House telephone services coordinator told the GAO that the missing phone labels  \u201cmust have been intentional.\u201d", "An employee who has worked at the White House since 1998 told the GAO that the rooms he observed were \u201cdeliberately made to look like someone was communicating a message.\u201d", "A former White House manager told the GAO that some of conditions he saw looked \u201cintentional.\u201d", "An individual who has observed five prior transitions said the offices looked like a \u201carge number of people . . . deliberately trashed the place.\u201d", "A current employee told the GAO that the desk drawers were clearly damaged intentionally and not just wear and tear.", "An employee who worked at the White House from 1999-2001 told the GAO that \u201cit was intentional, not accidental\u201d with respect to the damage he observed in dozens of rooms.", "A Bush Administration official who has participated in a prior transition told the GAO that the conditions he observed were \u201cmore than wear and tear.\u201d", "A current employee said that the broken key in the file cabinet looked \u201cdeliberate\u201d to him.", "An OA employee responsible for facilities management said that some of the damage was the result of \u201cintentional trashing.\u201d", "An employee with over 30 years of service in the White House said it looked like the prior occupants had \u201cpurposely trashed the place.\u201d", "One former employee who started working at the White House in January 1993 and left in January 2001 said that the officers were messier in January 1993 compared with January 2001.  Another former employee said that on January 20, 1993, his office contained leftover food and that the walls needed repainting.  A third former employee said the offices were still not cleaned by the afternoon of January 21, 1993.  Another former employee said that there were \u2018dusty and dirty\u2019 typewriters on desks.", "Three former staff said they saw a total of at least six Bush bumper stickers in different offices, on cubicle walls, in a desk, on a telephone.", "One former employee said she saw one to two photocopies of political cartoons left in a copy machine, a bottle of aspirin with a prank note inside a desk, a large banner on the balcony of the EEOB, and a tarp for a tent left behind.", "Again, we note that the same level of detail \u2013 for precisely the same sort of allegations \u2013 is lacking when GAO describes observations made during the 2001 transition.  By not including this information for the 2001 transition, the GAO has failed, in our view, to include all information needed to satisfy the audit objective to compare the 2001 transition with past transitions.  See Government Auditing Standard 7.50 and 7.51 (\u201cThe report should be complete. . .  . Being complete requires that the report contain all information to satisfy the audit objectives, promote an adequate and correct understanding of the matters reported, and meet the report content requirements.  It also means including appropriate background information.\u201d). 118.  PAGES 84-85.  The GAO was able to find only one news report that mentions the condition of the White House complex during previous transitions.  The GAO claims that \u201cthe Washingtonian magazine indicated that incoming Reagan administration staff had some complaints about the condition of the EEOB that were similar to observations made by EOP staff in 2001.\u201d  The Reagan administration staff complaints were, according to the article, finding memoranda taped to the walls; lampshades torn by paperclips hung on them to hold messages; a refrigerator with thick mold; and a large coffee stain on a sofa outside the vice president\u2019s office.  These allegations are hardly \u201csimilar,\u201d as the GAO maintains, to what was found in 2001 transition.  By analogizing the circumstances, the GAO trivializes what was observed in 2001.", "Part III:  Comments on Recommendations 119.  PAGES 86-87.  Although Appendix III is entitled \u201cSteps to Help Prevent Damage to Government Property during Future Presidential Transitions,\u201d the draft report does not actually contain any \u201csteps\u201d or recommendations in this section.  It simply discusses the check-out process used during the Clinton Administration and the procedures followed on Capitol Hill when offices are vacated. 120.  The GAO fails to include anywhere in its report two of the factors that OA officials, who have been through many transitions, identified as contributing to the problems found in the January 2001 transition.", "First, an employee who has worked at the White House for over 30 years told the GAO that he felt \u201champered\u201d in doing his job because he was \u201cnot allowed to have any contact with the incoming Administration.\u201d  He indicated that, in the past, he was allowed to confer with incoming staff regarding their telephone needs and expectations; but this was not permitted during the 2001 transition.  Likewise, an employee who has observed five prior transitions told the GAO that this transition was unusual because, for other transitions, there was a transition team from the new Administration on-site in the complex.  This time, the person said, the incoming administration did not get access to the space until three days before the Inauguration and did not get \u201clegacy books\u201d \u2013 books that explain how things work within the complex and within particular offices \u2013 until after the Inauguration.", "Second, a number of longtime employees told the GAO that problems could have been averted or remedied sooner if members of the Clinton Administration had vacated their offices earlier.  By way of example, one OA manager recalled seeing a woman simply watching television in her office; precisely at noon, she turned her TV off and left.", "Documents that we provided the GAO show that 325 passes of White House Office employees were terminated on January 19 and January 20, 2001.", "We believe that the points made by these employees are valid ones, and deserve to be addressed in the GAO report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Response to the White House Comments", "paragraphs": ["GAO\u2019s response to the White House\u2019s specific comments follow.

However, as indicated in the results section, the  letter portion of the report only contains observations made in specific  locations, and additional observations that staff identified by floor or  building, but not by room or office, are provided in appendix I.  Moreover,  we reported some observations of signs and messages differently from the  White House.  For example, we reported observations of writing in desks in  the section regarding furniture-related problems.  In addition, we reported  two observations that the White House included in the category of signs  and messages (observations of paper hole punches arranged on a floor to  spell a word and a T-shirt draped over a chair with a picture of a tongue  sticking out) in a different category relating to observations of trash and  personal items left behind.  We also added to our count two Gore stickers  that staff told us were found in a file cabinet, which we had not included in  our draft report.", "The White House also said in comments 9 and 106 that we should have  reported the specific content of all of the signs and messages.  We  addressed these comments in the White House\u2019s general comments about  the amount of detail provided.", "In comment 23, the White House said that writing was found on the walls of  four rooms, rather than two rooms, as the report indicated.  The statement  concerning writing on the walls in the letter portion of our report  summarized additional details provided in appendix I.  Further, by  \u201cwriting,\u201d the report referred to observations of actual words written on  walls.  As explained in appendix I, other staff observed pen and pencil  marks on the walls of two other rooms, but no words.  For the purposes of  clarification, we revised the statement to indicate that staff observed  writing \u201c(words)\u201d on the walls of two offices.", "The White House said in comments 68 and 87 that we failed to include the  statement of an EOP employee who told us about statements made by a  repairman, who while fixing a broken copy machine, said that he found a  pornographic or inappropriate message when he pulled out the copier\u2019s  paper drawer.  We did not include the repairman\u2019s statement because we  did not include information people relayed to us from third parties, which  is generally not regarded as competent evidence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Keyboards", "paragraphs": ["The White House disagreed with the range of keyboards that were  observed with missing or damaged \u201cW\u201d keys in comments 10 and 51.  We  previously explained how we calculated the range of observations in  response to the White House\u2019s general comment regarding the number of  observations reported.", "In comment 54, the White House also said that we did not report that the  Office of Administration (OA) associate director for information systems  and technology saw some glued-down space bars. Although we modified  our report, we note that this official first told us that the problem was  inoperable space bars and subsequently said it was glued down space bars.", "In comment 55, the White House said that we underreported the number of  \u201cW\u201d keys taped or glued to walls; that we failed to mention that other staff  reported that they found \u201cW\u201d keys sitting next to keyboards and computers;  and that an additional employee saw piles of keyboards or computers or a  computer monitor overturned that we did not report.  Our range of \u201cW\u201d  keys taped or glued to walls differed from what the White House had  indicated in its comments.  Further, the White House counted a least two  keys when people said they saw \u201csome\u201d keys taped or glued to walls, but  did not specify a number.  However, we did not estimate numbers in those  cases and disclosed that in the report.  We did not report the observations  of \u201cW\u201d keys sitting next to keyboards or on computers because we believed  that reporting the number of keys glued or taped to walls provided  sufficient detail to support the observation of keyboards with missing or  damaged keys.  We revised the report to indicate that five, rather than four,  employees observed piles of keyboards or computers or a computer  monitor overturned.", "In comment 56, the White House said that we did not consider the  statement of the OA branch chief for program management and strategic  planning in the information systems and technology division.  The White  House pointed out that, on one of the branch chief\u2019s last deliveries of  broken items to the temporary workroom, someone had told her that the  count of damaged keyboards was up to 150.  We did consider her  statement.  Our report contained a statement attributed to the branch chief  that 150 keyboards had to be replaced.", "The White House also said that, by contrast, we provided more details  regarding the observations made by the OA associate director for  information systems and technology, but had omitted the fact that this  official said that she was not focused on the keyboards during the  transition, but that she personally saw only about 10 keyboards with  missing \u201cW\u201d keys, a concentration of keyboards with missing \u201cW\u201d keys in  certain offices, and some keyboards with glued-down space bars, and that  she was very upset at the condition in which some of the keyboards were  left.  In addition, the White House said that during our second interview  with the OA associate director for information systems and technology, we  had asked this official to estimate the number of keyboards with missing  \u201cW\u201d keys without reminding her that we had asked her the same question  during our first interview with her.", "To address the White House\u2019s comments, we added to the report  statements contained in our interview record with the OA associate  director for information systems and technology indicating that she said  that she was not focused on the keyboards during the transition, but that  she saw about 10 keyboards with missing \u201cW\u201d keys, some with glued-down  space bars, and a lot of keyboards that were \u201cfilthy.\u201d  We also added, on the  basis of our interview record, that she believed that more of the keyboards  with problems were found in the offices of the first lady and vice president  than in other offices.  However, contrary to the White House\u2019s assertion,  our record regarding the follow-up interview with this official indicated  that we did remind her about her earlier statement about the number of  keyboards with missing \u201cW\u201d keys when we asked her that question again.   As indicated in the report, we asked to conduct a follow-up interview with  this official after obtaining an estimate from the branch chief for program  management and strategic planning in the information and technology  section that about 150 keyboards had to be replaced because of missing or  damaged \u201cW\u201d keys.", "Also in comment 56, the White House said that we did not report what the  OA associate director for information systems and technology said the  contract employee who packed the keyboards told her regarding the  number of damaged keyboards.  However, we did not include observations  people relayed to us from third parties.  Further, the contract employee\u2019s  statements that she provided to us during an interview were provided in the  report.  The White House also noted that we did not meet with the branch  chief, but interviewed her by telephone; we made the appropriate change.   Finally, the White House said that we had misquoted the OA associate  director for information systems and technology when we indicated that  she said that of the 100 keyboards that had to be replaced, about one-third  to one-half would have been replaced anyway because of their age.  The  White House said that this official told us that one-third to one-half of the  keyboards would have been replaced if they had not been changed out in 4  to 8 years.  Although our interview records indicated that this official said  that one-third to one-half of the keyboards would have been replaced  anyway, they did not indicate that she also said \u201cif they had not been  changed out in 4 to 8 years\u201d as the White House indicated, so we did not  change the report.", "In comment 57, the White House said that, regarding the 12 boxes of  computer equipment that were discarded, we should have explained that  the contract employee personally packed some of the boxes; and that for  those, she filled the boxes with keyboards and then used excessed  speakers, cords, and soundcards to fill in gaps and ensure that the  keyboards would not shift in the box.  We did not believe these details to be  relevant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missing Items", "paragraphs": ["The White House said in comments 19 and 44 that 11 to 13 doorknobs were  observed missing, compared to the 10 to 11 contained in the report.  Our  total differed from the White House\u2019s because (1) the White House counted  0 to 2 missing doorknobs in its range when an Executive Office of the  President (EOP) employee said a doorknob was missing in the Eisenhower  Executive Office Building (EEOB) but did not specify any location (room,  office, or floor); however, we did not include it to prevent possible double  counting of missing doorknobs where specific locations were identified;  and (2) the White House counted two missing doorknobs when an EOP  employee said that a doorknob was missing on a certain floor of the EEOB,  but did not identify the room. However, because we did not know whether  a doorknob was missing on both sides of the door in that case, we used a  range of one to two.  (Although this employee did not specify the room or  office where the doorknob was observed missing, we counted this because  it was on a floor of the EEOB where no other doorknobs were observed  missing.)", "In comment 41, the White House noted that four of the six EOP staff who  told us that they observed a total of 5 to 11 missing office signs were OA  employees and worked in the White House complex during the Clinton  administration, and that the fifth employee who worked for the White  House Office also served during the Clinton administration.  We did not  believe these details were needed and did not revise the report in response  to this comment because we generally did not differentiate among staff  who had worked in the White House complex before or after January 20,  2001, in reporting the observations.  Also in comment 41, the White House  said that one of the employees told us that a former Clinton administration  employee told her that he also observed two missing brackets on the  morning of January 20.  However, we did not report this statement because  we did not include observations people relayed to us from a third party.   Nonetheless, we also interviewed that former Clinton administration  employee, who said that he noticed that some office name signs were  missing, but could not recall how many.  He also said that he did not see  any metal frames for the signs that were missing.", "In comment 22, the White House asked that we quote from a facility request  form that asked GSA to \u201cput doorknob on\u201d an interoffice door.  In addition,  in comment 45, the White House said that we should state that the  recollection of a General Services Administration (GSA) planner/estimator  regarding this repair is inconsistent with the request form and the  recollections of at least three current staff members.  The statement  contained in the letter portion of the report summarized information  provided in more detail in appendix I, where the facility request form was  quoted directly.  However, we revised the statement contained in the letter  portion of the report to quote from the form.  Regarding the White House\u2019s  request that we state that a GSA employee\u2019s recollection is inconsistent  with the facility request form and the recollections of at least three current  staff members, the report indicated an EOP employee told us that he had  observed two pairs of missing doorknobs in this office.  Because no other  EOP staff told us that they observed missing doorknobs in this office,  including the employee who prepared the request, (who did not request to  be interviewed by us) we did not include the statements contained in the  White House\u2019s comments.  Further, in the White House\u2019s table of missing  doorknobs provided in comment 19, the White House only provided the  account of one person who observed missing doorknobs in that office.", "The White House also said in comments 22 and 45 that, if we include a  statement by a GSA planner/estimator that he received no written facility  requests made to GSA for replacing office signs, medallions, or doorknobs  during the transition, we should cite facility requests to \u201cput\u2026on\u201d a  doorknob and for \u201creplacement of frames & medallions,\u201d dated February 7  and April 19, 2001.  The February 7 request was contained in the report.  In  response to the White House\u2019s comments 22, 43, and 45, we added the April  19 request, even though it was prepared 3 months after the transition.  The  White House also said we should report statements made by two OA  officials and a White House Office employee about missing building  fixtures.  However, we did not believe these additional comments were  essential, and one of the statements was information that was relayed to us  from a third party, so we did not include them.", "The White House also said in comments 20 and 46 that the report should  have included an additional television remote control that was observed  missing.  Our interview notes indicated that one employee initially told us  that five or six remotes were missing in a certain office, but later in the  interview said that five were missing, which we had used in our draft report  in reporting the total number of remote controls observed missing by all  EOP staff.  However, in response to the White House\u2019s comments, we  changed the number that she observed to five or six.", "The White House also said in comment 46 that we should note that one of  the observers had worked in that office during the Clinton administration,  which we added because we believed it could be relevant to the  observation.  However, we did not discuss the two observations of missing  television remotes separately, as the White House suggested, because we  did not believe the additional detail would add any essential information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Furniture", "paragraphs": ["The White House said in comments 14 and 59 that we underreported the  number of reports of damaged furniture and the number of observers.

However, we broke out  observations of furniture-related problems into various subcategories, such  as broken furniture, furniture with damaged locks, chairs with torn fabric,  and desks with burns and scratches.", "In comments 16 and 66, the White House said that the report failed to  include a January 29, 2001, facility request form that documented a request  to obtain a key to a file cabinet that was locked in an office where an EOP  employee said he had observed damaged furniture.  The report had cited a  January 25, 2001, facility request made by the same employee to gain  access to a locked file cabinet in the same room that was cited in the  January 29 request.  However, in response to the White House\u2019s request, we  added the January 29 request to the report, even though it did not indicate  any additional problems were reported.", "The White House said in comments 17 and 62 that we underreported the  number of pieces of furniture that were observed overturned.  We  compared our interview records to the information provided by the White  House and found that our records of the interviews differed from the White  House\u2019s account of the interviews in some cases.  In one case, when we  interviewed an official, he mentioned various pieces of furniture that he  had observed overturned, but when he provided a tour of that office to  show what he had seen, he did not mention all of the pieces of furniture.   We added three additional pieces of furniture to reflect the statement he  made during the interview.   However, we did not add, as the White House  did, observations of furniture in locations that staff could not recall  because they could have duplicated ones reported observed in specific  locations.", "In comment 64, the White House disputed a GSA official\u2019s statement that  furniture could be overturned for a variety of reasons, such as to reach  electrical or computer connections.  We obtained this comment directly  from GSA on April 30, 2002, and GSA did not raise any objection to it in its  comments on our draft report.  It is important to note, however, that this  statement was a generic possible explanation that did not relate to a  specific observation.", "The White House said in comments 18 and 65 that our description of  observations of a sticky substance that was found on desks was inaccurate  and incomplete, and it also provided further details.  We believe that the  report generally provided a sufficient level of detail regarding these  observations.  However, to address the White House\u2019s comments, we added  more information about these observations in appendix I.", "In comment 29, the White House disagreed that the observations of  damaged furniture differed from the June 2001 list in terms of total  numbers and extent of damage.  In our discussion of furniture-related  observations in the letter portion of the report, we summarized the extent  of damage that staff said they observed regarding broken furniture and  stated that no information was provided that identified which offices some  of the broken furniture came from or exactly when the damage occurred.   Further, no one reported actually observing furniture being intentionally  damaged, and no definitive evidence was provided regarding whether the  damage was intentional.  Consequently, we were unable to conclude  whether the furniture in six offices was intentionally damaged severely  enough to require complete refurbishment or destruction, as indicated in  the June 2001 list.", "In comment 61, the White House said that we mistakenly reported that five  staff said they observed writing inside drawers of five desks and that we  were shown writing in four of those five desks.  Instead, the White House  said, five staff observed writing in or on six desks, that not all of the writing  was inside drawers, and that we observed writing in five of the six desks.   However, the White House included a sticker on a desk that we had  counted in another category of observations (signs and written messages).   The report indicated that we had observed that sticker.", "Finally, the White House said in comment 72 that we were wrong in saying  that, during the first of two interviews we held with an EOP employee, she  said that her observations, which included desks with burn marks and  scratches, pertained to a particular office, rather than a suite of offices.   The White House also pointed out that we were taken into the two offices  that she was referring to.  However, our record of this interview indicated  that her observations pertained to a particular office and that she  repeatedly referred to the previous occupant of that specific office.   Further, when we toured the office suite in question, she did not stop to  discuss furniture in an adjacent reception area as well.  In any event, we  reported that in a follow-up interview with this employee, she said that her  observations pertained to two rooms in an office suite."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Offices with Trash", "paragraphs": ["In comment 4, the White House said that the statement \u201cultiple people  said that \u2026they observed (1) many offices that were messy, disheveled, or  contained excessive trash or personal items\u201d was an understatement and  provided other observations that were made in the office space, such as  \u201cW\u201d keys glued to the walls and overturned furniture.  This statement was a  part of a summary paragraph of certain observations regarding trash and  personal items that were left behind; other types of observations that the  White House mentioned are contained elsewhere in the report.", "In comment 12, the White House said that the report\u2019s description of the  seven photographs that were taken of offices in the EEOB on January 21,  2001, was incomplete.  The description of the photographs provided in the  letter portion of the report summarized a more detailed description of the  photographs that is provided in appendix I.", "In comments 13 and 92, the White House said that our list of facility request  forms in appendix II that document the condition of the offices was  incomplete.  It cited two facility request forms dated January 30 and others  dated January 25, February 17, and February 21.  One of the January 30  request forms was already cited in the report, and we added the other one.   We also added the January 25 request form to the report, which requested  cleaning services in the same room as the February 17 request and was in  the report.  We did not include the February 21 facility request form  because it was unclear whether the request for carpet cleaning necessarily  corroborated reports of pencil shavings, paper, and files on the floor, which  were made during the first days of the administration.  The request was  made a month after the observations were made and we did not know  whether cleaning was needed as a result of the observations that were  made during the first days of the administration or some other reason.", "In comment 13, the White House said that, in describing one of the January  30 facility request forms, our description of the condition of the office  where work was requested was incomplete.  The White House noted that  staff also told us about significant damage to furniture in that office suite,  including a desk drawer with its drawer fronts removed, chairs without  legs, and a chair with its entire back broken off.  However, we did not  mention those additional observations with respect to the facility request  form because the form did not corroborate them.  With respect to furniture,  the January 30 request form that the White House cited in comment 13 only  requested furniture cleaning.  The additional observations that the White  House referred to actually pertain to a different office for which another  January 30 facility request was made.  However, that January 30 request  form also did not corroborate observations of broken furniture.  With  respect to furniture, that form only indicated that furniture cleaning was  requested.", "In comment 90, with regard to the section heading \u201ctrash,\u201d the White House  said that we apparently equated a statement in the June 2001 list that  offices were left in a state of general trashing, which is not the same as  saying that they had trash in them.  The White House said that we should  revise our \u201ctrash\u201d section heading to \u201ctrashing of offices.\u201d  Although some  portion of the observations reported in this section could have been  \u201ctrashing,\u201d i.e., vandalism, many of them were only observations of trash  and personal items left behind.  Further, although the White House  included in the June 2001 list \u201cglass top smashed and on the floor\u201d under  the category of \u201coffices were left in a state of general trashing,\u201d we reported  observations of broken glass desk tops in the section of appendix I  regarding furniture.  Therefore, we did not change the section heading to  \u201cTrashing of Offices,\u201d but to \u201cTrash and Related Observations.\u201d", "In comment 91, the White House said that we had made a gross  understatement by indicating staff had observed offices that were messy,  dirty, and disheveled.  The White House asked that we accurately report  what we were told, rather than recharacterize it, and provided a table  providing statements that staff had made regarding \u201ctrashed\u201d offices.  We  believe that we already reported a sufficient amount of information about  these types of observations.  First, we reported the total number of people  who observed offices that were messy, disheveled, dirty, or containing  trash or personal items left behind (a broader category that the White  House indicated in its comments) in specific rooms or offices, on certain  floors, or in locations they could not recall.  Second, we provided several  examples of how offices were described.  Third, we reported related  observations in several related categories, such as food left in refrigerators;  furniture, carpet, or drapes that were dirty; contents of desk drawers or  filing cabinets dumped on floors; pencil sharpener shavings and paper hole  punches on the floor, as well as several singular observations.  Fourth, we  reported detailed observations about trash made by the OA associate  director for facilities management and a White House management office  employee.  Fifth, we described photographs of messy offices that the White  House provided.  As in several other comments, the counsel to the  president asked that we expand our reporting of certain problems by  providing selected additional details.  However, our goal was to be  objective and not only provide additional details that supported a single  perspective.", "In comment 97, the White House said that we improperly redefined the  observations to simply a discussion of excessive trash, when the  observations were not limited to such.  The White House cited a statement  contained in the report made by a White House management office  employee who told us what he observed was probably a combination of  some trash having been dumped intentionally and an accumulation built up  over the years.  However, the White House said that this employee\u2019s  statement was far more direct and covered more than just trash.  According  to the White House, when we asked this employee whether the condition of  the offices, which included, among other things, filth and trash, was  intentional or a result of neglect, he responded that it was a combination.", "Our interview record indicated that this employee said that he saw trash  everywhere, but did not know whether the amount of trash left was  intentional or was due to a lack of maintenance.  He said the \u201cfilth\u201d that he  found was probably an accumulation from over the years and that some  looked like it had been dumped intentionally.  He also mentioned that he  had found trash in desks and food left behind.  We believe that these  observations were sufficiently reported and that no additional information  needed to be added.", "In comment 100, the White House said that we failed to report a statement  made by an employee who also served during the Clinton administration  who told us that what she observed was way beyond what you would  expect to see in a large move, that she was surprised and embarrassed by  the condition of the offices during the inaugural weekend, and that she  knew that the same offices were in pretty good shape during the weeks and  month before the transition.  We did not add the statement that the White  House suggested because the report already included in appendix II the  views of several staff who said that more cleaning was required during the  2001 transition than during previous ones."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Telephones", "paragraphs": ["The White House said in comments 24, 75, and 79 that we underreported  the number of telephones observed with missing labels and the number of  observers.  The report contained a different number of missing telephone  labels observed than the White House indicated for several reasons.  First,  our records of observations differed from the table that the White House  provided in its comments in some cases.  For example, the White House  included the observations of 3 to 5 missing labels by two employees that we  did not have in our interview records.  One of those two employees did not  request to be interviewed by us, and we have no record of obtaining  comments from that individual.  Our record of interview with the other  employee (the telephone service director) did not indicate that he observed  any labels missing from that room.  The interview record also indicated  that he said the telephones with missing labels that he observed were all on  the first floor of the EEOB; however, the room that the White House cited  was on another floor.   Because we were informed that this individual had  retired from the EOP since we interviewed him, we were not in a position  to resolve this.  Second, the White House double counted the number of  telephones with missing labels in a certain office, which increased the high  end of its total range of missing labels, which we did not do.", "Third, when we interviewed the telephone service director, he provided  some different information during his interview than he did during a tour  he provided to show us where he observed telephones with missing labels.   We used the information that he provided during the tour when he provided  more specific numbers and locations than he had during the interview.  By  contrast, the White House appeared to have counted the information that  he provided both during the interview and the tour.", "Fourth, in its tally, the White House counted at least two missing labels  when an individual did not provide a specific number, but said \u201clabels\u201d or  \u201csome\u201d were missing, which we did not do in our final count.  The total  number of missing telephone labels contained in our draft report had  included our assignment of one missing label to reflect an instance where  the specific number observed was not provided.  However, for consistency  in reporting all observations when people did not cite the specific number  of incidents, we did not estimate the number of telephones with missing  labels in this instance and revised our total count by reducing it by one.  We  also added a footnote explaining that the total range of missing telephone  labels does not reflect a number that the telephone service director said he  observed in a room, but did not specify how many.", "In comment 25, the White House said we did not report how many  telephones were unplugged or piled up or how many offices were affected.  According to the White House, telephones were piled up or unplugged in 25  or more offices in the EEOB.   We do not know how the White House  determined this number.  According to our records, many of the  observations were not precise regarding the locations.  In appendix I, we  reported that staff observed telephones unplugged or piled up on two  floors of the EEOB and in four specific rooms on those floors, but that was  the extent to which we could quantify the number of locations. Further, our  records indicated that although one official said that he observed seven or  eight telephones piled outside an office, the other six employees who said  they observed telephones that were unplugged or piled up did not indicate  how many they saw.", "The White House said in comment 26 that the report failed to mention the  telephones that were forwarded and reforwarded throughout the complex  during the transition.   The White House said that, according to its records,  roughly 100 telephones were forwarded to ring at other numbers.  These  observations were not reported in the letter portion of the report, but they  are discussed in appendix I.  As indicated in the results section, the  observations contained in the letter portion of the report were those made  in specific locations in the main categories, and the employee who said that  about 100 telephones had been forwarded to ring at different numbers,  with one exception, did not cite the specific locations of those telephones.", "The White House said in comments 27 and 74 that the report did not  adequately and correctly disclose information about telephone lines that  were observed ripped from walls.  In comment 27, the White House said  that, if we had reported that the people who made the observations did so  early in the morning on January 20, the comments made by a former  Clinton administration employee who said the cords were probably torn by  moving staff would be less credible because the moving staff did not begin  work until later in the day.  In response to the White House\u2019s comments, we  added additional information to appendix I about when EOP staff observed  cords pulled out of walls.  We also revised a statement made by a former  Clinton administration employee who said that (1) the cords were probably  pulled from walls by moving staff to clarify that the cords she had seen  pulled out of walls were not observed around the time of the transition, and  (2) she intended to provide a possible explanation on the basis of a  previous observation.  In comment 74, the White House said that our data  on the number of cut and pulled cords is not accurate.  Our total number of  observations and observers in this category were substantially the same,  but reported differently.  We reported observations separately of telephone  lines ripped or pulled from walls; other types of cords pulled from walls;  damaged plugs; and a telephone cord that appeared to have been cut with  scissors.  In addition, it appeared that the White House counted an  observation of a ripped cord that was not made in a specific location,  which we did not count.", "In comment 75, the White House questioned why a footnote contained in  the draft report reported a range of telephones in a certain office.  We could  not determine the exact number of telephones in that office from the  documentation that the White House provided.  Accordingly, we changed  the number to reflect an estimate provided by the White House.  The White  House also said that a total of five, not four, staff observed missing labels,  which we revised in the report.  Also in comment 75, the White House said  that our report did not include an observation that telephone labels in one  room were replaced \u201cbefore noon\u201d on January 20 and were missing again  later that day.  We added that to the report.", "The White House also said in comment 75 that, in addition to the number of  missing labels that were reported in specific rooms and offices, we should  have reported the observations of missing labels by the telephone service  director, who said that he personally saw more than 20 telephones with  missing labels; the OA associate director for facilities management, who  said that there were many instances of missing labels on telephones; and  another employee who said she was the \u201cmiddleman\u201d between EOP staff  and contractors regarding the telephones during the first month of the  administration and said that the majority of telephones in the EEOB and  the White House (roughly 85 percent) had removed labels or contained  incorrect numbers.  The telephone service director\u2019s recollections  regarding the number of telephones he observed with missing labels in  specific rooms or offices were included in the total number observed by all  staff, and we did not believe it was necessary to break out the number he  personally observed missing.  Although the OA associate director for  facilities management did not indicate how many telephones he observed  with missing labels, his observations were made in two offices where  others observed specific numbers of missing labels, and the other people\u2019s  observations are reported in the total.  Finally, the observation of the  employee who was the \u201cmiddleman\u201d between EOP staff and contractors  regarding the telephones during the first month of the administration was  already contained in the report.  According to the White House, this  employee said that a majority of labels on telephones, or about 85 percent,  had been removed \u201cor contained incorrect numbers.\u201d  Our record of this  interview indicated that she said that about 85 percent of the telephones  were missing labels \u201cor did not ring at the correct number,\u201d so we did not  revise the report.", "In comment 76, the White House said that we underreported the number of  telephones that were forwarded and reforwarded to ring at different  numbers throughout and between the EEOB and the West Wing, and  indicated that seven White House staff reported that roughly 100  telephones were forwarded to ring at other numbers.  Further, the White  House said that it did not know why we treated the observations of the  employee who coordinated telephones during the first month of the  administration differently from the other observers.  The White House also  questioned why we did not report that this employee told us that the chief  of staff\u2019s telephone was forwarded to a closet.", "We did not underreport the number of reports of telephones that were  forwarded and reforwarded.  Our count of the number of forwarded  telephones was substantially the same as what the White House indicated  in its comments.  However, we reported the observations made in specific  locations separate from the observation made by the employee who  coordinated telephones during the first month of the administration.  As  explained in our response to comment 26, that employee said that about  100 telephones had been forwarded to ring at different numbers, and with  one exception, she did not cite the specific locations of those telephones.   Further, according to its comments, the White House counted the  observation of an employee who said that the telephone number did not  ring if the number on the telephone was dialed.  Our record of interview  with that employee was different and indicated that his telephone had a  number for an extension that was different from his actual telephone  number.  We did not count that statement as an instance of a forwarded  telephone.  In addition, as indicated in the report, we had included the  observation made by the employee who coordinated telephones during the  first month of the administration of a forwarded telephone in a specific  location among the 100 telephones that she said were forwarded to other  numbers.  With respect to the one specific telephone that she cited, our  interview records indicated that she told us that the chief of staff\u2019s  telephone had been forwarded, but did not indicate that it was forwarded  to a closet.", "The White House said in comment 78 that we had dramatically understated  the number of telephones that were not working by failing to report that  one EOP employee said that no telephones were working on the south side  of the EEOB.  Our record of the interview indicated that she told us that,  because many telephones were not working in a section of a floor of the  EEOB, the switchboard forwarded calls from that area to other offices  where telephones were working, and that she walked from office to office  delivering telephone messages; we added that to the report to address the  White House\u2019s comment.  However, we did not estimate the number of  telephones that were not working in that part of the building and did not  know whether they were not working because of an intentional, malicious  act.", "In comment 80, the White House said that we failed to provide important  information regarding the extent of the problem with voice mail messages  and the consequences of this problem\u2014that no one had voice mail service  for the first days and weeks of the administration.  The White House said  those facts concerned the reports of obscene voice mail messages that  were heard by the telephone service director and the OA associate director  for facility management.  The White House also said that we should have  reported that when these two officials began touring offices and checking  telephones in the EEOB at approximately 1:00 a.m. on January 20, the  telephone service director listened to about 30 greetings, approximately 10  of which were inappropriate.  Further, of those 10 inappropriate messages,  the telephone service director said 5 or 6 were vulgar.  In addition, the  White House noted that the telephone service director said that White  House telephone operators notified him that there were obscene messages  on some of the voice mail greetings.  The White House said that after  encountering the high ratio of inappropriate and vulgar messages, and  because of these messages, a decision was made around 1:00 a.m. to take  the entire system down.  Further, the White House said that the telephone  service director explained that he erased some messages around 1:00 a.m.  on January 20, and they were rerecorded later that day.", "Our interview records indicated the OA associate director for facilities  management heard an inappropriate voice mail message, but he did not tell  us about hearing obscene voice mail messages.  The report had indicated  that two EOP employees who helped establish telephone service for new  staff, including the telephone service director, said they heard a total of six  to seven obscene voice mail messages that were left on telephones in  vacated offices.  In addition, we had reported that the telephone service  director said that inappropriate and vulgar voice mail messages were  initially erased on an individual basis, but it was eventually decided to  erase all of them.  Further, we reported that the OA associate director for  facilities management said that so many complaints were received about  voice mail that voice mail service was discontinued for a while to clear out  the system, and that no one had access to voice mail for at least 5 days and  possibly up to 2 weeks.  To provide additional detail about when the  inappropriate and vulgar voice mail messages were heard, in response to  the White House\u2019s comments, we added that the telephone service director  said that he heard inappropriate and vulgar voice mail messages during the  early morning hours of January 20.", "We did not report what the telephone service director said he was told by  telephone operators about hearing obscene voice mail messages because it  was information that was relayed to us from a third party.  Further,  according to our record of interview with the chief telephone operator, she  told us that operators received some calls from staff complaining about not  getting their voice mail and that their telephones were not working  correctly, but she did not mention complaints about obscene voice mail  messages.  Finally, regarding the messages that the telephone service  director said he erased during the early morning hours of January 20 and  were rerecorded later that day, he said that those messages were not  inappropriate in nature.  Because they were not inappropriate in nature and  could have been left for business reasons, we did not believe that this  additional information needed to be reported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Writing on Walls", "paragraphs": ["In comment 105, the White House said that the report\u2019s description of two  observations of pen and pencil marks on walls, but no words, did not  adequately describe what we were told.  The White House noted that these  were not observations of a stray pen mark, as it said the report suggested.   Rather, the White House said, one observation was that an entire wall in an  office was covered in lines that at a distance appeared to be cracks.   Further, the White House said this observation was confirmed by an OA  employee who said that she too had heard that someone had etched a wall  like marble.  However, the report already indicated, regarding the  observation, that the employee who observed it said that there were cracks  in the paint, but because the marks washed off, he thought it looked like  someone had used a pencil on a wall.  Further, because it was information  relayed to us from a third party, we did not report what someone had told  the OA employee about a wall etched like marble.  Regarding the other  observation, the White House noted that an employee said that a wall was  covered in pen and pencil marks, which she described as slasher marks and  beyond normal wear and tear.

No  costs were provided on that copy of the form, which indicated that the  services were completed on January 31, 2001.  The second copy said  \u201cmaking new drapes,\u201d and that the work was completed on March 2, 2001,  at a cost of $2,906.  We attributed the $2,906 cost to the making of new  drapes and not cleaning.  During our interviews with staff working in this  office, no one mentioned observing problems with the drapes in this office.", "Also in comment 99, the White House said that we could have, but did not,  determine how much time and money was spent paying the cleaning staff  and how much should have reasonably been spent on the basis of the  amounts spent during past transitions or estimates provided by  administrative staff.

He also  said more people were working the EEOB during the Clinton  administration than during previous administrations.  The director of GSA\u2019s  White House service center similarly said that he did not see any difference  in the condition of the rooms during the transition than when he saw them  2 to 3 years before.  He said that he did not think the departing Clinton  administration staff were being intentionally messy on January 20 and that  they had been like that all of the time.  He also said that he observed more  personal belongings left behind during the 2001 transition than during the  1989 transition, but that the condition of the offices during the 2001  transition was the same as that during the 1989 transition.

We also cited the  cost of removing a telephone from an office, which the White House did not  dispute.", "With respect to the completeness of cost data, we did not report a total cost  figure for replacing missing labels or correcting forwarded telephones  because we did not believe the documentation provided by the White  House was clear and descriptive enough for us to do so.  For correcting  forwarded telephones, the White House provided one telephone service  request that said a telephone line did not ring on a particular set.  However,  it did not state the cause of the problem, so we did not know whether the  cause was forwarding or something else.", "Most of the White House\u2019s points in comments 30, 79, and 81 addressed the  costs associated with replacing missing labels.  It said that (1) we should  estimate how much it would cost to replace the number of missing labels  reported to us as missing, (2) our statement that orders included other  services is incorrect and that placing button labels on telephones means  replacing missing labels beyond a doubt, (3) we never discussed the closed  orders log with OA\u2019s telephone services coordinator, and (4) the closed  orders log does more than mention labels.", "The White House estimated that $6,020 was incurred to replace missing  labels and correct forwarded telephones, and said that we had ignored the  information it had provided on this issue.  As its basis for the $6,020  estimate, the White House cited two blanket work orders and related bills  for work that included relabeling telephones on January 20 and 21, 2001.   The costs attributed by the White House to replacing labels and correcting  forwarded telephones for both of these orders was $2,490.  The White  House arrived at its $2,490 estimate for relabeling telephones and  correcting forwarded numbers, which it considered conservative given the  number of missing labels and forwarded telephones, by assuming that  technicians spent 10 percent of their time on these two days fixing these  two problems.  While we do not question that labels were missing or that  telephones were forwarded and that the government incurred costs for  replacing missing labels or correcting forwarded telephone calls, we have  no information on the extent to which technicians spent their time fixing  these problems on January 20 or 21, 2001, nor any basis to develop an  estimate for this.  Furthermore, if technicians replaced the labels reported  missing under the blanket work orders as the White House suggests, then it  is unclear why there would also be individual work orders to replace those  same missing labels.", "The White House\u2019s support for the remaining $3,530 (of the $6,020  estimate) consisted of items shown on the closed orders log for the period  January 20, 2001, through February 20, 2001; individual service requests  provided that cite placing labels on telephones; and AT&T invoices.  We  reviewed this information.  In fact, we reviewed it carefully, and our record  of interview indicated that we did discuss the closed orders log with the OA  telephone services coordinator.  We did not believe the closed orders log,  the individual service requests, or invoices that the White House provided  had enough information for us to definitively conclude that the costs  shown were solely for replacing missing labels or provided a sufficient  basis to compute an estimate of those costs.", "With one exception, neither the closed orders log nor the individual service  requests the White House provided specifically cited replacing missing  labels that had been removed, and in every case for which we have a  telephone repair document, another service was cited along with placing  labels on telephones, including the service requests for the one exception  referred to above.  For example:   For one service request cited in the White House\u2019s comment letter as  needing a label placed on a telephone by a technician, the actual service  request said:  \u201cneed line 65240 to ring on my phone 66522.  On 66522 add  65240 on button 7 and 8.  Need label placed on set by a technician.\u201d   According to the White House, the charge for this service was $75.92.", "Another service request the White House included in its $6,020 estimate  was for, it says, placing labels on sets.  The White House said the  estimated cost of this work order was $151.84 based on being billed for  2 hours of work.  The corresponding entry for this service request on the  closed orders log says, \u201cINSTALL (2) 8520 SETS IN RM-200, NEED  LABELS PLACED ON SETS.\u201d  The White House did not provide the  individual service order for this repair.", "The one service request cited above as an exception, which was dated  January 29, 2001, read: \u201cReplace labels on all phones that  removed\u201d  along with other services in a room for which the White House said the bill  was $75.92.  The corresponding entry in the closed orders log for this order  was \u201cINSTL NEW# 62926, 65961 / REPLACE LABEL.\u201d  We do not have any  additional information to explain the difference between the individual  service request and the log.", "A number of service requests that involved placement of labels also  involved programming or reprogramming of telephones.  For example, the  White House cited a work order indicating that labels were needed, among  other things, in several rooms at a cost of $341.64, which read: \u201cDisconnect  6-9008 in Room 271 OEOB.  Reprogram sets in Rooms 263, 265, 266, 267,  268, 269 and 271.  Need labels placed on each set.\u201d  The requirements  portion of the work order indicated \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cdisconnect.\u201d  Thus, it is  unclear from the information provided, whether labels were needed  because (1) they were missing, (2) there was a change in telephone service  or functions as a result of the reprogramming that could have affected the  labels, or (3) both conditions existed.  It is also unclear to us from the  information provided by the White House why telephones had to be  programmed or reprogrammed if the only problem was a missing label and  why 4 hours of work were required solely to place labels on telephones for  each of four service requests.  In cases where labels were missing, it  appears that a new label could have been needed in some cases due to  changes in telephone service or functions desired by new occupants, such  as adding a new number to a telephone.", "Regarding the White House\u2019s statement that placing button labels on a set  means replacing missing labels, in addition to the above examples, we note  our discussion with the OA telephone services coordinator during which  she said that service orders mentioning labels listed on the closed orders  log do not necessarily mean that telephones were missing labels.  We did  not discuss each entry with her on the closed orders log that cited labels  because it did not appear necessary at the time of our interviews with her,  and it was clear that we were discussing the closed orders log.  An  associate counsel to the president attended our meetings and raised no  objection or concern about this issue at the time of the meetings.", "Further, although the OA telephone services coordinator told us that she  had records from which she could estimate the total number of telephones  with missing labels and the associated costs to replace them, we did not  receive this information.  While there could have been a misunderstanding  between us and the telephone services coordinator on the meaning of the  terms on the closed orders log, we believe she clearly understood that we  were seeking information about the number of missing labels and the  associated costs, and because she said she would provide this information  to us, we saw no need to request additional documentation on this issue at  that time.", "As a related issue, the White House said in comment 81 that it explained to  us that there is no separate charge when a system analyst performs work,  such as reprogramming a telephone, that does not require a technician to  be dispatched to an office.  According to the White House, if a technician  must go to the office to replace a label, there is a minimum charge for each  hour or portion of an hour even if it is only a few minutes to perform the  work.  The White House did not document this until after we had sent our  draft report.  While we do not question that situations may have existed in  which the only service provided for which a cost was incurred was to  replace a missing label, we cannot determine to our satisfaction the extent  to which these situations occurred from the documentation provided to us.   Given the examples we cited above in which other services besides placing  labels on telephones were provided, the extent to which costs were  incurred just for replacing missing labels is unclear.  The extent to which  new labels would have been needed anyway due to changes desired by new  office occupants is also unclear.", "Further, given the OA telephone services coordinator\u2019s statement about the  little time needed to replace telephone labels, it is unclear why technicians  would have spent 4 hours just placing labels on telephones in some cases  where the service order shows the only other service besides placing labels  on sets as programming telephones.  It is also unclear why a generic or  blanket service request to replace missing labels was not prepared if this  was the only service needed.  It would appear that such an order would  have been less costly to the government than preparing individual service  orders for individual telephones or offices given that it only takes a short  time to place a label on a telephone.", "Given all of the questions we have related to the information the White  House provided on costs associated with replacing labels, we are not  making any estimates of such costs.  To do so would require additional  details on the work that was done in response to requests for telephone  service involving placing labels on telephones.  Obtaining this information  could have required discussions with the technicians who performed the  work, which could have involved additional costs to the government.   Given this and the time and effort that would be required by us and White  House staff, we did not believe further exploration by us of the costs  involved with replacing labels would have been cost beneficial to the  taxpayers.", "Finally, we modified our report to reflect the White House\u2019s comments 79  and 81 that the closed orders log does more than mention labels, as well as  to address comment 30 regarding replacing labels, as we deemed  appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missing Items", "paragraphs": ["In comment 31, the White House objected to our deducting the value of  one doorknob to reflect the statement of a GSA employee who said that a  facility request form regarding work in an office where two pairs of  doorknobs were observed missing was not done to replace a missing  doorknob, but to perform maintenance on a worn-out part.  The White  House pointed out that the GSA employee\u2019s statement is inconsistent with  the facility request form and the recollections of at least three current staff  members.  We discussed the observations regarding these doorknobs in our  response to comment 22.  Regarding the related cost issue, we recognized  the GSA employee\u2019s statement in this case because he said that he was  responsible for repairing and replacing building fixtures in the EEOB,  including doorknobs.  The report still included the cost of replacing three  of the four doorknobs that were observed missing in this office, totaling  $700.  The difference in deducting the cost of one doorknob in this case  was $100.", "In comment 47, the White House said it was untrue when we reported that  we did not obtain any information about the possible historic value of the  seal that was stolen.  The White House pointed out that we were told in  writing that the $350 purchase price would not purchase an exact replica of  the brass seal that was stolen; that the seal was purchased in the mid-1970s,  and is no longer available; and that the $350 would purchase a plastic-type  casting.  The statement that was included in the report about this historic  value was intended to convey that we did not obtain a dollar value  associated with the historic value of the seal; we clarified that statement  accordingly.

First, it  said that our estimate of 30 to 64 keyboards that were observed missing  was incorrect and should be 58 to 70, using a different counting  methodology.  It also said that the numbers only represented observations  made in specific rooms or offices and do not account for the observations  of other EOP staff who told us about additional damaged keyboards, such  as the branch chief for program management and strategic planning in the  information systems and technology division, who said that 150 keyboards  had to be replaced.  We addressed this point in our response to the White  House\u2019s general comment about the number of observations reported and  in our response to comments 10 and 51.  We also revised the table in the  report to clarify that the range of keyboards pertained to observations  made in specific rooms or offices.  The statement by the branch chief for  program management and strategic planning in the information systems  and technology division, who said that 150 keyboards had to be replaced,  was already included in the table and apparently overlooked by the White  House.", "Second, the White House noted that we included an estimate that the OA  associate director for information systems and technology provided in  February 2002, even though she said that her memory regarding that matter  was not as good as when we interviewed her in June 2001.  However, this  official\u2019s statement in June 2001 that 64 damaged keyboards had to be  replaced was also included in the table.  Because we did not know which  figure was correct, we included both statements made during the two  interviews.", "Third, the White House said that it was not accurate to represent that the  OA associate director for information systems and technology said that  one-third to one-half of the keyboards may have been replaced every 3 or 4  years because of their age.

However, as indicated in the letter portion of the report and appendix I, the  OA director told us that no record existed indicating that furniture was  deliberately damaged and that no inventory of furniture of the EEOB  exists.  Further, although in April 2002, an associate counsel to the  president provided us with photographs of four pieces of furniture that she  indicated were moved to an EOP remote storage facility, no information  was provided regarding from which offices these pieces had been taken or  when or how the damage occurred.", "In comment 69, the White House also said that we had failed to quantify  very real costs incurred, such as in having movers remove damaged  furniture and return with replacement furniture, having movers make  overturned furniture upright, and removing the glue-like substance from  desks.

The White House  said that it would have been possible for us to have generated a range of  estimates, but that we chose not to, resulting in a substantial  underreporting of the very real costs associated with the damage,  vandalism, and pranks that occurred during the transition.", "Although it is possible that we could have estimated some additional costs  potentially attributable to intentional acts, we did not believe it would have  been cost-effective for us to have done so.  For example, we did not believe  that our time and resources should have been expended on estimating any  possible incremental costs to remove \u201cW\u201d keys and prank signs that were  placed on walls, or that any such estimates would likely have been  material.  Further, we did not have a sufficient basis to conclude that all of  the damage that the White House cited, such as broken furniture and copy  machines, was caused by intentional acts.

In particular, the White House took issue  with a statement in the report that we were generally unable to determine  who was responsible for the incidents that were observed, and said we  simply failed to determine who was responsible.  For example, the White  House said we did not try to contact the former occupants of offices where  messages other than those of \u201cgoodwill\u201d were left.  Examples that the  White House cited regarding telephone labels and furniture are discussed  in comments 6 and 15 below.  The White House also cited examples  regarding the placing of glue on desks; the leaving of prank, inappropriate,  and obscene voice mail messages; and the removal of keys from keyboards,  which are discussed below.", "We agree that the likely perpetrators could be identified from the  observations and available information with regard to a few of the  observations that were made.  For example, because the telephone service  director said that a passcode was needed to record voice mail greetings, it  was fair to conclude that the previous occupants left the voice mail  greetings that were heard.   Moreover, we had concluded in the report that  the leaving of certain voice mail messages, the placing glue on desks, and  the removal of keys from keyboards were done intentionally.  However, the  White House is incorrect in asserting that we did not try to contact the  former occupants of offices where messages other than those of goodwill  were left.  As explained in our scope and methodology section, we  contacted 72 former Clinton administration staff, most of whom had  worked in offices where observations were made, including numerous staff  who worked in offices where signs and messages were observed and heard,  and not only those that were of goodwill. When we contacted them, we  described or showed lists of the observations that were made in their  former offices and asked for any comments or explanations.  However,  former Clinton administration staff we contacted did not provide  explanations regarding every observation, and we did not contact all  former Clinton administration staff because we did not know where they  were and because of the level of resources that would have been required.   In addition, regarding the reports of obscene or vulgar voice mail messages  that were left, specific information was not provided about which  telephones those messages were left on, so we could not ask any particular  former staff about them.  Moreover, it is speculative to suggest that, had we  contacted additional former Clinton administration staff, we would have  obtained undisputed facts regarding when the incidents occurred and the  likely perpetrators.", "The White House also said in comment 28 that our report suggested that  contract movers and cleaners were responsible for vandalism, damage, and  pranks, which it believed to be an insult to the contract personnel.  Our  report did not state that these contract personnel intentionally caused any  damage.  However, they were among other individuals in the complex  during the transition besides former Clinton administration staff, which  made it more difficult to narrow down people who were possibly  responsible, either intentionally or unintentionally, for the problems  reported observed.  We made a written request to the White House for a list  of the number of visitors cleared into the EEOB during the weekend of  January 20 and 21, 2001, and their respective organizational affiliations.   However, the White House declined to provide that information, indicating  that it was available from the individuals responsible for hiring and  supervising contractors who may have already provided us with estimates  regarding the number of contractors.  We were provided with information  regarding a certain number of GSA contractors who were in the complex  that weekend, but not about other contractor staff, such as those working  with computers, or any other visitors to the complex.", "In comment 28, the White House cited observations made in the vice  president\u2019s West Wing office, including an oily glue-like substance smeared  on desks; prank signs that were on walls and interspersed in reams of  paper in printer trays and copy machines, and vulgar words that were on a  white board that were all discovered between midnight on January 19 and  noon on January 20.  The White House said that it could be reasonably  concluded from these observations that the damage occurred shortly  before the inauguration and that former Clinton administration staff were  the likely perpetrators because it can be presumed that the former office  staff did not work under those conditions.  However, in certain respects,  our interview records differed from what the White House indicated in its  comments regarding these observations.  Although all three staff told us  they observed the glue-like substance and prank signs, none of them said  they saw vulgar words written on a white board.  One of the employees said  that her staff told her that they had seen vulgar words written on a white  board there, but we did not interview anyone who personally saw that, and  we did not include information people relayed to us from third parties.  We  would agree that, on the basis of the timing of these observations, they  were likely carried out shortly before the inauguration, but in the absence  of witnesses or other evidence we are not in a position to conclude who  was responsible.", "In comment 35, the White House said that our list of incidents that were  done intentionally was incomplete and provided several additional cases  that it said appeared to have been done deliberately by former Clinton  administration staff.  Our conclusion that the leaving of signs and written  messages was intentional was meant to encompass certain observations  that the White House cited in comment 38, including a Gore bumper sticker  stuck to the inside of a copy machine, writing on and in desks, and a sticker  in a filing cabinet.  Further, our conclusions were not meant to be  comprehensive in the same level of detail that the White House indicated,  but did include damage to \u201cW\u201d keys, in addition to \u201cW\u201d keys removed from  keyboards; \u201cW\u201d keys glued to walls and placed in drawers; the removal of  an office sign that was witnessed by an EOP employee; and desk drawers  turned over.  Finally, we could not conclude, as the White House did, that  certain incidents, such as a lamp placed on a chair and pictures and other  objects placed in front of doors, were done deliberately by former Clinton  administration staff.   It seemed equally as likely that they could have been  done as part of the moving out process.  Further, the White House\u2019s  statement that most, if not all, printers and fax machines were emptied of  paper in vacated offices was not contained in our interview records, and it  was not clear whether that would have been done intentionally.   Other  incidents that the White House listed relating to telephone and furniture are  discussed below.", "In comments 38 and 68, the White House said that we should report the  views of many staff who said that, on the basis of their first-hand  observations, damage appeared to have been done intentionally.  In our  report, we included examples of statements made by some individuals who  told us they believed the incidents they observed were done intentionally  and some individuals who told us they did not believe what they observed  was done intentionally.  However, we did not include all statements made  by all individuals about views on whether incidents were done  intentionally.

Further, our conclusion is consistent with the OA  director\u2019s April 18, 2001, statement that \u201c\u2026repair records do not contain  information that would allow someone to determine the cause of damage  that is being repaired.\u201d  As noted in the report, some former Clinton  administration staff said that telephones were missing labels during the  Clinton administration, primarily because those telephones were only used  for outgoing calls.  Although the OA telephone services coordinator said  she believed that telephone labels were removed intentionally, she said the  documentation regarding telephone service requests that mentioned labels  did not necessarily mean that the telephones had been missing labels and  that new labels might have been needed for variety of reasons.  In comment  28 and 36, the White House noted that, according to the telephone service  director, some of the missing telephone labels that were replaced before  noon on January 20 were found missing again later that day, which  indicated that the removal of at least some of the labels was an intentional  act, occurred before January 20, and that outgoing staff were almost  certainly responsible.  We would agree that, on the basis of the telephone  service director\u2019s observation on January 20, some telephone labels were  intentionally removed.  Although these circumstances may suggest that  some telephone labels were removed by departing Clinton administration  staff, in the absence of any witnesses we were not in a position to conclude  who was responsible.  No documentation was provided relating specifically  to these observations.", "The White House also said in comment 6 that staff noted that telephones  were left on the floor and that the documentation showed a request for a  technician to retrieve a telephone found on the floor of an office.  Although  this telephone service request corroborated a request to retrieve a  telephone in an office where an EOP official observed telephones piled on  a floor, we did not conclude that this corroborated an act of vandalism  because the request did not indicate why the telephone was left on the  floor.", "In comment 36, the White House said that we should report the views of  many staff who said that, on the basis of their first-hand observations,  damage appeared to have been done intentionally, including the OA  telephone services coordinator, who said that missing telephone labels  must have been intentional.

According to the White House, this statement would be relevant only if the  cut and pulled wires were observed after the cleaning and computer staff  had entered the offices.  The White House noted that the two employees  who reported the cords pulled from the walls observed the damage in the  early morning hours of January 20 before any cleaning staff had entered the  rooms and before the computer staff entered the rooms to archive  computer data.  However, although the cleaning crew for the transition  began on January 20 and the archiving of data from computers was taking  place in the morning of January 20, other cleaning and computer work  undoubtedly was done in offices at some point before January 20.  Further,  even though the staff made these observations on January 20, we did not  know when and how the wires became separated from the walls. In  addition, the employee who observed at least 25 cords pulled out of walls,  who the White House did not mention in this comment, said that she made  her observation on January 22. In addition, the January 24, 2001, GSA  facility request that this employee requested did not state that cords were  separated from the walls; the request was to \u201corganize all loose wires and  make them not so visible.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Furniture", "paragraphs": ["In comments 15 and 36, the White House objected to a statement attributed  to former Clinton administration staff who said that some furniture was  broken before the transition and could have been the result of wear and  tear, and little money was spent on repairs and upkeep during the  administration.

It also  noted in comment 36 that it would be odd behavior for office occupants to  have broken chairs through normal wear and tear and leave them  unrepaired for some time.  Further, the White House provided examples of  additional details regarding observations made by EOP staff regarding  furniture problems, which it said suggested that the damage was  intentionally done by former Clinton administration staff or was done  shortly before the inauguration.", "As previously explained, we did not obtain comments from former Clinton  administration regarding every observation, including all furniture-related  problems.  Therefore, we agree that the above statement made by former  Clinton administration staff does not necessarily apply to all observations  of furniture-related problems.  With respect to the White House\u2019s assertion  that it is difficult to believe that office occupants would not remove certain  broken furniture, as indicated in the report, the former director of one  office where EOP staff told us they observed pieces of broken furniture  said that the office furniture had been in poor shape for some time, but the  staff tolerated it.  The former director added that they did not want to send  the furniture away to be repaired because it was uncertain how long it  would take or whether the furniture would be returned.  We also note that,  in August 2001, we observed a desk in the EEOB with detached drawer  fronts that had not been repaired, and the staff in that office said the desk  had been in that condition since they arrived in January 2001.  Further,  although the White House said in comment 15 that the details regarding  certain observations suggested that furniture was intentionally damaged by  former Clinton administration staff or occurred shortly before the  inauguration, we could not make any definitive conclusions about how the  damage occurred and who may have been responsible for it on the basis of  those details or the statements of some EOP staff who said that it appeared  that certain damage had been caused intentionally.", "In comments 28 and 36, the White House cited several cases in which it said  the undisputed facts indicated when furniture was damaged and the likely  perpetrators.  Also, in comment 67, the White House said that the  overwhelming circumstantial evidence indicates when the damage  occurred, whether it was intentional, and who the likely perpetrators were.   In comments 15, 28, 36, 60, and 67, the White House described a case  involving a key that was observed broken off in a file cabinet, still hanging  in the lock by a metal thread, and when the locksmith opened it, a Gore  bumper sticker with an anti-Bush statement was prominently displayed  inside.  According to the White House, the circumstances in this case  suggested that the damage occurred not long before the inauguration, was  intentional, and was done by a former Clinton administration employee.", "Our interview records regarding this incident differed in certain respects  from what the White House indicated in its comments.  Although the staff  said they saw a broken key in the cabinet and one employee said that he  found two Gore stickers inside, none of them said they observed an anti- Bush statement prominently displayed inside.  One of the employees said  that another person told him he saw a Gore sticker with a message that was  derogatory about the president written on it.  We did not report what the  other person had told him because it was information relayed to us from a  third party.  Further, when we interviewed the person who reportedly  observed the anti-Bush statement written on a sticker, he told us about  seeing two Gore-Lieberman stickers inside the cabinet, but he did not  mention any writing on them.  Although we believe that it is likely that  political stickers were left in a cabinet around the time of the election, it is  speculative to conclude that the individual who left the sticker inside the  cabinet was the same person who broke the key off in the lock, and that the  key was intentionally broken off in the lock.  Also in comments 28, 36, 60,  and 67, the White House cited a similar case about locked desk drawers  that, when pried open, contained two pieces of paper with anti-Bush  statements.  We had already concluded in the report that these written  messages were done intentionally.", "The White House also cited cases in comments 28 and 67 that it said  suggested the damage occurred shortly before the inauguration.  In one  case, the White House cited the statement of an employee who said that  she saw damaged furniture in offices where things looked pretty good  weeks or months earlier, which the White House said suggested that  damage was done shortly before the inauguration weekend.  According to  our interview record with this individual, the only observations that she  made regarding furniture were of doors on a wall cabinet hanging on only  one hinge and upholstered furniture that was filthy, which she attributed to  dirt that had built up over time.  Although the cabinet doors could have  been damaged around the time of the transition, the upholstered furniture  probably did not become dirty then.  In the other case, the White House  said the nature of damage suggests that it occurred shortly before the  inauguration because the offices\u2019 prior occupants and cleaning staff would  not have let the damage remain in the office for long.  For example, the  White House said that it would be hard to believe that occupants would not  fix or remove a bookcase with shards of broken glass inside.  While we  would agree that we would not expect shards of glass inside a bookcase to  remain for long, we did not have any information indicating when the  damage occurred, or whether it was done accidentally or intentionally.", "In comment 36, the White House said that, with respect to our statement  that we did not know whether furniture was broken intentionally, and  when and how it occurred, it was not plausible to think the cleaning staff  completely broke off the backs and legs of multiple chairs within the same  office and then left that furniture in the offices for the new occupants.  We  did not suggest that the cleaning staff broke furniture.  However, we note,  as discussed above, that some former Clinton administration staff said that  certain pieces of furniture were already broken prior to the inauguration  and had not been repaired.", "The White House also said in comments 38 and 67 that the nature of some  of the damage and the surrounding conditions suggested that it was done  intentionally and/or was done shortly before the transition weekend.  For  example, the White House cited the observation of an EOP employee who  said that her desk drawers clearly had been kicked in and this damage was  not just wear and tear.  Our interview record with this individual indicated  that she observed a desk where the locks on a drawer had been damaged  and the drawers could not be opened, but did not indicate that she said the  drawers had been kicked in.", "In another case cited in comments 36 and 67, the White House cited an  observation of two seat cushions slit in an identical manner on apparently  new upholstery, indicating that this was not done accidentally.  Although it  is possible that this observation was of vandalism, it was unknown when  and how it occurred and who may have been responsible.  No information  was available about from which offices these chairs were taken (they were  observed in a hallway on January 21), and we did not observe these chairs  ourselves to inspect the damage.", "Also in comment 36, the White House said that it was not reasonable to  conclude that furniture was not overturned unintentionally because most  of the witnesses observed overturned furniture before the cleaning staff or  new occupants entered the rooms, and it was not plausible to think that  cleaning staff would have upended extremely heavy furniture in the  manner described.  Further, the White House pointed out that two GSA  officials said that cleaning staff would not move large pieces of furniture,  and none of these things would happen in the normal course of moving out  of an office.  According to our interview records with these individuals, one  GSA official said that while cleaning staff do not normally move furniture  to clean offices, furniture could be overturned for a variety of reasons, such  as to reach electrical outlets or computer connections.  The other GSA  official said that he did not see any damage or pranks during the transition  and did not mention overturned furniture, according to our interview  record.  Although we would agree that furniture would be overturned  intentionally and that it was unlikely that cleaning staff would have  upended extremely heavy furniture in the manner described, some former  Clinton administration staff who occupied the former offices where  overturned furniture was observed said that it would have been difficult or  impossible for them to move certain pieces of furniture.  Moreover, the  cleaning staff did not enter these offices for the first time on January 20;  according to GSA, cleaning is done continuously.", "Although we would agree with the White House that it is reasonable to  conclude that furniture was overturned intentionally, we do not believe that  a sufficient basis existed to conclude, as the White House did in comment  36, that most of the people who observed overturned furniture made their  observations before the cleaning staff or new occupants entered the rooms.  According to our interview records with the seven staff who observed  overturned furniture, none of whom were new occupants of those rooms,  two said that they made these observations in the early morning hours of  January 20 before the transition cleaning crews arrived; three said that they  made those observations during the afternoon of January 20; and the other  two did not tell us the time they observed the overturned furniture.  Although the descriptions provided by the observers suggested that the  offices where overturned furniture was observed had not yet been cleaned,  we do not know when particular offices were cleaned on January 20; the  time that new occupants entered these offices, or who else may have been  in these offices on January 19 and 20. The cleaning crew leader for the  EEOB floor where overturned furniture was observed said that the  cleaning began at 6:45 a.m. on January 20.", "In comment 60, the White House said that it did not recall anyone  complaining about missing keys, which would not be considered damage,  vandalism, or pranks.  Rather, the White House said, the observations  pertained to keys that may have been purposefully broken off in the locks  or drawers locked intentionally and keys taken or discarded.  However, an  employee told us that, when he started working in the EEOB on January 20,  his desk drawers were locked with no keys available to unlock them and  that the movers helped him open the drawers.  Other EOP staff told us  about broken off or damaged keys in cabinets.", "In comment 68, the White House took issue with how we had characterized  two employees\u2019 statements about whether they believed the damaged  furniture they observed was intentionally damaged.  In the first instance,  the White House said that an employee said that while it was possible that  legs on a chair were broken through wear and tear, she thought it was  unlikely that a broken chair would be kept in an office in that condition.   Our interview record regarding this employee indicated she said that the  chair legs could have been broken because of wear and tear and were not  necessarily done intentionally in January 2001.  In addition, the White  House said that we had not included additional statements made by EOP  staff who said that the damage, previously discussed in this section,  appeared intentional.  The White House said an employee told us that her  desk drawers were clearly damaged intentionally, and not just by wear and  tear, and another employee said that the a broken key in the file cabinet  looked deliberate.  In the first example, according to our interview record,  this employee did not say how the desk drawers were damaged. In the  second example, the employee said the key looked like it had been broken  intentionally, but he did not know if it was.", "We also note that other people, whom the White House did not cite, said  they did not believe that broken furniture was intentionally damaged.  For  example, the management office director told us that during the first 2  weeks of the Bush administration, she saw a building (the EEOB) filled  with furniture that had exceeded its useful life and that a lot of furniture  had to be taken out of offices.  She said the problems with furniture that  she saw, such as broken pieces, were the result of wear and tear and  neglect, and not the result of something that she thought was intentional."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Keyboards", "paragraphs": ["In comment 28, the White House said that it is unlikely that Clinton  administration staff worked for long without having \u201cW\u201d keys on their  keyboards, which suggested that the vandalism occurred shortly before the  inauguration.

According to the White House,  when we reported that an employee said she saw a volunteer remove an  office sign outside an office, that the person who removed the sign said that  he planned to take a photograph with it, and that the volunteer tried to put  the sign back on the wall, it implied that the person intended all along to  put the sign back.  The White House believes that only when the volunteer  was confronted by the EOP employee, did he claim that he planned to take  a photograph with it, that he tried to put the sign back, and ultimately did  not take it.  Further, the White House said that the employee did not believe  that the volunteer intended all along to return the sign as our statement  suggested.", "However, our record of interview did not indicate that this employee told  us what she believed the volunteer intended to do with the sign.  We also  did not know whether this individual planned to take the office sign.  We  were not provided with the volunteer\u2019s name and thus were unable to  contact him.  Further, we did not speculate, as the White House did, about  whether it was only after having been confronted by an employee that he  claimed that he wanted to take a photograph with the sign and tried to put  it back on the wall.", "In comment 48, the White House also said that we failed to mention that an  EOP employee said that a former Clinton administration employee told her  that he saw that the office sign was missing at some point during the night  of January 19.  We did not report this statement because it was information  relayed to us from a third party.  Further, when we interviewed this former  Clinton administration employee, he did not say that he observed a sign  missing from outside this office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Copy Machine", "paragraphs": ["In comments 68 and 87, the White House said that we had failed to report a  statement made by an employee who said that the repairman who fixed the  copy machine found a pornographic or inappropriate message when he  pulled out the copier\u2019s paper drawer, and that the repairman thought the  paper drawers had been intentionally realigned so that the paper supply  would jam.

Similarly, the White House said that writing observed on an office  wall that said something like \u201cRepublicans, don\u2019t get comfortable, we\u2019ll be  back,\u201d while not profane in nature, also would indicate that it was written  shortly before the transition and by a former Clinton administration  employee.

This statement was also  part of a summary paragraph, and additional comments regarding trash  that was observed and comments made by other staff with different views  were provided in appendix I.", "In comment 5, the White House said that, when we reported that some  former Clinton administration staff said that some of the observations were  false, it was disappointed that they would make such a reckless statement.", "According to the White House, the statement is neither based on nor  supported by a single shred of evidence.  Further, the White House said that  such self-serving accusations like this illustrate why it was important for us  to provide the reader with many of the details that we had omitted.  For  example, the White House said, if the reader is told that a particular  observation was made by a staff member who worked in the complex for  many years, including the Clinton administration, or that the damage was  found in a location where others observed a lot of other damage, then the  reader can determine for himself the credibility of the observation.", "The statement referenced above was included in part of a summary  paragraph, and many additional details regarding the observations are  provided throughout the report.  Further, we did not make judgments about  the credibility of the observations when current and former EOP staff had  different explanations and recollections.  Regarding the White House\u2019s  request that we indicate when observations were made by EOP staff who  had worked in the White House complex for many years because it would  help the reader determine the credibility of the observation, we did not do  this because we generally did not have a basis to conclude that EOP staff  we interviewed who had worked in the White House complex for many  years were more credible than staff who arrived with the Bush  administration.  On the one hand, one would not necessarily expect Bush  administration staff to have positive views of the Clinton administration.   On the other hand, EOP staff could have strong views on various  administrations.  Many of them work at the pleasure of the president, and  the associate counsel to the president participated in all of the interviews  with EOP staff.  We did not speculate about what influence these factors  may have had on the people we interviewed.  For example, one individual  we interviewed who had worked for the EOP under several administrations  expressed considerable disagreement during our interview with the Clinton  administration\u2019s handling of a matter related to his area of responsibility.   Although we do not know the extent to which, if any, the individual\u2019s views  regarding the Clinton administration influenced his conveyance of  observations to us, we reported his observations in the same manner as  those of incoming Bush administration staff we interviewed.", "In comment 49, the White House questioned a comment made by the  former director of an office where two pairs of doorknobs were observed  missing, that the office had several doors to the hallway that at some time  had been made inoperable, and he was not sure whether the interior sides  of those doors had doorknobs.  According to the White House, even if it  were true that the doorknob in the interior side of the door was missing,  that fact would not explain the observation that the door was missing both  an interior and exterior doorknob.  We only reported what the former  director told us and were not suggesting that his comment fully explained  the observation.", "In comment 70, the White House noted that, regarding the statement by the  former manager of an office where at least six pieces of furniture were  observed, he provided comments on only two broken chairs (that the arms  had become detached a year or two before the transition, that carpenters  tried to glue them back, but the glue did not hold).  According to the White  House, the additional reports of damaged furniture as well as other damage  found in the office suite undermine the former manager\u2019s innocent  explanation for the two chairs.  In addition, the White House said that  because we were unwilling to specify the locations where damage was  found and have not reported more details, readers are unable to assess for  themselves the credibility of the former manager\u2019s explanation.", "The former manager\u2019s explanation regarding these two chairs appeared to  be plausible because, as we reported, we found two GSA facility requests  made by him in 1999 requesting that chairs in that office be repaired.  We  only reported the comments and explanations that former Clinton  administration staff provided on observations made in their respective  offices, and did not note, for example, that this former office manager did  not comment on the other pieces of broken furniture.  Similarly, throughout  the report, when we cited an observation made by an EOP employee, we  did not point out what that person did not see, even in cases where other  people made additional observations in that same location.  Further, our  record of this interview indicates that the employee who observed the  other pieces of broken furniture told us she saw four chairs that had been  placed in the hall and that she believed the damage could have occurred  due to normal wear and tear and that the chairs were not necessarily  broken in January 2001.", "In comment 71, the White House questioned the comments of three former  staff who had worked in an office where staff told us they found glue or a  sticky substance on desks that they were not aware of glue being left on  desks.  One of those former employees also said that her desk was missing  handles when she started working at that desk in 1998, and it was still  missing them at them at the end of the administration.  The White House  said that these statements are inconsistent with the statement of an  employee who said that a handle was found inside the desk with more of  the oily-glue-like substance on top of it.  The White House also said that the  reader is unable to evaluate the credibility of the comments made by the  former staff because the report does not say where these desks were  located and that various other damage and pranks were found in the same  location.", "We do not believe the additional details that the White House cited about  these observations, which we did not report, would have allowed readers  to more fully evaluate the credibility of the statements made by the former  Clinton administration staff.  For one reason, incidents could have taken  place in this location after the former Clinton administration staff we  interviewed had left, which they said was between midnight on January 19  and 4:30 a.m. on January 20.  Our record of the interview with the employee  whom the White House indicated observed a desk handle inside a desk  with more of the glue-like substance on top of it did not contain the level of  detail that the White House provided in its comments.  Our interview  record indicated that she observed a desk drawer that had a handle  removed and glue that was placed on the bottom of a drawer.  Further, as  indicated in our discussion regarding comment 28, although all three staff  told us they observed the glue-like substance and prank signs in this area,  none of them said they saw vulgar words written on a white board.  One of  the employees said that her staff told her that they had seen vulgar words  written on a white board there, but we did not interview anyone who  personally saw that, and we did not report information relayed to us from a  third party.", "In comment 73, the White House said that if we included detailed  comments made by former Clinton administration staff about overturned  furniture, we should explain that two of the individuals who observed the  overturned furniture have worked in the White House complex for 30 and  32 years, respectively, and that they both observed overturned furniture  between approximately 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. on January 20.  Likewise,  the White House noted, the director of GSA\u2019s White House service center,  who served during the Clinton administration, reported seeing overturned  furniture.  In addition, the White House said that we should report that two  other staff said they observed overturned furniture at approximately 12:15  p.m. on January 20.", "To address the White House\u2019s comment 73 and 36, we added a range of time  during which these officials said they observed overturned furniture.   However, we did not add, as the White House suggested, that two of the  people who observed overturned furniture had worked in the White House  for more than 30 years because, except in appendix II, when we discussed  observations regarding past transitions, we did not report how long other  people who made observations had worked in the White House complex.", "In comment 77, the White House said that we did not report the number of  offices in which telephones were observed unplugged or piled up.  In  addition, the White House said we did not report that the telephone service  director was one of the staff who observed telephones that were unplugged  or piled up.  According to the White House, his observation is particularly  noteworthy because he had more than 30 years of experience managing  telephone services in the White House complex.  Further, the White House  said that because the telephone service director observed the unplugged  telephones on January 19 and during the early morning of January 20, it is  clear that the telephones were not unplugged by the telephone service  personnel or by the cleaning staff, who had not yet entered these rooms.   Moreover, the White House said that this information is particularly  important because of comments provided by former Clinton administration  staff who worked in offices where telephones were observed unplugged or  piled up.  (One of those former staff said that no one in that office  unplugged them, and another employee said that there were extra  telephones in that office that did not work and had never been discarded.)   The White House said that because we had not mentioned that there were  observations of unplugged and piled telephones in 25 or more offices, the  reader does not know that the comments of the former Clinton  administration staff, even if true, explain what happened in only 2 of 25 or  more offices.  Thus, according to the White House, the reader has no basis  for placing the comments of the former staff in context, nor for  understanding that the former staff apparently have no explanation for the  remaining observations.", "We addressed the issue regarding the number of offices in which  telephones were observed unplugged or piled up in our response to  comment 25 in the section of this appendix pertaining to reporting the  number of observations.  Regarding the White House\u2019s comment about the  noteworthiness of the telephone service director\u2019s observations, we added  to the report that he was one of the staff who made these observations.   However, we do not agree that because he made these observations on  January 19 and the early morning of January 20, it is clear that the  telephones were not unplugged by telephone services personnel or by  cleaning staff who had not yet entered these rooms.  Although the cleaning  crew for the transition started on January 20, according to GSA, cleaning in  these offices is continuous.  Further, we did not have information regarding  when telephone service or other personnel had been in these offices before  the transition.  Regarding the White House\u2019s assertion that we had deprived  readers of information that would place the comments of former Clinton  administration staff in context, or help readers understand that the former  staff apparently had no explanation for the remaining observations, as  previously noted, we did not obtain comments from former Clinton  administration staff regarding every observation.  Moreover, the fact that  certain former Clinton administration staff had no explanations for certain  observations does not necessarily mean that they were responsible.", "In comment 83, the White House said that we should have reported  additional statements made by EOP staff that would counter a statement  made by the former senior advisor for presidential transition who said that  it would have been technically possible to erase voice mail greetings for  most departing staff without also deleting greetings for staff who did not  leave at the end of the administration.  The White House said that, to  present a fair and balanced report, we should have explained that two OA  staff, who served during the Clinton administration, disagree with the  former senior advisor\u2019s statement.  According to the White House, they  included the OA associate director for facilities management, who worked  closely with the former senior advisor and told us that a proposal to delete  all voice mail greetings at the end of the Clinton administration was  discussed, but they decided not to do it because it would have erased the  greetings of all staff, including the 1,700 staff who were not vacating the  building.  In addition, the White House noted that the OA associate director  for facilities management said that it was his decision not to proceed with  the proposal, although the former Office of Management and  Administration staff, including the former senior advisor, were aware of the  decision.  Further, the White House said, the OA telephone services  coordinator told us that, until November 2001, the EOP\u2019s telephone system  did not have the capability to erase voice mails all at once.  According to  the White House, she explained that it was not until November 2001 that  the EOP had purchased the software and had performed upgrades to the  switch that were necessary to allow voice mails to be deleted on other than  a manual basis.", "We believe that we provided a sufficient amount of information to reflect  the views on this issue that differed with the former senior advisor\u2019s  statement.  Indeed, many of the details that the White House provided in its  comments were already reported.   In addition to reporting statements  made by the telephone service director about erasing voice mail, we  reported that the OA associate director for facilities management said that  he made the decision not to erase all voice mail messages and greetings at  the end of the administration because doing so would have deleted voice  mail for all EOP staff, including staff who did not leave at the end of the  administration, and not just for the departing staff.  We also reported that  the OA telephone services coordinator said that voice mail greetings and  messages were not removed on a systemwide basis at the end of the  Clinton administration because the EOP had not yet done an equipment  upgrade, which was done later.  Further, we footnoted the senior advisor\u2019s  statement to indicate that contrary views on this matter were provided  earlier in the report.", "In comment 84, the White House questioned a comment made by the  former senior advisor for presidential transition who said that regarding  reports of telephones that had been forwarded, some telephones were  forwarded to other numbers for business purposes at the end of the Clinton  administration.  He said that some of the remaining staff forwarded their  calls to locations where they could be reached when no one was available  to handle their calls at their former offices.  The White House said that this  explanation may sound plausible until one learns how and where the  telephones were forwarded and cited, for example, that the chief of staff\u2019s  telephone was forwarded to a closet.  Further, the White House said that,  because we have not provided details such as this, the reader does not have  the facts to judge the credibility of the statements made by former Clinton  administration staff.  As noted in our discussion regarding comments 26  and 76, our interview record with the employee who told us that the chief  of staff\u2019s telephone had been forwarded did not indicate that we were told  the telephone was forwarded to a closet.  Even if our interview did indicate  this, because we did not obtain a comment from former Clinton  administration staff on every observation, the former senior advisor\u2019s  statement did not necessarily address all instances of forwarded calls.", "In comment 93, the White House said that, although we reported that the  OA director said that the offices were in pretty good shape by the evening  of January 22, we had failed to include other people\u2019s observations on how  long it took to get the offices in shape and provided five examples.   However, two of the five additional statements related to telephone service,  not trash, and the report had included a statement by the OA associate  director for facilities management regarding how long it took to complete  the cleaning. We believed that reporting his statement was sufficient.", "In comment 98, the White House said that we should have included more  statements by EOP staff who said they believed that offices were  intentionally or deliberately trashed because we had reported that none of  the 67 former Clinton administration staff we interviewed who worked in  the White House complex at the end of the administration said that trash  was left intentionally as a prank or act of vandalism.  The White House said,  for example, that we should have reported an observation by a National  Security Council  (NSC) employee who said the NSC office was  deliberately made to look like someone was communicating a message; the  OA director, who said that it looked like there were a large number of  people who deliberately trashed the place; and the chief of staff to the  president, who said the conditions he observed were more than wear and  tear.  The White House said that if we had included these statements, it is  more likely that the conclusion that these people reached---that what they  observed was intentional\u2014is correct.  We had already reported the views  of the OA associate director for facilities management and a management  office employee who said they observed some trash that appeared to have  been left intentionally, as well as the observations of other EOP staff who  used words such as \u201cextremely filthy\u201d or \u201ctrashed out\u201d to describe the  conditions they had observed, and that office space contained a  \u201cmalodorous stench\u201d or looked liked there had been a party.  We had also  reported observations such as the contents of desk drawers or filing  cabinets having been dumped on floors, which were likely to have been  done intentionally, but we did not know by whom.   However, to address  the White House\u2019s comments, we added the statements of two other staff  cited in its comments.", "In comments 101 and 103, the White House said that we should have  reported how many cleaning staff were on duty and the number of hours  they worked.  According to the White House, without that information, the  reader has no basis for evaluating (1) comments made by a former Clinton  administration employee who worked in an administrative office who said  that she did not observe much cleaning of offices before January 20, and  that she believed GSA did not have enough supervisors and decision  makers to oversee the cleaning; and (2) a statement contained in a letter to  us from the former senior advisor for presidential transition and the former  deputy assistant to the president for management and administration who  said they did not observe any cleaning crews during the evening of January  19 or the morning of January 20.  However, we did report the number of  GSA and contract staff who cleaned the EEOB during the weekend of  January 20 and 21, 2001; when the cleaning began on January 20; the  observations of the crew leaders; and the number of hours that the cleaning  crew leaders worked on January 20.  We believe that this was a sufficient  amount of information to report about the cleaning effort.  We also  reported that, according to the OA associate director for facilities  management, maybe 20 offices were vacant before January 20, and that it  took 3 or 4 days after January 20 to complete the cleaning.  We attempted to  evaluate how many former Clinton administration staff left on January 19  and 20, 2001, which would have helped to determine when the cleaning  could have begun.  We were provided data indicating when building passes  were terminated for EOP staff at the end of the administration, but the  White House also informed us that the data were unreliable.  We asked the  White House to arrange a meeting with an appropriate official to discuss  the pass data, but this was not done.", "In comment 102, the White House questioned why we included a comment  made by the former administrative head of an office who said that he asked  25 professional staff to help clean the office before he left.  The White  House said this comment was irrelevant because no one alleged that this  particular office was left dirty, and that we had misled the reader by  including it in the report because we did not explain that it does not rebut  or relate to any observation.  In contacting former Clinton administration  staff, we not only sought any explanations they had regarding the  observations, but also asked for their observations regarding the condition  of the White House complex during the transition.  In this case, although it  did not rebut a specific observation about his former office, the former  official explained the condition of his office at the end of the  administration.  (He also said that the EEOB and the West Wing were  \u201cfilthy\u201d at the end of the administration, but that he did not believe that  trash was left as an act of vandalism.)  However, for the purposes of  clarification, we added to the report that no one told us that this office was  dirty.", "In comment 104, the White House said that a statement by a former office  manager in which an EOP employee said it appeared that a pencil  sharpener was thrown against the wall and that pencil shavings were on the  floor did not rebut this observation.  The former office manager said that a  pencil sharpener in that office did not work and may have been placed on  the floor with other items to be removed.  The White House noted that an  employee told us that two pencil sharpeners were found broken and on the  floor with shavings.  In addition, the White House noted, with respect to  one of the two pencil sharpeners, there was a distinct mark on the wall  where the pencil sharpener had struck.  We recognize that the former  manager\u2019s comments did not address both pencil sharpeners and the mark  on the wall, but they could explain why a pencil sharpener was found on  the floor.  We only reported what he told us in response to the observation.", "In comment 109, the White House noted that the content of the message  written inside a desk that was dated January 1993 was neither profane nor  disparaging of the incoming president or his administration.  The report did  not indicate that it was, and we did not describe the specific content of  similar messages that were found during the 2001 transition, so we did not  revise the report.", "In comment 117, the White House said that the descriptions provided by  former Clinton administration staff regarding the condition of the White  House office space during the 1993 transition in the report contain more  detail than the descriptions provided regarding the 2001 transition.  We do  not believe that the descriptions provided regarding the 1993 transition are  more detailed than were provided regarding the 2001 transition.  Further, in  addressing comment 98, we added the statements of two additional staff  who had provided detailed descriptions of the condition of the office space  during the 2001 transition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Past Transitions", "paragraphs": ["In comments 33 and 110, the White House said we failed to report the  statements of several staff members who said that the damage was worse  in 2001 than during previous transitions.  Comment 33 pertained to the  letter portion of the report, where we summarized the information  provided in appendix II.  To address the White House\u2019s comments, we  added in appendix II the statement of another official who said that the  condition of the White House complex was worse in 2001 than previous  transitions.   We also note that our records of many of those interviews, as  well as the quotes the White House provided in its comments, do not  necessarily indicate that they were referring to damage observed, but to  trash.", "The White House also said in comment 118 that, while pranks and damage  may have been observed in prior administrations, the reported  observations are not the same in number or kind as those observed during  the 2001 transition, and we failed to mention this in the report, which  hampers the reader from drawing his or her own conclusion.  In addition,  the White House also said that we seem to overstate the extent of damage  reported during previous transitions and did not quantify the number of  incidents observed.  However, we clearly indicated that only a limited  number of people were available to comment on previous transitions.   Further, we lacked definitive data that would allow us to compare the  extent of damage, vandalism, and pranks during the 2001 transition to past  ones, such as records of office inspections.  Moreover, although fewer in  number, many of the observations that were made regarding previous  transitions were of the same kind that were observed during the 2001  transition, such as missing office signs and doorknobs, a message written  inside a desk, prank signs and messages, piles of furniture and equipment,  and excessive trash.  In addition, observations regarding the 1993 transition  included messages carved into desks, which were not observed during the  2001 transition.  One significant difference between the 2001 and earlier  transitions is that no one reported observing keyboards with missing or  damaged keys during previous transitions.", "In comment 33, the White House said that, when we reported that piles of  equipment were observed (by only one person), we failed to explain that  the telephone service director said that he never encountered any problems  with the telephones during the 1993 transition, that perhaps some  telephones were unplugged, but \u201cthat would be it.\u201d According to our  interview record, this official also said that every transition has some  pranks and said that unplugging telephones is a \u201cstandard prank.\u201d  Further,  in comment 115, the White House attributed observations of piles of  telephones during the 1993 transition to a statement made by the telephone  service director who said that he was instructed to get rid of the  \u201cRepublican phone system,\u201d which the White House said apparently  resulted in the replacement of all telephones.  However, our scope of work  did not include reviewing the installation of a new telephone system in the  White House complex around the time of the 1993 transition to determine if  it could relate to the piles of telephones that were observed at that time.", "Also in comment 33, the White House said, with respect to a statement in  the draft report that observations regarding previous transitions included  missing building fixtures such as office signs and doorknobs, that no other  building fixtures besides office signs and doorknobs were observed.   Accordingly, we revised the report to indicate that office signs and  doorknobs were the only building fixtures reported being observed missing  during previous transitions.", "The White House also said, regarding a statement that messages were  carved into desks, that it is aware of only one observation of a message  written inside a desk, which the White House noted, for some reason, we  repeated in the sentence in the report that followed.  Further, the White  House said, there were only three observations of carvings in desks used by  staff who served only during the Clinton administration.  The observations  of three messages carved into desks were made by former Clinton  administration staff, as reported in appendix II.  The discussion regarding  previous transitions contained in the letter portion of the report combined  the observations by current EOP staff and former Clinton administration  staff.  We mentioned the writing that was seen inside of a desk because we  observed it, and it contained a date indicating when it was written.  Further,  we do not understand why the White House noted that there were only  three observations of carvings in desks by people who served \u201conly\u201d during  the Clinton administration.  Many of the observations that were reported  regarding the 2001 transition were by staff who served only during the Bush  administration.", "In comment 111, the White House said that we failed to mention that the  director of GSA\u2019s White House service center had observed only two  transitions (1989 and 2001), and that he only heard that doorknobs were  missing during the 1989 transition, but did not observe them himself.   Accordingly, we deleted his statement that doorknobs are favorite  souvenirs of departing staff.", "Also in comment 111, the White House said that the telephone service  director did not say that office signs were missing in previous transitions,  but only during one prior transition.  According to the White House, he said  that when the Carter administration left office, door signs were missing and  cords were unplugged.  According to our interview record, this official told  us that, during previous transitions, telephone cords were unplugged and  some door signs were missing.  He told us that some problems were found  when Carter administration staff left, although he could not recall any  specific examples.", "In comment 112, the White House noted that the director of GSA\u2019s White  House service center said that he observed little in the way of damage,  vandalism, or pranks during the 2001 transition, so when he said the  condition of the office space during the 2001 transition was the same as  what he observed during the 1989 transition, this means that he claims not  to have observed much in either transition.  For the purposes of  clarification, we added that he said that he observed little during the 2001  transition in terms of damage, vandalism, or pranks.", "In comment 113, the White House said that what the GSA acting  administrator said in his March 2, 2001, letter may be misleading because  he referred only to real property and not to the telephones, computers,  furniture, office signs, etc., that were the focus of the damage, vandalism,  and pranks that occurred during the 2001 transition.  Some of the  observations made by EOP staff, such as holes in walls and missing paint  on walls, did relate to real property.  To address the White House\u2019s  comment, we added a definition of real property.", "In comment 116, the White House noted that we included a statement by a  former Clinton administration employee who said that the damage that was  observed in the 1993 transition was intentional, but did not include similar  statements made by EOP staff about the 2001 transition.  As noted in our  discussion regarding comment 68, we included the statements of some  individuals who told us they believed the incidents they observed were  done intentionally and some individuals who told us they did not believe  what they observed was done intentionally.  However, we did not include  all statements made by all individuals about views on whether things were  done intentionally.  In any event, without having observed the incidents  being carried out, people\u2019s views on whether incidents were intentional or  not were speculative.", "In comment 118, the White House objected to a statement in the report  that, according to the March 1981 issue of the Washingtonian magazine,  incoming Reagan administration staff had some complaints about the  condition of the EEOB that were similar to observations made by EOP staff  in 2001.  The White House said that the allegations are \u201chardly\u201d similar to  what was found in the 2001 transition and, by analogizing the  circumstances, we trivialized what was observed in 2001.  Although the  Washingtonian certainly did not cite as many observations regarding the  1981 transition, the types of observations were indeed similar, such as  memoranda taped to walls, pieces of damaged and dirty furniture, and a  dirty refrigerator.  Further, according to the Washingtonian, a visitor to the  EEOB in 1981 described the building as being \u201ctrashed,\u201d which is the same  word used by some EOP staff to describe its condition during the 2001  transition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other", "paragraphs": ["In comment 2, the White House said that we misidentified the units that  comprise the EOP and incorrectly referred to EOP units as agencies.  We  addressed this comment in the White House\u2019s general comment regarding  use of the term \u201cEOP.\u201d", "In comment 21, the White House said that the report should have identified  the name of the office where the cellular telephones could not be located  and that the report suggested that we had interviewed all of the former  employees of the Office of the Vice President, which it said was not true.   We did not identify the names of offices in the report unless they were  relevant to the observation or comment.  We had no reason to identify the  name of this office, nor did the White House explain why we should have.   Also in comment 21, the White House said the report suggested that we had  interviewed all former employees of the office of the vice president, and  that all former staff from that office said they did not take them, which is  not true.  Accordingly, we clarified the report to indicate that the former  occupants of offices during the Clinton administration whom \u201cwe  interviewed\u201d where items were observed missing said that they did not take  them.", "In comment 34, the White House said that it had repeatedly told us that  some current EOP staff who also worked during the Clinton administration  believe that check-out procedures were often not followed at the end of the  administration, and that building passes in particular were not turned in.   However, as indicated in appendix III, we did not review whether these  check-out procedures were followed because it was not within the scope of  our review.  Further, this information was provided to us orally by an  associate counsel to the president, not directly by any EOP staff with  responsibilities in this area.  Moreover, we referred to a check-out  procedure in appendix III as a means of indicating that it did not include an  office inspection.", "In comment 39, the White House disagreed with the statement that, in the  overwhelming majority of cases, one person said that he or she observed  an incident in a particular location.  According to the White House, in many,  if not most, cases, more than one person reported the same incident in the  same location.  We concluded from a careful review of all of the  observations that, although generally more than one person observed the  same types of incidents, in the overwhelming majority of cases, only one  person said that he or she observed an incident in a particular location.", "In comment 40, the White House disagreed with a statement in the report  that, in some cases, people said that they observed damage, vandalism, and  pranks in the same areas where others said they observed none.  The White  House said that, without a specific description of the instances where one  current staff member recalled seeing something and another expressly  disavowed seeing the same thing, it was impossible to know whether the  apparent conflict in testimony could be reconciled or whether our  statement is factually accurate.  The White House also said that the vague  statement provided no indication of how many conflicts existed or what  types of incidents were involved.  Further, the White House cited two  examples that it said we had indicated the sentence referred to, and said  the observations and circumstances indicated in those examples were not  instances of a direct conflict where one person said he or she observed  damage in a location where others observed none.", "In the examples the White House said we had referred to, the White House  excluded the statements made by former Clinton administration staff and a  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) official who were  working in the EEOB in the late morning of January 20.  In those  comments, people said they did not observe damage, vandalism, and  pranks in the late morning of January 20 in the same rooms where others  said they had observed them later that afternoon.  For example, two former  occupants of an office where furniture was observed overturned in the  afternoon of January 20 said they left between 10:00 a.m. 11:55 a.m. that  day and did not observe any overturned furniture.  In another situation, the  former senior advisor for presidential transition said that when he was in a  certain office after 11:00 a.m. on January 20, he did not see a broken glass  top smashed on a floor or files dumped on a floor, which were observed  there during the afternoon of January 20.  Further, as noted in the report, a  NARA official said that, although she did not remember the specific rooms  she went to during the morning of January 20, she went to various offices in  the EEOB with the former senior advisor for presidential transition around  11:00 a.m. that day and did not see any evidence of damage, vandalism, or  pranks.  In reporting the comments of former Clinton administration staff  regarding these situations, we clarified when the EOP staff made the  observations.", "In comment 94, the White House said that we did not accurately quote what  the OA associate director for facilities management told us about cleaning.   We had reported that he said that \u201cabout 20\u201d offices were vacant before  January 20 and that it took 3 or 4 days after January 20 to complete the  cleaning.  However, the White House said that this official actually said that  there was \u201csome list of offices that could have been cleaned before the  20th,\u201d and that the list was given to the director of GSA\u2019s White House  service center, and that there were \u201cnot a lot of offices on the list\u201d\u2014\u201cmaybe  20.\u201d  Although we were not directly quoting this official when we reported  that he said \u201cabout 20\u201d offices were on the list, our interview record agreed  with the White House\u2019s comments that he said there were \u201cnot a lot\u201d of  offices on the list and that \u201cmaybe 20\u201d were on it, and we revised the report  accordingly.  The White House also indicated that this official said that it  took \u201c3 to 5 days\u201d to complete \u201cjust the cleaning.\u201d  However, our record  indicated that he said that it took 3 or 4 days after January 20 to complete  the cleaning, and we did not revise the report in that regard.", "In comment 96, the White House said that it believed we had misquoted the  OA associate director for facilities management when we indicated he said  that it would have taken an \u201castronomical\u201d amount of resources to have  cleaned all of the offices by Monday, January 22.  Rather, the White House  indicated that he said that they could not have had enough people to clean  it by January 22 because the offices were dirtier than in past transitions.   The White House also noted that the official said that, in response to a  question about whether it was legitimate to think people could start  working in the complex on Sunday, January 21, he replied that, yes, in his  opinion, people should leave their offices in an orderly fashion.  We  checked our record of interview with this official and believe that we  accurately reported his comments, and we also believe that they are  substantially the same as what the White House indicated in this comment.   For example, we had reported that this official said that there was more to  clean during the 2001 transition than during previous ones and provided the  reasons why; he said that, in his opinion, departing staff should have left  their offices in a condition so that only vacuuming and dusting would have  been needed.  Thus, we did not believe that any revisions were needed to  the report regarding this comment.", "In comment 107, the White House said that it was not accurate for us to  indicate that the statement that trucks were needed to recover new and  usable supplies generally was not corroborated.  According to the White  House, the associate director for the general services division told us that  because the excess supplies had been dumped in the basement hall and  were piling up down there, leaving much of it unusable, he instructed his  staff to take the supplies to the off-site warehouse where the staff could re- sort the supplies and salvage what was reusable.  The White House also  noted that eight truckloads were needed to recover these new and usable  supplies from the basement, and had these trucks not been dispatched, all  of the supplies, instead of just a portion, would have been rendered  unusable; therefore, the statement was corroborated.  However, when we  interviewed this official, he said that the statement contained in the June  2001 list that six to eight 14-foot trucks were needed to recover new and  usable supplies that had been thrown away \u201cbothered\u201d him.  He said that  nothing usable was thrown away intentionally.  Further, although trucks  were reportedly used to transport supplies from the EEOB to the  warehouse so that they could be sorted and to salvage what could be used,  as indicated in the report, the former senior advisor for presidential  transition said that the supplies were brought to the basement of the EEOB  so that staff could obtain them from there, rather than obtaining them from  the supply center.  Therefore, we could not corroborate the portion of the  statement in the June 2001 list that supplies had been \u201cthrown away.\u201d", "In comment 120, the White House said that we failed to report two of the  factors that OA officials, who have been through many transitions,  identified as contributing to the problems found in the 2001 transition.   First, the telephone service director said that he felt hampered in doing his  job because he was not allowed to have any contact with the incoming  administration.  According to the White House, he indicated that, in the  past, he was allowed to confer with incoming staff regarding their  telephone needs and expectations; but this was not permitted during the  2001 transition.  Likewise, the White House said, the OA director said that  this transition was unusual because, for other transitions, there was a  transition team from the new administration on-site in the complex but,  during the 2001 transition, the incoming administration did not get access  to the space until 3 days before the inauguration and did not get \u201clegacy  books,\u201d (books that explain how things work within the complex and  within particular offices) until after the inauguration.", "We did not evaluate the transition coordination issues that the White House  raised in this comment because they were outside the scope of our review.   However, former Clinton administration staff did provide some related  information.  The former senior advisor for presidential transition said that  some Bush administration staff were given walk-through of offices in the  weeks before January 20, that officials from the president-elect\u2019s staff  attended several meetings before January 20, and that each office was  instructed to prepare briefing books for the incoming Bush staff.  Further,  the deputy assistant to the president for management and administration  said the president-elect\u2019s staff were involved in planning the transition and  had an unprecedented level of access.  Because we did not evaluate these  issues, we are not in a position to comment on them.", "Also in comment 120, the White House said that a number of longtime  employees, such as the OA associate director for facilities management,  told us that problems could have been averted or remedied if former  Clinton administration staff had vacated their offices earlier.  The White  House noted that this official said he observed a woman watching  television in her office on January 20 and turning it off and leaving precisely  at noon.  Further, the White House said that 325 passes of White House  Office employees were terminated on January 19 and 20, 2001.  As  indicated in our discussion regarding comments 101 and 103, we attempted  to evaluate how many former Clinton administration staff left on January  19 and 20, 2001, which would have helped to determine when the cleaning  could have begun.  As previously noted, we were provided data indicating  when building passes were terminated for EOP staff at the end of the  administration, but the White House also informed us that the data were  unreliable.  We had asked the White House to arrange a meeting with an  appropriate official to discuss the pass data, but this was not done."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes Made to the Report", "paragraphs": ["We revised the report, as appropriate, to address the White House\u2019s  comments 1, 3, 7, 37, 50, 52, 53, 63, 85, 86, 88, 89, 95, 114, and 119."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to  support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve  the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American  people.
