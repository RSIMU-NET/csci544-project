The U.S. Mission to the UN also expressed concern that OIOS's independence is limited in that it cannot make final hiring decisions for senior staff. In response to such concerns, the UN General Assembly in 2006 created an Independent Audit Advisory Committee (IAAC). GAO was asked to examine actions taken to address (1) impediments to OIOS's ability to provide independent oversight and (2) staffing issues that may have hindered its performance. GAO assessed OIOS's independence based on internationally recognized auditing standards, analyzed OIOS and other UN documents and data, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The UN has taken worthwhile steps to enhance OIOS's independence, but certain UN funding and oversight arrangements continue to impede OIOS's ability to provide independent oversight. The General Assembly has supported OIOS's independence by creating the IAAC, which reviews OIOS's budgets and work plans for audits of the Secretariat and peacekeeping missions, and by recommending that OIOS base its planning and budget requests on risk in accordance with standards of the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). The General Assembly also clarified the role OIOS plays in internal oversight of funds and programs by adopting a resolution that reaffirmed the prerogatives of separately administered funds and programs to decide their own oversight mechanisms and relationship with OIOS. However, an independent review found that the arrangements for funding OIOS audits of those entities that choose to utilize its audit services do not meet IIA standards for independence. OIOS also remains constrained in its ability to issue consolidated audit reports for joint UN activities that include entities over which it does not have oversight authority, even when directed to do so by the General Assembly. High vacancy rates for authorized positions have hindered OIOS's ability to provide sufficient oversight, but the UN and OIOS are taking steps to address this issue. As of July 2011, 19 percent of OIOS staff positions were unfilled, and 30 percent were vacant for investigations of peacekeeping activities--the most challenging positions to fill. The UN's external auditor found that OIOS's staffing shortages hampered its Internal Audit Division's completion of its work plans. The UN and OIOS have made filling vacant positions a priority, and OIOS has hired 82 staff members since the start of the term of the new Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services in September 2010. The IAAC also expressed concern that vacancies at the senior management level would make it difficult for OIOS to accomplish its work. In August 2011, OIOS filled two director-level positions that had been vacant for more than a year. Further, the Under-Secretary-General has begun an initiative to strengthen OIOS's management and coordination and has requested an additional staff position for her front office. The Secretary-General has concurred with this request."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of State and the U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN work with the General Assembly and member states to address remaining impediments to OIOS's ability to provide independent oversight resulting from its relationships with certain UN funds and programs and other clients.

To carry out its role as the UN\u2019s internal oversight unit, OIOS has over  300 staff positions worldwide and provides oversight services to multiple  entities within the UN system that reported a total budget of about $15  billion in 2009. In 2005, we raised concerns that OIOS\u2019s internal audits of  the Oil for Food Program were constrained in scope and authority,  preventing auditors from scrutinizing and reporting problems with the  program. In 2006, we found that funding arrangements impeded OIOS\u2019s  ability to operate independently, as mandated by the General Assembly  and called for by international auditing standards, severely limiting OIOS\u2019s  ability to reallocate resources among revenue streams, locations, and  operating divisions. Additionally, we found that OIOS depended on the  provision of auditing resources by specific UN funds and programs and,  therefore, it could provide oversight only when requested by the  management of these funds and programs, hindering its ability to identify  waste, fraud, and abuse. The U.S. Mission to the UN has also expressed  concern that OIOS\u2019s operational independence is limited in that it cannot  make final hiring decisions for high-level staff positions. In response to  these and similar issues raised by the UN\u2019s Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions, the General Assembly in  February 2006 established the Independent Audit Advisory Committee  (IAAC) to assist it in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. One of the  IAAC\u2019s key roles is to advise the General Assembly on the effectiveness  of OIOS by reviewing OIOS\u2019s proposed budgets and work plans.", "The United States, as the largest contributor to the UN\u2014with assessed  and voluntary contributions totaling about $4 billion in fiscal year 2010 for  UN activities over which OIOS has audit authority\u2014has long advocated  for strong oversight of the UN and supported the establishment of both  OIOS and the IAAC.

We met with State Department officials in  Washington, D.C., and officials in New York from the U.S. Mission to the  UN. In New York, we also met with OIOS management and staff,  representatives of Secretariat departments and UN funds and programs,  and members of the UN\u2019s external oversight body, the Board of Auditors.  We also spoke with senior OIOS audit and investigations officials based in  Geneva and Vienna via videoconference; with the IAAC Chairman in  Washington, D.C., in person and via video and teleconference; and with a  Joint Inspection Unit official in Geneva via teleconference. In addition, we  evaluated the reliability of UN and OIOS budget data taken from UN source  documents and concluded that they were sufficiently reliable to present  trends of the regular, peacekeeping, and extrabudgetary appropriations for  the biennia 1994-1995 through 2010-2011.  We used staffing data provided  by OIOS, which we determined were reliable for our purposes of presenting  staffing levels as of July 31, 2011. We conducted our work between  October 2010 and September 2011 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

The United States contributes a fixed  percentage to the regular budget, which was 25 percent prior to 2000 and  22 percent thereafter, and which funds the UN Secretariat and its various  activities and functions, including OIOS (shown in figs. 2 and 3,  respectively). For example, the United States contributed about $1.2 billion  to the UN Secretariat regular budget in the current biennium (2010-2011).  The United States also contributes annually to peacekeeping operations  and to extrabudgetary items. For example, in 2010, the United States  contributed about $2.6 billion to peacekeeping operations (about 27.3  percent of the total peacekeeping budget) and about $4.4 billion to other  UN activities, including those funded through extrabudgetary sources.", "As shown in figure 4, OIOS funding from all three sources\u2014regular  budget, peacekeeping, and extrabudgetary\u2014has generally increased  over time.

The amounts these organizations pay for internal  oversight are based on negotiated fees for services, sometimes defined in  a memorandum of understanding (MOU). Some UN funds and programs,  including, for example, the United Nations Development Program and the  World Food Program, have their own internal oversight offices, which they  use to oversee their activities instead of using the services of OIOS.  Others, such as the International Trade Center and the Office of the  United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, have partial or no  internal audit capacity. Funds or programs with their own internal  oversight capacity may also use certain OIOS services, for example, if  they determine that they need outside experts to conduct a sensitive  investigation. (App. V provides a more detailed listing of UN  organizations, their relationship with OIOS, and their oversight capacity.)  According to OIOS, as of September 2011, it provided oversight to a  number of separately administered entities, including seven funds and  programs that have partial or no internal oversight capacity. The Under- Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services told us that she is  conducting a review of all separately administered entities under the  authority of the Secretary-General to determine their internal oversight  capacities, which conforms with her mandate to support the Secretary- General in his oversight responsibilities.", "The UN General Assembly has supported OIOS\u2019s independence in audits  of organizations within the Secretariat and peacekeeping missions by  creating the Independent Audit Advisory Committee (IAAC), which  reviews OIOS\u2019s audit plans and budget requests, and compares them to  the Secretary-General\u2019s proposed budgets for oversight to ensure that  they reflect the resources OIOS needs to audit identified risks. In a July  2006 report to the General Assembly, OIOS noted that a main obstacle to  the independence of its audits was that it was responsible for auditing  departments in the Secretariat, such as the Department of Management,  which reviews its budget. While OIOS did not report any specific  examples of budget restrictions that had been imposed, the IAAC  mitigates the potential impairment to OIOS\u2019s independence caused by its  dependence on funding from entities it audits by making  recommendations that would ensure that OIOS has sufficient resources,  and keeping the General Assembly apprised of issues related to OIOS\u2019s  operational independence. The IAAC became operational in 2008 and  serves some of the functions of an independent audit committee, which  the IIA considers critical to ensuring strong and effective processes  related to independence, internal control, risk management, compliance,  ethics, and financial disclosure.", "The IAAC advises the General Assembly in accordance with terms of  reference adopted by the General Assembly in 2007. The IAAC reviews a  proposed budget for internal oversight prepared by the Secretary-General  and compares that to the resources requested by OIOS. The IAAC then  provides independent comments directly to the budget committee of the  General Assembly on the resources OIOS will need (see app. III for a  timeline showing the preparation, approval, and execution of OIOS\u2019s  regular budget). An IAAC official reported that, while part of its function is  to ensure OIOS\u2019s independence, the committee does not automatically  take OIOS\u2019s side in disputes over resources with the Secretary-General.", "In some instances, the IAAC has advised the General Assembly that  OIOS needed more resources and independence; in others, it has  advised that OIOS resources were sufficient or excessive.", "Managing the internal audit activity:  The chief     audit executive must effectively manage the     internal audit activity to ensure it adds value to     the organization.", "Risk management:  The internal audit activity     must evaluate the effectiveness and contribute     to the improvement of risk management     processes.", "Definition of risk management:  A process to     identify, assess, manage, and control potential     events or situations to provide reasonable     assurance regarding the achievement of the     organization\u2019s objectives.", "The UN also strengthened OIOS\u2019s independence by supporting its efforts  to improve its risk-based planning and budgeting process in accordance  with IIA standards, but OIOS is still working to improve its risk  assessments in response to IAAC concerns. As part of the outcome of a  2005 World Summit gathering at the UN, the General Assembly  requested that the Secretary-General submit an independent external  evaluation of the auditing and oversight system of the UN, with  recommendations for improving these processes. The external review  commissioned by the Secretary-General recommended that OIOS  improve its annual risk-assessment methodology, and specified several  improvements, including building an inventory of risks in consultation with  its clients, and ranking the risk of each item in OIOS\u2019s audit universe. As  the Secretary-General reported, in addition to ensuring that oversight  resources are prioritized for high-risk areas, a risk-based approach also  provides the General Assembly with a basis for determining the level of  risk it is willing to accept for the organization. In its 2006 report to the  General Assembly, OIOS committed to having fully risk-based work plans  by 2008. OIOS was able to meet this schedule, completing risk  assessments of approximately 90 percent of its clients from July 2007 to  September 2008. An OIOS official also reported that its separately  administered, extrabudgetary clients were included in its risk  assessments.", "In 2008, its first year of operation, the IAAC reported that OIOS\u2019s risk- assessment methodology provided a reasonable basis for establishing  preliminary work plans. However, in 2009, the IAAC reported that OIOS\u2019s  risk assessments were not practical for determining OIOS\u2019s resource  requirements because they did not take into account its clients\u2019 efforts to  mitigate these risks and therefore gave an inflated estimate of risks and  oversight needs. The IAAC recommended that OIOS modify its risk  assessments to include the effect of controls that its clients have already  put in place, and in February 2011, OIOS officials reported that they are  working to change OIOS\u2019s methodology in accordance with the  recommendations.", "The Secretary-General found that OIOS\u2019s funding arrangements with  separately administered organizations do not meet IIA standards for  independence because OIOS must negotiate oversight agreements with  these organizations without an independent review to ensure that the  oversight resources provided are sufficient. These negotiations include  discussions of the number and level of staff and resources that will be  used for an audit based on an amount of funding that the individual fund  or program is able to provide OIOS. The IAAC mitigates this potential  impediment to OIOS\u2019s independence within the Secretariat and  peacekeeping missions; however, the IAAC Chairman stated that  although the IAAC reviews OIOS\u2019s budget requests for separately  administered organizations, it does not have the authority to work with the  governing bodies of these entities to resolve funding issues, and thus  potential impediments to OIOS\u2019s ability to provide independent oversight  remain.", "Threats to independence must be managed at     the individual auditor, engagement, functional,     and organizational levels.", "OIOS officials stated that some of these clients have provided limited  audit resources to assist OIOS in its efforts. OIOS officials emphasized  that these resource limitations have not impeded the office\u2019s audit  activities because improvements to risk-based planning have allowed it to  better prioritize audit work and manage resources more effectively and  economically. However, OIOS officials reported that several smaller  entities that have adopted the UN financial regulations and rules (and  therefore fall under OIOS\u2019s audit authority for financial management  audits) have not provided OIOS with resources for conducting audits.  These entities include the United Nations Convention to Combat  Desertification, the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice  Research Institute, the United Nations Institute for Training and  Research, the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development,  the United Nations System Staff College, and the United Nations  University.", "Compounding the potential for limitations to OIOS\u2019s ability to provide  independent oversight, developing oversight relationships on a case-by- case basis has also created inconsistent funding arrangements, and the  IAAC has recommended that these funding arrangements be revised.  OIOS has MOUs formalizing its relationships with only seven of the  separately administered entities it lists as clients (see table 1). These  MOUs describe OIOS\u2019s oversight activities and resources, but the IAAC  does not review the MOUs and they do not necessarily ensure  independent oversight. OIOS has not established formal MOUs with its  other separately administered clients, including three funds and  programs\u2014the United Nations Environment Program, the United Nations  Human Settlements Program, and the United Nations Conference on  Trade and Development. In its report pending with the Secretariat, the  IAAC is recommending that the General Assembly reconsider OIOS\u2019s  current funding arrangements with separately administered entities.", "Since OIOS does not have oversight authority over all separately  administered UN entities, it may not be able to provide sufficient oversight  of crosscutting activities undertaken jointly by multiple UN entities even  when it is directed to do so by the General Assembly. UN humanitarian,  reconstruction, and development program activities can involve multiple  entities not covered by OIOS\u2019s existing mandate, which have their own  internal oversight offices. For example, the United Nations Development  Group Iraq Trust Fund has 22 separate participating UN organizations,  and some of these entities also have their own internal oversight capacity.  In August 2006, an external review commissioned by the Secretary- General found that OIOS could not fully assess risks in joint activities  involving entities not covered in its mandate, and it recommended that  OIOS be given audit authority over joint activities that include entities  within its mandate, with support from other audit organizations. In 2007,  OIOS and other internal audit offices in the UN system adopted a  framework for auditing multi-donor trust funds, in part to address this  issue. The framework established that a summary report of all internal  audit work would be prepared after the completion of the individual audits,  and OIOS officials stated that OIOS has subsequently participated in a  summary report of a joint audit of the Common Humanitarian Fund for  Sudan that was issued by the United Nations Development Program.", "While OIOS is not responsible for coordinating the internal oversight of all  joint activities, the General Assembly has previously directed it to prepare  the consolidated report of the audit and investigative reviews undertaken  by other UN organizations. However, in December of 2006, OIOS  reported that it had been unable to issue a consolidated report on the  audits of tsunami relief efforts, as directed by the General Assembly,  because the internal auditors of funds, programs, and specialized  agencies were unable to share their audit reports with OIOS. In 2010,  OIOS reemphasized its recommendation that the Secretary-General, in  collaboration with the heads of funds, programs, and specialized  agencies, specify in a single policy document the applicable rules and  regulations, coordination mechanisms, and reporting systems for  oversight of interagency activities.

The Under-Secretary-General for Internal  Oversight Services noted that this is because OIOS is required to submit  a work plan based on 100 percent of its authorized positions, rather than  filled positions. She further stated that OIOS should be allowed to submit  a work plan based on anticipated staffing shortages.", "As reasons for high vacancy rates, OIOS officials cited complexities in the  hiring process, difficulty filling oversight positions in peacekeeping  missions, and a new online system for human resources management  that was unfamiliar to OIOS staff. OIOS officials stated that the human  resource policies of the Secretariat require that vacancies be posted  individually, preventing OIOS from conducting a single hiring process for  multiple positions, and that this requirement makes reducing the vacancy  rate more difficult. Compounding this problem, OIOS officials added that  when a high-level position becomes vacant, it is often filled internally,  which creates a new vacancy at a lower level. Thus, the filling of one  position can result in the creation of a new vacancy, which requires  another extended recruitment period. OIOS officials also stated that it is  difficult to fill vacant positions in peacekeeping missions due to  challenging working and living conditions. According to a high-level official  in the Investigations Division, OIOS staff in peacekeeping missions feel  isolated by their remote locations and by the fact that they are seen as  outsiders by the peacekeeping staff. Finally, OIOS officials said the  Secretariat had difficulty implementing the new online human resources  recruitment tool, and that this contributed to delays in filling vacancies in  the most recent biennium. UN Office of Human Resources Management  officials confirmed that there had been some technical problems with the  rollout of the new system and that vacancy rates had increased  systemwide.", "The UN and OIOS have made reducing staffing shortages a priority. The  new Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight Services stated that  she has hired 82 new staff since the beginning of her term in September  2010 and has received clearance to bring in consultants to work on  recruitment through December 2011. The Under-Secretary-General noted  that the UN financial regulations and rules do not provide her the flexibility  to redeploy funds to hire consultants, as may be necessary.  To reduce  the number of unfilled positions, the Under-Secretary-General requested  an exemption from Secretariat hiring policies in order to conduct mass  recruitment to identify qualified candidates. She said that a key to this  effort would be the ability to interview and prequalify candidates at the  appropriate level in order to be able to fill multiple vacancies at once. She  reported that she did not have to use the exemption because, in the final  analysis, she was able to work within current policies to permit selection  of prequalified candidates more expeditiously.", "Officials from the UN Office of Human Resources Management stated  that in April 2010, the UN revised its recruitment policy to expedite the  process for departments with high vacancy rates. The revised policy  allows department managers (including the Under-Secretary-General for  Internal Oversight Services) to place qualified candidates that are not  selected for a particular position onto a roster, which they or other  department managers can then use to fill similar vacancies without  repeating the full recruitment process. The new policy provides the Office  of Human Resources Management with incremental resources to fully  verify credentials and references of rostered candidates (with their  permission), rather than waiting until they have been selected for a  position to complete this verification process, as this can delay their  placement for up to 6 months. This revision is expected to expedite future  placement of prequalified candidates. OIOS also reported that the  difficulties with the online human resources recruitment tool are being  resolved, and that the office expects vacancy rates to decline over the  next year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prolonged Vacancies at Director Level Resolved, but Underlying Weakness in Hiring Process Remains", "paragraphs": ["OIOS had prolonged vacancies at the director level in two of its three  divisions, one of which persisted for 5 years, but both positions have now  been filled. In its 2008-2009 report, the IAAC expressed concern that  these vacancies would make it difficult for OIOS to accomplish its work.  Vacancies at the director level differ from other vacancies because OIOS  cannot fill director-level vacancies without the approval of the Secretary- General, in accordance with a Secretariat-wide human resources policy.  According to this policy, the head of a department or office must submit at  least three candidates\u2014one of which must be a woman\u2014to the  Secretary-General, who ultimately decides which candidate to appoint.  This process was a point of contention between the previous Under- Secretary-General and the Secretary-General and resulted in prolonged  vacancies at the director level in two of OIOS\u2019s three divisions. In 2009,  the IAAC proposed a definition of operational independence for OIOS that  includes the ability to select staff for appointment and promotion, and the  General Assembly will consider this proposal during its 66th session  starting in September 2011. However, the new Under-Secretary-General  was able to nominate candidates in accordance with the Secretariat\u2019s  policy. She stated that the process was not overly restrictive and that it  was appropriate for an internal auditor to follow the policies of the  Secretariat.

Although OIOS  plays a vital role in improving the UN\u2019s effectiveness, OIOS\u2019s ability to  provide sufficient oversight of UN entities under the authority of the  Secretary-General is limited due to impediments to its operational  independence in providing full oversight of funds and programs and high  rates of unfilled staff positions.", "The UN General Assembly has taken steps to help strengthen OIOS\u2014 most notably, by creating the IAAC to review OIOS\u2019s budgets and work  plans for audits of entities within the Secretariat and peacekeeping  missions to ensure that OIOS resources are sufficient to address risks in  the UN. However, in order to provide essential internal oversight services,  OIOS still has to negotiate individual agreements with funds, programs,  and other clients under the authority of the Secretary-General but  administered separately and funded with extrabudgetary resources. This  practice may unduly limit the scope of OIOS\u2019s oversight. As the United  States and other member states place new demands for fiscal discipline  and cost-effective management on the UN and the myriad funds and  programs under it, strengthening OIOS oversight will help the UN be  more responsive to these demands.
