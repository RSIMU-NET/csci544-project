In addition, there was widespread agreement among the government, industry, and consumer organizations GAO contacted that the Department of Transportation's lack of action has contributed to the growth of problems. The Department contends that safety activities are the primary focus of its motor carrier efforts. However, the Department has not taken steps to understand the nature and extent of problems in the industry--and therefore to determine whether its limited approach to oversight and enforcement is appropriate. Nor has it made more than minimal efforts to provide information to consumers that would assist them in making more informed choices. Consumer education as a preventive tool takes on increased importance if the motor carrier administration is to pursue its course of limited oversight and enforcement. The motor carrier administration has recently recognized the need to be more active in this area and has outlined plans to increase its involvement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The ICC Termination Act of 1995 transferred federal responsibilities for  protecting consumers who move their household goods across state lines  using commercial moving companies to the Department of Transportation.

The hearing also  demonstrated a lack of effective oversight and enforcement of the industry  by the Department of Transportation.", "The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 directed that we assess  the effectiveness of the Department of Transportation\u2019s consumer  protection activities for the interstate household goods moving industry  and identify alternative approaches for providing consumer protection in  the industry. Accordingly, this report discusses (1) the nature and extent of  consumer complaints about household goods carriers since 1996, (2) the  roles of consumers in preventing and resolving disputes and of government  agencies in providing consumer protection, (3) the Department of  Transportation\u2019s oversight and enforcement activities with respect to this  industry, and (4) issues associated with an expanded state role in this area.  This report focuses on commercial moves of individual households and  does not discuss interstate moves arranged by governments or  corporations for their employees.", "To address these topics, we contacted or met with officials from a variety  of industry, law enforcement, consumer, and alternative dispute resolution  associations involved with the household goods moving industry or  consumer protection activities. We also met with officials from the  Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration (the motor carrier administration)\u2014the federal agency that  has oversight and enforcement responsibility for this industry\u2014and met  with or contacted officials from 14 of the 52 division (state) offices within  the motor carrier administration. We chose these locations because they  represented the states with the greatest number of interstate moves or  because our discussions with federal agencies, industry associations, and  consumer groups indicated that these states appeared to be experiencing  the most problems with interstate household goods moves. (See app. I for a  detailed discussion of how we carried out our work.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Each year, between 1.3 million and 1.5 million households have commercial  moving firms move their household goods to another state, according to  industry estimates. There are approximately 2,900 motor carriers  registered with the Department of Transportation that are active in  transporting household goods across state lines. These 2,900 carriers  represent a small percentage of the approximately 654,000 commercial  motor carriers engaged in all aspects of interstate commerce (and  registered with the Department).", "Household goods carriers are of three types: national van lines,  independent carriers, and short-haul movers. Most interstate moves are  conducted by approximately 25 van lines\u2014companies that market and  dispatch moves in which agents, acting on the van lines\u2019 behalf, perform the  actual moves. These agents are local moving companies that own the  moving equipment and storage facilities used in interstate moves.  Independent carriers lease or own their own equipment and storage  facilities but do not have agents. Independent carriers often share storage  facilities and some equipment in an effort to provide enough capacity and  flexibility to compete with the van lines. According to industry officials,  short-haul movers typically undertake moves of around 500 miles that do  not require storage facilities or return trip loads of goods.", "Because most consumers seldom use moving companies for their  household goods, they are less prepared to protect themselves financially  than are commercial shippers. Until 1996, the Interstate Commerce  Commission (ICC) had regulatory responsibility for interstate household  goods carriers, including issuing regulations, conducting oversight  activities, and taking enforcement actions. The ICC Termination Act of  1995, among other things, dissolved ICC and transferred these consumer  protection functions (called \u201ceconomic regulation\u201d) to the Department of  Transportation. These functions were further assigned to the motor carrier  safety office within the Federal Highway Administration. The Motor Carrier  Safety Improvement Act of 1999 transferred these consumer protection  functions to a new organization within the Department, the Federal Motor  Carrier Safety Administration. In addition to its headquarters facilities, the  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration maintains a field office  structure consisting of 4 service centers and 52 division offices\u2014one in  each state, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information on the Nature and Extent of Problems Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Data weaknesses do not allow us to assess the nature and extent of the  problems consumers have had nationwide with various aspects of the  interstate moving industry since 1996. One reason is that the government  offices and business and industry organizations we contacted that receive  complaints from consumers do not centrally compile information on the  nature of the complaints and often do not differentiate between complaints  against interstate and intrastate moving companies. Another reason is that  organizations did not collect information on how the complaints were  resolved. The federal motor carrier administration estimates that it  receives 3,000 to 4,000 complaints about interstate moves each year.", "Available information indicates that consumers have complained about a  broad range of problems in dealing with household goods carriers in recent  years. Some alleged problems reflect misunderstandings between  consumers and carriers about (1) when services were to be paid for or (2)  what services were included in the original cost estimate provided to the  consumer. For example, a carrier arrived at the destination with the  consumer\u2019s goods on the scheduled delivery date but the consumer was not  present; the carrier then took the consumer\u2019s goods to a storage facility\u2014at  an extra cost to the consumer\u2014until the consumer arrived, and the  consumer complained about the extra cost. In another example, the  consumer failed to obtain complete information about the services,  accepting a telephone estimate of the expected moving charges rather than  having the moving company provide an on-site estimate\u2014and then  complained when the actual cost of the move included charges for services  that were not covered by the estimate.", "Other problems occurred when a carrier lost or damaged the consumer\u2019s  goods but the consumer and the carrier disagreed on the amount of  compensation or the carrier took a long time to settle the claim. In some  instances, the disputed amounts involved thousands of dollars. Consumers  have also complained that carriers held their goods \u201chostage\u201d by refusing to  unload them from the moving truck until the consumer paid the entire  balance of money due, even though the consumer is not required to pay  more than 110 percent of the estimated amount to the carrier at the time of  delivery. Yet some carriers required payment in full\u2014over and above the  110 percent amount\u2014in cash at the time of delivery. And when the  consumer did not pay the amount above 110 percent of the estimate, the  carrier stored the goods at an added cost to the consumer.", "Finally, available information indicates that some consumer complaints  arose because unscrupulous carriers had no regard for the rights of  consumers or for the law. In some instances, carriers provided  unreasonably low estimates that they had no intention of honoring. Some  carriers also extracted unreasonably high fees from consumers by  imposing unjustified and exorbitant charges for packing, boxes, tape, and  other ancillary services. In addition, some carriers engaged in a practice  called \u201cweight bumping,\u201d in which they artificially inflated the weight of a  shipment by including the weight of another household\u2019s goods when  calculating the final bill. Consumers have complained that, in some  instances, even when they have won judgments against carriers in court,  they have been unable to collect damages because the carrier has hidden  its assets.", "The limited information that is available from selected federal and industry  organizations suggests that the number of complaints against household  goods carriers is increasing. The complaints recorded by 12 federal motor  carrier administration division offices about interstate household goods  carriers doubled from 318 in 1996 to 659 in 1999. (Two other division offices  we contacted did not record complaints received.) Nationwide data  maintained by the Council of Better Business Bureaus indicate a  nationwide increase in complaints against interstate and intrastate  household goods carriers from about 3,000 in 1996 to about 5,100 in 1999.  Another measure\u2014consumer requests for formal arbitration proceedings  to resolve disputes with carriers\u2014indicates an increase in consumer  dissatisfaction. Such requests submitted to the American Moving and  Storage Association increased between 1996 and 2000 from about 100 to  over 700. While all consumer complaints or requests for arbitration may not  have merit, they represent consumer dissatisfaction that consumers want  addressed.

Under the ICC Termination Act of  1995, the Department of Transportation is authorized to conduct oversight  and provide enforcement activities, among other things, to protect these  consumers.", "For moves of household goods across state lines, as for other services,  consumers are primarily responsible for protecting their own interests. It is  up to them to select a reputable carrier, ensure that they understand the  terms and conditions of the contract, and understand the remedies that are  available to them when problems arise so that they can resolve disputes  directly with the carrier. Typically, a consumer first tries to work with the  carrier directly or through state or local government agencies, if such help  is available, to resolve a dispute. If the results are not satisfactory, the  consumer can seek further recourse\u2014arbitration\u2014through industry and  business associations, such as the American Moving and Storage  Association, the Council of Better Business Bureaus, and other  independent arbitration organizations nationwide. Alternatively, the  consumer can pursue civil litigation for violations of the household goods  consumer protection statutes and regulations.", "Since 1996, the Department of Transportation has had primary federal  authority for regulating the interstate household goods moving industry\u2014 specifically, for issuing regulations to protect consumers, conducting  oversight activities (including reviewing carriers\u2019 compliance with those  regulations), and taking enforcement actions. Among other things, the  Department\u2019s existing consumer protection regulations cover the (1) types  of cost estimates carriers can provide to consumers, (2) guidance that  carriers must provide to consumers about their rights and responsibilities  when they move, (3) approved methods for carriers to weigh shipments of  household goods used to determine the final costs of the move, (4) process  through which carriers handle inquiries and complaints, and (5) maximum  charges consumers are required to pay at the time their goods are delivered  to the final destination.", "Historically, the Department\u2019s oversight activities for all types of  commercial motor carriers\u2014not just household goods carriers\u2014include  collecting information on the state of the industry, such as complaints  lodged against registered carriers. The Department also reviews  compliance with regulatory requirements (called \u201ccompliance reviews\u201d) at  a carrier\u2019s base of operations. When it identifies instances of  noncompliance, the Department can rely on a variety of enforcement  activities. For example, it can issue orders to compel compliance, impose  civil monetary penalties, revoke the carrier\u2019s operating authority, or seek  federal court orders to stop regulatory violations. While the Congress  provided the Department with the authority to regulate the interstate  household goods moving industry, a House Committee report  accompanying the 1995 act directed the Department not to intervene and  help resolve individual complaints\u2014as was the practice of ICC. According  to Department officials, the Department has followed this direction and,  when it undertakes enforcement actions, focuses on patterns of behavior  (e.g., multiple complaints) by a carrier.", "Another federal agency, the Surface Transportation Board, has the  authority to determine whether a moving company\u2019s charges to consumers  are consistent with its tariff (a published list of charges for specific services  provided). Consumers can use the Board\u2019s opinion in negotiating with the  carrier or in court.", "The states may regulate the transportation of household goods within their  boundaries (intrastate transportation). In addition, 9 of the 14 states we  contacted attempt to help consumers with complaints involving interstate  transportation. According to state officials, this involvement is generally  limited to informal mediation of the complaint with the carrier, unless state  officials believe the carrier has violated that state\u2019s consumer protection or  fraud statutes. State involvement in matters involving interstate carriers is  limited, at least in part, by a federal statute that preempts a broad range of  state law claims for loss or damage in interstate transportation.

According to Department officials, no more than two  staff positions were transferred from ICC for household-goods-related  functions. Typically, the Department has devoted about 5 staff years to its  household goods consumer protection activities and has not requested  more resources for these activities from the Congress. Rather, it has  devoted its attention to motor carrier safety issues, which are its primary  motor carrier responsibility. The Department undertook few, if any,  activities related to the industry between 1996 and 1998. In 1998, after a  congressional hearing on growing problems with certain carriers, it formed  a task force to provide increased enforcement against egregious carriers.  This task force initiated 29 enforcement actions against carriers but was  disbanded in 2000 to be replaced with a permanent enforcement team as  part of the Department\u2019s plans to increase its efforts in this area. The  Department also published proposed rules implementing the ICC  Termination Act and addressing certain consumer protection issues, but  the rules have not been finalized because of work on other, safety-related  rules.", "In 2000, when the authority for these activities was transferred to the motor  carrier administration, the Department established the Office of  Enforcement and Compliance within the motor carrier administration, with  enforcement and compliance responsibilities for all carrier types, including  household goods carriers. Through January 2001, this unit had established  a minimal system for recording complaints about household goods  carriers, established a toll-free telephone consumer complaint hotline, and  produced an outline of plans for public education and enforcement efforts,  among other things. However, significant elements of the outline\u2014 including plans for public education and outreach, as well as training of  field investigators on the household goods regulations\u2014lack specific steps.", "Officials of the government, industry, and consumer organizations we  contacted agreed that this minimal activity has created a vacuum that has  allowed egregious carriers to flourish and take advantage of consumers.  According to these officials, carriers are aware that the Department does  little to enforce the consumer protection regulations or provide much  oversight of the industry. As a result, these officials believe that while most  moves are completed by reputable carriers with few or no problems,  unscrupulous carriers are taking advantage of the lack of oversight and are  operating without concern for the regulations or the rights of consumers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consumer Education Activities Have Been Minimal", "paragraphs": ["Education helps consumers understand how they can make the choices  that will lead to more successful interstate moves. The Department has not  made an effort to reach out to consumers and organizations, such as  consumer groups, to promote a message of how consumers can protect  themselves and get redress when problems arise. Given that consumers  have primary responsibility for preventing and resolving problems with  moving companies, such outreach could help prevent consumer problems.  The Department recognized the importance of consumer education when it  continued to make available an ICC-developed booklet on consumers\u2019  rights and responsibilities. In addition, the Department continued an ICC  requirement that all interstate household goods carriers provide this  booklet to their customers.", "The Department\u2019s consumer education efforts have been minimal, limited  mostly to placing the rights and responsibilities booklet and a Department- developed \u201c17 most frequently asked questions\u201d document about moving  on the agency\u2019s Internet Web site. The rights and responsibilities booklet  and the frequently asked questions document contain much useful  consumer information. However, making the booklet available on the  Department\u2019s Web site may not be sufficient because many households do  not have Internet access. In addition, some movers may not be making the  booklet available to their customers, as required. In this regard, motor  carrier administration officials who receive consumer complaints in  California and New York and the Executive Director of the Illinois Movers  and Warehouseman\u2019s Association told us that, according to consumers who  contact their organizations after a move has taken place, some carriers  have not offered them this booklet. The motor carrier administration also  offers a \u201cself-help\u201d package to those who request it. However, the  usefulness of this package is questionable. It consists of photocopies of  federal regulations and statutes without explanation to help the reader  understand them.", "One means of consumer education would be through concerted outreach  to consumers, such as through consumer and industry groups and state  consumer protection and enforcement agencies. The motor carrier  administration endorsed the concept of this approach in December 2000,  but it will not develop concrete activities for carrying it out until June 2001.  (The motor carrier administration\u2019s plans to increase its presence in this  area are discussed at the end of this section.) We agree that such outreach  could be useful in helping consumers understand how to make a move  more successful and how to seek redress when problems arise. It would  also be helpful to state agencies when consumers complain to them about  interstate household goods movers. Over half of the state agencies we  contacted did not know which federal agency regulates these movers, or  that any federal agency had any role since the termination of ICC.  Therefore, they were unable to forward complaints they received about  interstate moves to the motor carrier administration.", "Another opportunity for the Department to help consumers make informed  choices is to make complaint information available to the public. For  example, the motor carrier administration receives complaints from some  consumers about household goods carriers but does not share this  information with the public because it believes that by doing so it may  violate consumers\u2019 privacy. Such concerns would have merit if the  Department identified the complainant when making the information  public. However, the complaints could be aggregated by carrier and type of  complaint (e.g., damage to goods shipped, hostage freight) without  revealing the identity of the complainant. This approach is used by the  Department\u2019s Aviation Consumer Protection Division. The Aviation  Consumer Protection Division routinely shares complaint information  (e.g., damage to luggage, poor service) collected from consumers through  its Air Travel Consumer Report. The Aviation Consumer Protection  Division shares this information with consumers through its Internet Web  site to help them make choices about which airlines to use. According to  the Assistant Director for Aviation Consumer Protection, publishing these  data assists consumers in assessing the airlines\u2019 service quality while  encouraging the airlines to improve their service. In addition, Department  officials are concerned about providing the public with complaint  information that has not been substantiated by the Department. However,  the Assistant Director for Aviation Consumer Protection explained that his  office and the airline industry generally agree that complaints, as reported,  are real and valid from a consumer\u2019s perspective regardless of whether  there has been a violation of regulations or simply a disagreement over  policy and procedures.", "Similarly, in 1998, the Department proposed rules that would implement  the requirements of the 1995 act and would require carriers to file annual  reports with the agency that, among other things, include information on  the number of claims filed with the carrier. The Department planned to  make this information available to the public, further indicating that  privacy concerns could be addressed. (The Department has not finalized  these rules and, therefore, has not implemented this action.) Previously,  ICC required similar reports and made this information available to the  public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Department Has Undertaken Little Industry Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Oversight efforts that would help the Department understand the industry  and shape its enforcement strategy have been minimal. The motor carrier  administration has not collected information on the nature and extent of  complaints in a way that could be used in overseeing the industry. Even  though it required its division offices to collect information on all  complaints that came in to them in a complaint register, 2 of the 14 division  offices we contacted were not using complaint registers because the  officials in charge of those offices decided that the complaints were so  infrequent that the registers were unnecessary. The other offices collected  the information inconsistently, hampering the motor carrier administration  in understanding the nature and extent of problems reported by  consumers. For example, one office recorded only complaints made in  writing and ignored complaints made over the telephone, even though the  motor carrier administration\u2019s guidance specified that information from  telephone complaints be recorded.", "Agency guidance indicates that a primary purpose of the complaint register  is to identify substantial patterns of noncompliance that would aid in  targeting unscrupulous carriers for enforcement actions. However, the  motor carrier administration did not issue any guidance to its division  offices on how and when to report complaint data to headquarters.  Division office staff told us that the registers were primarily used to log  complaints because the agency guidance did not ask for complaints to be  supplied to headquarters for analysis. In addition to having data quality  problems, the complaint register system is not designed to share  information across state lines or with headquarters: The databases that  each office maintains are \u201cstand-alone\u201d\u2014not electronically linked to each  other or to headquarters. This design limits the register\u2019s usefulness in  oversight and enforcement. According to Department officials, the motor  carrier administration plans to create a new, national consumer complaint  database by April 2001 for use in enforcement and oversight. While this  database will accept complaints from all sources\u2014including the general  public\u2014motor carrier administration staff at headquarters, service centers,  and division offices will have limited access to the entire system.", "Finally, the Department has not undertaken a study of the effectiveness of  arbitration as a means of settling household goods disputes, despite the  requirement in the ICC Termination Act that it complete this study within  18 months. A study of arbitration\u2014required for the first time by the 1995  act\u2014would be useful in determining the degree to which carriers have  established accessible and fair arbitration programs.

The 11 cases  opened against household goods carriers were for (1) violating consumer  protection regulations, (2) failing to register with the Department, or (3)  failing to have insurance. The Department had settled these cases,  including assessing civil penalties against the carriers, as of February 2001.  In response to congressional concerns in 1998 about such limited  enforcement, the Department established a temporary task force with  seven members, including three former ICC investigators, to inspect  household goods carriers reported to the agency for egregious behavior.

For example, an official from one state suggested that the  Carmack Amendment be modified so as not to preempt state law with  respect to household goods carriers operating without tariffs in violation of  federal law. (See app. III for additional information.)", "As discussed in the previous section, a number of areas exist in which the  motor carrier administration could better oversee the household goods  moving industry and help consumers make informed choices when they  move their household goods. We believe that actions in these areas could  lead to improved compliance with federal laws and regulations. We also  believe that action by the Department in areas in which it currently is  exercising little authority should precede state involvement in this area.  Once the Department completes its December 2000 plans and effectively  implements the recommendations contained in this report, it will be in a  better position to determine what additional benefits, if any, would accrue  from legislative changes that would expand the states\u2019 role with respect to  interstate household goods carriers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Available information indicates that consumer complaints in the household  goods industry are increasing.

However, the Department has not taken steps to understand the nature and  extent of problems in the industry\u2014and therefore to determine whether its  limited approach to oversight and enforcement is appropriate. Nor has it  made more than minimal efforts to provide information to consumers that  would assist them in making more informed choices. Consumer education  as a preventative tool takes on increased importance if the motor carrier  administration is to pursue its course of limited oversight and enforcement.  The motor carrier administration has recently recognized the need to be  more active in this area and has outlined plans to increase its involvement.

These actions should  include  assessing whether enforcement activities against household goods  carriers are effective and sufficient and, if not, increase enforcement  actions against interstate household goods carriers, as outlined in the  motor carrier administration\u2019s plans, and  determining whether legislative changes are needed to supplement the  Department\u2019s efforts, including (1) authorizing the states to enforce  federal statutes and regulations and (2) changing the federal statute  limiting carriers\u2019 liability with respect to interstate shipments of  household goods. If such changes are needed, the Department should  submit them to the Congress. This determination should be made after  the other recommendations in this report have been implemented and  sufficient time has passed to assess the effects of the Department\u2019s  actions.", "We also recommend that the Secretary direct the Administrator to carry out  public education efforts that will promote awareness of means that  consumers can employ to protect themselves when they are moving their  household goods across state lines and on what they can do when  problems arise. These efforts should include  reaching out to consumers, consumer and industry groups, and state  governments and using Internet postings and other means, consistent  with the motor carrier administration\u2019s plans;  notifying state consumer and law enforcement agencies and national  consumer organizations that the motor carrier administration is  responsible for regulating the interstate household goods industry;  making information on the number and general nature of complaints  made against individual carriers available to the public without  disclosing the complainants\u2019 identity; and  publicizing the results of the Department\u2019s enforcement cases against  household goods carriers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Department of Transportation with a draft of this report  for review and comment.

It will continue to work to the best of its ability, within established resource  constraints, to effectively fulfill its responsibilities in this area. The officials  indicated that the Department has received only a fraction of the resources  ICC devoted to the area and has augmented its staffing to the degree it is  able, while it continues to pursue the ambitious safety agenda set out  before it with the motor carrier community. The representatives also told  us that the motor carrier administration recently established a new  approach to deal more effectively and comprehensively with issues in the  household goods moving industry, particularly those involving carriers and  brokers that have demonstrated persistent noncompliance with applicable  economic and commercial regulations. They said that this approach will  focus on educating consumers, tracking complaints, and formulating a  more effective approach to regulatory enforcement.", "We agree that the new approach adopted by the Department has the  potential to improve oversight and enforcement over the household goods  moving industry. However, since many of the initiatives are still in their  early stages, we cannot predict the ultimate success of these endeavors.  The Department will need to demonstrate to the Congress and to the public  that it can follow through with its consumer protection efforts over the  long term. The Department also made several technical and clarifying  comments, which we incorporated where appropriate.", "Finally, the Department did not comment on our recommendations. Our  draft report contained a proposed recommendation that the motor carrier  administration establish implementation and completion dates for actions  contained in its plans to improve oversight and enforcement activities  involving interstate household goods carriers.

From 12 motor  carrier administration division offices in Arizona, California, Colorado,  Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, and Texas, we obtained summary information from their  Economic Complaint Registers. We selected these offices because they  represent the states that (1) had the most interstate moves and, according  to motor carrier administration officials, (2) reported the most problems  with household goods movers. We did not verify the reliability of the data  maintained in these registers. We also obtained summary complaint  information and/or summary requests for arbitration from the Council of  Better Business Bureaus and the American Moving and Storage  Association. To determine the number of motor carriers that might be  involved in interstate household goods moves, we obtained information  from the Department of Transportation and from the American Moving and  Storage Association. To determine the nature of the complaints, we  interviewed federal and state officials and a number of industry and law  enforcement and consumer protection organization officials. We relied on  interviews because information on the nature of problems was not  available without expending extraordinary efforts. We also reviewed the  record for the 1998 hearing on consumer protection issues involving the  household goods moving industry.", "To establish how consumer protection for this industry is provided, we  determined the Department of Transportation\u2019s role with respect to the  household goods moving industry, as well as the roles of other federal  agencies and the states. To do so, we reviewed the ICC Termination Act of  1995 and the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. We also  reviewed the Department of Transportation\u2019s applicable regulations,  program guidance, and self-help packages provided to consumers. We  discussed with motor carrier administration officials (at headquarters and  in 14 division offices\u2014the 12 previously mentioned, as well as those in New  Hampshire and North Carolina) their duties and actions with respect to the  household goods moving industry, including consumer complaint tracking,  public education efforts, and enforcement efforts. We also contacted  officials at the Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Trade  Commission (FTC) to discuss their roles in consumer protection for this  industry. In addition, we contacted agencies in 14 states to determine what  activities they undertake with respect to this industry. (The organizations  we contacted are listed at the end of this appendix.)

Under the Carmack  Amendment, carriers are liable, to the person entitled to recover under a  receipt or bill of lading, for actual loss or damage to property, but they may  limit their liability to a declared value or other amount agreed to by the  consumer as authorized by the Surface Transportation Board. The  Carmack Amendment was enacted to impose a uniform scheme of liability  that would eliminate the uncertainty associated with conflicting state laws  on interstate shipments.", "Courts have consistently held that the Carmack Amendment preempts a  broad range of state law claims relating to the loss or damage of goods in  interstate shipments. Specifically, the Carmack Amendment bars  individual consumers from asserting claims that would enlarge the carrier\u2019s  responsibility for loss or affect the grounds or measure of recovery,  including those for violations of state consumer protection statutes, breach  of contract, negligence, and fraud. However, the extent of the Carmack  Amendment\u2019s preemptive effect is not as clear. Emphasizing the goal of  uniformity underlying the Carmack Amendment, some courts addressing  state law claims asserted by individual consumers have held that the  amendment essentially preempts every state law claim related to the  contract of shipment. Others have suggested that the Carmack  Amendment does not preempt claims that stem from injuries separate and distinct from loss or damage, but have identified little actionable conduct.  Furthermore, there is some question about the states\u2019 authority under  consumer protection statutes to take enforcement action against interstate  carriers for claims unrelated to loss or damage.  Although at least one state  has successfully taken action against an interstate household goods carrier  under such statutes and other states are currently pursuing such action,  officials from two states told us that they would not attempt to bring such  cases because of the Carmack Amendment\u2019s pervasive preemption of state  law.", "The states can provide for the regulation of intrastate household goods  carriers, and some states have decided not to regulate the household goods  moving industry. Of the 14 states we contacted, 11 regulate household  goods carriers through a state agency, such as a public utilities commission  or a department of transportation. The remaining three states (Florida,  Arizona, and Colorado) do not regulate the industry. The states that  regulate intrastate household goods carriers require them to follow  regulations, such as those to file tariffs, file proof of insurance, provide  educational material to potential consumers, maintain operating authority,  and pass examinations on state regulations to obtain authority. While all 12  state offices of the attorney general we contacted said they would bring  cases against intrastate carriers for violations of state fraud or business fair  practices laws, only 3 of the offices\u2014in New York, Illinois, and  Pennsylvania\u2014were pursuing intrastate household goods cases. The  states\u2019 enforcement authority includes imposing temporary restraining  orders and injunctions to halt practices, imposing monetary penalties, and  revoking carriers\u2019 authority to haul goods.

The Commission allocates its investigative and law enforcement resources  to address practices that cause the greatest harm. As a result, cases  considered significant on a state or regional level may not spur the  Commission to initiate an investigation. While the states may be required to  use their enforcement resources in other areas, allowing 50 states to  enforce federal and state consumer protection statutes has an enhanced  deterrent effect not realized through FTC\u2019s enforcement alone, according  to Commission officials.", "Consumer advocates and household goods moving industry  representatives with whom we spoke see the states\u2019 enforcement of federal  statutes and regulations in very different ways.
