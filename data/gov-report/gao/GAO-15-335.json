This report examines (1) the status of reform efforts and the extent to which FCC has evaluated program effectiveness, (2) the extent to which households participate and challenges they face in accessing and retaining benefits, and (3) FCC's plans to evaluate the broadband pilot program.", "GAO reviewed FCC orders and other relevant documentation; analyzed 2008\u20132012 Census Bureau data; and interviewed FCC officials, officials at four pilot projects selected based on features such as technology, and officials from 12 Lifeline providers and four states selected based on factors such as disbursements and participation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has made progress implementing reforms to the Lifeline Program (Lifeline), which reduces the cost of telephone service for eligible low-income households. In 2012, FCC adopted a Reform Order with 11 key reforms that aimed to increase accountability and strengthen internal controls, among other things. FCC has implemented seven of the reforms and partially implemented four. In some cases, FCC needs to make a decision, and in other cases, additional time is needed to fully implement the reform. However, FCC has not evaluated Lifeline's effectiveness in achieving its goals\u2014to ensure the availability of voice service for low-income Americans and minimize the burden on consumers and businesses that fund the program. FCC attributes improvements in the level of low-income households' subscribing to telephone service over the past 30 years to Lifeline, but other factors, such as lower prices, may play a role. FCC officials stated that Lifeline's structure makes evaluation difficult, but referred GAO to academic studies that suggest that many low-income households would subscribe to telephone service without Lifeline. GAO has found that program evaluation can help agencies understand whether a program is addressing an intended problem. Without a program evaluation, FCC does not know whether Lifeline is effectively ensuring the availability of telephone service for low-income households while minimizing program costs.", "In 2014, over 12 million households participated in Lifeline, up from about 7 million in 2008. At its peak enrollment in 2012, Lifeline served about 18 million households. The introduction of prepaid wireless service contributed to this growth. After the Reform Order, program disbursements declined from $2.2 billion in 2012 to $1.7 billion in 2014, due in part to a reduction in the number of ineligible households receiving benefits. Based on interviews with stakeholders and providers, GAO identified challenges households may face in accessing and retaining benefits, including lack of awareness of the program and difficulty complying with new requirements, such as providing documentation of eligibility. Companies providing Lifeline service have taken steps, such as greater outreach and in-person enrollment, to mitigate these challenges.", "The usefulness of information FCC gathered through its broadband pilot program may be limited due to the lack of an evaluation plan and other challenges. The pilot program included 14 projects to test an array of options and provide data on how Lifeline could be structured to promote broadband. According to FCC officials, the 14 projects enrolled about one-tenth of the 74,000 customers anticipated before ending subsidized service in October 2014. Although GAO previously recommended in 2010 that FCC develop a needs assessment and implementation and evaluation plans for the pilot, FCC did not do so and now faces difficulties in evaluating the program without established benchmarks. Although enrollment was lower than anticipated, FCC officials believe information on the number of eligible consumers offered service can provide relevant information regarding the options' effects on broadband adoption. However, FCC did not survey these consumers and does not know why eligible households did not enroll. The pilot projects are substantially complete, and FCC officials noted that the pilot program is one of many factors FCC will consider when deciding whether and how to incorporate broadband into Lifeline."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["FCC should conduct a program evaluation to determine the extent to which the Lifeline program is efficiently and effectively reaching its performance goals.

As with all universal  service programs, Lifeline is funded through mandatory fees that are  usually passed along to consumers through a charge applied to their  monthly telephone bills. In 2014, FCC\u2019s universal service disbursements  totaled $7.9 billion, and the Lifeline program\u2019s disbursements totaled  approximately $1.7 billion.", "Although the Lifeline program traditionally centered on wireline residential  telephone service, in 2005 and 2008, FCC acted to pave the way for  eligible households to receive prepaid wireless service from non-facilities- based wireless carriers. Subsequent to these actions, the Lifeline program experienced rapid growth in participation and disbursements.  For example, in 2009, disbursements increased by 25 percent. In  October 2010, we reported that the Lifeline program lacked some internal  control features. For example, we found that the program had limited  abilities to detect and prevent ineligible and duplicate subscribers from  enrolling in the program. We recommended that FCC take actions to  improve management and oversight, including conducting a robust risk  assessment and implementing a systemic process for considering the  results of ETC audits; FCC agreed with our recommendations. To  comprehensively reform and modernize the Lifeline program, among  other things, FCC adopted a Reform Order in January 2012 that sought to  improve the program\u2019s internal controls and that included a pilot program  to evaluate inclusion of broadband into the program.", "You asked us to examine the progress FCC has made toward  modernizing the Lifeline program.

To answer   and stakeholders from state and  our first three objectives, we conducted four state case studies (Alabama,  Arizona, New York, and Wisconsin); we selected the states to capture a  range of Lifeline disbursement amounts and participation rates, and also  considered other factors. In each state, we interviewed officials from the  public utility commission and the state consumer advocate, where  available, and we collected documentation and interviewed  representatives from three prepaid wireless eligible telecommunications  carriers (ETC), which are companies eligible to receive Lifeline support.  We selected these ETCs based on their Lifeline market share in the state  and their nationwide revenues. In addition to these nine wireless ETCs,we also interviewed representatives from the three largest nationwide  wireline ETCs. Although using these criteria allowed us to obtain  information from a variety of states and ETCs, the findings from our case  studies cannot be generalized to all states and ETCs because case  studies were selected as part of a nonprobability sample. To assess the  extent to which FCC has evaluated the effectiveness of the Lifeline  program, we compared information collected from FCC to criteria on  program evaluation identified from our previous work. In addition, we  reviewed two academic studies that examined the effect of the Lifeline  program; we identified the studies through an interview with FCC. To  assess the methodological quality of the studies, at least two GAO  analysts and an economist reviewed the studies, and we discussed the  methodologies with four economists involved with the studies; the studies  met our criteria for methodological quality. To analyze how the Lifeline  program verifies household eligibility and addresses privacy and data  security, we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from FCC,  USAC, and a state association.", "To describe the extent to which eligible households participate in Lifeline,  we analyzed USAC data on quarterly Lifeline participation counts from  2008 through fourth quarter 2014 and yearly disbursements from 2008  through 2014; we selected 2008 since it was the first year non-facilities- based wireless carriers offered Lifeline service. We also analyzed data  from the Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Income and Program Participation  (SIPP) and the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA)  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to estimate trends in  the number of households that would satisfy the federal criteria to  participate in Lifeline from 2008 through 2012. To assess the reliability of  these data, we reviewed relevant USAC, SIPP, and SNAP documentation  and interviewed USAC officials; we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes of reporting trends. To identify the  challenges, if any, eligible households face in accessing and retaining  program benefits, we reviewed FCC, USAC, and ETC policies,  processes, and practices that could influence participation in Lifeline. To  determine how FCC plans to evaluate the broadband pilot program, we  interviewed FCC officials and representatives from 4 case study pilot  projects that we selected from a universe of 14 projects to include both  wireline and wireless service, diverse locations (urban and rural), and  based on other factors. We also reviewed documentation from USAC on  each case study project and interviewed consumer advocates and  representatives from broadband adoption programs.

The commission also  has broad permissive authority to require other providers of  telecommunications to contribute if the public interest so requires.  Contributions are to be equitable and nondiscriminatory and are to be  deposited into the Universal Service Fund (USF). Each quarter, FCC  calculates a \u201ccontribution factor\u201d based on the projected demands of the  universal service programs and the projected contribution base. USAC  then bills contributors based on this factor. In the fourth quarter of 2014,  the contribution factor was 16.1 percent, down from a historic high of 17.9  percent in the first quarter of 2012. Carriers generally pass their USF  contribution obligation on to their customers, typically in the form of a line  item on their monthly telephone bill.", "FCC, USAC, states, and ETCs all have roles and responsibilities in the  Lifeline program. At the federal level, FCC is responsible for setting  policy, making and interpreting rules, providing oversight, and, in certain  states, designating carriers as ETCs. Meanwhile, USAC, a not-for-profit  corporation designated by FCC as the administrator of its universal  service programs, manages the day-to-day operations of the Lifeline  program, including collecting USF contributions, disbursing payments,  auditing USF recipients, and reporting to FCC. At the state level, public  utility commissions can increase the scope of Lifeline in their states by  contributing additional financial support to Lifeline recipients, adding to  the list of programs that households use to qualify for Lifeline, or both. For  example, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin contributes state  funds to Lifeline recipients and adds programs such as Wisconsin Works,  which provides employment preparation and other services to eligible  low-income families, to the list of programs that households use to qualify  for Lifeline. States can also play a role in Lifeline enrollment either by  accepting applicants directly or providing ETCs access to information on  enrollment in programs that households use to qualify for Lifeline for the  purposes of verifying eligibility, since this information is generally housed  at the state level. To receive Lifeline support, carriers must be designated  as ETCs by state public utility commissions or FCC. State public utility  commissions have the primary responsibility for designating carriers as  ETCs; however, in a situation where the telecommunications carrier is not  subject to state jurisdiction, FCC may designate the carrier as an ETC.  ETCs are generally responsible for advertising the availability of the  program, submitting forms for reimbursement, and verifying applicants\u2019  eligibility for Lifeline.", "Traditionally, Lifeline discounts only applied to wireline service and  eligibility standards varied significantly by state. In addition to Lifeline,  FCC\u2019s efforts to promote phone service among the low-income population  included Link Up, which discounted the connection charges associated  with telephone service installation. In addition, carriers could receive  support to offset certain costs for providing consumers with toll limitation  service (TLS); TLS support subsidized carriers\u2019 costs for blocking or  restricting long-distance service for low-income consumers, thus allowing  these consumers to specify a limit on the amount of toll charges that  could be incurred per billing cycle.

This view is shared by representatives from both industry  associations, one consumer advocate, and 3 of the 12 ETCs we  interviewed. Commissioner Clyburn and these stakeholders suggest that  Lifeline should follow a similar arrangement as other low-income  assistance programs, such as SNAP or Medicaid, where the government  determines who is eligible for the benefit, while private companies, such  as grocery stores or health care providers, provide goods and services to  eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, in the Lifeline program, governmental  entities, such as states, FCC, and USAC, are not required to determine  an applicant\u2019s initial eligibility, while ETCs are required to both  determine consumer eligibility and provide service to beneficiaries.

In particular, of the nine prepaid wireless ETCs we spoke to, six stated  that they enroll most of their customers in person, either at a store  location or mobile event, with several noting they enroll 90 percent or  more of their customers this way. These enrollments often involve  agents entering application information and capturing electronic copies of  eligibility documentation using a tablet computer. When asked about the  privacy and data security provisions for this process, representatives from  three ETCs told us this information is stored in a secure software  application rather than on the tablet itself and is transmitted to an off-site  back office for review, after which the electronic copy of the  documentation is deleted.

Although  Lifeline rules require ETCs to keep accurate records on how each  consumer demonstrated his or her eligibility, FCC rules prohibit ETCs  from retaining any documentation provided by a consumer to  demonstrate eligibility after an eligibility determination has been made.  FCC officials say the requirement that prohibits ETCs from retaining  documentation provides privacy protection against unauthorized access  to or release of the information. According to FCC officials, FCC\u2019s  Enforcement Bureau is charged with enforcing FCC and Lifeline privacy  rules, such as the recent notice of apparent liability against the two  carriers mentioned above. In addition, USAC officials said they review  ETCs\u2019 document retention procedures as part of their audits of ETCs.  Representatives from 9 of the 12 ETCs we spoke to said that they comply  with program rules and destroy copies of customer documentation  regularly. Despite this, 7 of the 12 ETCs we spoke to support FCC  modifying its rules to allow ETCs to retain this documentation indefinitely.  Some of these ETCs state that they can use this documentation during  audits to demonstrate how they determined the applicant\u2019s eligibility. In  addition, these ETCs argue that retaining documentation will better  enable the Lifeline program to detect waste, fraud, and abuse. For  example, TracFone noted that without a requirement to retain  documentation, ETCs have the ability and the economic incentive to claim  that they reviewed documentation without being required to retain  documentation that FCC and USAC can use to verify the claim.

In 2010, we found that growth in  the program was primarily due to the introduction of prepaid wireless  as an eligible service. ETCs offering prepaid wireless typically  provide consumers with a free handset and 250 free monthly minutes,  rather than providing a discount on a monthly telephone bill like  traditional wireline ETCs. Since 2008, the Lifeline program shifted  from wireline ETCs, which received at least 82 percent of Lifeline  disbursements in 2008, to wireless ETCs, which received 85 percent  of disbursements in the third quarter of 2014.", "Duplicate or ineligible enrollment: Duplicate enrollments and ineligible  subscribers may have contributed to the growth in the Lifeline  program. The transition to wireless removed the connection between  Lifeline service and a physical address, increasing the likelihood that  a household could receive more than one Lifeline-supported service.  As noted earlier, weak controls resulted in ineligible and duplicate  benefits. For example, USAC undertook an in-depth data validation  process to identify and remove duplicate subscribers, and reported  that it eliminated 2.2 million duplicate subscribers and yielded savings  of over $260 million from 2011 through 2013.", "Increase in eligible households: The growth in Lifeline may also have  been partially due to an increase in the number of households eligible  for the benefit. Using Census data, we found the number of  households eligible for Lifeline grew from approximately 35 million in  2008 to 40 million in 2012, a 15 percent increase.

We identified the following  challenges:", "Knowledge about the program: Eligible households may be unaware  of the program. FCC requires ETCs to publicize the availability of  Lifeline in a manner reasonably designed to reach those likely to  qualify. In a 2010 recommended decision, the Federal-State Joint  Board on Universal Servicemay not reach some eligible households and that insufficient outreach  efforts by some ETCs may have contributed to low Lifeline  participation rates.

However, applicants may be challenged to  access or submit applications through such methods because they  may lack access to the Internet or fax machines. In addition, two  stakeholders we interviewed said that eligible consumers may  struggle to complete an application due to a lack of literacy or  language skills given the complexity of the form. For example,  representatives from one ETC noted that some applicants may not  understand statements such as \u201cOne Lifeline service is available per  household, and that, to the best of my knowledge, no other person in  my household is receiving a Lifeline service. For purposes of Lifeline,  a household is any individual or group of individuals who live together  at the same address and share income and expenses.\u201d", "Providing documentation of eligibility: Some households may be  unable to submit copies of their eligibility documentation such as a  SNAP benefit card with their applications. As mentioned earlier, ETCs  are now required to verify eligibility, which is often done by reviewing  documentation. Consumers submitting applications need to send  copies of documentation, but may be unable to do so due to a lack of  access to equipment such as scanners or photocopiers. According to  representatives from one ETC, this may result in consumers failing to  complete the application. In addition, some consumers may have  difficulty providing required documentation to prove eligibility, such as  tax returns or Social Security statement of benefits.", "Recertification: FCC requires ETCs to annually recertify the eligibility  of all of their Lifeline customers and de-enroll those who do not reply  to recertification attempts, which stakeholders we interviewed said  may result in eligible households de-enrolled from the program. In  order to verify eligibility, ETCs often contact customers directly  through a variety of means, such as mail, telephone, and text  message. Customers must then reply to affirm their ongoing eligibility  for Lifeline. Representatives from all 12 ETCs we interviewed noted  that it is a challenge to get customers to respond. In the two  completed recertification rounds to date, 2012 and 2013, USAC  reports that many households were de-enrolled due to non- response. According to representatives from 3 of the 12 ETCs we  interviewed, eligible households may not respond because they have  moved and did not receive mailed notices or may not respond to  telephone calls from unknown callers. In addition, representatives  from ETCs, public utility commissions, and consumer advocates we  spoke to said that subscribers may have difficulty understanding the  recertification process or the language used on recertification forms.

According  to FCC, the projects are expected to provide high-quality data on how the  Lifeline program could be structured to promote broadband adoption by  low-income households. FCC noted the diversity of the 14 projects, which  differed by geography (e.g., urban, rural, Tribal); types of technologies  (e.g., fixed and mobile); and discount amounts. Projects were also  designed to test variables such as digital literacy training and equipment  discounts. FCC selected projects that were designed as field  experiments and offered randomized variation to consumers. For  example, one project we reviewed offered customers three different  discount levels and a choice of four different broadband speeds, thereby  testing 12 different program options. FCC officials said they aimed to test  and reveal \u201ccausal effects\u201d of variables. FCC officials said this approach,  for example, would test how effective a $20 monthly subsidy was relative  to a $10 subsidy, which would help FCC evaluate the relative costs and  benefits of different subsidy amounts. However, FCC officials noted that  there was a lack of FCC or third party oversight of the program, meaning  that pilot projects themselves were largely responsible for administration  of the program.", "We found that FCC did not conduct a needs assessment or develop  implementation and evaluation plans for the broadband pilot program, as  we had previously recommended. In October 2010, we recommended  that if FCC conducted a broadband pilot program, it should conduct a  needs assessment and develop implementation and evaluation plans,  which we noted are critical elements for the proper development of pilot  programs. We noted that a needs assessment could provide information  on the telecommunications needs of low-income households and the  most cost-effective means to meet those needs. Although FCC did not  publish a needs assessment, FCC officials said they consulted with  stakeholders and reviewed research on low-income broadband adoption  when designing the program. Well-developed plans for implementing and  evaluating pilot programs include key features such as: well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives;  criteria or standards for determining pilot program performance; clearly articulated methodology, including sound sampling methods,  determination of appropriate sample size for the evaluation design,  and a strategy for comparing the pilot results with other efforts; benchmarks to assess pilot success; and detailed evaluation time frames, roles, and responsibilities.", "We noted in our October 2010 report that such evaluation plans help  ensure that evaluations will yield methodologically sound results and  support effective program and policy decisions. FCC officials said they did  not set out with an evaluation plan because they did not want to prejudge  the results by setting benchmark targets ahead of time. FCC officials said  they are optimistic that the information gathered from the pilot projects will  enable FCC to make recommendations regarding how broadband could  be incorporated in Lifeline. However, FCC officials said they do not have set milestones, time frames, or specific deliverables for their evaluation of  the program.

FCC officials  said that the 74,000 consumers noted in the December 2012 order  adopting the pilot program was an estimate of consumers who could be  served through the program given the available funding and was not a  reliable number and should not be interpreted as a goal for the program.  FCC officials said they calculated this figure by adding together the  enrollment estimates provided by projects, which varied in their  methodologies. For example, some projects estimated serving all eligible  consumers, while others predicted that only a fraction of eligible  consumers would enroll. Due to the low enrollment in the pilot program, a  small fraction of the total money FCC authorized for the program was  spent. Specifically, FCC officials report that about $1.7 million of the  $13.8 million authorized was disbursed to projects.", "FCC officials told us they do not view the pilot\u2019s low enrollment as a  problem, as the program sought variation and the data collected will still  enable FCC to make comparisons across different treatments. In addition,  FCC officials noted that although insufficient sample size could be a  problem for some projects, most projects offered service to a sizable  number of consumers, even if a relatively small portion of those offered  service subsequently enrolled in the service. FCC officials believe  information on the number of consumers offered service can provide  relevant information regarding the subsidy\u2019s effect on broadband  adoption. However, the program did not survey consumers who were  offered but did not enroll in the service and will not generate information  on why these consumers did not enroll.", "FCC and pilot project officials we spoke to noted that a preliminary finding  from the pilot was that service offered at deeply discounted or free  monthly rates had high participation. FCC officials and representatives  from the four pilot projects we interviewed noted that broadband offered  at no or the lowest cost per month resulted in the highest participation.  For example, according to USAC data, one project that offered service at  no monthly cost to the customer reported 100 percent of its 709 enrollees  were enrolled in plans with no monthly cost as of October 2013, with no  customers enrolled in its plans with a $20 monthly fee. This information  raises questions about the feasibility of including broadband service in the  Lifeline program, since on a nationwide scale, offering broadband service  at no monthly cost would require significant resources and may conflict  with FCC\u2019s goal to minimize the contribution burden.", "In addition, representatives from the projects we interviewed noted other  challenges, such as difficulties with marketing the program and getting  customers to pay their bills.

Further, representatives from three of the four projects we spoke to noted  that eligible customers they contacted were unaware of or did not see the  benefits of broadband. In addition, officials from three of the four pilot  projects we interviewed noted the difficulty of getting customers to pay  their monthly bills. For example, at one project, an official noted that all  enrolled customers in the pilot lost service during the course of the project  due to inability to pay. FCC officials noted that understanding these  challenges faced by pilot projects will help the commission as it considers  whether and how to incorporate broadband into the Lifeline program.", "For the reasons noted above, FCC\u2019s broadband pilot program  experienced challenges. In particular, FCC did not adopt our previous  recommendation to conduct a needs assessment or develop  implementation and evaluation plans prior to establishing the program.  Without such planning, FCC now faces difficulties in evaluating the  program without established benchmarks for success. Further, FCC does  not know why large numbers of eligible households did not enroll in the  pilot projects. As noted earlier, FCC approved the introduction of non- facilities-based wireless service into the Lifeline program without  quantifying or estimating the potential cost increases, which contributed to  a 167 percent increase in disbursements from 2008 to 2012. The risk of  significant costs to the program are even greater given that FCC notes  that a lesson learned from the broadband pilot program is that higher  subsidies have the highest participation rates. However, the pilot projects  are now substantially complete.

However, several factors could  play a role in this change, such as a reduction in the price of service over  time. Program evaluation is a critical strategy that can allow agencies to  assess the value or effectiveness of a program, among other things.  Officials report that FCC has not conducted a program evaluation of  Lifeline, noting that the program\u2019s structure makes it difficult to determine  a causal connection between the program and the penetration rate.  However, FCC officials referenced academic studies that evaluated the  impact of Lifeline and suggest that the program may be a rather inefficient  and costly mechanism to increase telephone subscribership. This  suggested lack of efficiency is a concern, particularly since FCC has  proposed expanding the pool of households eligible for Lifeline. Such  actions may increase overall penetration, but might do so at a high cost  because households may enroll that already have phone service. Without  evaluating the program, FCC does not have information on which to base  program changes, such as expanding eligibility requirements.

Using data from  the Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),  we estimated the number of households that would satisfy the federal  criteria to participate in Lifeline by calculating the number of households  participating in Lifeline qualifying programs and the number of households  at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty guidelines from 2008  through 2012. We also used SIPP data to estimate the number of  additional households that would be added if the Special Supplemental  Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children were added as a  Lifeline qualifying program.
