Medicaid consists of more than 50 distinct state-based programs. The federal government matches state expenditures for most Medicaid services using the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, a statutory formula based in part on each state's per capita income.

Medicare spending  must be held much more firmly in check to sustain the program over the  long term, while continuing to ensure that beneficiaries have access to  appropriate health care. To help do so, GAO has identified opportunities  to make Medicare payment methods more efficient and cost-effective. In  addition, the size of the program makes it important for CMS to manage  program functions more effectively and better oversee the program\u2019s  integrity and quality of patient care. The following areas delineate where  GAO has identified opportunities for improvements.", "Reforming and refining payments. CMS has implemented broad- based reforms to payment systems in the traditional Medicare fee-for- service (FFS) program as well as Medicare Advantage (MA) plans,  where about a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries receive their care.  Many reforms introduce financial incentives into payment structures to  explicitly reward quality and efficiency. Important initiatives include  steps toward transitioning Medicare\u2019s FFS physician payment system  from one that rewards volume of services to one in which value\u2014as  measured by quality and cost of care\u2014is used to determine payment.  As CMS progresses to full implementation of its value-based payment  system, it will be important for the agency to use reliable quality and  cost measures and methodological approaches that maximize the  number of physicians for whom value can be determined.", "GAO\u2019s work identified opportunities for CMS to introduce additional  payment method refinements and controls in Medicare FFS to  encourage appropriate use of services. For example, self-referral,  where a provider refers patients to entities in which the provider or the  provider\u2019s family has a financial interest, continues to be a concern for  advanced imaging services. GAO\u2019s analysis showed that providers\u2019  referrals of advanced imaging services substantially increased once  they start to self-refer. GAO estimated that such additional referrals  cost more than $100 million in 1 year. Further, although Medicare\u2019s  payment system gives hospitals an incentive to seek the best price for  implantable medical devices (IMD), GAO determined that hospitals  may vary in their ability to do so. The lack of price transparency and  variation in amounts hospitals pay for some IMDs\u2014and may pass on  to the Medicare program\u2014raise questions about whether hospitals  are achieving the best prices possible.", "For the MA program, CMS has made progress implementing required  adjustments to plan payments to align them more closely with the cost  of care in the traditional Medicare program. However, in a January  2012 report, GAO indicated that CMS could still improve the accuracy  of payments to MA plans. The payment adjustment CMS makes to  MA plans to account for differences in diagnostic coding between MA  plans and Medicare FFS was $2.7 billion in 2010 while GAO\u2019s  estimate was that a more accurate adjustment would have been  between $3.9 billion and $5.8 billion. In another report on MA plans,  GAO reviewed a demonstration CMS established to test an alternative  bonus payment structure. This demonstration is estimated to cost  more than $8.3 billion over 10 years and offsets a significant portion of  the MA payment reductions made by the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as amended, during its 3-year time  frame. GAO identified significant shortcomings in the demonstration\u2019s  design that preclude a credible evaluation of the effect of incentives  on plans\u2019 quality improvement. For this reason, GAO recommended  that the Secretary of Health and Human Services cancel the  demonstration and implement the quality bonus payments provided  for under the PPACA. HHS has continued the demonstration.", "Improving program management. CMS has overcome some  challenges in managing Medicare as it implemented some recent  program improvements. For example, GAO had previously reported  that Medicare sometimes overpaid for durable medical equipment  (DME) items relative to other payers. To achieve Medicare savings, in  2009 CMS began implementing a DME competitive bidding program.  In this program, CMS contracts with select suppliers to provide DME  to beneficiaries and pays them at competitively determined prices  based on the bids. GAO found that beneficiary access and  satisfaction appeared stable in early assessments, and the  competitive bidding program has led to savings. Similarly, in the past,  CMS was sometimes hampered in identifying situations when  Medicare should be the secondary payer, and the Medicare,  Medicaid, and State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Extension  Act of 2007 mandated reporting of such situations. Since CMS\u2019s  implementation of the mandatory reporting for non-group health plans,  program savings increased by $124 million from 2008 through 2011.", "CMS has improved its overall guidance and oversight of contracts, an  area where GAO found pervasive internal control weaknesses in 2009  that put billions of taxpayers\u2019 dollars at risk. Improvements include  adding internal controls and testing the agency\u2019s review of contract  payments, adding new checklists and policies to document  compliance with federal acquisition requirements, and enhancing its  policies and procedures for tracking, investigating, and resolving  contract audit and evaluation findings.", "Enhancing program integrity. The Administration and CMS have made  reducing improper payments one of their priority initiatives. CMS has  made progress in error rate measurement and in 2011 was able to  report the error rate for all Medicare components for the first time,  including the prescription drug benefit (Part D). CMS\u2019s performance  plan has set targets for percentages of improper payments, with the  targets slightly lower in each year. However, as reported in 2012, the  rate of improper payments in FFS and Part C exceeded CMS\u2019s target  rates. Thus, additional efforts will be needed to further reduce  improper payments in FFS and Part C.", "CMS has also taken steps to try to strengthen Medicare program  integrity and reduce vulnerabilities to improper payment, but some  problems have yet to be fully addressed. For example, GAO\u2019s  previous work found persistent weaknesses in Medicare\u2019s enrollment  standards and procedures that increased the risk of providing billing  privileges to entities intent on defrauding the program. CMS has  implemented provisions in PPACA designed to strengthen provider  enrollment procedures in several ways, such as designating risk  levels for categories of providers and applying different screening  procedures for providers at each level. In addition, CMS contracted  with two new entities at the end of 2011 to assume centralized  responsibility for automated screening of provider and supplier  enrollment and for conducting site visits of providers. However, CMS  has not completed other actions required by this legislation, including  (1) determining which providers will be required to post surety bonds  to help ensure the recovery of payments made for fraudulent billing,  (2) contracting for fingerprint screening services for high-risk  providers, (3) issuing a final regulation to require providers to disclose  additional information, and (4) establishing core elements for provider  compliance programs.", "CMS also has implemented the Fraud Prevention System (FPS),  which uses analytic methods to examine claims before payment to  help identify and prioritize investigations of potential fraud.  Specifically, FPS analyzes Medicare claims data using models of  potentially fraudulent behavior, which results in automatic alerts on  specific claims and providers. These alerts are then prioritized for  program integrity analysts to review and investigate as appropriate.  According to program integrity officials, FPS is intended to help  facilitate the agency\u2019s shift from focusing on recovering fraudulent  payments after they have been made, to taking actions more quickly  when aberrant billing patterns are identified. However, the system is  not fully integrated with CMS\u2019s existing information-technology  systems, and CMS has not defined and measured quantifiable  benefits and performance goals for it. In addition, GAO reported in  2011 that CMS had not incorporated all the data into its Integrated  Data Repository, as planned, which limited the repository\u2019s use for  identifying potentially fraudulent claims.", "Overseeing patient care and safety. For some of the most vulnerable  beneficiaries\u2014those in nursing homes\u2014weaknesses remain in  oversight of the quality of care, although CMS has taken steps to  improve the oversight. For example, CMS contracts with state survey  agencies to investigate complaints about nursing homes and helps  ensure the adequacy of complaint processes by issuing guidance,  monitoring data that state survey agencies enter into CMS\u2019s  database, and annually assessing state agencies\u2019 performance  against specific standards. However, CMS has found that states had  difficulties meeting some of its standards for their complaint  processes. CMS has taken steps to address GAO\u2019s recommendations  to improve nursing home oversight, such as strengthening  enforcement against nursing homes that have provided poor quality  care and by increasing the number of facilities that will be subject to  more intensive oversight and sanctions.", "To provide information to consumers and improve provider quality, in  2008, CMS implemented the Five-Star Quality Rating System, which  assigns each nursing home an overall rating and three component  ratings\u2014health inspections, staffing, and quality measures\u2014based on  the extent to which the nursing home meets CMS\u2019s quality standards  and other measures. However, CMS lacks GAO-identified leading  strategic planning practices\u2014the use of milestones and timelines to  guide and gauge progress toward desired results and the alignment of  activities, resources, and goals\u2014that could help it more efficiently and  effectively improve the Five-Star System."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Remains to Be Done", "paragraphs": ["CMS has not met GAO\u2019s criteria to have the Medicare program removed  from the High-Risk List.

Both Congress and the administration have demonstrated commitment  and leadership to making Medicaid fiscal and program integrity a priority.  In 2012, committees in Congress held hearings on reducing Medicaid  improper payments and on improving oversight of the program. HHS  continues to review and report on the rate of Medicaid improper  payments, and continues to train and provide technical assistance to  states on approaches to prevent improper payments. Among other  actions, CMS issued guidance to states on removing providers from their  Medicaid programs who have been terminated for committing fraud in  other states\u2019 Medicaid programs or in Medicare, and required improved  reporting and independent audits of states\u2019 Medicaid supplemental  payments made to certain providers known as disproportionate share  hospitals. However, stronger federal oversight of Medicaid is warranted  as the program continues to grow in size and spending. For example,  potential Medicaid expansions under PPACA are estimated to result in  the enrollment of about 7 million additional individuals in 2014, growing to  11 million in 2022. The federal government is responsible for paying more  than 90 percent of the increased costs associated with this expansion.", "CMS will need new tools and resources as the law is implemented,  including more reliable data for assessing expenditures, measuring  performance, and preventing improper payments. Areas where program  oversight has been insufficient include the following:  Improper payments to Medicaid providers serving program  beneficiaries. Improper payments to providers who submit  inappropriate claims can result in substantial financial losses to states  and the federal government. In its 2012 financial report, HHS  estimated\u2014on the basis of individual state error rates from a sample  of 17 states reviewed on an annual rotating basis\u2014a national  improper payment rate for Medicaid of 7.1 percent (with the federal  share estimated at $19.2 billion).", "Positive steps toward improving transparency and reducing improper  payments have been taken in recent years. In May 2011, CMS issued  guidance to states on processes to remove providers from their  program when the providers have been terminated from another  state\u2019s Medicaid program or terminated from Medicare as required by  PPACA. In addition, CMS has committed to (1) redesigning its  national Medicaid audit program, which relied on data that were  incomplete, unreliable, and untimely, and, as a result cost significantly  more than the potential overpayments it identified; and (2) using its  comprehensive reviews of state integrity program activities to better  target audits toward states with significant weaknesses in their ability  to detect overpayments. Separate from this initiative, CMS is also  testing the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of establishing a fraud  prevention system for Medicaid by April 1, 2015; however key  challenges remain, including improving key data systems so that they  provide reliable and complete data needed to implement effective  programs to identify and prevent improper payments; eliminating  duplication between CMS and state program integrity efforts; and  refocusing national audit efforts on approaches that are cost-effective.", "Financing methods that are inappropriate, and large supplemental  payments that are not always transparent. Some states have  established varied financing arrangements involving Medicaid  supplemental payments that inappropriately increase federal Medicaid  matching payments. The total amount of supplemental payments has  increased in recent years. In fiscal year 2011, states reported  spending at least $43 billion, up from $32 billion in fiscal year 2010  and $23 billion in fiscal year 2006. GAO and others have reported  concerns with states\u2019 Medicaid supplemental payments over the last  decade, including the use of supplemental payment arrangements to  increase federal funding without a commensurate increase in state  funding, and concerns that the payments were not used for Medicaid  purposes. Large increases in reported supplemental payments have  been identified as a major factor that contributed to increased  Medicaid spending on hospital services in 2010.", "A variety of federal legislative, regulatory, and CMS actions have  helped curb inappropriate arrangements, but gaps remain. In 2003,  CMS began an initiative to closely review state supplemental  payments and required states to end those it found inappropriate;  however, in 2008, GAO reported that CMS had not reviewed all  supplemental payment arrangements to ensure payments were  appropriate and were for Medicaid purposes. Starting in 2010, CMS  implemented new transparency and accountability requirements for  certain Medicaid supplemental payments, known as Disproportionate  Share Hospital (DSH) payments, including new reporting and auditing  requirements for these payments. In 2012, GAO found that the new  requirements improve CMS\u2019s ability to oversee DSH payments by  better assuring that states comply with federal requirements, including  accurate calculation of payment amounts to ensure payments are not  excessive. However, similar standards for calculating, reporting, and  auditing of other types of Medicaid supplemental payments\u2014referred  to here as non-DSH supplemental payments\u2014have not been  established even though these payments have increased significantly  in recent years and exceeded DSH supplemental payments in total  amounts. Although Medicaid payments are not limited to the costs of  delivering Medicaid services, Medicaid payments that greatly exceed  Medicaid costs raise questions about the purpose of the payments,  how payments relate to Medicaid services, whether payments are  consistent with economy and efficiency, and whether payments  contribute to beneficiaries\u2019 access to quality care.", "Managed care rate setting and quality of data used to set such rates  has not been consistently reviewed by CMS. Requirements for  Medicaid managed care rates to be actuarially sound are key  safeguards in efforts to ensure that federal spending is appropriate. In  2010, GAO reported that CMS had been inconsistent in ensuring that  states are complying with the actuarial soundness requirements.  Further, GAO found that CMS efforts were not sufficient to ensure the  quality of the data used by states to set managed care rates. With  limited information on data quality, CMS cannot ensure that states\u2019  managed care rates are appropriate, which places billions of dollars at  risk for misspending.", "Demonstrations that inappropriately increase federal costs. HHS has  the authority to waive certain statutory provisions to allow states to  implement demonstrations that test ideas for achieving program  objectives. By policy, demonstrations should not increase federal  costs. However, GAO reported in 2008 that HHS had approved two  state demonstrations that could substantially increase the federal  financial liability. At the time of GAO\u2019s work in 2007, HHS disagreed  with GAO\u2019s recommendation to improve the demonstration review  process through steps such as clarifying the criteria for reviewing and  approving states\u2019 proposed spending limits, and ensuring that valid  methods were used to demonstrate budget neutrality.  Consequentially, GAO elevated this recommendation to Congress for  consideration. HHS subsequently reported taking steps, such as  monitoring the spending under ongoing approved demonstrations, to  improve its oversight; however, as of December 2012, HHS had not  planned on any changes in the criteria and methods used to  determine budget neutrality of demonstrations prior to approving  them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Remains to Be Done", "paragraphs": ["Congress, HHS, and CMS have taken steps to improve the fiscal integrity  of Medicaid, and CMS has implemented certain GAO recommendations,  such as improving the information collected on certain supplemental  payments and issuing guidance to states to better prevent payment of  improper claims.

For example, CMS oversight of program  integrity has been challenged by data systems that do not provide  reliable, complete, and timely data. States also have key roles in reducing  improper payments to providers in developing, implementing, and  evaluating the effectiveness of corrective plans to reduce improper  payments.", "CMS should also continue taking steps to improve oversight of Medicaid  managed care payment rate-setting and Medicaid supplemental  payments. In November 2012, GAO suggested that Congress require  CMS to take certain steps to improve the transparency of and  accountability for Medicaid non-DSH supplemental payments, including  requiring improved reporting and independent audits of these payments.
