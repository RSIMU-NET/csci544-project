Twenty-three states have implemented some variation of a family cap, breaking the traditional link between a family's size and the amount of its monthly welfare check. Generally, these states implemented family cap policies as part of their welfare reforms to reduce out-of-wedlock births and to encourage self-sufficiency. During an average month in 2000, 20 of the 23 family cap states reported that about 108,000 families received less in cash benefits than they would have in the absence of state-imposed family cap policies. In an average month, about nine percent of welfare families in these states had their benefits affected by the family cap. A family's welfare benefits are affected by several factors, including earnings and receipt of child support. Therefore, states were unable to report the precise effect of the family cap on benefits.

States have increased flexibility to design and implement programs to achieve the TANF goals, including reducing the dependence of needy families on government aid, and preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies. During discussions on welfare reform, the proportion of births that were out-of-wedlock in the United States began to decline after rising for over half a century. The potential negative consequences of out-of-wedlock births are numerous, including increasing the probability of dependence on welfare and also increasing the amount of time on assistance once enrolled.", "In an effort to reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies among welfare recipients, some states have imposed family caps on welfare benefits.

In states with a family cap policy, however, no additional cash benefits are provided when the birth of a child increases the size of the family. To provide you with information on family cap policies and their effects, you requested that we (1) identify the states that have family caps as a part of their TANF programs and describe how the caps are implemented; (2) determine the number of families whose benefits have been affected by the family cap and estimate the amount by which the family cap has altered a family\u2019s cash benefits; and (3) using existing studies, determine what is known about the effect of the family cap on out-of-wedlock births, abortions, and poverty. In conducting this work, we also reviewed HHS\u2019 research agenda to assess whether it supported the TANF goal of preventing and reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies.", "To identify states with family caps on TANF benefits, we obtained a list of such states from the Regional Directors of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees TANF at the federal level, and then conducted a phone survey with these states to discern how they implemented the family cap. To determine the impact of the family cap on benefits, we gathered data from TANF data specialists in these states. To assess the impact of the family cap on out-of-wedlock births, we identified and reviewed studies that examined family caps. In our review, we assessed the extent to which each study provided evidence for an effect of the family cap on out-of-wedlock births and other outcomes. In addition, we spoke with and collected information from HHS officials on the Department\u2019s TANF-related research efforts. We conducted our work from July 2000 through September 2001, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The legislation ended the legal entitlement to cash assistance for eligible needy families with children and focused on helping needy families move toward economic independence. As specified in PRWORA, the goals of TANF are   providing assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their own homes or in the homes of relatives;   ending the dependence of needy parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work and marriage;   preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and   encouraging the formation and maintenance of two-parent families.", "PRWORA places a 5-year time limit (or less at state option) on federal cash assistance for most families\u2014and requires states to impose federally established work and other program requirements on most adults receiving aid. Otherwise, the Act gives states broad flexibility to establish their own eligibility rules and the types of services provided. In fiscal year 2000, total TANF expenditures equaled almost $23.6 billion, more than half in federal dollars. About 5.8 million recipients received TANF cash assistance in September of that year."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "PRWORA Emphasizes Reducing the Incidence of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing", "paragraphs": ["In addition to establishing a key TANF goal related to reducing out-of- wedlock pregnancies, the Congress, through PRWORA, established a \u201cBonus to Reward Decrease in Illegitimacy Ratio\u201d so that HHS could reward states that showed the greatest reduction in out-of-wedlock births while decreasing their abortion rates. States win this bonus based on these reductions for the general population, not just the welfare population. In each of fiscal years 1999 through 2002, up to $100 million is available to the five states that achieve the largest reductions. HHS also requires states to set goals to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies. Each state has to submit a TANF plan that includes the state\u2019s strategy for preventing and reducing the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies. This plan must also include an explanation of how the state intends to establish numerical goals for reducing out-of-wedlock births. PRWORA also authorized the National Strategy to Prevent Teen Pregnancy and the Abstinence Education Grant Program to help meet the TANF goal of reducing out-of- wedlock births. PRWORA authorized federal expenditures of $50 million annually, beginning in fiscal year 1998, to support state efforts promoting abstinence education.", "PRWORA\u2019s emphasis on reducing out-of-wedlock childbearing, among other goals, results from congressional concerns about the negative consequences of out-of-wedlock births on the mother, the child, and the family. The percentage of out-of-wedlock births among the total population has increased dramatically, from 3.8 percent in 1940 to 32.6 percent in 1994, although from 1994 to 1999 it remained around 33 percent. While there are still questions about the extent of the consequences of out- of-wedlock childbearing, research shows that children born out of wedlock are much more likely to be poor and receive welfare than children born to married parents. More specifically, among children living with single mothers, children born outside of wedlock are 1.7 times more likely to be poor than are those born to married parents. In addition, research shows that women aged 17 and under who give birth outside of marriage are more likely to go on public assistance and spend more years on assistance once enrolled. For example, over three-quarters of all unmarried teenage mothers began receiving cash benefits from the AFDC program within five years of the birth of their first child.", "The potential link between welfare receipt and non-marital childbearing has been of interest to policymakers and researchers for several years, particularly as the number of never-married mothers receiving welfare has increased, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of all families on welfare. Studies have been conducted to understand what role, if any, the amount of welfare benefits plays in a woman\u2019s decision to have a child. The results of studies examining the effects of various welfare benefit amounts on fertility and marriage have been mixed. A recent summary of this research found that a slight majority of studies have concluded that receiving welfare has led to a decrease in marriage and an increase in childbearing.", "In the early to mid-1990s, before federal welfare reform, some states responded to concerns about links between welfare and childbearing by seeking waivers from federal AFDC rules to implement their own policies to eliminate increased cash welfare grants for families who have additional children while on welfare. This \u201ccapping\u201d of cash grants became known as the family cap. During the 2 years of debate over how to reform welfare and address the issue of rising rates of out-of-wedlock births, one version of the welfare legislation contained a family cap. PRWORA, the final welfare reform legislation passed in 1996, emphasized decreasing out-of- wedlock birth rates but remained silent on the family cap, leaving implementation decisions regarding family cap policy to the states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PRWORA Specifies a Research Role for HHS in the New Devolved Welfare System", "paragraphs": ["Although PRWORA devolved considerable authority to the states to design and implement their own welfare programs, HHS retains some program oversight and research responsibilities. Generally, the law narrowed HHS\u2019 regulatory authority, as compared to its authority under AFDC. For example, PRWORA specifically limits HHS from regulating the conduct of states, except as expressly provided in the law. HHS is responsible for administering statutory penalties for states\u2019 noncompliance with the law, and for developing and administering the high performance bonuses and Bonus to Reward Decrease in Illegitimacy Ratio established in PRWORA to reward states that achieve certain goals of the law. In addition, HHS is responsible and receives funding for conducting research on the benefits, effects, and costs of state TANF programs and for disseminating information among states and localities. This research role differs from the one HHS played in the past, when a state wishing to experiment with any departure from federal AFDC rules had to request a waiver from HHS, and HHS had to ensure that the waiver request included plans for a rigorous evaluation of the state\u2019s experiment. In fact, some of the effectiveness studies of the family cap that we reviewed in this report were conducted as required evaluations of policies implemented under waiver of AFDC rules.

States implement the family cap in one of three ways: a full family cap on benefits, a partial family cap on benefits, or a flat grant that applies to all TANF families. States implemented the family cap policy to reduce out-of- wedlock births and encourage self-sufficiency, with 15 states implementing the family cap policy under a waiver to the AFDC program and eight states implementing the policy after welfare reform. Most states with a family cap policy exempt families from the cap if special circumstances exist. For example, children born as the result of sexual assault, rape, or incest are exempt from the family cap in 18 states.

As Figure 1 shows, 19 states employ a full family cap. In these states a family\u2019s cash grant is not increased by any amount with the birth of an additional child. For example, in Arizona, if a family of two receiving a monthly maximum grant of $275 per month had an additional child, their cash benefit would be capped at this amount. The family would not receive the $72 increase in benefits, which would have otherwise raised their grant amount to $347\u2014the maximum grant for three person families. Two states have a family cap that is implemented as a partial increase in cash benefits with the birth of an additional child. For example, one state with the partial family cap increases by 50 percent the cash benefits the family would have received without the family cap for only the first child born to a family after they enrolled in assistance; the benefit cap becomes a full family cap for any subsequent children born into the family. Two other states use a flat grant to provide cash benefits to families. This policy creates an implicit benefit cap because cash benefits are the same for all families on assistance regardless of family size or the birth of an additional child. For example, in Wisconsin families receive either $628 or $673 per month. Their benefit amount depends on the work program component to which they have been assigned, rather than on family size.", "States implemented the family cap policies before and after federal welfare reform, often with the goals of decreasing out-of-wedlock births and encouraging self-sufficiency. For example, one state implemented the family cap based on the goal of encouraging parents to plan for security and assume responsibility for their children.

In addition, states commonly exempt children not living with their biological parents. This exemption typically occurs when the custody of the child is legally transferred or the parent is deceased, incarcerated or incapacitated. Most states exempt families who leave assistance for a specified period of time, give birth to a child, and return to the rolls, that is, they become pregnant \u201cbetween spells.\u201d Some state officials we spoke with expressed concern about this exemption because of the potential that families are circumventing the family cap on benefits by leaving assistance and reapplying once a new child is born.", "Six states have other exemptions to the family cap.

These policies increase the amount of cash income for the households with a working adult. Three of the states with a family cap policy ignore an even larger portion of a family\u2019s income after the family\u2019s benefits are capped.

These variations could be caused by differences in state\u2019 various exemption policies and practices, or whether states have their own time- limits for cash assistance.  Variations could also be due to differences in when states implemented the family cap.

Our estimate represented an average dollar amount of approximately $100 per month\u2014representing a range from $20 in Wyoming to $121 in California. These estimates may somewhat overstate the amount by which families benefits are affected because the estimates are based upon the maximum cash benefit a TANF family is eligible to receive, which is generally greater than the average amount of cash assistance families actually receive. Overall, the average level of cash assistance for three person families whose benefits were affected by the family cap was $394 per month in federal fiscal year 2000. Depending on the state and based on maximum benefit levels, we estimated that families received between six percent (in Wyoming) to 26 percent (in Illinois) less in cash assistance due to the family cap.

Consequently, the cap\u2019s total effect on household income is difficult to determine. To some extent, the family cap\u2019s financial impact is offset by an increase in food stamp benefits. Because food stamp benefit calculations take into account unearned income (i.e., TANF cash assistance) and family size, capped-benefit families would receive more in monthly food stamp benefits than they would if they were not capped. In addition, a capped-benefit family may receive more child support or retain more of its earnings than it would without the cap, due to the state level policies specific to capped-benefit families discussed previously.

For example, PRWORA placed more emphasis on work requirements to encourage recipients to be self-sufficient and also allowed states to have more flexibility in implementing policies such as family caps, which also encourage self-sufficiency through the goal of reducing out-of-wedlock births. In such cases, it would be difficult to separate the combined effects of the various policies into the individual effects of each on the number of out-of-wedlock births.", "Another major difficulty with studying the effects of family caps on the number of out-of-wedlock births is separating the family caps\u2019 effect from societal changes occurring between 1991 and 1997.

The period in which these declining birth rates occurred overlapped with the period in which family caps were implemented. Since this overall decline began before any family caps were in effect, we can safely assume that this trend began independent of family cap implementation. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle the true effect that the family cap policies may have had on declining birth rates from the effect of these national declines.", "Another barrier to understanding the effects of the family cap is the limited availability of needed information from national data sets for studying specific welfare policies relating to out-of-wedlock births.

Since the enactment of PROWRA, HHS has used its research authority and resources to encourage and support evaluations of various welfare program approaches and features. As described in its Third Annual Report to the Congress on the TANF program, August 2000, HHS\u2019 research agenda has two main goals: (1) to increase the probability of success of welfare reform by providing timely, reliable data to inform policy and program design, especially at the state and local level where decision making has devolved; and (2) to inform the nation of policies chosen and their effects on children, families, communities and social well-being. Within this research agenda, as shown in table 4, in fiscal year 2000, HHS spent about $26 million on research and technical assistance projects. These projects include studies on the relative effectiveness of various approaches to moving welfare recipients into employment, the well-being of children of parents enrolled in welfare- to-work programs, and the effectiveness of job retention strategies for welfare recipients who become employed.", "Although most of the studies and research focus on employment-related issues, HHS does support some research related to the TANF goal of reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies. For example, some of the evaluations begun under waivers as well as a few studies of families who have left welfare have gathered some information relating to the family cap and out-of-wedlock pregnancies among welfare recipients. In addition, HHS has been involved with a significant initiative aimed at reducing teenage pregnancy, has funded research projects related to helping young adults avoid premature sexual activity and unintended pregnancies, and has just recently begun a project involving interventions for unwed parents at the time of their child\u2019s birth. HHS is also involved in a major on-going evaluation of abstinence education programs designed to strengthen the research base and public knowledge about promoting abstinence among youth and the benefits of various approaches. Moreover, in fiscal year 2000, HHS has taken steps to increase the availability of information related to out-of-wedlock childbearing activities by requiring states to include information on their strategies for reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies in their TANF annual reports. HHS also requires states to report data on the incidence of out-of-wedlock births among the TANF caseload. This new information may help HHS, states, and researchers share information on promising approaches to reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies and contribute to a state\u2019s ability to qualify for the Bonus to Reward Decrease in Illegitimacy Ratio.", "Even with the research under way and the steps HHS has recently taken, additional efforts may prove useful in, for example, improving data availability, conducting implementation studies, and striving to improve effectiveness studies. In our recently completed comprehensive review of the data available to assess states\u2019 progress in meeting TANF\u2019s goals, we found limited information regarding the goal of reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, particularly in comparison to the more widely available information related to helping welfare parents reduce their dependence on welfare through job preparation and employment. In some ways this is not surprising, given that states have focused their efforts on helping welfare recipients find employment and become economically independent. One expert said that states have focused their efforts on employment because much more is known about effective strategies for moving welfare recipients into work than is known about strategies for reducing births. Another expert believes that states have focused more on employment goals because more consensus exists about the role of government in helping welfare recipients become employed than about its role in influencing people\u2019s childbearing decisions. HHS could play an important role in encouraging and supporting additional research in this area to support states\u2019 efforts in meeting TANF goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["In the new and evolving welfare environment created by PRWORA, states have tremendous flexibility to design and implement strategies to meet four key TANF goals: providing assistance to needy families; ending dependence on government aid through job preparation, employment, and marriage; preventing and reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and promoting two-parent families. States have moved ahead with strategies designed to move welfare recipients into employment, an area where much research exists providing useful information about what works best and for whom. While states have been much less active in implementing strategies to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, the use of family cap policies does show interest among states in meeting this congressionally- established goal. Yet, policymakers and program administrators have limited information available to help in understanding the effectiveness of the family cap or to aid in devising and implementing other strategies that may prove effective in reducing out-of-wedlock births. While overcoming the inherent difficulties in assessing the effectiveness of family cap policies and other approaches in the new welfare environment may be challenging, taking steps to improve data availability, conduct implementation studies, and improve effectiveness studies would be useful. State, local, and federal program administrators and policymakers would be well served by a stronger research base upon which to draw information on a range of effective strategies for reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies.", "Even though the new welfare system is highly decentralized, PRWORA explicitly charged HHS with conducting research on state TANF programs, and HHS has played an important role in identifying and disseminating information on effective strategies for meeting welfare reform goals, with a particular focus on TANF\u2019s employment-related goal. HHS also has supported some research that addresses effective strategies for accomplishing the goal of reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies. In addition, HHS has taken steps to ensure that more data will be available from states on births to welfare recipients and on strategies that states have implemented to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies. Still, if HHS strengthened its efforts in this area and improved the research base, it could enhance states\u2019 efforts to address this TANF goal. Moreover, if HHS submits information on its research agenda and efforts with estimated resource needs to the Congress, the Congress will have useful information to use as it considers TANF reauthorization and related research needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations to the Secretary of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of HHS review its research agenda and, if appropriate, take steps to identify, encourage, and support additional studies that would increase the availability of information on how best to prevent and reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies and more fully support the goals of TANF. This additional work could include improving the availability of data to support studies, working with states to identify and disseminate information on relevant promising practices, and supporting rigorous evaluation studies. Having additional research in this area would provide important information to administrators and policymakers and support the Congress\u2019 efforts to reward states for strategies that succeed in reducing out-of-wedlock births.", "We also recommend that HHS provide its research agenda, with estimated resource needs, to the Congress for its use as it considers TANF reauthorization, including decisions about the role of HHS in conducting research and the resources HHS needs to fulfill that role. This will help to ensure that the key research and technical assistance needs of this $16.5 billion federal program are met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided HHS with an opportunity to comment on the report.  HHS agreed with our conclusion that available research does not address the effect of family cap policies and said that the report addressed an important topic.  A copy of HHS\u2019 response is in appendix III.  We also incorporated technical comments we received from HHS where appropriate.", "Regarding our recommendation about the need for more research on effective strategies for reducing out-of-wedlock births, HHS agreed that more research is needed, but noted that additional detail in the report on the methodological limitations of existing research would be helpful for understanding the significance of the existing studies and for individuals thinking about additional research.  We believe the level of discussion on limitations in the report, including the appendix, is sufficient to address the focus of this report\u2014what conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of the family cap from existing research--and to point to ways to improve studies on the family cap. Regarding our second recommendation that HHS provide its research agenda to the Congress for its use as it considers TANF reauthorization, HHS noted that it already has in place several mechanisms for keeping the Congress informed about its welfare research activities.  These include annual reports to the Congress on its study of the outcomes of welfare reform with brief descriptions of welfare outcomes projects planned for funding each year, a chapter describing its research agenda in the annual TANF report to the Congress, and briefings to interested congressional staff upon request.  We are aware of these information sources and believe they provide important information to the Congress.  However, we continue to believe that it would be useful for HHS to provide its research agenda to the key authorizing committees for the TANF program, with estimated resource needs, in a form designed specifically to aid the Congress in TANF reauthorization would serve a useful purpose.", "HHS also expressed concern that readers might get an unnecessarily narrow view of the strategies available to address the goal of reducing out- of-wedlock pregnancies because the report focuses solely on family cap policies and research.  As HHS noted, the TANF goal of preventing and reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies addresses the overall population, not just welfare families, and only a modest portion of out-of-wedlock births is attributable to the welfare population.  Yet, family cap policies focus by definition on welfare families. We agree that this is an important point and that other strategies can address the goal of reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, such as the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, which we mentioned in the report.  While a comprehensive review of the research related to strategies to reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies was not the focus of this report, we did look beyond research on the family cap to assess whether HHS\u2019 welfare-related research agenda supported the broad goal of preventing and reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies and concluded that more research on strategies for addressing this goal, including those beyond the family cap, could play an important role in encouraging states efforts in this area.  As suggested by HHS, we added a reference to the recently completed review of evaluation research related to reducing teen pregnancy.", "We also provided the draft report to two experts on welfare research, who agreed with our findings and overall conclusions.

Not all states were able to give us this information by family size.

(See table 5.)", "To determine the average monthly cash benefit for three person capped- benefit families, we asked states for the average monthly cash benefit level for families affected by the cap by family size.
