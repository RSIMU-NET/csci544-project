DOD's report addressed, among other things, the requirement to describe procedures for allocating enlisted aide authorizations, and the objective to reduce by 40 the maximum number of enlisted aides authorized and allocated. GAO determined that DOD partially addressed the requirement to justify enlisted aide authorizations on a billet-by-billet basis because DOD did not provide an explanation for each individual enlisted aide, and because some data were not from September 30, 2014, as was required.", "DOD's methodology for identifying enlisted aide duties is consistent with guidance, and its methodology for allocating enlisted aides is consistent with relevant statute. However, DOD's methodologies for allocating and justifying aides are not consistent with all DOD guidance. DOD's stated methodology for allocating enlisted aide authorizations is consistent with the authorization formula and cap in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 981 by first satisfying Joint Staff needs and then allocating the remaining authorizations among the military services according to a \u201cfair share\u201d percentage basis. However, this methodology is not based on validated personnel requirements, as DOD guidance requires, and DOD has not applied it to reallocate enlisted aide authorizations since 2010, resulting in a disproportionate distribution of authorizations. DOD officials stated that they have not assessed DOD-wide requirements in part due to the limited timeframe for developing DOD's report, and that they have not reallocated authorizations since 2010 because they were rewriting their enlisted aide guidance and anticipated changes to the statutory formula for determining enlisted aide authorizations. Without periodically assessing enlisted aide requirements and updating allocations, DOD cannot reasonably ensure that these resources are properly matched to its changing needs. In addition, the justifications included in DOD's report vary and are subjective, and it is unclear how duties and workload support enlisted aide assignments. For instance, a 4-star Joint Staff general hosts 150-200 official representational events per year and is assigned one enlisted aide, while a 3-star Army general hosts 3 events per year but is also assigned one aide. Without additional guidance to determine enlisted aide workload, military service and Joint Staff decisions regarding authorizations and assignments may not be consistent and transparent.", "Certain data DOD used in its report were inaccurate or incomplete and therefore not reliable. For example, justification data from the Army, the Navy, and the Joint Staff did not reflect enlisted aide authorizations and assignments as of September 30, 2014, as was required. Also, several justifications did not align with the number of aides authorized or assigned to a general or flag officer billet. DOD officials stated they had no reason to doubt military service and Joint Staff data, but without a process for assessing reliability DOD does not have reasonable assurance that data it used to determine enlisted aide reductions were accurate, and Congress and senior DOD leaders may not have reliable data in future enlisted aide reports on which to base decisions on enlisted aides."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD assess DOD-wide enlisted aide requirements, reallocate enlisted aide authorizations, establish criteria for determining enlisted aide workload, and establish a process for assessing the reliability of data in future enlisted aide reports.

Enlisted aides are a resource to assist  GFOs with minor tasks\u2014such as maintaining uniforms\u2014that if performed  by the officers themselves would be at the expense of the officers\u2019  primary military and official duties and responsibilities. Congressional  committees have previously raised questions over the costs of sustaining  the GFO population\u2014including those costs associated with enlisted  aides\u2014and Congress has imposed a ceiling on the total number of  enlisted personnel who may be assigned or detailed as enlisted aides on  the personal staffs of GFOs. In September 2014, we found that the  military services track the numbers and costs associated with enlisted  aides to varying extents and recommended that DOD finalize a biannual  reporting requirement related to the tracking of these aides within the  department. DOD concurred with this recommendation and included a  reporting requirement related to the tracking of enlisted aides in its  updated enlisted aide instruction. Subsequently, section 504 of the Carl  Levin and Howard P. \u201cBuck\u201d McKeon National Defense Authorization Act  (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2015 required DOD to produce and submit to the  Committees on Armed Services a series of reports on enlisted aides.", "DOD\u2019s annual enlisted aide report, due no later than March 1 of each  year, is to specify the number of enlisted aides authorized and  allocated\u2014as of September 30 of the previous year\u2014to GFOs of the  Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Joint Staff, and  to justify on a billet-by-billet basis the authorization and assignment of  each enlisted aide to each GFO position. A second, one-time report, due  no later than June 30, 2015, was to include a list of authorized and  necessary official military and official representational duties for enlisted  aides in the military services and the Joint Staff, procedures for allocating  enlisted aides among and within the military services and the Joint Staff,  a billet-by-billet justification for the authorization and assignment of each  enlisted aide to each GFO position, and recommendations for changing  the statutory method for calculating the authorized number of enlisted  aides. Congress further directed DOD as an overall reporting objective to  reduce by 40 the maximum number of enlisted aides authorized and  allocated to GFOs, subject to a validation of duties and billet-by-billet  justifications. DOD responded to this reporting requirement by submitting  a report on June 30, 2015, to the congressional defense committees.", "Section 504 of the NDAA for fiscal year 2015 also included a provision for  us to review DOD\u2019s June 2015 enlisted aide report.

However, OUSD P&R kept the allocations for the Army  (81) and Marine Corps (21) the same as in fiscal year 2010, resulting in  the Army receiving approximately 96 percent of its hypothetical maximum  authorization for fiscal year 2014. OUSD P&R officials told us that they  have not reallocated enlisted aide authorizations since 2010 because  they were revising their primary enlisted aide instruction and because  they anticipated changes to the statutory formula for determining  maximum enlisted aide authorizations. Figure 1 depicts the Joint Staff\u2019s  and each of the military services fiscal year 2014 allocations\u2014unchanged  since the fiscal year 2010 allocation\u2014under the statutory cap in relation  to its hypothetical maximum authorizations in fiscal year 2014, according  to the formula in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7981(a).", "As previously mentioned, DOD\u2019s report calls for the reduction of 48  enlisted aides and for lowering the statutory cap of enlisted aides from  300 to 252. Specifically, DOD\u2019s proposal would reduce the number of  enlisted aides in the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, and the Joint Staff by  between 10 and 14 positions each; the Marine Corps would not be  affected. According to an OUSD P&R official, the proposed reductions  would be made gradually over a 3-year period so as to not disrupt the  military services\u2019 abilities to support GFOs and maintain the needed  number of enlisted aides. Figure 2 shows DOD\u2019s proposed allocation of  enlisted aide authorizations under its proposed cap of 252 aides.", "According to DOD\u2019s June report, the proposed reduction was based on  extensive reviews of the billet-by-billet justifications by each military  service and the Joint Staff and additional input from members of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff. Additionally, an OUSD P&R official stated that the billet- by-billet justification process now in place for its annual enlisted aide  reports may create future opportunities to adjust military service  allocations. However, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2015 required billet-by- billet justifications for enlisted aide authorizations and assignments as of  September 30, 2014\u2014not total enlisted aide requirements. Additionally,  DOD\u2019s proposed enlisted aide reduction and allocation were based on its  existing \u201cfair share\u201d allocation, which has not been updated since 2010  and does not include an assessment of total DOD-wide enlisted aide  requirements.", "OUSD P&R officials stated that the military services expressed support  for receiving the proposed standard cap of enlisted aides over basing  allocations on requirements because it would provide continuity in year- to-year planning. Officials we spoke with from the Army, the Air Force,  and the Joint Staff confirmed their preference for a standard cap on the  number of enlisted aides allocated to their organizations, but officials from  the Navy and the Marine Corps stated that they would prefer a  requirements-based approach that better reflects service-level enlisted  aide needs. Specifically, Navy officials told us that they did not concur  with the department\u2019s proposed reduction and allocation because they  were based on the current enlisted aide allocation methodology\u2014which is  not consistent with how the military services assign enlisted aides\u2014and  because they focused on justifying current inventories and reducing  overall numbers instead of assessing requirements. Similarly, an official  from the Marine Corps stated that enlisted aide requirements should be  considered when determining enlisted aide allocations and that DOD  should quantify its enlisted aide needs.", "OUSD P&R officials stated that they are continuing to operate under the  existing statutory cap of 300 enlisted aides for fiscal year 2016, as well as  the same allocation of enlisted aides across the Joint Staff and the  military services. These officials noted also that all options are under  review for the next allocation and that they anticipate congressional input  to that process. As noted, the current statutory enlisted aide cap of 300  has been in place since 1976, at which point GFO authorizations stood at  1,141. Since that time, GFO authorizations have fallen to 962 in fiscal  year 2015, thus increasing the ratio of enlisted aides to GFOs. At the  same time, in recent years, DOD has created new organizations, such as  U.S. Cyber Command (2010) and the Defense Health Agency (2013),  which require additional GFOs for senior leadership positions. The U.S.  military has also reduced its presence in countries such as Iraq and  Afghanistan, but emerging challenges may continue to affect the level  and location of enlisted aide support needed to assist GFOs with meeting  their responsibilities related to building partnerships and ties throughout  the world. Such changes suggest that the current allocation and fair share  methodology may not be in line with actual enlisted aide requirements.  Without an assessment of enlisted aide requirements and periodic  reallocations of enlisted aide authorizations under the statutory cap, the  department cannot reasonably ensure that these resources are properly  matched to the needs of today\u2019s environment by equitably distributing  them across the military services and the Joint Staff and ensuring their  efficient and effective use."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Military Service and Joint Staff Justifications for Allocating Enlisted Aides Vary and Are Subjective", "paragraphs": ["Military service and Joint Staff justifications for enlisted aide  authorizations and assignments vary and are subjective, and it is unclear  how duties and workload support enlisted aide assignments, particularly  in cases where more than one enlisted aide is assigned to a single GFO.  DOD guidance for personnel management states that personnel  requirements should be driven by workload and established at the  minimum levels necessary to accomplish mission and performance  objectives. DOD\u2019s enlisted aide guidance generally requires that GFOs  reside in military housing in order to be assigned an enlisted aide and  describes enlisted aide duties as relating principally to maintaining the  care and cleanliness of GFO military housing and supporting qualifying  representational events. This guidance states also that the military  services and the Joint Staff should only authorize enlisted aides if the  official duties of the GFO position, including representational duties,  warrant enlisted aide support and that enlisted aide authorizations should  not be based solely on grade or title of a GFO position. OUSD P&R  instructed the military services and the Joint Staff to cite, to the extent  possible, the number of qualifying representational events and the size of  military housing used for hosting qualifying representational events when  developing their justifications for the June 2015 report. The billet-by- billet justifications in DOD\u2019s report commonly cited qualifying  representational events and GFO housing as reasons for enlisted aide  authorizations or assignments, but they did so inconsistently. For  example,  Justifications varied in whether they explicitly addressed GFO military  housing, qualifying representational events, or both.", "Justifications covering 289 of 290 assigned enlisted aides across  the military services and the Joint Staff mentioned enlisted aide  duties associated with qualifying representational events, but  justifications covering 78 enlisted aide assignments either did not  discuss housing or referenced it indirectly by discussing duties  associated with areas used for qualifying representational events,  which can be hosted inside or outside of the home, according to  OUSD P&R officials.", "Justifications varied in whether they quantified the size of GFO  military housing or number of qualifying representational events.", "Justifications for 76 of the Army\u2019s 79 enlisted aide assignments  specified the square footage of GFO housing, but justifications for  5 of 58 Navy enlisted aide assignments and 2 of 57 Joint Staff  enlisted aide assignments specified the square footage of GFO  housing.", "All 75 of the Air Force\u2019s assignment justifications specified the  number of qualifying representational events held annually by the  GFO, while the Joint Staff specified this number in 41 of its 57  assignment justifications.", "Justifications varied in how they supported enlisted aide assignments  based on the size of GFO military housing or the number of qualifying  representational events.", "Within the Army, two 4-star generals were each assigned two  enlisted aides, though one hosts 128 qualifying representational  events per year and resides in an 8,500-square-foot home, while  the other hosts 65 qualifying representational events and resides  in a 4,912-square-foot home. Similarly, two 2-star Army generals  were assigned one enlisted aide each, though one hosted 144  qualifying representational events and resided in a 3,957-square- foot home, and the other hosted 8 qualifying representational  events and resided in a 3,429-square-foot home.", "Within the Air Force, two 1-star generals were assigned one  enlisted aide each, though one hosts approximately 10 events per  year and resides in a 2,297-square-foot house, and the other  hosts 72 qualifying representational events per year and resides in  an 11,000-square-foot house.", "A 4-star general assigned to the Joint Staff hosts 150-200  qualifying representational events per year and is assigned one  enlisted aide, while an Army 3-star general hosts 3 qualifying  representational events per year but is also assigned one enlisted  aide.", "A 3-star Army general who resides in a 16,000-square-foot home  has two assigned enlisted aides, while a 4-star general officer  assigned to the Joint Staff resides in a 3,115-square-foot home  but also has two enlisted aides.", "OUSD P&R officials stated that they did not use specific criteria\u2014such as  quantitative thresholds\u2014to assess the sufficiency of justifications  submitted for DOD\u2019s June report and that authorization and assignment  decisions are subjective. An OUSD P&R official also stated that each of  the military services quantifies its enlisted aide needs differently, thus  complicating comparisons of military service justifications. Citing the  subjective nature of these decisions, officials from two of the military  services stated that there is a need for additional criteria for determining  enlisted aide authorizations or assignments. For example, Navy officials  stated that authorization and assignment determinations should be based  on factors such as the square footage of military housing, maintenance  hours, and the quantification and qualification (type of event and number  of attendees) of qualifying representational events. Similarly, a Marine  Corps official told us that the Marine Corps had proposed a working group  comprising military service representatives to identify weighted criteria for  the purpose of informing enlisted aide authorization and assignment  decisions.", "An OUSD P&R official stated that in developing the June 2015 report  OUSD P&R had considered developing a formula to help guide enlisted  aide authorization and assignment decisions but that doing so proved to  be too complicated because of the range of decisions that would have to  be made on the selection and weighting of potential criteria, such as the  number and nature of qualifying representational events, the square  footage of military housing, and GFO responsibilities. OUSD P&R officials  also stated that the revised DOD Instruction 1315.09 addressed the need  for criteria for determining enlisted aide requirements, for example by  tying authorization and assignment determinations to official  representational duties. However, DOD\u2019s Instruction\u2014which specifies one  criterion (housing) for enlisted aide assignments and ties enlisted aide  authorizations to the duties of GFO positions, including representational  duties\u2014does not include criteria to make clear how factors such as the  number of qualifying representational events and size of military housing  translate into enlisted aide workload for the purpose of identifying enlisted  aide requirements and informing authorization and assignment decisions.

However, officials from the Army, the Navy, and the Joint Staff stated  that their justifications reflected enlisted aide authorizations and  assignments as of February or March 2015.

However, DOD\u2019s  report stated elsewhere that the Army had 30 3-star generals on  active duty, and the Marine Corps had 12. OUSD P&R officials  stated that the Army discrepancy could be attributed to the Army  having authorized enlisted aides for four Joint Staff GFOs beyond  what the Joint Staff had been authorized, and to two Army 3-star  billets that were temporarily vacant but did not warrant the  removal or reassignment of an enlisted aide. However, these  officials could not identify all of the Joint Staff GFOs who had been  authorized Army aides, and the enlisted aides assigned by the  Army to these joint GFO billets were not included in the overall  number of enlisted aides reported by DOD as being assigned to  the Joint Staff. As a result, the actual number of enlisted aides  assigned to the Joint Staff exceeded the number reported by  DOD.", "Several justifications did not align with the number of enlisted  aides authorized or assigned to a GFO billet, or authorization and  assignment justifications conflicted. For example, the billet  justification section listed an enlisted aide assigned to a certain  Army general, but the corresponding narrative stated that an  enlisted aide was not authorized for that position because the  general did not live in military housing or host qualifying  representational events. Similarly, the justification associated  with a GFO assigned to the Joint Staff, who was not assigned an  enlisted aide, stated that an aide was assigned to the GFO. Also,  three separate assignment justifications for the Joint Staff stated  that enlisted aides were authorized to assist the officer with myriad  official duties and qualifying representational events, but the  corresponding authorization justifications stated that the subject  GFO hosted qualifying representational events on occasion and  did not provide any detail regarding the officer\u2019s official duties.", "The number of 3-star GFOs assigned to the Joint Staff differed by  one from the number of 3-star GFOs in corresponding source data  we collected from the military services. This difference would have  resulted in a different hypothetical maximum aide authorization for  the Joint Staff.", "Both the Navy and the Joint Staff counted an enlisted aide  assigned by the Navy to the Joint Staff on a temporary basis,  resulting in a reported total of 290 assigned enlisted aides instead  of 289. As a result, the actual total number of enlisted aides in  either the Navy or the Joint Staff is lower than the number  reported by one\u2014depending on how this aide is counted\u2014as is  the total number of assigned aides across the department.", "Some data were incomplete\u2014Narratives covering 78 assigned  enlisted aides either did not discuss housing or mentioned housing  indirectly by discussing duties associated with areas used for  qualifying representational events. OUSD P&R officials stated in  relation to the incomplete justifications that each did not need to be  exact. However, as previously mentioned, DOD\u2019s enlisted aide  instruction generally requires that GFOs occupy military housing in  order to be eligible for the assignment of an enlisted aide, and OUSD  P&R instructed the military services and the Joint Staff to cite the size  of military housing used for qualifying representational events to the  extent possible when developing their justifications for the June 2015  report.", "Federal internal control standards state that agencies should have  relevant, reliable, and timely information for decision-making and external  reporting purposes. Leading human capital practices similarly state that  high-performing organizations use complete and reliable data to ensure  that resources are properly matched to the needs of the environment.

These actions include access  restrictions and quality checks, such as reviewing for anomalies.  However, OUSD P&R officials stated that they did not have a process to  assess the reliability of submitted data or the military services\u2019 and the  Joint Staff\u2019s data collection and reporting methods and noted that they did  not question the data because it had been approved by the service  Secretaries. These same officials also noted that producing the enlisted  aides report was a new process and that they will be better positioned to  refine the process when producing future annual enlisted aide reports.", "Our review found that some of the justification data presented in DOD\u2019s  June 2015 report were inaccurate because the Army, the Navy, and the  Joint Staff did not maintain historical data on enlisted aides and,  therefore, as noted above, could not produce data regarding their  authorizations, assignments, and justifications as of September 30, 2014,  as required by section 504 of the Fiscal Year 2015 NDAA. The collection  of these data will likely be improved by DOD\u2019s updated Instruction  1315.09, which requires that the military services and the Joint Staff  report to OUSD P&R on similar data.

Without a process to assess the reliability of enlisted aide  data submitted by the military services and the Joint Staff, DOD does not  have reasonable assurance that the data it used to determine enlisted  aide reductions were accurate, and Congress and senior DOD leaders  may not have reliable data in future enlisted aide reports on which to base  decisions on enlisted aides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The military services\u2019 and Joint Staff\u2019s longstanding practice of assigning  enlisted aides to GFOs has reduced the burden on GFOs of  accomplishing minor but necessary tasks that otherwise might be done at  the expense of the officers\u2019 primary military and official duties and  responsibilities. However, in light of the fiscal year 2015 NDAA\u2019s reporting  objective to reduce the total number of assigned enlisted aides across the  department by 40, certain actions could better position DOD to assign  aides more effectively and efficiently. For instance, the application of  DOD\u2019s fair share methodology, while consistent with statute, does not  account for enlisted aide personnel requirements or changing  circumstances faced by the military services and Joint Staff in recent  years. Without periodically assessing department-wide enlisted aide  requirements DOD cannot determine the equitable allocation of enlisted  aide authorizations across the department. Such an assessment\u2014 followed by a reallocation on the basis of its results\u2014would better align  the process for distributing enlisted aide allocations with the department\u2019s  human capital management guidance and help ensure the effective and  efficient use of the allowable total authorizations.

DOD also provided technical comments on the  draft report, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "DOD concurred, with comment, on our first recommendation related to  conducting an assessment of DOD-wide enlisted aide requirements,  stating that it would appear to call for duplication of the annual,  department-wide billet-by-billet review of enlisted aide authorization and  assignment required by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(c). DOD further noted that going  forward, the Secretaries of the Military Departments and the Chairman of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff will identify their respective total enlisted aide  requirements, including requirements that, if authorized, would cause the  department to exceed the ceiling on the number of enlisted aides  authorized by law. DOD\u2019s annual enlisted aide report, required by 10  U.S.C. \u00a7 981, is to specify the number of enlisted aides authorized and  allocated\u2014as of September 30 of the previous year\u2014to GFOs of the  Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the Joint Staff, and  to justify on a billet-by-billet basis the authorization and assignment of  each enlisted aide to each GFO position. DOD did not include the billet- by-billet justifications in the first installment of its annual report, stating  that additional time was needed to prepare the justifications and that the  information would be included in the June 2015 report. As noted in our  report, DOD\u2019s June 2015 enlisted aides report partially addressed the  requirement to include billet-by-billet justifications for enlisted aide  authorizations and assignments as of September 30, 2014, but these  justifications were based on the department\u2019s existing allocation and did  not constitute an assessment of total DOD-wide enlisted aide  requirements. DOD officials told us during our review that such an  assessment would likely demonstrate a need for additional enlisted aides.  As a result, we do not believe that the assessment of total enlisted aide  requirements duplicates the process mandated by 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 981.  However, by identifying and including requirements in future annual  reviews that, if authorized, would cause the department to exceed the  ceiling on the number of enlisted aides authorized by law, DOD should  meet the intent of our recommendation and therefore better position itself  to equitably distribute these resources across the military services and  the Joint Staff and ensure their efficient and effective use.", "DOD concurred, with comment, on the second recommendation to  reallocate enlisted aides across the military services and the Joint Staff  based on its assessments of total enlisted aide requirements, noting that  the department \u201cfroze\u201d the past two allocation reviews to allow a period of  stabilization following the implementation of a new guiding document on  enlisted aides, coordination on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  \u201c13 Professional Character Initiatives,\u201d and feedback and dialogue with  Congress on the reports submitted in March and June of 2015. As noted  in our report, DOD has not reallocated its enlisted aide authorizations  since 2010, and DOD\u2019s enlisted aide Instruction and reports were issued  in 2015. We are encouraged, however, that DOD also stated in its  comments that it will endeavor to improve the allocation process to better  support actual service and joint requirements. By reallocating enlisted  aide authorizations, under the statutory cap, based on its assessments of  total enlisted aide requirements, DOD should meet the intent of our  recommendation and more reasonably ensure that these resources are  properly matched to the needs of today\u2019s environment.", "DOD concurred, with comment, on our third recommendation, that it  establish criteria for determining enlisted aide workload and include these  criteria in relevant enlisted aide guidance. Specifically, DOD stated that  the workload of an enlisted aide is unique to each position and area of  responsibility, and that establishing a fixed set of workload criteria would  significantly limit the flexibility of the department and \u201ctremendously  increase\u201d the management investment associated with a discrete  program comprising 300 or fewer personnel. As noted in our report,  DOD\u2019s enlisted aides Instruction specifies military housing as the lone  eligibility criterion for enlisted aide assignments and ties enlisted aide  authorizations to the official duties of GFO positions, including  representational duties. Additionally, OUSD P&R instructed the military  services and the Joint Staff to cite, to the extent possible, the number of  qualifying representational events and the size of military housing used  for hosting qualifying representational events when developing their  justifications for the June 2015 report. However, DOD\u2019s Instruction does  not include criteria to make clear how factors such as the number of  qualifying representational events and size of military housing translate  into enlisted aide workload for the purpose of identifying enlisted aide  requirements and informing authorization and assignment decisions. As a  result, justifications for enlisted aide authorizations vary and are  subjective, and it is unclear how duties and workload support enlisted  aide assignments. Accordingly, we continue to believe that, without  additional guidance on how to determine enlisted aide workload in  relation to factors such as housing and GFO official representational  duties, military service and Joint Staff decisions regarding enlisted aide  authorizations and assignments may not be consistent and transparent,  and those exercising oversight in DOD and Congress will lack reasonable  assurance that these decisions are being made in relation to factors that  drive enlisted aide workload. Further, with enlisted aide duties already  tied principally to housing and official representational duties, we do not  believe that establishing workload criteria would significantly limit the  flexibility of the department or significantly increase its management  investment in enlisted aides.", "DOD concurred, with comment, on our fourth recommendation, that it  establish a process to assess the reliability of data submitted by the  military services and the Joint Staff for future enlisted aide reports.
