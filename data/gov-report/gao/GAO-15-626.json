For example, GAO identified soldiers who were listed as available but were incarcerated or had a medically limiting condition. A comprehensive analysis could reveal additional inaccuracies. While the Army reserve component commands and some units perform some data quality reviews to identify and correct discrepancies within the multiple data systems that they rely on for availability data, these reviews examine a limited scope of availability-related variables and are performed infrequently. For example, one system generates a report that identifies a small number of problematic variables, but only reports this information quarterly. Further, it does not provide information specific enough to correct individual problems or cover the full range of variables contributing to inaccurate data. Furthermore, the multiple systems do not interface with each other in a way to allow for timely updates of inconsistent availability information.

We also found examples of data system  inconsistencies to a lesser degree in the Army National Guard data,  including soldiers who were identified as having physical limitations  during their annual physical, but did not have a medically limiting status  code listed in the Medical Protection System (referred to as MEDPROS).  In addition, some of the examples of inaccurate data discussed above are  also affected by untimely updates between data systems, some of which  have lag times of weeks or months between updates, leading to  inaccuracies. Even systems that update every 24 hours can negatively  affect the accuracy and completeness of the data, depending on the  timing of report creation and information input.", "Furthermore, both Army Reserve and Army National Guard officials  stated that commander discretion in the interpretation of soldier  availability data at the unit level allows for operational flexibility but may  create inconsistent data among systems. For example, a commander  may classify soldiers who are in the process of retraining to a different  military occupational specialty or transitioning from an enlisted soldier to  an officer or warrant officer as available in the Standard  Installation/Division Personnel System (SIDPERS) or Total Army  Personnel Data Base-Reserve (TAPDB-R) based on the soldiers\u2019  previous training or qualifications. However, the individual would still be  listed as non-available due to training in Army Training Requirements and  Resources System (ATRRS) because the data systems do not currently  interface in a way to allow for timely updates of this new availability data  to keep the soldier\u2019s information relevant. Because soldier availability  information is always changing, without timely updates between data  systems that occur as soon as new information is added, commanders  and unit administrators responsible for managing soldiers are unable to  ensure that the data remains relevant and valuable for reporting soldier  non-availability rates.   states  The Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Governmentthat complete and accurate information should be available on a timely  basis to maintain its relevance and value to management, allow for  effective monitoring of events, and effective decision-making to  accomplish agency objectives. While the Army reserve component  commands and the units we selected perform some data quality reviews  to identify and correct discrepancies within the multiple data systems that  they rely on for availability data, these reviews examine a limited scope of  availability-related variables and are performed infrequently. For example,  the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard stated that they use  reports, such as the quarterly Data Quality Index (DQI) reports which are  narrowly scoped reports, focusing on the top 25 problematic variables of  more than 8,000 variables across each of the Army reserve components.  Officials stated that the DQI is intended to identify missing, incomplete, or  inconsistent availability data between systems but does not identify  invalid values unless they contradict data in a different system, or keep  track of past variables when the new list is issued each quarter. These  top 25 problematic variables are not necessarily representative of data  inconsistencies specific to a particular unit, thus the unit may assume its  data for other variable are accurate and may not look for other issues  within its data. As a result, the DQI may only be helpful to units that  identify issues similar to the top 25 problematic variables within their own  data and units may be unaware of other issues. Unit administrators can  create \u201con-demand\u201d discrepancy reports to help address other issues  resulting from self-reporting and data entry, but the administrators have to  suspect a potential problem with the data (e.g., available statuses despite  contradiction with the guidance or inaccuracies due to self-reporting)  before they can run the corresponding, issue-specific \u201con-demand\u201d  reports to identify and resolve the issue. While National Guard officials  stated the DQI was intended to validate soldier statuses against Army  policy and guidance, we identified soldiers in the data who were listed as  available despite having statuses in contradiction with the guidance  concerning availability, bringing the effectiveness of these existing quality  reviews into question.", "Overall, the national and unit level data quality reviews do not check the  full range of potential errors, missing or invalid values, and inconsistent  data among all the data systems used to track soldier availability. The  reports only focus on known potential issue areas and often once issues  identified by these reports are addressed, they may not be considered in  future reports, until it becomes such a systematic problem that it is once  again identified in the DQI. Furthermore, these reports are conducted on  an infrequent basis, with the DQI only being updated quarterly, and units  running intermittent on-demand reports on a weekly or monthly basis, or  as they have time to address suspicions of a potential issue. Thus, if data  systems are updated with new information that is incomplete or incorrect,  and a data quality review is not scheduled for another week or month, the  data in these systems could be used to create inaccurate availability  reports that hinder management\u2019s ability to make effective, well-informed  decisions.", "In addition, the multiple data systems (e.g., individual systems for  recording medical, training, and administrative information) used to track  availability data do not currently interface in a way to allow for timely  updates between all systems to ensure the relevance and value of the  data management uses to make soldier availability-related decisions. For  example, the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard have access to  the Reserve Component Manpower System (RCMS), a centralized data  warehouse, which offers one point of access to all of the soldier  availability data contained in the multiple data systems. But, while the  RCMS warehouse has some algorithms in place to reconcile  inconsistencies that exist between data systems, this reconciliation is only  used for reports derived from warehouse data. Specifically, the  warehouse does not update the availability data in the conflicting  individual data systems or automatically inform the units that there is a  problem with their specific availability data. Once the issue is identified  and addressed in one data system, at the unit level, the current interfaces  between systems do not allow for timely updates to ensure relevant and  valuable data is available in all other applicable data systems as soon as  the change is made. Internal control standards state that controls should  be installed at the interfaces between systems to ensure all inputs  received are valid, all outputs are correct and properly distributed, and  information is provided in a timely manner to maintain its relevance and  value to decision makers. Some of the data systems used by the Army  Reserve and Army National Guard have lag times of weeks or months  between updates and are not automated, leading to inconsistencies and  inaccurate information. Even systems that update every 24 hours can  negatively affect the accuracy and completeness of the data, depending  on the timing of report creation and information input, hindering  management\u2019s ability to make informed decisions.", "We determined that, for the purpose of reporting soldier availability rates,  the issues we identified within and between data systems used for  tracking individual soldier availability render the data not sufficiently  reliable. Because the Army Reserve and Army National Guard do not  have constant oversight of their soldiers, they rely on self-reported  information and cannot guarantee that soldiers are providing complete  and accurate information. Without effective internal controls consisting of  frequent data quality reviews that cover the full range of availability- related variables and timely updates between data systems, the Army  reserve components will not be able to ensure that the data in and among  systems is complete, accurate, and timely to efficiently and effectively  manage individual soldier availability.", "Both the Army and DOD are aware of the data issues resulting from the  lack of integration of the Army\u2019s multiple data systems. For example, a  September 2012 Army National Guard document on personnel data  systems and data processing and metrics noted that data systems face  systemic issues, accuracy issues, and delays in updating information, and  had suggested the creation of the Data Quality Index to address the  problem. In addition, DOD tried to address the errors caused by the lack  of integration of personnel and pay systems that we previously reported in  1993, through the implementation of the Defense Integrated Military  Human Resources System. This system was intended to provide a joint,  integrated, standardized personnel and pay system for all military  personnel, but in February 2010, the project was canceled after 10 years  of development due, in part, to a lack of strategic alignment, governance,  and requirements management, as well as because of the overall  magnitude of the project.", "Subsequent to the cancelation of the Defense Integrated Military Human  Resources System, the Army began designing the Integrated Personnel  and Pay System-Army, which is intended to provide a 24-hour, web- based, integrated human resources system to soldiers, human resource  professionals, combatant commanders, personnel and pay managers,  and other authorized Army users.

They stated that many soldiers do not actively  participate in their medical appointments or provide necessary supporting  documents. Sometimes, soldiers are unwilling to reveal all of their  medical conditions or provide permission for release of their medical  records from their private providers, where applicable, which slows the  process.", "Another cause we identified for the delay in completing Line of Duty  investigations is the absence of a time limit for reporting incidents. Army  Reserve and Army National Guard unit officials we interviewed said that  having to investigate soldiers\u2019 claims of injuries or illnesses from many  years past was burdensome as the Line of Duty program regulation sets  no statute of limitations on reporting their incidents to their unit. One  National Guard unit official said that processing a claim that a soldier was  injured 5 or 10 years prior takes an extensive amount of time and  resources. Additionally, several Army Reserve and National Guard  officials stated that the time standards within which the Line of Duty  investigations are to be completed are unreasonable for the reserve  components.", "Army Reserve and Army National Guard officials stated that there are  training opportunities on Line of Duty investigations given along with other  aspects of the disability evaluation system. For example, National Guard  Bureau officials told us that they conduct Line of Duty training on a  quarterly basis at the Professional Education Center, located in North  Little Rock, Arkansas, and the class is open to all commanders, case  managers, medical readiness unit officials, and health services  specialists. However, officials from at least one National Guard state  indicated that more unit leader training on Line of Duty responsibilities  would be welcome as, according to these officials, the only Line of Duty  investigation training that they knew of was for company commanders  and it consisted of a 30-minute block of training given during their  company pre- command course. They said additional training would be  helpful because a high percentage of the Line of Duty investigations are  returned to the units for corrections. These same National Guard officials  said that even if the pre-command course included more training, funding  levels in their state has precluded them from holding any pre-command  courses in 2015.

Additionally, Army Regulation 220-1  specifies a training qualification rate between 85 and 100 percent for  optimum unit readiness. The Army National Guard also establishes a  training qualification rate of 85 percent in its 2014 \u2013 2020 Strategic  Planning Guidance document. As of January 2015, both the Army  Reserve commands and the Army National Guard states we reviewed  were meeting their identified training goal of 85 percent.", "According to the Army National Guard Combat Readiness Reform Act of  1992, as amended, the Secretary of the Army has the legal authority to  establish a personnel accounting category to be used for reserve  component soldiers who have not completed their initial military training  or who are otherwise not available. This account provides units with  improved unit availability rates by assigning soldiers who are non- available due to training or other issues to a separate personnel account  that is external from the unit\u2019s personnel roster. However, Army Reserve  and Army National Guard officials stated that, unlike the Active Army,  they do not use a separate personnel account to assign soldiers who are  in training, in transit, or incapacitated for a long period of time\u2014referred to  as a Trainees, Transients, Holdovers, and Students account. The Army  reserve component soldiers in these situations who are non-available are  directly assigned to their units and are counted against their home units\u2019  manning and personnel readiness levels, and therefore, their unit non- availability rates are typically higher than those of the Active Army. For  example, a senior official said that the Army National Guard units usually  have approximately 20 percent of their unit non-available because of  having not completed initial military training or because of other issues  that make them non-available.", "The Army Reserve and the Army National Guard officials stated that they  have not established a personnel account for reserve component soldiers  who have not completed their initial military training or who are otherwise  not available for several reasons. For example, Army Reserve officials  stated that during a 2012 pilot of administratively assigning soldiers who  had not completed training or other non-available soldiers to a separate  personnel account, they found that the unit commanders felt that they had  lost some level of accountability for their soldiers once they were being  managed by others outside of the unit. Further, officials stated that costs  were incurred to hire additional personnel to support the management of  individuals assigned to a Trainees, Transients, Holdovers, and Students  account outside of their home unit. National Guard and unit officials we  interviewed agreed that implementing a separate account to manage  these soldiers outside of their home unit is currently cost prohibitive.", "Army reserve component officials stated that there will always be a  portion of the force in the training pipeline and, therefore, non-available as  long as new soldiers are recruited. Not separately accounting for these  new soldiers negatively affects the overall availability rate of the unit to  which they are assigned. Alternatively, utilizing a separate account to  manage soldiers allows the Active Army to fill its units with only those who  have completed initial military training and who are considered available  from a training perspective. Regardless of whether the Army reserve  components use a separate personnel account or accounting for non- available soldiers within the units, soldier availability rates of the force as  a whole do not change, as those non-available soldiers would still exist  within the reserve components and would have to be accounted for and  managed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Army Reserve and the Army National Guard categorized about a  quarter of their soldiers as not available for mobilization due to various  reasons such as duty-limiting medical conditions, lack of initial training, or  other administrative situations that exist. While the Army reserve  components collect a large amount of data regarding soldier medical,  training, and other statuses to report non-availability rates, the  completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of these data are not sufficiently  reliable for supporting their reported soldier non-availability rates.", "Specifically, the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard currently do  not frequently conduct data quality reviews that identify the full range of  potential errors, missing or invalid values, and inconsistent data among all  the data systems used to track soldier availability, which cause soldiers to  be listed as available despite having statuses in contradiction with the  guidance concerning availability. In addition, the multiple data systems  used to track availability data do not currently interface in a way to allow  for timely updates between all systems to ensure the relevance and value  of the data management uses to make soldier availability-related  decisions. These data problems hinder Army leaders\u2019 ability to know the  true extent to which their reserve component soldiers are available and  ready for duty at a given point in time. Without quality data that is readily  available to leaders at all levels from systems that interface in a way that  produces the most up-to-date information possible, the Army and its  reserve component leaders will not be able to adequately monitor and  manage the availability of soldiers who make up over half of the total  Army force.", "Moreover, the majority of Line of Duty investigations to verify such  circumstances as solider injury and illness are overdue. Thus, many of  these soldiers are being maintained in a non-available status for extended  periods of time while awaiting the completion of these investigations. A  planned revised program regulation for Line of Duty investigations could  address some of the delays, but its issuance has been pending for years  and does not appear to address all causes of the delays, such as soldiers  not providing information as required. Within units, the overall non- available percentage is not just an aggregate number but represents  individual soldiers with particular skills who are needed to perform specific  roles and tasks for the unit. As the Army and its reserve components  reduce their overall number of soldiers in the near future, each soldier  that remains plays a larger part in contributing to the missions of their  units. Consequently, it becomes critically important for commanders to  effectively manage their non-available soldiers so as to minimize the  impact to their unit\u2019s readiness as well as that of the total Army force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army to take the following four actions:  Improve the Army Reserve\u2019s and the Army National Guard\u2019s internal  control procedures to ensure that individual soldier availability  information in each data system is complete, accurate, and timely by  increasing the scope and frequency of data quality reviews at the unit  and national levels to address issues resulting from self-reporting and  inaccurate inputs;", "Develop and implement ways that the Army reserve components can  facilitate timely updates of availability data between all data systems  through the current system interfaces to improve the relevance and  value of the data that management is using to make soldier  availability-related decisions;", "Develop a plan with timelines and take actions accordingly to address  the backlog of Line of Duty investigations; and", "Revise the Line of Duty program regulation to include procedures that  would address implementation challenges that contribute to delays in  the processing of Army Reserve and Army National Guard soldiers\u2019  claims of incurring service-connected injuries and illnesses, such as  by including the identification of and procedures to address non- compliance by soldiers, and take steps to expeditiously issue that  revised program regulation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In DOD\u2019s written comments on a draft of this report, DOD concurred with  comments on each of our four recommendations.

In its comments, the Army  National Guard stated that, while it concurred with the recommendations,  it believes our report did not analyze the lack of training for personnel  clerks within the states. Additionally, it stated that system limitations as  well as staffing shortages and budget constraints contribute to the delays  in updating information within its primary system, SIDPERS. Further, the  Army National Guard believes that the deployment of the Integrated  Personnel and Pay System-Army will resolve the identified issues, and  training will play a vital role in the implementation of that system. In the  report we state several reasons why the soldier non-availability  information is not complete, accurate or timely. The lack of training for  personnel clerks, staffing shortages, and budget constraints may certainly  be additional causes for the data problems identified. We encourage the  Army National Guard to take all necessary actions to remedy these  problems they have identified. However, we continue to believe that the  completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of solider availability-related data  will be improved by taking actions to strengthen the internal control  procedures and developing and implementing ways to facilitate timely  updates of availability data between all systems.", "In their comments related to the reliability of its soldier availability-related  data, the Army Reserve stated that the report contains an inaccuracy  regarding the Data Quality Index and its intended use and capability.  More specifically, the Army Reserve contends that the Data Quality Index  is an \u201con-demand\u201d report that can identify blank, invalid, and pay-related  data discrepancies, and are available to unit commanders to run as  needed and to monitor the data quality of their assigned unit. In our  report, we state that unit administrators can create \u201con-demand\u201d  discrepancy reports to help address data, but the administrators have to  suspect a potential problem with the data before they run the  corresponding, issue-specific \u201con-demand\u201d reports to identify and help  resolve any problems. We also state that unit officials are running their  unit level data quality reviews, intermittently and that these unit reviews  do not check the full range of potential errors, missing or invalid values,  and inconsistent data among all the data systems used to track soldier  availability. Since the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard use  more than a dozen data systems to record or analyze various pieces of  data related to the medical, training, and administrative status of their  soldiers, we continue to believe that these reserve components need to  take appropriate steps to improve the reliability of their soldier availability  information.", "DOD concurred with comment on our third and fourth recommendations  related to improving the completion of Line of Duty investigations.  Specifically, the Army Reserve states that we did not fully analyze the  manpower necessary for completing the Line of Duty investigations.  Further, it stated that we did not mention that major contributing factors to  the increase in the number of investigations are soldiers with pre-existing  medical conditions who are transitioning from the active duty to the  reserve components as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019  requirement for a completed Line of Duty investigation for every claimed  condition. Our report states that many causes exist for the delays in  completing Line of Duty investigations, and we provide examples of  common causes that we heard during our review. However, we recognize  that these are not the only causes for delays in completing Line of Duty  investigations. It may be very likely that the manpower demands, soldier  transition issues and the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 requirement  mentioned by the Army Reserve could be additional causes for the  delays. No matter the cause for the delays, the significant backlog of  incomplete Line of Duty investigations shows that this has been a long- standing issue within the reserve components. Therefore, it is imperative  that they resolve this problem as it is in the best interest of the soldiers to  expeditiously address their medical situations in order to minimize the  number of non-available soldiers being retained within Army reserve  component units.", "Further, the Army Reserve stated in its comments that it is developing a  plan of action to address the critical findings related to Line of Duty  investigations and that two agencies are currently testing a streamlined  Line of Duty process. Upon review of quantitative data from the test, the  Army Reserve states that it will develop a comprehensive plan of action to  address its backlog of late Line of Duty investigations. According to the  Army Reserve, the plan of action will streamline and standardize internal  processes in order to reduce the backlog and adjudicate cases more  efficiently. Finally, it plans to review the feasibility of creating a Process  Act Team to both address the existing backlog and develop a more active  method of processing new Line of Duty investigations. We are  encouraged by the Army Reserve plans to take actions to address this  important issue which can hold injured and ill soldiers in a non-available  status for extended periods of time.", "The Army Reserve also stated that our report did not mention that it had  established a separate personnel account known as a Trainees,  Transients, Holdovers, and Students account back in the mid to late  2000, but it was later dissolved. The Army Reserve stated that the  account was dissolved due to lack of commander's accountability and  ownership of their soldiers when they were assigned and managed  outside of their home unit, and because of the resources (people,  systems, etc) involved in managing the account. However, our draft report  did note the 2012 pilot of administratively assigning soldiers who had not  completed training or other non-available soldiers to a separate personnel  account.

Through discussions with Army Reserve and Army  National Guard officials, we determined that in 2012 there was a change  in how soldiers with certain medically limiting conditions were being  accounted for. As a result, we analyzed the data from the time period  after the policy change, July 2012 through the end of calendar year 2014,  in order to have consistent data over the entire timeframe for our review.  We also decided to use a non-generalizable sample of a combination of  six units\u2014two Army Reserve commands and four Army National Guard  states\u2014 for a detailed analysis of the individual soldier non-availability  data.", "In order to select a non-generalizable sample of commands to review, we  initially obtained summary data for each of the 54 Army National Guard  states and territories of the United States as of September 2014. This  summary availability data included the number of Army National Guard  soldiers: assigned to each state or territory, reported as non-available,  reported as non-available due to medical reasons and reported as a  percentage of the total number of soldiers reported as non-available,  and  reported as non-available due to training reasons and as a  percentage of the total number of soldiers reported as non-available  In table 4, we list the four Army National Guard states we selected for our  non-generalizable sample and the criteria we used for selecting each  one\u2014that is, the combination of the number of assigned soldiers in the  state or territory, their geographic dispersion across the country, and  whether they have high or low rates of overall, medical- or training-related  soldier non- availability.", "In addition to these four Army National Guard states, we also selected  two Army Reserve commands, as a part of our non-generalizable sample,  on the basis of (1) the number of assigned soldiers and (2) their proximity  to and geographic dispersion with the four Army National Guard states in  order to allow for regional perspectives between organizations. As such,  we selected the largest command\u2014the 377th Theater Sustainment  Command in Louisiana\u2014and one medium-sized command\u2014the 807th  Medical Support Command in Utah.", "Due to the magnitude of discrepancies that we found using the historical  data from July 2012 through the end of fiscal year 2014, we decided we  could more comprehensively analyze these discrepancies with a  snapshot in time of soldier availability data rather than using historical  trend data. We decided to use a snapshot of the most current data  available (January 2015), from the same six Army Reserve and Army  National Guard units rather than using data from all Army Reserve and  Army National Guard units. After we decided to focus our review on a  snapshot in time of the soldier non-availability data, we obtained  individual soldier availability information as of January 2015 (see table 5)  for the selected four Army National Guard states and two Army Reserve  commands. We determined that the information we obtained and  analyzed, though not representative of all units, was sufficient to provide  relevant insights for our review.", "We spoke to officials from each of these commands and states (excluding  Michigan), as well as the US Army Reserve Command and the National  Guard Bureau regarding the data we analyzed and the discrepancies we  identified to obtain a complete understanding of the availability data and  multiple data systems. Officials from Michigan were willing to speak with  us, but we were unable to coordinate on a mutually agreeable time.", "The Army Reserve and Army National Guard provided us individual  soldier availability data from the five main data systems they use to track  availability-related data, including the Medical Protection System  (MEDPROS), the Army Training Requirements and Resources System  (ATRRS), the Total Army Personnel Data Base-Reserve (TAPDB-R), the  Standard Installation/Division Personnel System (SIDPERS), and the  Reserve Component Manpower System (RCMS). The availability data  from these five systems were sufficient to answer the objectives for the  purpose of this report for the following reasons. First, the entire Army  uses MEDPROS to track immunization and medical readiness for all  active and reserve components as well as other pieces of information  affecting soldiers\u2019 medical availability to deploy. ATRRS is the  Department of the Army\u2019s management information system of record for  managing soldier training information. TAPDB-R is the Army Reserve\u2019s  database of record for personnel data to fully support all personnel  manning functions during peacetime and deployment. SIDPERS is the  database of record for all personnel information for Army National Guard  soldiers. Both TAPDB-R and SIDPERS track the administrative causes of  non-availability. Lastly, both the Army Reserve and the Army National  Guard use RCMS to provide decision makers with standard reports for  analyzing personnel and operational readiness data by aggregating  sources of information from multiple data systems. The Army reserve  components use the information in these multiple data systems  collectively to assess a soldier\u2019s and a unit\u2019s overall availability for  mobilization and deployment.", "We compared these solider availability data from these five data systems  for the six selected locations with (1) Standards for Internal Control in the   and (2) Army guidance documents for reporting the  Federal Governmentavailability of soldiers, and assessed the soldier availability information for  completeness, accuracy, and timeliness. Specifically, Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government states that complete and  accurate information should be available on a timely basis to maintain its  relevance and value to management in making decisions, allow for  effective monitoring of events, and effective decision-making to  accomplish agency objectives. Furthermore the Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government defines \u201ctimeliness\u201d as information  that is promptly recorded to maintain its relevance and value to  management in making decisions such as reporting soldier non- availability rates. In addition, these standards state that controls should  be installed at the interfaces between systems to ensure all inputs  received are valid, all outputs are correct and properly distributed, and  information is provided in a timely manner to maintain its relevance and  value to decision makers. We also used Department of the Army  Pamphlet 220-1 to provide us with the instructions and reference  information related to (1) determining and reporting personnel data, (2)  the mobilization of Army National Guard and Army Reserve units, and (3)  the duty-limiting conditions which would make a soldier non-available for  mobilization. We assessed the reliability of the data elements in the  multiple data systems needed for this engagement based on the criteria  above and identified the data reliability issues discussed in the body of  this report. As previously discussed, the data systems contain inaccurate  and incomplete records, soldiers listed as available in contradiction with  availability reporting guidance, and availability data that may not be  relevant or valuable to management due to current system interfaces that  do not allow for timely updates between all systems. Overall, the issues  we identified within and between data systems used for tracking individual  soldier availability render them not sufficiently reliable for the purpose of  reporting soldier availability rates.", "For our second objective, we obtained and reviewed the Line of Duty  program regulation, which details the policies and procedures for  investigating the circumstances of a soldier\u2019s disease, injury, or death.  The Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army for Personnel (G-1) is the  proponent and exception authority that includes the investigation  procedures and the processing time standards for these investigations.  Further, we obtained summary information from the Army Reserve and  the Army National Guard from January 2015 that showed (1) the total  number of Line of Duty investigations that were in process at that time for  the entire Army Reserve by support command level and Army National  Guard by state or territory and (2) the breakdown of the total as to the  number that were on-time and overdue as compared with the Line of Duty  program regulation\u2019s processing time standards.

We also analyzed Army Reserve and Army National Guard  summary reports as well as data for individual soldiers from the six sites  we selected for January 2015 showing the number of soldiers that were  not available because they had not completed their initial military training.  To identify the extent to which delays exist in the process of soldiers  completing their initial military training, we also requested information  from U.S. Army Recruiting Command, the U.S. Army Reserve Command,  and the National Guard Bureau for January 2015 showing the number of  soldiers who were delayed in completing their initial military training.", "Additionally, to determine how the Active Army, the Army Reserve and  the Army National Guard account for their soldiers who are in training or  otherwise in a non-available status, we researched applicable laws  governing the assignment of soldiers to units or to a separate personnel  account. We interviewed U.S. Army Reserve Command, Army National  Guard, and unit officials to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of  using the different assignment approaches.
