For a number of reasons, most Americans have an SSN, each of which is unique to the individual. Today, the SSN is used for a myriad of non-Social Security purposes, some legal and some illegal. Both private businesses and government agencies frequently ask individuals for SSNs in order to comply with federal laws requiring these numbers or because these entities need the SSNs to conduct their business.", "Responding to public concerns about how organizations use SSNs and mounting occurrences of identity theft, sometimes involving misuse of SSNs, several members of the Congress have introduced bills to regulate the use of SSNs. To obtain information on how the SSN is currently used, the Subcommittee asked us to describe federal laws and regulations requiring or restricting SSN use, how extensively the private and public sectors use SSNs for purposes not required by federal law, and what businesses and governments believe the impact would be if federal laws limiting the use of SSNs were passed.", "To develop this information, we reviewed private businesses that sell information of a personal nature about members of the general public, including individuals\u2019 SSNs; businesses involved in providing financial and health care services to individuals; and two large state programs that frequently use SSNs for administrative purposes. Appendix I contains a list of the organizations and agencies we contacted. For more details about our scope and methodology, see appendix II.

Subsequent federal laws added benefits for workers\u2019 dependents and survivors and, later, for disabled workers. Workers now earn entitlement to benefits on the basis of the number of Social Security credits they have earned while working in jobs covered by Social Security. Because the act required SSA to maintain records of wage amounts employers report having paid to individuals, in 1936, SSA created SSNs as a means of maintaining individual earnings records and issued cards to workers as records of their SSNs. The act now requires individuals to provide SSA their number when they apply for Social Security benefits. SSA uses the SSN to identify applicants\u2019 personal earnings records, which contain information the agency uses to compute benefits payable to beneficiaries.", "Over the years, the SSN has come to be viewed by many as a national identifier because almost every American has an SSN, and each is unique.SSA estimates that about 277 million individuals currently have SSNs. Furthermore, the boom in computer technology over the past several decades has prompted private businesses and government agencies to rely on SSNs as a way to accumulate and identify information in their databases. Simply stated, the uniqueness and broad applicability of the SSN have made it the identifier of choice for government agencies and private businesses, both for compliance with federal requirements and for the agencies\u2019 and businesses\u2019 own purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Laws and Regulations Require and Restrict Certain SSN Uses", "paragraphs": ["No federal law regulates overall use of SSNs. However, a number of federal laws and regulations enacted since the 1960s require certain programs and federally funded activities to use the SSN for administrative purposes. These laws and regulations generally limit the use of the SSN to the required purpose by explicitly prohibiting other uses or disclosures. Federal law neither requires nor prohibits many of the public and private sectors\u2019 other uses of SSNs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Laws and Regulations Require SSN Use in Some Public Programs", "paragraphs": ["A number of federal laws and regulations require the use of the SSN as an individual\u2019s identifier to facilitate automated exchanges that help administrators enforce compliance with federal laws, determine eligibility for benefits, or both. The Internal Revenue Code and regulations, which govern the administration of the federal personal income tax program, require that individuals\u2019 SSNs serve as taxpayer identification numbers.This means that employers and others making payments to individuals must include the individuals\u2019 SSNs in reporting to IRS many of these payments. Reportable payments include interest payments to customers, wages paid to employees, dividends provided to stockholders, and retirement benefits paid to individuals. Other reportable transactions include purchases involving more than $10,000 in cash, such as the purchase of an automobile or a boat, or mortgage interest payments totaling more than $600. In addition, the Code and regulations require individuals filing personal income tax returns to include their SSNs as their taxpayer identification number, the SSNs of people whom they claim as dependents, and the SSNs of spouses to whom they paid alimony. Using the SSNs, IRS matches the information supplied by entities reporting payments or other transactions with returns filed by taxpayers to monitor individuals\u2019 compliance with federal income tax laws.", "A number of federal laws require program administrators to use SSNs in determining applicants\u2019 eligibility for federally funded benefits. The Social Security Act requires individuals to provide their SSNs in order to receive benefits under the SSI, Food Stamp, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and Medicaid programs. These programs provide benefits to people with limited income and resources as well as medical care for the needy. Applicants give program administrators information on their income and resources, and program administrators use applicants\u2019 SSNs to match records with those of other organizations to verify the information. For example, SSA uses SSNs to determine whether applicants for SSI benefits have accurately reported their income by matching records with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Railroad Retirement Board to identify any retirement or disability payments to these applicants. In addition to using SSNs to match records with other federal benefit-paying agencies, administrators of these programs said they also match records with state unemployment agencies, IRS, and employers to verify earned and unearned income, such as unemployment benefits, wages, retirement benefits, and interest paid to applicants. In fact, we have recommended in numerous reports that administrators of programs paying federally funded benefits match data in their payment files with SSA records to identify deceased beneficiaries, and that SSA match its records with other state and federal program records to reduce SSI payments to individuals whom the agency finds residing in nursing homes and prisons as well as those receiving benefits under other programs. Using SSNs to identify such recipients enhances program payment controls and reduces fraud and abuse.", "Another federal law that requires the use of SSNs to identify individuals is the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986. This law established the Commercial Driver\u2019s License Information System (CDLIS), a nationwide database. States are required to use individuals\u2019 SSNs to search this database for other state-issued licenses commercial drivers may hold. This checking is necessary because commercial drivers are limited to owning one state-issued driver\u2019s license. If a state grants a license, the state is required to record the license information, including the driver\u2019s SSN, in the CDLIS. States may also use SSNs to search another database, the National Driver\u2019s Registry, to determine whether an applicant\u2019s license has been cancelled, suspended, or revoked by another state. In these situations, the states use SSNs to limit the possibility of inappropriately licensing applicants.", "Federal law also requires the use of SSNs in state child support programs to help states locate noncustodial parents, establish and enforce support orders, and recoup state welfare payments from parents. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 expanded the Federal Parent Locator Service\u2014an automated database searchable by SSN\u2014to include information helpful for tracking delinquent parents across state lines. The law requires states to maintain records that include (1) SSNs for individuals who owe or are owed support for cases in which the state has ordered child support payments to be made, the state is providing support, or both, and (2) employers\u2019 reports of new hires identified by SSN. States must transmit this information to the Federal Parent Locator Service. The law also requires states to record SSNs on many other state documents, such as professional, occupational, and marriage licenses; divorce decrees; paternity determinations; and death certificates, and to make SSNs associated with these documents available for state child support agencies to use in locating and obtaining child support payments from noncustodial parents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Federal Laws Restrict SSN Use", "paragraphs": ["Federal laws that require the use of an SSN generally limit its use to the statutory purposes described in each of the laws. For example, the Internal Revenue Code, which requires the use of SSNs for certain purposes, declares tax return information, including SSNs, to be confidential and prescribes both civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure. Similarly, the Social Security Act, which requires the use of SSNs for a number of different purposes, declares that SSNs obtained or maintained by authorized individuals on or after October 1, 1990, are confidential and prohibits their disclosure. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 explicitly restricts the use of SSNs to purposes set out in the act, such as locating absentee parents to enforce child support payments.", "In addition to the restrictions contained in laws that require the use of SSNs, the Privacy Act of 1974 also restricts federal agencies in collecting and disclosing personal information, which includes SSNs. The act requires federal agencies that collect information from individuals to inform the individuals of the agencies\u2019 authority for requesting the information, whether providing the information is optional or mandatory, and how the agencies plan to use the information. The act, which also prohibits federal agencies from disclosing information without the individuals\u2019 consent, does not apply to other levels of government and private businesses.", "Except as discussed above, federal law does not regulate the use of SSNs.

Businesses and government agencies may ask for SSNs when individuals apply for benefits or services, such as worker\u2019s compensation, driver\u2019s licenses, credit, checking accounts, insurance, apartment rentals, and public utilities. Law enforcement agencies may also use SSNs for investigative purposes.", "Because there are so many users of the SSN, we focused on describing SSN use by organizations that routinely use these numbers for activities that affect a large number of people: organizations that sell personal information, provide financial services, and offer health care services and state government agencies that are responsible for collecting personal income tax and licensing drivers. In general, organizations may record SSNs in their databases for two purposes: to locate records for routine internal activities, such as maintaining and updating account information, and, more frequently, to facilitate information exchanges with other organizations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Businesses That Sell Personal Information", "paragraphs": ["Continuing advances in computer technology and the ready availability of computerized data have spurred the growth of a new business activity: amassing vast amounts of personal information, including SSNs, about members of the public for resale. Businesses involved in this activity act as information brokers. One information broker official told us his organization has more than 12,000 discrete databases. The increasing proliferation of information brokers has aroused concerns about individuals\u2019 personal identifying information, including SSNs, being made easily available to others. Federal law does not prohibit such disclosure of SSNs.", "Brokers buy information from public and private sources in various markets throughout the nation. The information may include public records of bankruptcy, tax liens, civil judgments, criminal histories, deaths, real estate ownership, driving histories, voter registration, and professional licenses. This information may also include privately owned information such as telephone directories and copyrighted publications, which are often made public, and certain information from consumer credit reports. Generally, each record provides details about the specific event for which it was created as well as some personal identifying data\u2014for example, an individual\u2019s name; date of birth; current and prior addresses; telephone number; and, sometimes, SSN. An information broker official told us that not every record his organization buys includes an SSN and that public records are more likely to contain SSNs than those from nonpublic sources.", "Brokers may provide their services (that is, information products) to a variety of customers either over private networks or over the Internet. Brokers that provide information over private networks generally limit their services to businesses that establish accounts with them. Brokers providing services over the Internet generally offer their services to the public at large. Law firms, businesses, law enforcement agencies, research organizations, and individuals are among those who use brokers\u2019 services. For example, lawyers, debt collectors, and private investigators may request information on an individual\u2019s bank accounts and real estate holdings for use in civil or divorce proceedings; automobile insurers may want information on whether insurance applicants have been involved in accidents or have been issued traffic citations; employers may want background checks on new hires; pension plan administrators may want information to locate pension beneficiaries; and individuals may ask for information to help locate birth parents. When requesting information, customers may ask for nationwide database searches or searches of only specific geographical areas.", "Information brokers\u2019 databases can be searched by identifiers that may include SSNs; brokers may also include SSNs along with information they provide customers.

Officials representing a bank and a credit card company\u2014businesses that provide credit\u2014told us that because it serves their interests for credit bureaus to have the most to up-to-date consumer payment histories, businesses in their industries voluntarily report customers\u2019 charge and payment transactions, accompanied by SSNs, to credit bureaus. SSNs are one of the principal identifiers credit bureaus use to update individuals\u2019 credit records with the monthly reports of credit and payment activity creditors send them. In addition, credit bureaus use SSNs provided by customers to retrieve credit reports on individuals. Credit bureau officials told us that customers are not required to provide SSNs when requesting reports, but requests without SSNs need to include enough information to sufficiently identify the individual. An official for a credit bureau trade association estimated that each national credit bureau has more than 180 million credit records. A publication by this official\u2019s trade association estimated that, combined, all three bureaus sell 600 million credit reports annually.", "Businesses such as insurance companies, collection agencies, and credit granters use SSNs to request information about customers from credit bureaus. To determine a customer\u2019s likelihood of repaying a loan, businesses\u2014banks and credit card companies in particular\u2014want information on customers\u2019 histories of repaying debts and whether customers have filed for bankruptcy or have monetary judgments against them, such as tax liens. Officials representing credit granters said most banks and credit card companies ask applicants to provide their SSNs, and these credit granters may choose to deny services to individuals who refuse.

The HMO official said SSNs are also used to integrate patients\u2019 records when providers merge, a trend that is growing. In data exchanges, hospital and HMO officials said they use SSNs to track patients\u2019 medical care across multiple providers, which helps establish the patients\u2019 medical history and avoid duplicate tests.", "A trade association official told us that some health insurers use the SSN or a variation of the number as a primary identifier, which becomes the customer\u2019s insurance number. We were told that the BlueCross BlueShield health insurance plans and the Medicare program frequently use this method. In addition, the trade association official said insurers and providers frequently match records among themselves, using SSNs to determine whether individuals have other insurance to coordinate payment of insurance benefits.", "Officials in the health care industry expect their use of SSNs to increase.

The Social Security Act authorizes states to use SSNs to administer any tax, general public assistance, driver\u2019s license, or motor vehicle registration law in order to identify individuals affected by such laws. Officials of the Maryland and Virginia personal income tax and Ohio and Georgia driver licensing programs told us that they use SSNs in both administering these programs and enforcing compliance with regulations governing the programs.", "State income tax administrators routinely use the SSN as a primary identifier in their programs. An official from an organization representing state tax administrators said that all states levying personal income taxes use SSNs to administer their programs. Tax officials said that states use SSNs to make state tax systems compatible with the federal system and to reduce taxpayer reporting burden. Maryland and Virginia tax administrators told us their state tax returns require individuals to provide their SSNs, and individuals who omit SSNs risk being considered nonfilers if tax administrators cannot otherwise identify the submitter of the return.", "Tax administrators also use SSNs internally for auditing purposes. For example, tax administration officials said they use SSNs to cross-reference owners\u2019 or officers\u2019 business income tax returns with their personal income tax returns so that an audit of one triggers an audit of the other. Also, in the course of monitoring compliance with state income tax laws, states use SSNs to exchange data with other organizations. For example, in order to monitor taxpayer income reporting, states rely on SSNs for data matches with IRS and state tax agencies to identify residents who received income from out-of-state employers and businesses and to verify credits for income taxes that filers report paying to other states. Also, when tax administrators assess liens against taxpayers, states may use SSNs to request information from information brokers and credit bureaus to identify taxpayer assets, such as bank accounts and real estate. In addition, federal and state agencies, such as IRS and state child support agencies, use SSNs when asking state tax administrators to offset state refunds otherwise due to taxpayers.", "State driver licensing agencies are more likely to use SSNs to exchange data with other organizations than to support internal activities. A few states print SSNs on licenses and use the SSNs either as license numbers or along with the state-assigned license numbers. Most state driver licensing agencies that request SSNs, however, include SSNs in driver records as a secondary identifier and devise their own license numbers. Information from the AAMVA and other sources suggests that many states request, but may not require, applicants for noncommercial driver\u2019s licenses to provide their SSNs. AAMVA officials estimate that there are about 175 million noncommercial drivers nationwide.", "To monitor driver compliance with state laws, state officials said they use SSNs during the licensing process to search national databases maintained by AAMVA to identify driver\u2019s licenses the applicant may hold in other states and determine whether the applicant has had a license suspended or revoked in another state. These officials also told us that organizations such as the courts and law enforcement agencies may choose to request driver records by SSN when they do not know the driver\u2019s license number.", "AAMVA officials expect states\u2019 use of SSNs to increase as the result of a recent federal law. Effective October 1, 2000, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 prohibits federal agencies from accepting state-issued driver\u2019s licenses as proof of identification, unless licenses satisfy federal requirements set out in the act. Specifically, states must either verify a driver\u2019s SSN with SSA and record the number in their database or display the number, visually or electronically, on the license.", "States\u2019 practices for disclosing SSNs contained in driver records vary. In states in which driver records are public information, states may disclose SSNs to individuals and organizations such as credit card companies, direct marketers, and credit bureaus. For example, Massachusetts driver licensing officials told us that their driver records are public and that the state includes individuals\u2019 license numbers (usually the SSN) when providing information to organizations or people requesting driver records."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Business and State Officials Believe Federal Laws Restricting Uses of SSNs Would Have a Negative Impact", "paragraphs": ["Officials of the programs and activities we reviewed believed their entities would be negatively affected if federal laws were enacted restricting use of SSNs. Businesses that sell personal information and state driver licensing officials, however, told us that their organizations have already voluntarily responded to concerns about their practices for disclosing SSNs. State tax administrators and credit bureau officials said that federal restrictions could hamper their ability to conduct routine internal activities. For example, representatives of these organizations said such restrictions could impede credit bureaus\u2019 ability to accurately post consumer payment and credit transactions and state tax agencies\u2019 ability to identify tax filers. Moreover, many of the officials we interviewed believed that federal restriction of their use of SSNs would hamper their ability to conduct data exchanges with other organizations. Without SSNs, state tax administrators said, it would be difficult to associate tax return information received from other tax agencies with tax information reported by residents. In addition, a health care provider said federal restrictions on SSN use could impede providers\u2019 ability to track patients\u2019 medical histories over time and among multiple providers. Also, AAMVA officials said federal restrictions could hinder states\u2019 ability to screen for applicants who try to conceal traffic violations they have acquired under other state licenses. Many of the officials we interviewed said federal restrictions on their use of SSNs could make it difficult for their organizations to be assured of receiving credit reports for the specific individuals they requested. Officials of bank and credit card companies said they rely heavily on credit reports to make decisions about providing customers service on credit.", "Officials of businesses that sell personal information and driver licensing agencies also believed that federal restrictions on SSN use could make it difficult for others to obtain specific records from them. For example, driver licensing officials said that if \u201coutsiders,\u201d such as government and law enforcement agencies, do not know the driver\u2019s license number and cannot request driver records by SSNs, these agencies can only use the driver\u2019s name and are more likely, therefore, to receive the records of other people with the same name.", "Because of privacy concerns raised by disclosure of personal information, businesses and states have become more sensitive to this issue and are voluntarily restricting the disclosure of some personal information, including SSNs. In December 1997, 14 businesses that sell personal information\u2014the self-identified industry leaders\u2014responded to these concerns by, among other things, voluntarily executing a written agreement stating their intent to restrict disclosure of SSNs associated with data they obtain from nonpublic sources. These 14 businesses essentially agreed to make SSNs from such sources available to only a limited range of customers identified as having appropriate uses for the information, such as law enforcement. The 14 organizations also agreed to annual compliance reviews by independent contractors. When an organization fails to comply with the agreement, the Federal Trade Commission can cite the organization for unfair and deceptive business practices. Because the agreement was not scheduled to be fully implemented until December 31, 1998, its effectiveness could not be determined during our review.", "In addition, some states are discontinuing practices that result in routine disclosure of SSNs. For example, since July 1, 1997, Georgia no longer automatically prints SSNs on licenses but rather assigns its own numbers for driver licenses and uses SSNs as license numbers only if requested by the license holder to do so. Ohio, which before July 29, 1998, routinely printed SSNs along with state-assigned numbers on driver\u2019s licenses, now allows drivers the option of not having SSNs printed on their licenses.

In addition, we included in our review the industry that gathers and sells personal information.

Because there are no readily available data on how extensively businesses and states use SSNs, we selected entities that are commonly known to use SSNs routinely and that affect a large number of the general public by this use. We developed information on SSN use for these entities through interviews with officials representing the selected businesses, trade organizations, and state programs.
