Other regional groups such as the Central American Common Market, the Andean Community, and the Caribbean Community have either been initiated or expanded. (See app. I for more information on the 34 countries of the Free Trade Area of the Americas.) Also, countries in the region have concluded numerous bilateral free trade and investment agreements with others in the region and worldwide. In addition, Chile and the European Union have recently started trade negotiations, while similar European Union and Mercosur negotiations are already under way.", "In December 1994, the heads of state of the 34 democratic countries in the Western Hemisphere agreed at the first Summit of the Americas in Miami, Florida, to conclude negotiations on a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) no later than 2005. The FTAA would cover a combined population of about 800 million people, more than $11 trillion in production, and $3.4 trillion in world trade. It would involve a diverse set of countries, from some of the wealthiest (the United States and Canada) to some of the poorest (Haiti) and from some of the largest (Brazil) to some of the smallest in the world (Saint Kitts and Nevis)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Free Trade Area of the Americas Agreement May Provide the United States Economic and Noneconomic Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Proponents of the FTAA contend that a successful negotiation could produce important economic benefits for the United States. The FTAA region is already important economically for the United States, purchasing about 36 percent of U.S. exports of goods and services in 1999 and receiving over 23 percent of U.S. foreign direct investment. Business groups point out that if relatively high tariffs and other market access barriers are removed, U.S. trade with the region could expand further. U.S. exports to many FTAA countries face overall average tariffs above 10 percent, whereas all 33 other countries participating in FTAA negotiations already have preferential access to the U.S. market on certain products through unilateral programs or NAFTA. In addition, some U.S. industry representatives assert that they have lost sales and market share to competitors that have preferential access into other Western Hemisphere markets through bilateral free trade agreements that exclude the United States. For example, the U.S. Trade Representative testified before the House Committee on Ways and Means in March 2001 that because of the Canada-Chile trade agreement, Canadian products will enter Chile duty free, while U.S. products face an 8 percent duty. The FTAA would help remedy this disadvantage by providing U.S. exporters with access equivalent to that provided to U.S. competitors. Supporters also assert that the FTAA would benefit the United States by stimulating increased trade and investment and enabling more efficient production by allowing businesses to produce and purchase throughout an integrated hemisphere. Beyond these economic benefits, the FTAA is widely regarded as a centerpiece of efforts to forge closer and more productive ties to Western Hemisphere nations, increase political stability, and strengthen democracy in the region."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An FTAA May Harm Some Sectors and Has Raised Other Concerns", "paragraphs": ["While an FTAA may provide benefits for the United States, it may also adversely impact certain import-competing sectors. Some U.S. business and labor groups argue that import restrictions are necessary to help them to compete against imports produced with more favorable labor costs, less restrictive environmental regulations, or imports that receive government assistance. Also, some labor and environmental groups argue that potential FTAA provisions may reduce the ability of countries to set and enforce high standards for health, safety, and the environment. For example, some opponents are concerned that the FTAA would contain NAFTA-like investment provisions, which they argue give corporations a greater ability to challenge government regulations than is provided for under domestic law. Finally, as is the case with other international trade agreements, the FTAA has drawn the attention of organizations and individuals apprehensive about the FTAA\u2019s effects on greater global integration and the resulting impact on society and the environment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Negotiators Have Succeeded in Laying Groundwork for an FTAA", "paragraphs": ["Between December 1994 and March 1998, FTAA countries laid the groundwork for an FTAA.

FTAA participants formally initiated the negotiations at the San Jos\u00e9 Ministerial and Santiago Summit of 1998, where they agreed on how the negotiations would proceed. Specifically, they agreed in 1998 at San Jos\u00e9 that the FTAA would be a single undertaking, meaning that the agreement would be completed and implemented as one whole unit instead of in parts. Ministers also agreed that the FTAA could coexist with other subregional agreements, like Mercosur and NAFTA, to the extent that the rights and obligations go beyond or are not covered by the FTAA. An eventual FTAA agreement would contain three basic components: (1) chapters on general issues and the overall architecture of the FTAA and its institutions, (2) schedules for reducing tariff and nontariff barriers, and (3) chapters on specific topics.", "The specific topics currently under negotiation include (1) market access for goods, (2) investment, (3) services, (4) government procurement, (5) dispute settlement, (6) subsidies/antidumping/ countervailing duties, (7) agriculture, (8) intellectual property rights, and (9) competition policy. As illustrated in figure 1, FTAA participants formed negotiating groups on each of these topics; agreed on a general mandate for each group; formed special committees on smaller economies, the participation of civil society, and electronic commerce; and determined that the negotiations would be led by a vice-ministerial-level Trade Negotiations Committee. Chairmanship of the negotiations changes every 18 months, with Argentina serving as the current chair, to be succeeded by Ecuador for the next round of negotiations following the April meetings. Brazil and the United States are set to co-chair the final round from November 2002 to December 2004.

As illustrated in figure 2, negotiators were directed by ministers in November 1999 to submit first drafts of their chapters to the Trade Negotiations Committee by December 2000, using annotated outlines developed in the previous phase as frames of reference. According to FTAA participants and other observers, these were ambitious goals, and working-level activity since 1998 has been fairly intense in order to meet them. They stated that merely providing the first drafts of the chapters marks important progress, as the drafts are necessary groundwork for future negotiations. Under FTAA negotiating procedures, individual countries may still propose new text to be included in the draft chapters; the removal of brackets and text can only be done by consensus.", "Third Summit Quebec City, According to U.S. and foreign negotiators, however, the draft text is heavily bracketed, indicating that agreement on specific language has not been reached. The draft text generally represents a consolidation of all proposals submitted by FTAA countries so far.

U.S. officials report that the FTAA countries immediately began to implement all 10 transparency measures and are in various stages of carrying out the customs measures. Outside of the concrete accomplishments, many observers feel the negotiations have greatly improved coordination and provided a broader understanding of trade and its impacts among FTAA countries, in part through technical assistance in the form of reports, databases, seminars, and financial assistance provided by the Inter- American Development Bank, the Organization of American States, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Significant Challenges Ahead for the FTAA Process", "paragraphs": ["A number of challenges must be overcome in order to successfully complete the FTAA.

However, negotiators have not yet begun to bargain on the agreement\u2019s detailed rules or market access concessions, and vice-ministers have not begun to formulate the agreement\u2019s institutional structure. Negotiators will conduct their work in an environment filled with challenges, due to the complex and controversial character of some of the issues, and the diverse nature and fluid political and economic condition of the participants.

For example, agricultural support measures and antidumping provisions are widely understood to be controversial; observers feel that some of the more difficult issues will not be resolved until the deadline for completing the negotiations. Other negotiating groups\u2019 tasks are complex by virtue of the extent of the subject matter to be covered. For example, the market access negotiating group is responsible not only for the elimination of tariffs but also for devising rules of origin, customs procedures, safeguards, and technical barriers to trade. Other negotiating groups\u2019 tasks are complex because they break new ground for many of the FTAA countries.

Decisions on these procedural matters are especially important for five of the nine negotiating groups: market access, agriculture, government procurement, investment, and services.

For example, the United States seeks broad improvements in trade rules and access, in addition to the lowering of regional tariffs;  Brazil is primarily interested in gaining access to certain sectors of the U.S. market in which it faces relatively high barriers; the smaller economy countries are interested in protecting their economies from becoming overwhelmed by the larger ones while securing special treatment in an eventual FTAA; and  Mexico has less economic incentive to pursue an FTAA because it already has preferential access to most hemispheric markets through a comprehensive network of free trade arrangements.", "Finally, several FTAA experts told us that the 2005 deadline has seemed far away to many participants, thus sapping needed momentum from the negotiating process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Achieving Consensus", "paragraphs": ["The FTAA negotiating process is challenging because it requires consensus.

This proposal was met with steadfast opposition by some FTAA countries, but the United States was ultimately accommodated with the creation of the Committee of Government Representatives on the Participation of Civil Society. The Committee, which is to provide a vehicle for public input on these issues, remains a point of contention for both the United States and some of its FTAA partners.

For example, the market access negotiating group, which has a very broad portfolio of issues, was not able to be broken up into more manageable components because of resource capacity limitations.

In addition, the United States had not developed its negotiating position for several important issues. Some FTAA experts told us that they believed the United States did not have a mandate to make meaningful concessions on market access, which are, in their view, necessary to complete an agreement. In addition, some experts believe that progress in the FTAA in certain areas such as agriculture is reliant on progress in the WTO. Meanwhile, economic hardship and political uncertainty have made some participants more reluctant to pursue an FTAA.

In particular, FTAA experts and participants have been closely following the debate within the United States on the overall direction of U.S. trade policy and its implications for the FTAA. Some FTAA participants believe that the United States has been distracted from pursuing trade liberalization because it lacks a domestic consensus on the benefits of trade and the way in which to handle the overlap between trade and labor rights and the environment. Several told us that they believed the absence of trade promotion authority has hampered the process to the extent that other countries have held back making concessions on free trade agreement rules and procedures. Others stated that the primary cost of the President\u2019s lack of trade promotion authority was in giving others an excuse to slow progress. Many observers we consulted believe that trade promotion authority is essential for the next phase of negotiations, particularly completion of the market access concessions. These experts said that the foreign partners will not make significant concessions unless they have credible assurance that the deal will not come undone when submitted to Congress for approval.", "Concerns also exist about Brazil\u2019s commitment to the FTAA process. Even though Brazil has actively participated in the negotiations, observers have noted that Brazil has appeared reticent to embrace an FTAA, and Brazilian officials admit that Brazil has held back during the negotiations. They explained that this reticence is because they believe the United States is not ready to negotiate on issues of greatest interest to Brazil such as high U.S. tariffs on key Brazilian exports and changes to the U.S.\u2019s antidumping regime.

Past summits have been used to make major advancements in the FTAA process. For example, the first summit, held in Miami in 1994, resulted in the leaders\u2019 commitment to achieve the vision of an FTAA by 2005. The April Summit will engage President Bush and other newly elected heads of state in the FTAA process and provide an opportunity for all 34 leaders to renew their countries\u2019 political commitment to the FTAA. Doing so at this time is particularly important, because the phase of negotiations where countries set out initial positions is ending. The next phase is expected to narrow the many substantive differences that remain, which will require political direction and support.", "The April meetings will provide an indication of the U.S.\u2019s and other countries\u2019 willingness to make the effort and tough choices required for the bargaining that lies ahead. The April meetings also represent an opportunity to generate interest in and support of the FTAA within the U.S. Congress, the U.S. business community, and the U.S. public. This support will be crucial if the United States is to provide the forceful leadership many FTAA participants believe is necessary for concluding a deal. It is also required for ultimate approval of an FTAA in Congress and in the U.S. \u201ccourt of public opinion.\u201d Until recently, congressional interest in the FTAA has been limited, and business support has been muted, according to both business and government officials.

For example, Chile has floated the idea of moving up the target date for completion of the negotiations to December 31, 2003, with a final agreement entering into effect on January 1, 2005. This idea of accelerating negotiations is still being debated within and among FTAA governments and may be actively discussed at the April meetings.

The issue of transparency is also controversial domestically. U.S. negotiators note that releasing the text could hamper their flexibility in exploring creative options to obtain their objectives.
