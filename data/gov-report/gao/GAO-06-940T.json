One of GAO's investigators, posing as an employee of a fictitious company located in Washington, D.C., stated that the purpose of his purchase was to use the radioactive sources to calibrate personal radiation detection pagers. The purchase was not challenged because suppliers are not required to determine whether prospective buyers have legitimate uses for radioactive sources, nor are suppliers required to ask a buyer to produce an NRC document when purchasing in small quantities. The amount of radioactive sources GAO's investigator sought to purchase did not require an NRC document. Subsequently, the company mailed the radioactive sources to an address in Washington D.C. The radiation portal monitors properly signaled the presence of radioactive material when our two teams of investigators conducted simultaneous border crossings. Our investigators' vehicles were inspected in accordance with most of the CBP policy at both the northern and southern borders. However, GAO's investigators, using counterfeit documents, were able to enter the United States with enough radioactive sources in the trunks of their vehicles to make two dirty bombs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a dirty bomb is a mix of explosives, such as dynamite, with radioactive powder or pellets. When the dynamite or other explosives are set off, the blast carries radioactive material into the surrounding area. The direct costs of cleanup and the indirect losses in trade and business in the contaminated areas could be large. Hence, dirty bombs are generally considered to be weapons of mass disruption instead of weapons of mass destruction. GAO investigators were able to successfully represent themselves as employees of a fictitious company present a counterfeit bill of lading and a counterfeit NRC document during the secondary inspections at both locations. The CBP inspectors never questioned the authenticity of the investigators' counterfeit bill of lading or the counterfeit NRC document authorizing them to receive, acquire, possess, and transfer radioactive sources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our investigation of potential  security weaknesses associated with the installation of radiation detection  equipment at U.S. ports of entry. To address the threat of dirty bombs and  other nuclear material, the federal government has programs in place that  regulate the transportation of radioactive sources and to prevent illegal  transport of radioactive sources across our nation\u2019s borders. The  Department of Homeland Security through the U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP) uses radiation detection equipment at ports of entry to  prevent such illicit entry of radioactive sources. The goal of CBP\u2019s  inspection program is to \u201c\u2026thwart the operations of terrorist  organizations by detecting, disrupting, and preventing the cross-border  travel of terrorists, terrorist funding, and terrorist implements, including  Weapons of Mass Destruction and their precursors.\u201d Deploying radiation  detection equipment is part of CBP\u2019s strategy for thwarting radiological  terrorism and CBP is using a range of such equipment to meet its goal of  screening all cargo, vehicles, and individuals coming into the United  States.", "Most travelers enter the United States through the nation\u2019s 154 land border  ports of entry. CBP inspectors at ports of entry are responsible for the  primary inspection of travelers to determine their admissibility into the  United States and to enforce laws related to preventing the entry of  contraband, such as drugs and weapons of mass destruction.", "Our investigation was conducted as a result of widespread congressional  and public interest in the security of our nation\u2019s borders, given today\u2019s  unprecedented terrorism threat environment. Our investigation was  conducted under the premise that given today\u2019s security environment, our  nation\u2019s borders must be protected from the smuggling of radioactive  sources by terrorists.", "This testimony will provide the results of our work related to testing  whether the radiation portal monitors installed at the U.S. ports of entry  would detect radioactive sources transported in vehicles attempting to  enter the United States. We will also provide our observations regarding  the procedures that CBP inspectors followed when the radiation portal  monitors detected such material.  In addition, at the request of the  Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, we issued in  March 2006 a detailed report with corrective action briefings to CBP and  the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) on the results of our  undercover border crossing tests.", "We selected two land ports of entry that had radiation portal monitors  installed: one at the U.S.-Canadian border and one at the U.S.-Mexican  border. Radiation portal monitors are large pieces of stationary equipment  that CBP uses as part of its overall strategy to thwart radiological  terrorism by detecting the presence of radioactive sources by screening  people, vehicles, and cargo as they pass through ports of entry. In order to  safely plan and execute our undercover operation, several of our  investigators attended training at the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Our investigators received  training on the safe handling, storage, and transport of radioactive  sources.", "When considering the type of radioactive sources to use in our undercover  operation, we decided to use one of the most common radioisotopes used  in industry for its strong radioactivity and also used in medical therapy to  treat cancer. After consulting with an outside expert, we used an amount  of radioactive sources that we determined was sufficient to manufacture a  dirty bomb. A dirty bomb would most likely result in small radiation  exposures and would typically not contain enough radiation to kill people  or cause severe illnesses. However, by scattering the radioactive material,  the dirty bomb has the effect of contaminating an area. The extent of local  contamination depends on several factors, including the size of the  explosive, the amount and type of radioactive material used, and weather  conditions. While there could be an increase in the cancer risk among  those exposed to radiation from a dirty bomb, the more significant effect  of a dirty bomb could be the closing of contaminated areas. The direct  costs of cleanup and the indirect losses in trade and business in the  contaminated areas could be large. Hence, dirty bombs are generally  considered to be weapons of mass disruption instead of weapons of mass  destruction.", "As part of our investigation, we purchased a small quantity of the  radioactive sources from a commercial source by posing as an employee  of a fictitious company. This was to demonstrate that anyone can purchase  small quantities of radioactive sources for stockpiling because suppliers  are not required to exercise due diligence to determine whether the buyer  has a legitimate use for the radioactive sources and suppliers are not  required to ask the buyer to produce an NRC document when making  purchases in small quantities. We then deployed two teams of  investigators to the field to make simultaneous border crossings at the  northern and southern borders in an attempt to transport radioactive  sources into the United States.", "While making our simultaneous crossings, we focused our investigation on  whether the radiation portal monitors would detect the radioactive  sources we carried and whether CBP inspectors exercised due diligence to  determine the authenticity of paperwork presented by individuals  attempting to transport radioactive sources across our borders. Although  we offer observations on the procedures that CBP inspectors followed for  our two border crossings, we did not evaluate the adequacy of the design  or effectiveness of those procedures. Our investigation also tested whether  an NRC document could be counterfeited using data easily accessible and  available to the public.
