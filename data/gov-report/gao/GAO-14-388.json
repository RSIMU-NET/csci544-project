Treasury had received about $225 billion from its CPP investments, exceeding the approximately $205 billion it had disbursed. Most institutions exited by repurchasing their preferred shares in full or by refinancing their investments through other federal programs. Treasury also continues to sell its investments in the institutions through auctions; a strategy first implemented in March 2012 to expedite the exit of a number of CPP participants. As of January 31, 2014, Treasury has sold all or part of its CPP investment in 162 institutions through auctions, receiving a total of about 80 percent of the principal amount. A relatively small number of the remaining 83 institutions accounted for most of the outstanding investments.

Treasury estimated a lifetime gain of $16.1 billion for CPP as of November 30, 2013.", "GAO's analysis of financial data found that the institutions remaining in CPP were generally less financially healthy than those that have exited or that never participated. In particular, the remaining CPP institutions tended to be less profitable, hold riskier assets, and have lower capital levels and reserves.

Treasury determined that  strengthening capital levels was the more effective mechanism to help  stabilize financial markets, encourage interbank lending, and increase  confidence in lenders and investors. Treasury believed that strengthening  the capital positions of viable financial institutions would enhance  confidence in the institutions themselves and the financial system overall  and increase the institutions\u2019 capacity to undertake new lending and  support the economy. On October 14, 2008, Treasury allocated $250  billion of the original $700 billion in overall TARP funds for CPP.

For example,  later auctions have tended to include smaller institutions with more  cumulative missed payments. In a few cases, the prospect of recouping  these missed payments made the institutions particularly attractive to  investors and helped raise the sale price of those securities above their  par value.
