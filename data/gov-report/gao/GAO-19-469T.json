Some of these settlements included civil penalties\u2014fines for wrongdoing that do not require proof of harm\u2014for FCRA violations or violations of consent orders. However, FTC does not have civil penalty authority for violations of requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), which, unlike FCRA, includes a provision directing federal regulators and FTC to establish standards for financial institutions to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security of customer records. To obtain monetary redress for these violations, FTC must identify affected consumers and any monetary harm they may have experienced. However, harm resulting from privacy and security violations can be difficult to measure and can occur years in the future, making it difficult to trace a particular harm to a specific breach. As a result, FTC lacks a practical enforcement tool for imposing civil money penalties that could help to deter companies, including CRAs, from violating data security provisions of GLBA and its implementing regulations.", "Since 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has had five public settlements with CRAs. Four of these settlements included alleged violations of FCRA; and three included alleged violations of unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices provisions. CFPB is also responsible for supervising larger CRAs (those with more than $7 million in annual receipts from consumer reporting) but lacks the data needed to ensure identification of all CRAs that meet this threshold. Identifying additional sources of information on these CRAs, such as by requiring them to register with the agency through a rulemaking or leveraging state registration information, could help CFPB ensure that it can comprehensively carry out its supervisory responsibilities. After the Equifax breach, CFPB used its existing supervisory authority to examine the data security of certain CRAs. CFPB's process for prioritizing which CRAs to examine does not routinely include an assessment of companies' data security risks, but doing so could help CFPB better detect such risks and prevent the further exposure or compromise of consumer information.", "Consumers can take actions to mitigate the risk of identity theft\u2014such as implementing a fraud alert or credit freeze\u2014and can file a complaint with FTC or CFPB. However, consumers are limited in the direct actions they can take against CRAs. Consumers generally cannot exercise choice in the consumer reporting market\u2014such as by choosing which CRAs maintain their information\u2014if they are dissatisfied with a CRA's privacy or security practices. In addition, according to CFPB, consumers cannot remove themselves from the consumer reporting market entirely."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its February 2019 report, GAO recommended that Congress consider giving FTC civil penalty authority to enforce GLBA's safeguarding provisions. GAO also recommended that CFPB (1) identify additional sources of information on larger CRAs, and (2) reassess its prioritization of examinations to address CRA data security.

CFPB, created in 2010 by the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank  Act), has enforcement authority over all CRAs for violations of certain  consumer financial protection laws. In general, it also has the authority to  issue regulations and guidance for those laws. CFPB has supervisory  authority over larger market participants in the consumer reporting  market. In 2012, CFPB defined larger market participant CRAs as those  with more than $7 million in annual receipts from consumer reporting.  CFPB\u2019s supervision of these companies includes monitoring, inspecting,  and examining them for compliance with the requirements of certain  federal consumer financial laws and regulations. As discussed below,  these laws include most provisions of the Fair Credit Reporting Act  (FCRA); several provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA); and  provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act concerning unfair, deceptive, or abusive  acts or practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Breaches and the Equifax Breach", "paragraphs": ["Although there is no commonly agreed-upon definition of \u201cdata breach,\u201d  the term generally refers to an unauthorized or unintentional exposure,  disclosure, or loss of sensitive information. This information can include  personally identifiable information such as Social Security numbers, or  financial information such as credit card numbers. A data breach can be  inadvertent, such as from the loss of an electronic device; or deliberate,  such as the theft of a device or a cyber-based attack by individuals or  groups, including an organization\u2019s own employees, foreign nationals, or  terrorists. Data breaches have occurred at all types of organizations,  including private, nonprofit, and federal and state entities.", "In the Equifax data breach, Equifax system administrators discovered on  July 29, 2017, that intruders had gained unauthorized access via the  Internet to a server housing the company\u2019s online dispute portal. The  breach compromised the personally identifiable information of at least  145.5 million individuals, and included names, addresses, and birth dates;  and credit card, driver\u2019s license, and Social Security numbers. Equifax\u2019s  investigation of the breach identified the following factors that led to the  breach: software vulnerabilities, failure to detect malicious traffic, failure to  isolate databases from each other, and inadequately limiting access to  sensitive information such as usernames and passwords. Equifax\u2019s public  filings after the breach noted that the company took steps to improve  security and notify individuals about the breach.

As we reported in  February 2019, according to FTC, in the last 10 years, it has brought 34  enforcement actions for FCRA violations, including 17 against CRAs. In  addition, FTC said that it has taken 66 actions against companies (not  just in the last 10 years), including CRAs, that allegedly engaged in unfair  or deceptive practices relating to data protection.", "In some circumstances, FTC enforcement authority can include civil  money penalties\u2014monetary fines imposed for a violation of a statute or  regulation. However, FTC\u2019s civil penalty authority does not extend to  initial violations of GLBA\u2019s privacy and safeguarding provisions. These  provisions require administrative, physical, and technical safeguards with  an emphasis on protection against anticipated threats and unauthorized  access to customer records. For violations of GLBA provisions, FTC may  seek an injunction to stop a company from violating these provisions and  may seek redress (damages to compensate consumers for losses) or  disgorgement (requirement for wrongdoers to give up profits or other  gains illegally obtained).", "Determining the appropriate amount of consumer compensation requires  FTC to identify the consumers affected and the amount of monetary harm  they suffered. In cases involving security or privacy violations resulting  from data breaches, assessing monetary harm can be difficult. In  addition, consumers may not be aware that their identities have been  stolen as a result of a breach and or identity theft, and related harm may  occur years in the future. It can also be difficult to trace instances of  identity theft to specific data breaches. According to FTC staff, these  factors can make it difficult for the agency to identify which individuals  were victimized as a result of a particular breach and to what extent they  were harmed and then obtain related restitution or disgorgement. Having  civil penalty authority for GLBA provisions would allow FTC to fine a  company for a violation such as a data breach without needing to prove  the monetary harm to individual consumers. FTC staff noted that in the  case of a data breach, each consumer record exposed could constitute a  violation; as a result, a data breach that involved a large number of  consumer records could result in substantial fines.", "In 2006, we suggested that Congress consider providing FTC with civil  penalty authority for its enforcement of GLBA\u2019s privacy and safeguarding  provisions. We noted that this authority would give FTC a practical tool  to more effectively enforce provisions related to security of data and  consumer information. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Congress  introduced several bills related to data protection and identity theft, which  included giving FTC civil penalty authority for its enforcement of GLBA.  However, in the final adoption of these laws, Congress did not provide  FTC with this authority. Since that time, data breaches at Equifax and  other large organizations have highlighted the need to better protect  sensitive personal information. Accordingly, we continue to believe FTC  and consumers would benefit if FTC had such authority, and we  recommended in our February 2019 report that Congress consider  providing FTC with civil penalty authority for the privacy and safeguarding  provisions of GLBA to help ensure that the agency has the tools it needs  to most effectively act against data privacy and security violations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFPB Enforces and Examines CRAs for Compliance with Consumer Protection Laws but Does Not Fully Consider Data Security in Prioritizing Examinations", "paragraphs": ["CFPB enforces compliance with most provisions of FCRA; several  provisions of GLBA; and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive  acts or practices under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Four of these settlements included alleged violations of  FCRA, and three included alleged violations of provisions related to  unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices. CFPB also has an ongoing  investigation of Equifax\u2019s data breach.", "Under its existing authority, CFPB has examined several larger market  participant CRAs, but may not be identifying all CRAs that meet the $7  million threshold. CFPB staff told us that as of October 2018, they were  tracking between 10 and 15 CRAs that might qualify as larger market  participants. CFPB staff told us that they believe the CRA market is highly  concentrated and there were not likely to be many larger market  participants beyond the 10 to 15 they are tracking. However, CFPB staff  said that the 10 to 15 CRAs may not comprise the entirety of larger  market participants, because CRAs\u2019 receipts form consumer reporting  may vary from year to year, and CFPB has limited data to determine  whether CRAs meet the threshold.", "Our January 2009 report on reforming the U.S. financial regulatory  structure noted that regulators should be able to identify institutions and  products that pose risks to the financial system, and monitor similar  institutions consistently. CFPB could identify CRAs that meet the larger  market participant threshold by requiring such businesses to register with it, subject to a rulemaking process and cost-benefit analysis of the burden  it could impose on the industry. Another method CFPB could use to  identify CRAs subject to its oversight would be to leverage information  collected by states. We recommended in February 2019 that CFPB  identify additional sources of information, such as through registering  CRAs or leveraging state information, that would help ensure the agency  is tracking all CRAs subject to its authority. CFPB neither agreed nor  disagreed with our recommendation.", "Each year CFPB determines the institutions (for example, banks, credit  unions, non-bank mortgage servicers, and CRAs) and the consumer  product lines that pose the greatest risk to consumers, and prioritizes  these for examinations. CFPB segments the consumer product market  into institution product lines, or specific institutions\u2019 offerings of consumer  product lines. CFPB then assesses each institution product line\u2019s risk to  consumers at the market level and institutional level. To assess risk at the  market level, CFPB considers market size and other factors that  contribute to market risk. To assess risk at the institution level, CFPB  considers an institution\u2019s market share within a product line, as well as  field and market intelligence. Field and market intelligence includes  quantitative and qualitative information on an institution\u2019s operations for a  given product line, including the strength of its compliance management  systems, the number of regulatory actions directed at the institution,  findings from prior CFPB examinations, and the number and severity of  consumer complaints CFPB has received about the institution.", "CFPB then determines specific areas of compliance to assess by  considering sources such as consumer complaints, public filings and  reports, and past examination findings related to the same or similar  products or institutions. Most recently, CFPB examinations of CRA\u2019s  consumer reporting have focused on issues such as data accuracy,  dispute processes, compliance management, and permissible purposes.", "Although CFPB\u2019s examination prioritization incorporates several important  factors and sources, the process does not routinely include assessments  of data security risk, such as how institutions detect and respond to cyber  threats. CFPB staff said the bureau cannot examine for or enforce  compliance with the data security standards in provisions of GLBA and  FCRA or FTC\u2019s implementing rules, even at larger participant CRAs. After  the Equifax breach, however, CFPB used its existing supervisory  authority to develop internal guidelines for examining data security, and  conducted some CRA data security examinations. CFPB staff said that  they do not routinely consider data security risks during their examination  prioritization process and have not reassessed the process to determine  how to incorporate such risks going forward.", "Statute requires CFPB to consider risks posed to consumers in the  relevant product and geographic markets in its risk-based supervision  program. In addition, federal internal control standards state that agencies  should identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined  objectives. This can entail considering all significant internal and external  factors to identify risks and their significance, including magnitude of  impact, likelihood of occurrence, nature of the risk, and appropriate  response. In light of the Equifax breach, as well as CFPB\u2019s  acknowledgment of the CRA market as a higher-risk market for  consumers, it is important for CFPB to routinely consider factors that  could inform the extent of CRA data security risk such as the number of  consumers that could be affected by a data security incident and the  nature of potential harm resulting from the loss or exposure of  information. In our February 2019 report, we recommended that CFPB  assess whether its process for prioritizing CRA examinations sufficiently  incorporates the data security risks CRAs pose to consumers, and take  any needed steps identified by the assessment to more sufficiently  incorporate these risks. CFPB neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Inform Consumers about Protections Available and Consumers Can Take Some Actions after a CRA Data Breach", "paragraphs": ["In our February 2019 report, we noted that FTC and CFPB provide  educational information for consumers on ways to mitigate the risk of  identity theft. In addition, after a breach, FTC and CFPB publish  information specific to that breach. For example, shortly after Equifax\u2019s  announcement of the breach, FTC published information on when the  breach occurred, the types of data compromised, and links to additional  information on Equifax\u2019s website. Similarly, CFPB released three blog  posts and several social media posts that included information on ways  that consumers could protect themselves in the wake of the breach and  special protections and actions for service members.", "At any time, consumers can take actions to help mitigate the risk of  identity theft. For example, consumers can implement a credit freeze free  of charge, which can help prevent new-account fraud by restricting  potential creditors from accessing the consumer\u2019s credit report.  Similarly, implementing a free fraud alert with a credit bureau can help  prevent fraud because it requires a business to verify a consumer\u2019s  identity before issuing credit. However, consumers are limited in the  direct actions they can take against a CRA in the event of a data breach,  for two primary reasons. First, consumers generally cannot determine the  source of the data used to commit identity theft. As a result, it can be  difficult to link a breach by a CRA (or any other entity) to the harm a  consumer suffers from a particular incidence of identity theft, which  makes it challenging to prevail in a legal action. Second, unlike with many  other products and services, consumers generally cannot exercise choice if they are dissatisfied with a CRA\u2019s privacy or security practices.  Specifically, consumers cannot choose which CRAs maintain information  on them. In addition, consumers do not have a legal right to delete their  records with CRAs, according to CFPB staff, and therefore cannot choose  to remove themselves entirely from the CRA market.", "FTC and CFPB have noted that the level of consumer protection required  can depend on the consumer\u2019s ability to exercise choice in a marketplace.  For example, when determining whether a practice constitutes an unfair  practice, FTC considers whether the practice is one that consumers could  choose to avoid. Similarly, according to CFPB staff, the consumer  reporting market may pose higher risk to consumers because consumers  cannot choose whether or which CRAs possess and sell their information.", "Chairman Krishnamoorthi, Ranking Member Cloud, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared remarks.
