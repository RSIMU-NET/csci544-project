The reporting relationships between field staff and SBA headquarters vary depending on the program. For example, field staff who implement government contracting programs report to OGCBD, while most staff who implement the 8(a) business development program report to the Office of Field Operations (OFO), which oversees SBA's field offices. SBA officials told GAO that this reporting structure, in which some field staff implement OGCBD programs but report to OFO, offers some benefits\u2014for example, it allows these staff to support the goals of OGCBD programs as well as those of the individual field offices. However, officials also said the reporting structure can result in inconsistent program delivery. They described recent steps to improve communication between OGCBD and field staff, but it is too soon to tell if these steps will be effective.", "SBA has taken some steps to address weaknesses GAO and the SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG) have identified in its processes for certifying small businesses as eligible to participate in SBA programs, but some recommendations remain open. For example, GAO found in 2015 that SBA had not required firms seeking recertification for the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program to submit any information to verify continued eligibility and instead relied on firms' attestations of continued eligibility. GAO recommended that SBA assess the HUBZone recertification process and add additional controls; SBA had not yet implemented this recommendation as of May 2017. SBA's OIG also found in 2016 that SBA managers overturned lower-level reviewers' decisions to deny firms admission to the 8(a) program without documenting in the information system how eligibility concerns were resolved. SBA's OIG recommended that SBA clearly document the justification for approving or denying firms. In response, SBA stated that managers are now required to document decisions in the system that differ from those of lower-level reviewers.", "A number of legal requirements and the volume of required rule makings, among other factors, affect the timeliness of SBA's rule-making process. Certain stages of the rule-making process have mandated time periods, such as the required 90-day interagency review process for certain rules. Various approaches exist for measuring the length of time required to develop and issue final rules, but they have limitations. For example, in measuring the period from rule initiation to final publication, agencies may differ on when they mark initiation. For four finalized SBA rules GAO reviewed, the time from publication of the proposed rule to publication of the final rule varied from 7.5 months to 17.5 months. SBA officials noted that an increase in the number of statutorily mandated rules in recent years has contributed to delays in the agency's ability to promulgate rules in a more timely fashion.

SBA has addressed a number of these recommendations;  however, some remain outstanding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HUBZone Program", "paragraphs": ["SBA has made some improvements to address problems we identified  with the HUBZone program\u2019s certification and recertification processes.  For example, in June 2008 we reported that, for its HUBZone certification  process, SBA relied on data that firms entered in the online application system and performed limited verification of the self-reported  information. Although agency staff had the discretion to request  additional supporting documentation, SBA did not have specific guidance  or criteria for such requests. Consequently, we recommended that SBA  develop and implement guidance to more routinely and consistently  obtain supporting documentation upon application. In response to that  recommendation, SBA revised its certification process, and since 2009  has required firms to provide documentation, which SBA officials review  to determine the firms\u2019 eligibility for the HUBZone program. SBA then  performs a full-document review on all applications as part of its initial  certification process to determine firms\u2019 eligibility for the program. We  have closed this recommendation as implemented.", "We have also identified a number of concerns with SBA\u2019s HUBZone  recertification process. For example, in February 2015 we reported that  SBA relied on firms\u2019 attestations of continued eligibility and generally did  not request supporting documentation as part of the recertification  process. SBA only required firms to submit a notarized recertification  form stating that their eligibility information was accurate. SBA officials did  not believe they needed to request supporting documentation from  recertifying firms because all firms in the program had undergone a full  document review, either at initial application or during SBA\u2019s review of its  legacy portfolio in fiscal years 2010\u20132012. However, as we found, the  characteristics of firms and the status of HUBZone areas\u2014the bases for  program eligibility\u2014often can change and need to be monitored. As a  result, we concluded that SBA lacked reasonable assurance that only  qualified firms were allowed to continue in the HUBZone program and  receive preferential contracting treatment. We recommended that SBA  reassess the recertification process and implement additional controls,  such as developing criteria and guidance on using a risk-based approach  to requesting and verifying firm information.", "In following up on this recommendation for our March 2016 report on  opportunities to improve HUBZone oversight, we found that SBA had not  yet implemented guidance for when to request supporting documents) for  the recertification process because SBA officials believed that any  potential risk of fraud would be mitigated by site visits to firms.  According to data that SBA provided, the agency visited a fraction of  certified firms each year during fiscal years 2013 through 2015. SBA\u2019s  reliance on site visits alone did not mitigate the recertification weaknesses  that were the basis for our recommendation. The officials also cited  resource limitations. In recognition of SBA\u2019s resource constraints, we  reiterated in our March 2016 report that SBA could apply a risk-based  approach to its recertification process to review and verify information  from firms that appear to pose the most risk to the program. In addition,  as of February 2017, SBA officials told us that the agency had begun  implementing a technology-based solution to address some of the  ongoing challenges with the recertification process. The officials  expected that the new solution would help them better assess firms and  implement risk-based controls by the end of calendar year 2017. As of  May 2017, this recommendation remains open.", "We also found in June 2008 and again in February 2015 that the  recertification process was backlogged\u2014that is, firms were not being  recertified within the required 3-year time frame. In 2015, we reported  that as of September 2014, SBA was recertifying firms that had been first  certified 4 years previously. While SBA initially eliminated the backlog  following our 2008 report, according to SBA officials the backlog recurred  due to limitations with the program\u2019s computer system and resource  constraints. Consequently, in February 2015 we again recommended that  SBA take steps to ensure that significant backlogs would not recur. In  response to the recommendation, SBA made some changes to its  recertification process. For example, instead of manually identifying firms  for recertification twice a year, SBA automated the notification process,  enabling notices to be sent daily to firms (to respond to and attest that  they continued to meet the eligibility requirements for the program).  According to SBA officials, as of February 2017 this change had not yet  eliminated the backlog."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "8(a) Business Development Program", "paragraphs": ["SBA has made improvements to address problems we identified with the  8(a) program\u2019s process to help ensure firms\u2019 continuing eligibility.

SBA has  taken steps to address the six recommendations, and we have closed all  six as implemented. For example, we recommended that SBA monitor  and provide additional guidance and training to district offices on the  procedures used to determine continuing eligibility. In response to this  recommendation, SBA issued revised regulations that provided additional  8(a) program eligibility requirements and criteria related to size standards,  indicators of economic disadvantage, and other thresholds businesses  must meet to maintain eligibility. In addition, SBA indicated that under its  Field Accountability Review program it conducts oversight of SBA district  offices using audit-like steps to measure performance and compliance  regarding federal statutory mandates, regulations, and SBA policy and  procedures. According to SBA, one of the areas covered by the Field  Accountability Review on-site visits is the 8(a) annual compliance reviews  of participating firms.", "In April 2016, SBA\u2019s OIG reported that SBA failed to properly document  that 8(a) firms admitted into the program met all eligibility criteria. SBA\u2019s  OIG evaluated SBA\u2019s eligibility determination process for admitting 48  applicants in the 8(a) program between January 1, 2015, and May 31,  2015, and found that 30 of the participants did not meet all of the eligibility  criteria. SBA\u2019s OIG found that SBA managers had overturned lower-level  reviewers\u2019 recommendations for denial without fully documenting how all  of the identified areas of eligibility concerns were resolved. SBA\u2019s OIG  recommended that SBA (1) clearly document its justification for approving  or denying applicants into the 8(a) program, particularly when those  decisions differed from lower-level recommendations, and (2) provide  documentation showing how eligibility concerns raised by lower-level  reviewers were resolved for the 30 firms not documented. In response to  the first recommendation, SBA noted in a written response to us that it  had established a practice of noting a statement of difference in cases  where decisions differed; however, the SBA OIG had yet to close this  recommendation as of May 2017. According to the SBA OIG, this  recommendation will remain open until this practice is documented in an  SOP or desk guide for the program. In response to the second  recommendation, SBA\u2019s OIG noted that SBA provided the SBA OIG with  documentation showing how the eligibility concerns were resolved for the  30 firms not documented, and this recommendation was closed as  implemented.

As a result, we found that SBA cannot  provide reasonable assurance that certifiers fulfill the requirements of  their role and that firms that attest that they are eligible for the program  are actually eligible.

SBA\u2019s  OIG recommended that SBA perform eligibility examinations on the firms  identified in the report as potentially ineligible.

SBA relies on two SOP documents  that outline procedures and responsibilities for rule making at the agency.  One SOP on Federal Register documents identifies the procedures and  responsibilities for obtaining internal clearance (the agreement of various  offices within SBA and ultimately the signature of the Administrator)  before publishing documents to the Federal Register, and includes details  on how to format Federal Register proposed and final rules and the  offices involved in reviewing documents. This SOP does not include  specific information on required timelines for this process. The other SOP  on SBA\u2019s Office of Executive Secretariat includes, in part, additional  information on clearance procedures before documents can be published  in the Federal Register.

This interagency review period requires 90 days, but the actual  amount of time for this review varies. Sometimes the rule may be sent  back to SBA where the process starts over again. According to SBA  officials, if other agencies have no comments, the interagency review  period can take 4 to 5 months.", "After the proposed rule passes interagency review, it goes back  through OGCBD clearance and agency-wide clearance by the  Administrator before being added to the Federal Register for public  comment.

After these reviews are completed, the rule  is then published in the Federal Register.", "Rules that only apply to SBA (and that do not need to go to OMB to  amend the FAR) have an effective date 30 days after issuance. For rules  that amend the FAR, a statement is drafted by OPPL and the FAR team  drafts proposed and final rules. It takes the FAR Council at least a year  between proposed and final rule to complete a FAR amendment,  according to SBA staff.", "For SBA and the federal government more broadly, certain stages of the  rule-making process have mandated time periods, as shown in figure 2.  For example, the public comment period recommended by Executive  Order 12866 is 60 days. In addition, the interagency comment period  managed by OMB requires 90 days, and this review can occur prior to the  publishing of both the proposed rule and the final rule. Other stages have  no time requirements but also add to the overall length of the process,  such as the time required to research, analyze, and draft a proposed rule.", "Timelines for promulgating rules varied across four finalized SBA rules we  reviewed.

Three of the four rules we reviewed were  identified as requiring the OMB interagency review process, which  lasted longer than 90 days in some cases. Of these three rules, one  (the Lower Tier Subcontracting rule) was under review with OMB for  less than the required 90 day review period (86 days); the other two  required 107 and 156 days for this review process. Further, these  three rules also underwent an additional interagency review process  after SBA had obtained public comments, which required an  additional 68 to 75 days each.", "Public comment period. In addition, SBA officials noted that the  public comment period varied in some cases, with extended comment  periods being added as necessary. For example, for the All Small  Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 rule, SBA initially provided a 60-day comment period,  but extended it by an additional 30 days in response to public request.  Likewise, for the Limitations on Subcontracting rule, SBA reopened  the initial 60-day comment period for an additional 30 days starting  about a week after the initial comment period ended.", "Statutory deadlines. Finally, three of the four rules arose from  statutes that required the final rule to be issued within a set period of  time. Both the All Small Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 rule and the Advisory Size  Decisions rule were required to be issued as final within 270 days of  the law\u2019s enactment, while the Lower Tier Subcontracting rule  required a final rule to be issued by 18 months after the date of  enactment. The All Small Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 rule took 1,300 days from  the date of the law\u2019s enactment to the issuance of the final rule, which  was 1,030 days past the statutory deadline. The Advisory Size  Decisions rule took 770 days, which was 500 days past the statutory  deadline. The Lower Tier Subcontracting rule took almost exactly 18  months longer than the statutory deadline.", "SBA officials noted some factors that may have contributed to certain  rules taking longer than anticipated in recent years. They explained that  the volume of rule making required of SBA has increased in recent years.  Agency officials said they were used to receiving such legislation in  stand-alone bills every couple of years until Congress began including  rule-making requirements for SBA in NDAAs in fiscal year 2013. In written  responses to our questions on the four selected rules, SBA officials noted  that the three rules required by NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 came at a  time when they were busy completing rules required by the Small  Business Jobs Act of 2010, thereby delaying the start of their work on the  new set of rules. In a congressional testimony in February 2016, the  Associate Administrator of OGCBD stated that SBA had implemented  over 25 provisions from the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 and was  making progress on the remaining provisions. OMB officials stated that  the timeliness of SBA\u2019s rule makings is not unusual and has not raised  any concerns.", "Additionally, SBA officials noted that some of the rules contained other  statutory requirements that required additional work. Specifically, the All  Small Mentor-Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 program and the Limitations on Subcontracting  rules included changes that affected Indian tribes, Alaska Native  corporations, and Native Hawaiian organizations, which required SBA to  consult with these groups in accordance with Executive Order 13175.  Also, the Lower Tier Subcontracting rule required SBA, the General  Services Administration, and the Department of Defense to submit a plan  for implementing the rule to both House and Senate committees; the  agencies were required to complete planned actions within 1 year after  enactment, and SBA was required to issue any regulations necessary,  including the completion of a FAR amendment, within 18 months after  enactment. However, SBA officials said that the FAR Council generally  will not open a FAR case until SBA has issued a final rule, making the  accomplishment of this statutory deadline impracticable. SBA officials  also cited some delays in rule making as a result of the recent  presidential administration transition.", "Generalizing about time frames in the rule-making process is difficult  because the process varies from rule to rule. In an April 2009 report on  the effect of procedural and analytical requirements on federal agencies\u2019  rule-making processes, we found variation in the length of time required  for the development and issuance of final rules, both within and across  agencies. We identified several factors, including the complexity of the  issues addressed; priorities set by agency management that can change;  and the amount of internal and external review required. Additionally,  SBA officials noted that some rules receive many more comments than  others, which can add significantly to the timeline.", "Various approaches exist for measuring the length of time required to  develop and issue final rules, but they have limitations.", "Initiation to final publication. The most complete measure of the  length of time for a rule making is to measure the period from initiation  of the rule to final publication, but this approach is limited by  disagreement as to when a rule-making process begins. According to  our prior work, while agency officials generally agreed that the  publication of a final rule marked the end of the rule-making process,  identifying when a rule making begins is less definite. Specifically,  while each agency identifies milestones that mark the initiation of a  rule making, they may not factor in the time spent researching the rule  makings or developing policy for the rule, as well as time spent  researching rule makings related to the rule in question.", "Publication in Federal Register to final publication. Another  approach to measuring the time required for a rule making is to use  two rule-making milestones common among federal agencies: (1)  publication of a proposed rule in the Federal Register and (2)  publication of a final rule. However, this measurement is incomplete,  as it ignores the potentially substantial length of time necessary for  regulatory development, according to our April 2009 report. In that  report, our case study of 16 rules suggested that this time frame  ranged from approximately 6 months to 5 years, while the total rule- making time for the two rules on either end of that range varied from  slightly over 1 year to 13 years, respectively. For our current review of  four selected SBA rules, the time between the publication of proposed  and final rules ranged from 7.5 months to 17.5 months.", "Mandated timeline. Finally, another approach is to evaluate each  rule against its mandated timeline, although this requirement does not  exist for all rules. However, the various factors that can affect rule- making timeliness can limit the meaningfulness of this analysis. For  example, although our April 2009 report found that rules that are a  management priority or that have a statutory or judicial deadline may  move more quickly through the rule-making process while other rules  are set aside, this analysis must factor in the overall volume of  required rule makings and the relative priorities and rule-making  caseload for the agency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making new recommendations in this report and maintain that  SBA should implement our prior reports\u2019 recommendations.
