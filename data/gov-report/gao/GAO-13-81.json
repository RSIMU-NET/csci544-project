None of the civil agency efforts met GAO's criteria for a key effort. Most of the aerostat and airship efforts have been fielded or completed, and are intended to provide intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) support. The estimated total funding of these efforts was almost $7 billion from fiscal years 2007 through 2012. However, funding estimates beyond fiscal year 2012 decline precipitously for aerostat and airship efforts under development, although there is an expectation that investment in the area will continue.", "Three of the four aerostat and airship efforts under development, plus another airship development effort that was terminated in June 2012, have suffered from high acquisition risks because of significant technical challenges, such as overweight components, and difficulties with integration and software development, which, in turn, have driven up costs and delayed schedules.", "DOD has provided limited oversight to ensure coordination of its aerostat and airship development and acquisition efforts. Consequently, these efforts have not been effectively integrated into strategic frameworks, such as investment plans and roadmaps. At the time of GAO's review, DOD did not have comprehensive information on all its efforts nor its entire investment in aerostats and airships. Additionally, DOD's coordination efforts have been limited to specific technical activities, as opposed to having a higher level authority to ensure coordination is effective. DOD has recently taken steps to bolster oversight, including the appointment of a senior official responsible for the oversight and coordination of airship-related programs. However, as of August 2012, DOD has not defined the details relating to the authority, scope, and responsibilities of this new position.

Both use a lifting gas\u2014most commonly helium\u2014but an aerostat is tethered  to the ground while an airship is free moving. Aerostats lack a propulsion  mechanism and are connected to a mooring station on the ground by a  long cable called a tether. The tether, in addition to securing the aerostat to  one general area above the ground, usually provides power to the payload,  such as ISR sensors and communications equipment, and carries data  between the payload and ground control station. Airships, on the other  hand, are manned or unmanned, self-propelled vehicles that have  directional control. See figure 1 for an example of an aerostat system.", "There are three basic types of airships: (1) non-rigid\u2014which has no frame  and maintains its envelope (external structure) shape through the slightly  pressurized gas it contains; (2) semi-rigid\u2014which also maintains its  shape through the slightly pressurized gas it contains, but also has a  structural keel along the bottom of the envelope to help distribute loads;  and (3) rigid\u2014which has an internal rigid frame to maintain its shape and  to distribute lift and load weight. Blimps flying above sporting events are  commonly non-rigid airships, whereas the Hindenburg airship of the  1930s is an example of a rigid airship.", "Airships can be further categorized by their shape\u2014conventional or  hybrid. A conventional airship has an ellipsoidal shape reminiscent of  those that fly over sporting events. A hybrid airship combines the buoyant  lift of a lighter-than-air gas with the aerodynamic lift created by the shape  of the airship as it flies through the air. Shaped roughly like the cross- section of an aircraft wing, a hybrid airship can generate up to 30 percent  of its lift as it flies. Additional lift can be generated by directing the thrust  of on-board propulsion systems (called vectored thrust) downward.  Because of the additional sources of lift, hybrid airships theoretically can  take off in a heavier-than-air configuration. See figures 2 and 3 for  respective depictions of conventional and hybrid airships.", "In the early to mid 1900s, and especially during World War II, the U.S.  Navy operated a variety of airships for maritime patrol and fleet  reconnaissance, including assistance in antisubmarine warfare.  Additionally, in the early 1930s, airships were used for commercial  transportation across the Atlantic Ocean. However, advances in fixed- wing aircraft design, capabilities, and availability, as well as in enemy  antiaircraft weaponry, led to a marked decline in the military and  commercial use of airships. For instance, the Navy disbanded its last  airship unit in 1962, and since then, the military use of airships for other  than research and development purposes essentially discontinued.", "Since 1978, DOD has operated aerostats along the southern U.S. border  for counterdrug detection and monitoring. Additionally, civil government  agencies have used aerostats for a variety of purposes, such as  monitoring of environmental pollution, and atmospheric and climate  research. For example, since 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency  has used aerostats for the purpose of sampling air emissions from open  sources, such as prescribed forest burns. Additionally, the Department of  Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has used  small aerostats to collect wind data. Furthermore, the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Customs and Border Protection is considering  using aerostats for its border security mission. The overall investment of  civil government agencies in LTA activities is small compared to that of  DOD. See appendix II for examples of civil agency aerostat activities.  While commercial use of airships has primarily been limited to sightseeing  and advertising, there has been interest in using airships for cargo  transportation to logistically austere locations, such as remote areas in  Alaska and Canada.", "Several factors have increased DOD\u2019s attention toward LTA platforms.  The lack of enemy air defense capabilities in recent military operations  has made threats to LTA platforms appear to be low, and the military\u2019s  demand for persistent ISR has grown significantly. For example, DOD  plans to almost double the number of aerostats\u2014from 66 to 125\u2014in  Afghanistan for ISR in fiscal years 2011 and 2012. Also, growing budget  pressures have encouraged the study of potential solutions to military  problems, such as persistent ISR and heavy-lift cargo transportation,  which may reduce procurement and operations and maintenance costs.  For example, a 2008 Army Science Board study that compared fixed-wing  unmanned aircraft, space satellites, and LTA platforms for providing  persistent communications, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions,  concluded that airships offered great promise at being effective in  supporting these missions because of factors including ease of  reconfigurability, extended time on station, large payload capacity, and  lower cost.", "LTA platforms face several significant operational hazards. For example,  weather phenomena such as high winds and lightning have posed the  highest threats to aerostats deployed by the military in Afghanistan.  Before the arrival of hazardous weather conditions, aerostat operations  must cease and the platform must be lowered and secured to the mooring  station to help prevent platform or payload damage. Additionally, high  winds can make airships hard to control and increase fuel consumption,  reducing on-station endurance. Furthermore, combat operations can  result in punctures in the fabric caused by bullets and other projectiles.  However, low helium pressure in the envelope (which is only slightly  higher than the surrounding atmospheric pressure) means small helium  leaks from bullet holes are typically slow and repairs can usually wait until  a normally scheduled maintenance period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Key Aerostat and Airship Efforts Underway or Initiated Since 2007 Have Been Fielded or Completed", "paragraphs": ["We identified 15 key aerostat and airship efforts that were underway or  had been initiated since 2007, and DOD had or has primary responsibility  for all of these efforts.

The various ISR sensors used or planned for the aerostats  and airships in our review include: electro-optical cameras to conduct optical monitoring of the  electromagnetic spectrum from ultraviolet through far infrared; ground moving target indicator radars to detect, locate, and track  vehicles throughout a large area when they are moving slowly on or  just above the surface of land or water; unattended transient acoustic measurement and signature intelligence  systems that use sets of microphones to capture sounds that are  processed and analyzed to determine the direction of the points of  origin and impact of mortar launch; and  signals intelligence sensors to collect transmissions deriving from  communications, electronic, and foreign instrumentation systems.", "The aerostat and airship efforts we identified vary in terms of the time  they can operate on station in any single session. Their on-station  endurance time is typically greater than that of fixed-wing unmanned  aircraft. For example, the TARS aerostat is expected to stay on station for  6 days, whereas the LEMV airship is expected to stay on station for at  least 16 days. In contrast, tactical and theater-level fixed-wing unmanned  aircraft can stay on station from 6 hours for a Shadow aircraft, to 40 hours  for a Sky Warrior. The amount of time on station is greatly dependent on  how often the aerostats and airships need to be topped off with additional  helium, and in the case of most airships, how often they have to be  refueled."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Invested Almost $7 Billion in Aerostats and Airships over the Past 6 Years", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 6 years, overall total DOD investment in aerostat and  airship development, acquisition, and operations and maintenance has  increased, ranging from about $339 million in fiscal year 2007 to a high of  about $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2010, and about $1.3 billion in fiscal year  2012, as illustrated in figure 4.

JLENS was originally scheduled to enter  production in September 2010. However, that same month, an  aerostat accident resulted in the loss of one of the JLENS platforms.  The accident, as well as recent system integration challenges, led to a  decision to not procure production units.

ISIS has  experienced technical challenges stemming from subsystem  development and radar antennae panel manufacturing. Consequently,  earlier this year DARPA temporarily delayed airframe development  activities, and instead will mainly focus on radar risk reduction  activities. During this time period, the ISIS team will develop an airship  risk reduction plan and conduct limited airship activities. Based on the  radar and airship risk reduction studies, DARPA will reassess the  future plan for ISIS with the Air Force.", "The Army initiated development efforts on LEMV in 2010. At over 300  feet in length and with a goal of carrying a 2,500 pound payload, LEMV  offers substantive potential ISR capabilities\u2014if the program can meet  its performance objectives. LEMV\u2019s deployment is behind schedule by  at least 10 months (about a 56 percent schedule increase) due to  issues with fabric production, getting foreign parts cleared through  customs, adverse weather conditions causing the evacuation of work  crews, and first-time integration and testing issues. Also, LEMV is about  12,000 pounds overweight because components, such as tail fins,  exceed weight thresholds. According to program officials, the increased  weight reduces the airship\u2019s estimated on-station endurance at an  altitude of 20,000 feet from the required 21 days, to 4 to 5 days.  However, current plans call for operating the airship at a lower altitude  of 16,000 feet, which is expected to enable an on-station duration time  of 16 days with minimal impacts to operational effectiveness (other than  about a 24 percent reduction to on-station endurance). According to  program officials, the biggest risk to program development was the  ambitious 18-month initial development schedule (from June 2010 to  December 2011). The Army successfully launched and recovered  LEMV during its first flight in August 2012.

Prior to its termination in June  2012, the Blue Devil Block 2 airship effort experienced significant  technical problems resulting in cost overruns and schedule delays.  According to an Air Force official, the Blue Devil Block 2 development  effort had a very aggressive development schedule because it was  intended to meet an urgent need for use in Afghanistan. Some of the  technical problems included the tail fins, which were overweight and  failed structural load design testing, rendering the airship not flyable.  Other technical problems included the flight control software which  experienced problems due to issues related to scaling\u2014although the  software worked well with a much smaller scale version of the airship,  it did not work well with the much larger Blue Devil Block 2 airship.  The Air Force terminated the Blue Devil Block 2 airship effort in June  2012 due to the technical problems experienced with the airframe and  the need to avoid substantially increasing costs of the effort.

Some of these steps include quicker requirements validation  and reduced levels of oversight, including exemption from disciplined  analyses that help to ensure requirements are achievable within available  technologies, design, and other resources, and that programs have  adequate knowledge in hand before moving forward in the acquisition  process. The success of this accelerated acquisition process is predicated  on efforts that do not involve high development and acquisition risks, such  as limiting technology development by using mature technologies.

Adding aerostats and airships to the mix of other investments  would add to the complexity of planning and oversight of relevant  portfolios, but doing so could help to make (1) determinations of how  aerostats and airships compare to other efforts and (2) effective trade-off  decisions based on their capabilities and costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordination Efforts Limited Mainly to Technical Collaboration", "paragraphs": ["Since 2007, DOD significantly increased its investment in airship and  aerostat efforts, in large part to respond to the urgent warfighter ISR  needs in Iraq and Afghanistan, but also to demonstrate LTA technologies  and deliver new capabilities. As a result, numerous organizations  throughout DOD have pursued aerostat and airship development and  acquisition efforts. For example, the Army oversees and manages the  GARP testbed, JLENS, LEMV, and some high altitude airship efforts; the  Air Force manages TARS; DARPA and the Air Force are responsible for  ISIS; the Navy undertook Star Light and is currently responsible for PGSS  and AAFL; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Research and Engineering is responsible for Project Pelican. Given the  wide variety of efforts, DOD has taken some positive steps to coordinate  the various aerostat and airship development and acquisition efforts it has  underway. However, these efforts have mostly occurred at technical  levels where working groups, consisting of technologists from industry  and government, collaboratively address technical issues, as opposed to  having a higher level authority to ensure coordination is effective. DOD  officials identified various examples of these coordination efforts that have  taken place among the military services and departments:", "The Army formed a working group in which the U.S. Navy Naval Air  Systems Command (which manages the PGSS program) participated  to develop plans to merge the PGSS and PTDS aerostat rapid fielding  initiatives into a Persistence Surveillance Systems-Tethered program  of record. This program of record transition is expected to occur in  2014 and should help to ensure effective coordination between the  efforts.", "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames  Research Center signed an interagency agreement in July 2011 with  the DOD Office of the Director of Defense Research and  Engineering\u2019s Rapid Reaction Technology Office to develop a  prototype airship referred to as Project Pelican. Project Pelican is the  U.S. government\u2019s only airship effort to demonstrate ballast-free  variable-buoyancy control technology through which the vehicle can  control its buoyancy (and therefore go up and down) without the use  of ballast and/or ground personnel and ropes. Both agencies agreed  to mitigate long-term technical risk by demonstrating this technology.  NASA is providing acquisition support services to DOD by overseeing  the contractor\u2019s technical efforts and DOD is funding the effort.", "The Air Force and DARPA are currently collaborating on the ISIS  project. A February 2009 memorandum of agreement between the Air  Force and DARPA outlines their respective roles, responsibilities, and  development objectives. The project involves developing a large radar  aperture that is integrated into the structure of a station-keeping  stratospheric airship supporting wide-area persistent surveillance,  tracking, and engagement of ground, maritime, air, and space targets.  DARPA is providing program management, technical direction,  security management, and contracting support. The Air Force is  providing resources for program management, demonstration efforts,  equipment, and base operations and support. Additionally, the project  has used lessons learned from the Army\u2019s HALE-D project, as they  are both designed to operate at a high altitude. However, ISIS is  unique in that the radar system is integrated into the airship\u2019s  platform\u2014the radar is part of the airship structure.", "LEMV coordination is occurring among various Army organizations  and military services and agencies. For example, the Army obtained  lessons learned and best practices for its development of LEMV by  leveraging the Navy\u2019s AAFL program and the Army\u2019s HALE-D effort,  and the Navy developed flight-to-ground operational procedures for  LEMV. Additionally, the Army has had informal coordination with the  Blue Devil Block 2 effort in the past. For example, originally both  airships had several diesel engine commonalities (they used the same  type of engine), and program officials shared challenges and solutions  they discovered as part of the process to modify the engines to meet  their respective requirements.", "The Navy\u2019s AAFL serves as a flying laboratory and risk reduction test- bed for sensors and other components and has assisted the Air Force  with its Blue Devil Block 2 airship development. In 2011, the Air Force  provided funding to the Navy to provide training to airship pilots to  qualify them to fly the Blue Devil Block 2 airship.", "While these efforts indicate some military services and organizations are  sharing lessons learned and technical solutions, DOD may be able to  realize additional opportunities for coordination within the agency and  throughout the government. For example, DOD officials told us that  coordination between the LEMV and Blue Devil Block 2 projects and  opportunities to share lessons learned had been limited because of their  concurrent and accelerated development pace. Also, according to a U.S.  Central Command official, information sharing between the PTDS and  PGSS efforts has been limited, because the efforts are managed by  different services, in areas such as test reports and operational impacts  resulting from adverse weather. According to this official, better sharing  of information could help to inform solutions for making aerostats more  survivable. PGSS and PTDS program officials stated that the respective  programs have steadily increased information sharing (including daily  system status reports, aerostat incident reports, contracting information,  budgets, and training programs of instruction) and collaboration on  common aerostat issues (such as in-theater force protection for system  operators, helium supply priorities, aerostat safety and weather  information, and staff and crew tactical training)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Duplication Ended with Termination of Airship Effort", "paragraphs": ["The shortcomings in planning, insight, and collaboration may have made  some airship efforts susceptible to duplication.

However, the potential duplication  ended when the Air Force terminated the Blue Devil Block 2 program in  June 2012. Most of the desired capabilities for LEMV and Blue Devil  Block 2 were similar, as shown in table 3. According to DOD officials,  these two programs were expected to demonstrate ISR capabilities;  however, they are two different types of vehicles with different design  objectives. LEMV is a hybrid airship demonstration that is developing a  new platform and the Blue Devil Block 2 was a conventional airship that  was to place sensors on a mature commercial-based platform. However,  both were expected to have the capability to conduct ISR missions at low  altitude, and share other operational characteristics. For example, both  airships were to operate at the same operational altitude of 20,000 feet,  were expected to handle a payload weight capacity of 2,500 pounds, and  shared some of the same types of sensors. The two airship efforts also  were being developed concurrently and were expected to be deployed to  Afghanistan for testing and operations around the same time.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 directed the  Secretary of Defense to designate a senior official with principal  responsibility for DOD\u2019s airship programs.

The statutory direction and appointment of the senior official  are positive steps, but it is too early to assess the effectiveness of this  official\u2019s authorities and responsibilities in integrating and overseeing  these activities. As of August 2012, the Office of the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Research and Engineering was defining the details relating  to the authority, scope, and responsibilities of this new position. The  overarching direction by the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in accordance  with the statutory mandate, provides the senior official with authority over  airship-related efforts. Because aerostat efforts respond to some of the  same warfighter requirements as airships, such as for persistent ISR, and  share some of the same technologies used in airship development efforts,  such as materials, design, and fabrication, common oversight of both  airships and aerostats could enable DOD to have better visibility over all  of its aerostat and airship efforts and help to ensure these efforts are  effectively overseen, planned, and coordinated.", "While DOD\u2019s overall investment in this area has totaled nearly $7 billion in  the past 6 years, near term funding estimates sharply decline beyond  fiscal year 2012 and the level of future investment beyond fiscal year  2016 is not known.

If DOD decides to make significant future investments in  aerostat and airship capabilities, the senior official could play a key role in  shaping those investments.

But this rush came with  high acquisition risk\u2014particularly since there was a lack of knowledge  about the amount of modifications and technology development that was  required. Moreover, DOD\u2019s limited oversight to ensure coordination of all  of these efforts has resulted in ineffective integration of capabilities into  broader strategic frameworks and limited investment knowledge and  collaboration, making them susceptible to duplication. The appointment of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering as the  senior official responsible for the oversight and coordination of various  airship-related programs is a positive step, but the role of the position  remains to be clearly defined. Yet, the future is uncertain; at this point, no  substantive investment is planned for aerostat and airship capabilities.
