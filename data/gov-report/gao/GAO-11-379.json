The Recovery Act requires GAO to review funds made available under the act and to comment on recipients' estimates of jobs created or retained. GAO examined (1) how EECBG recipients used EECBG funds and challenges they faced, if any; (2) DOE and recipients' oversight and monitoring activities and challenges, if any; (3) the extent to which the EECBG program is meeting Recovery Act and program goals for energy savings; and (4) the quality of jobs data reported by Recovery Act recipients, particularly EECBG recipients. GAO also updates the status of open recommendations from previous bimonthly and recipient reporting reviews. GAO analyzed DOE recipient data and interviewed DOE officials and a nonprobability sample of EECBG recipients, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to DOE data, EECBG recipients primarily used funds for 3 of the 14 activities eligible for EECBG funding. These activities are energy-efficiency retrofits, financial incentive programs, and buildings and facilities projects. Some DOE officials, recipients, and others identified challenges in obligating and spending funds due to local jurisdictional requirements and staff and resource limitations. In addition, in April 2010 DOE determined that many recipients were not on a trajectory to obligate and spend funds within specified time frames, so DOE issued new milestones for obligating and spending funds. Many recipients reported having had difficulty meeting the new milestones. DOE is taking steps to address these difficulties. According to DOE officials and documentation, DOE follows a programwide monitoring plan to oversee the use of Recovery Act funds and uses a variety of techniques to monitor recipients. Overall, recipients also use various methods to monitor contractors and subrecipients, but DOE does not always collect information on recipients' monitoring activities. As a result, DOE does not always know whether the monitoring activities of recipients are sufficiently rigorous to ensure compliance with federal requirements. Some DOE officials, recipients, and others have reported to GAO that some DOE staff and recipients faced challenges with overseeing the use of funds, including (1) technical challenges with a Web-based reporting application DOE uses as a primary oversight tool and (2) staffing and expertise limitations, such as some recipients' unfamiliarity with federal grant procedures. Recipients contacted and some DOE officials reported to GAO that recipients are using EECBG funds to develop projects designed to reduce energy use and increase energy savings in line with Recovery Act and program goals. However, DOE officials have experienced challenges in assessing the extent to which the EECBG program is meeting those goals. Because actual energy savings data are generally available only after a project is completed, DOE officials said that most recipients report estimates to comply with program reporting requirements. DOE takes steps to assess the reasonableness of these estimates but does not require recipients to report the methods or tools used to develop estimates. In addition, while DOE provides recipients with a tool to estimate energy savings, DOE does not require that recipients use the most recent, updated version of its estimating tool. GAO's analysis of the Recovery.gov data that recipients reported, including jobs funded, shows data quality this quarter reflects minor amounts of inconsistencies or illogical data. The portion of EECBG recipients reporting some jobs funded has continued to increase. DOE headquarters and field officials continue to address data quality concerns, including ensuring that recipients and reviewers had the updated Office of Management and Budget guidance on narrative descriptions. However, data across reporting periods may not be comparable because, in earlier periods, some confusion existed about methods for calculating jobs funded."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE (1) explore a means to capture information on recipients' monitoring activities, and (2) solicit information on recipients' methods for estimating energy-related impact metrics and verify that recipients use the most recent version of DOE's estimating tool.

The Recovery Act directed states to use the funds for  various purposes, including to preserve and create jobs; assist those most  affected by the recession; and invest in transportation, environmental  protection, and other infrastructure to provide long-term economic  benefits. Of the Recovery Act funds, about $3.2 billion were provided as  grants to states, territories, federally recognized Indian tribes and local  communities through the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Office of Energy  Efficiency and Renewable Energy\u2019s newly funded Energy Efficiency and  Conservation Block Grant program (EECBG). DOE provides EECBG  funds to grant recipients to develop, promote, and manage projects to  improve energy efficiency and reduce energy use and fossil fuel emissions  in local communities. DOE further encourages EECBG recipients to  develop new and innovative approaches; prioritize energy efficiency and  conservation; develop projects in a cost-effective manner that will  stimulate the economy; and to the extent possible, to develop programs  that will continue beyond the funding period.", "DOE provides EECBG funds to grant recipients in two forms: through  formula grants and competitive grants. Of the $3.2 billion, DOE awarded  about $2.7 billion through formula grants to local communities and states.

About 1 percent of the total EECBG funds  ($40 million) was allocated to Administrative and Training/Technical  Assistance. In addition to the approximately $2.7 billion in formula grants,  DOE awarded about 14 percent of the total EECBG funds ($453 million)  through competitive grants to local communities.", "This report, the ninth in a series of bimonthly GAO reviews, responds to a  mandate in the Recovery Act, which requires that GAO conduct such  reviews of funds made available under the act to determine how funds are  used, including whether funds are achieving the stated purposes of the act.  The Recovery Act also requires GAO to comment on estimates of jobs  created or retained as reported by recipients. Over the past 2 years, our  bimonthly reviews of Recovery Act programs have covered a wide range  of programs including Medicaid, education, Head Start, highways and  transit, housing construction and tax credit assistance, emergency food  and shelter, justice assistance and community-oriented policing,  workforce investment, and environmental and energy projects.", "In this report, we reviewed and updated recipients\u2019 information available  on the EECBG program, focusing on the approximately $2.7 billion  awarded through formula funding to eligible states and local and tribal  communities. Specifically, our objectives were to determine (1) how  EECBG funds are being used, and what challenges, if any, EECBG  recipients face in obligating and spending their funds; (2) actions DOE  officials and EECBG recipients are taking to provide oversight of EECBG  funds and challenges, if any, they face in meeting Recovery Act and other  requirements; (3) the extent to which EECBG recipients and the EECBG  program are meeting Recovery Act and EECBG program goals for energy  savings and what challenges, if any, recipients have encountered in  measuring and reporting energy savings; and (4) how the quality of  estimates of jobs created and retained reported by Recovery Act  recipients, particularly EECBG recipients, has changed over time.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations, as well as DOE guidance documents. We analyzed DOE\u2019s  EECBG program data from DOE databases. We interviewed EECBG  program officials, including about 30 project officers, technical monitors,  and contractors in the field offices responsible for managing and  monitoring awards. We also interviewed representatives from several  energy and public service organizations, including the National  Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO), the National Association of  Counties (NACo), and the U.S. Conference of Mayors (USCM). In addition,  we e-mailed questions to a sample of 91 purposefully selected city and  county recipients that are eligible to receive EECBG funding. We received  responses from 49 recipients to questions on the various aspects of our  objectives, such as obligating and spending funds, guidance, best  practices, monitoring, and challenges experienced. The responses from  this nonprobability sample of recipients are not generalizable to the 2,185  EECBG states, cities, counties, and tribal grant recipients eligible for  formula funding nationwide. To comment on recipients\u2019 estimates of jobs  created or retained, we analyzed the quality of estimates of jobs created or  retained provided by recipients. The Recovery Act requires that nonfederal  recipients of Recovery Act funds\u2014including grants, contracts, and loans\u2014 submit quarterly reports. These reports include a list of each project or  activity for which Recovery Act funds were expended or obligated and  information concerning the amount and use of funds and jobs created or  retained by these projects and activities, among other information. The  latest of these recipient reports covered the activity as of the Recovery  Act\u2019s passage through the quarter ending December 31, 2010.

The EECBG  program was funded for the first time by the Recovery Act, through  formula and competitive grants. Through the program, DOE allocates  formula grants to the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five  territories; to city and county recipients based on their resident and  commuter populations; and to Native American tribes based on population  and climatic conditions. Applicants eligible for formula funding include  cities or city-equivalent units of government, such as towns or villages  with populations of at least 35,000; counties, which include county- equivalent units of local government, such as parishes or boroughs with  populations of at least 200,000; and all Indian tribes and any Alaska Native  village.

As shown in table 2, recipients have allocated nearly two-thirds (65.1  percent) of EECBG funds for three types of activities: (1) energy-efficiency  retrofits (36.8 percent), which includes activities such as grants to nonprofit  organizations and governmental agencies for retrofitting existing facilities to  improve energy efficiency; (2) financial incentive programs (18.5 percent),  which includes activities such as rebates, subgrants, and revolving loans to  promote energy-efficiency improvements; and (3) energy-efficiency and  conservation programs for buildings and facilities (9.8 percent), which  includes activities such as installing storm windows or solar hot water  technology. Some EECBG recipients are using their awards to fund projects  in all three of these categories. For example, according to information  reported through PAGE, New York City plans to use $31 million of its $80.8  million award to fund energy-efficiency retrofits at municipal buildings such  as schools, courthouses, police precincts, and firehouses. It has also  allocated $16.1 million to a financial incentive program that will provide  loans to capital-constrained building owners for energy-efficient retrofits to  residential, commercial, or industrial buildings. New York City designated  another $2 million for buildings and facilities projects and will fund a retro- commissioning program at city facilities designed to identify efficiency  measures and address anomalies in energy use, equipment schedules, and  control sequences that may cause energy waste. As indicated in table 2,  these three activities account for 48 percent of all the projects funded  through the EECBG program, or 3,674 out of 7,594 total projects.", "According to DOE officials, a number of factors explain why energy- efficiency retrofits, financial incentive programs, and buildings and  facilities programs account for such a large portion of all EECBG-funded  projects. DOE officials told us that some recipients had previously  identified needed improvements to their buildings and facilities.  Recipients also told us that EECBG funds allowed them to undertake  planned facilities projects that previously lacked the requisite funding.  DOE officials told us that other recipients allocated EECBG funds to these  projects to save money on future energy bills and many recipients chose  retrofit programs because these programs allowed them to use EECBG  funds to engage their broader communities by retrofitting commercial and  residential buildings, in addition to government facilities. DOE also  encouraged recipients to pursue these projects. In the EECBG program\u2019s  funding announcement, DOE asked recipients to \u201cprioritize energy  efficiency and conservation first as the cheapest, cleanest, and fastest  ways to meet energy demand\u201d and to \u201cdevelop programs and strategies  that will continue beyond the funding period.\u201d Energy efficiency retrofits  and buildings and facilities projects meet both of these goals.", "Although financial incentive programs appear to be the second highest  funded activity\u2014receiving over 18 percent of EECBG funds\u2014the data for  this activity require further explanation. According to DOE officials,  approximately 73 percent of activities classified as financial incentive  programs are subgrants made by state governments to units of local  government within the state. Such subgrant recipients can use these  funds for any of the 14 eligible activities, such as lighting, retrofits, and  transportation. The state awarding the subgrant can report details of the  activities funded by subgrant recipients. However, the state government  reports these details in narrative fields within DOE\u2019s PAGE system while  the primary activity type, reflected in table 2, is simply classified as  \u201cfinancial incentive programs.\u201d High-level summary data on these activities  may give the impression that over 18 percent of EECBG funds are  allocated to financial incentive programs however, nearly three-quarters of  these funds may ultimately be used for any of the 14 eligible activities.  Although DOE collects information on how these funds are ultimately  used, these data are not readily available.", "DOE has obligated all EECBG funds to recipients, and recipients are  beginning to obligate and spend these funds. The Recovery Act required  DOE to obligate all funds to recipients by September 30, 2010, and DOE  has done so.

In response to questions about spending delays,  one recipient told us that although local procedures can be time- consuming, these procedures also protect tax dollars. Another recipient  told us that DOE needs to take local procedures into consideration so that  spending milestones are more flexible and realistic. Both representatives  from NACo told us that although recipients are grateful for the opportunity  to implement critical projects that they previously could not have funded,  DOE has not adapted guidance and deadlines to the needs, timelines, or  procedures of local governments and that this has created some  challenges. Some project officers expressed similar views in our meetings  with them, stating that the federal government in general lacked an  appreciation of city and county government processes.

DOE officials stated that worksite reviews were  conducted as determined necessary by the project officer, though project  officers made an effort to visit at least one worksite during every on-site  visit.", "Overall, DOE officials stated that they planned to prioritize their  monitoring based on the size of the grant rather than on the expected risk  of the project. For example, all recipients with over $2 million in Recovery  Act funds\u2014which as a group, represent about 70 percent of all EECBG  Recovery Act formula funds\u2014receive significantly more on-site  monitoring than would recipients of grants of under $250,000.

For example,  DOE monitoring staff use PAGE data to inform and target further  monitoring actions such as on-site monitoring. Additionally, DOE has also  created a monitoring tool within PAGE that compiles the checklists used  by project officers to determine the compliance of recipients with the  program\u2019s statutes and requirements. DOE guidance states that through  the use of PAGE, monitoring staff can target recipients with low spending  rates or reporting delays for additional follow-up to help ensure that funds  were spent in a timely manner. Project officers also stated that they use  financial data reported in PAGE to identify potential areas of concern for  further analysis.", "Overall, DOE officials stated that they have almost met their desktop  monitoring goals with a rate of over 90 percent of their planned  monitoring complete, and based on their current rate, are on track to meet  on-site monitoring goals (see table 6). DOE officials stated that they do not  currently track the number of worksite reviews, but that all initial on-site  monitoring visits also include a worksite review.", "In addition to desktop monitoring and site visits, several DOE officials  reported almost meeting their planned staffing goals for project officers  and other monitoring staff. Specifically, as of December 20, 2010, these  DOE officials reported that approximately 60 project officers, 20 contract  specialists, and 35 full-time equivalents (FTE) of contractor support were  assigned to administer the EECBG program. These staff members are  located in Washington, D.C.; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; Golden, Colorado; and  Las Vegas, Nevada. As of December 2010, DOE officials stated they had  met their staffing goals with the exception of one field office, which had  recently lost several of its staff. These DOE officials said they hoped to fill  those positions soon.", "DOE monitoring also includes specific financial management oversight in  DOE field offices, as well as independent oversight through DOE\u2019s  Inspector General. Specifically, financial management oversight is  conducted by the DOE Office of the CFO in the Golden, Colorado, and Oak  Ridge, Tennessee, field offices. In addition, the project officers in the Las  Vegas, Nevada, field office also oversee disbursements of DOE funds. Data  on the disbursement of funds are then made available to DOE employees,  including headquarters employees and the CFO. DOE\u2019s Inspector General  also provides oversight of the EECBG program and has issued a report on  the status of implementation of EECBG, as well as the management  controls over the development and implementation of PAGE. Along with  issuing such reports, DOE\u2019s Inspector General takes actions to investigate  allegations related to fraud, waste, and abuse for the EECBG program. To  date, DOE\u2019s Inspector General has received four complaints regarding the  use of EECBG funds and is handling two of them through ongoing  investigations, while the other two were sent back to the program office  for resolution. A DOE Inspector General official stated that the complaints  are related to potential conflicts of interest and potential ethics violations.  Additionally, while not investigating EECBG directly, DOE\u2019s Inspector  General recently issued a management alert related to DOE\u2019s State Energy  Efficient Appliance Rebate Program. Some recipients also used EECBG  funds to help fund rebate programs. In its alert, DOE\u2019s Inspector General  identified an incident in which a consumer in Georgia was able to  purchase water heaters at a store, return them, and still inappropriately  apply for and receive a rebate through the state\u2019s rebate program.

Broadly stated, federal law, federal regulations, and DOE  guidance require that recipients comply with applicable laws, including  provisions in the Recovery Act, such as Buy American, and other federal  requirements, including regulatory and procedural requirements.  Recipients are responsible for informing subrecipients of all applicable  laws and other federal requirements and ensuring their subrecipients\u2019  compliance with program, fiscal, and audit requirements. The Single Audit  Act, as amended, requires recipients passing on the funds to subrecipients  to monitor the subrecipients\u2019 use of the federal funds through site visits,  limited scope audits, and other means. DOE did not require recipients to  conduct any specific oversight actions but instead released guidance on  October 26, 2010, identifying a number of best practices for monitoring by  recipients to ensure their and their subrecipients\u2019 compliance with federal  requirements for monitoring. Further, DOE has also provided additional  resources regarding the monitoring of subrecipients, such as workshops  and guidance.", "We found that recipients contacted are using various methods to meet  applicable laws and other federal requirements, and recipients, DOE  officials, and project officers stated that some recipients are providing  substantially more rigorous monitoring than others. For example, while it  is required that recipients monitor subrecipients, in response to our  questions, one recipient did not indicate that it monitored subrecipients  and instead stated that it included terms in their contracts that required  contractor adherence to applicable federal requirements. Other recipients  reported actively monitoring funds but using relatively limited techniques  such as reviewing invoices and other reports submitted by vendors. DOE  officials acknowledged that many recipients are resource constrained,  limiting their ability to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable  federal requirements, and DOE would need to evaluate on a case-by-case  basis whether the grant recipient\u2019s subrecipient monitoring system is  sufficient to meet compliance requirements. However, officials stated that  DOE does not gather specific information on recipient monitoring  practices except during on-site visits. Additionally, because less than 25  percent of grants under $1 million are to receive on-site visits, DOE does  not have specific information on monitoring for many recipients. DOE  officials stated that they focused monitoring efforts on recipients of larger  grants because they were more likely to have subrecipients. DOE officials  also said that they adopted standard, well-accepted audit sampling  practices to achieve the most effective coverage in verifying monitoring  practices and conducted additional on-site reviews of recipients that have  demonstrated cause for concern such as not filing quarterly reports.  Officials stated that if they identified a concern during an on-site visit, they  would work with the recipient to develop an alternative system to monitor  subrecipients.", "While some recipients reported less rigorous monitoring activities, in  other instances, recipients reported having detailed monitoring practices  with multiple components. For example, one recipient reported collecting  monthly progress reports, which included financial reports, from all  subrecipients, vendors, and contractors, as well as conducting site visits.  Additionally, the recipient reported that their auditor and grant services  staff also conducted internal audits of all Recovery Act programs. Another  recipient also reported using a variety of monitoring practices such as  inspections, site visits, and regular billing of vendors. The recipient\u2019s staff  also reported that they planned to use third-party oversight of site visits in  the coming year and that they had recently hired a grant compliance  analyst who would be administering a subrecipient monitoring plan in the  coming year.", "Some grant sizes and project types may not lend themselves to the same  level of oversight as others. DOE project officers stated that some larger  projects included specific monitoring requirements in the contract to help  ensure that the project met key goals including achieving project  outcomes and ensuring that funds were used efficiently. For example,  project officers stated that some recipients were able to use expertise  provided by contractors that perform energy-savings work to generate  energy-cost savings to help determine estimated versus achieved energy  savings. Other smaller contracts, however, were not large enough to  include these types of oversight. In another instance, one recipient noted  that because the grants with subrecipients they were using were so small,  ranging from $8,000 to $55,000, that the recipient did not see the need to  conduct internal and financial audits but did report conducting on-site  visits on some projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Officials and Recipients Reported Technical, Staffing, and Expertise Challenges That Hinder Efforts to Ensure Requirements Are Met", "paragraphs": ["DOE officials and some recipients reported experiencing technical,  staffing, and expertise challenges that hinder the ability of both DOE and  recipients to provide oversight to ensure that Recovery Act and program  requirements are met, but DOE is taking steps to address many of these  challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Technical Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Some DOE project officers and recipients reported experiencing technical  challenges using PAGE. For example, project officers told us that  monitoring was challenging because of the extensive amount of time that  they spent helping recipients use the PAGE system, which recipients  found cumbersome and difficult to use. In particular, some project officers  said that they provide ongoing support during reporting cycles to help fix  reporting errors and, in some cases, help walk recipients through the  reporting process and help fix reporting errors. For example, some DOE  project officers in one field office told us that during the reporting  period\u2014the last week of the quarter and the following 2 months\u2014project  officers spent approximately 70 to 85 percent of their time helping  recipients fill out their PAGE and federal reporting forms. Other project  officers with the same office also told us that recipients often cannot  figure out how to enter data into PAGE and do not understand the  reporting system. In another field office, a DOE project officer stated that  almost all of the initial PAGE reports for each quarter were initially  rejected for issues such as missing or incorrect data entries and that  recipients reported having difficulties with entering data in every field.  Some recipients have also reported difficulties using PAGE\u2014for example,  though not asked about PAGE issues specifically in our structured  questions, one recipient stated in a response regarding challenges faced  that \u201cPAGE reporting is the biggest challenge\u201d while another recipient  noted that \u201ctechnical glitches\u201d in PAGE made reporting more challenging.", "Incorrect data entered into PAGE has also limited project officers\u2019 ability  to monitor recipients. For example, some project officers stated that some  recipients continued to enter incorrect information in PAGE for data fields  such as total hours worked and estimated energy savings\u2014key project  measures used to help gauge project progress and status\u2014in part due to  difficulties recipients had understanding PAGE data fields. Specifically,  some project officers stated that some PAGE data field names were  difficult to interpret, confusing some recipients. Some project officers also  stated that recipients entered incorrect job information using incorrect job  calculation formulas or that they entered incorrect energy data and that  DOE project officers had to spend time locating the errors and working  with the recipient to ensure that the correct data were entered. In previous  work looking at EECBG, as well as the State Energy Program and  Weatherization Assistance Program, we have also reported on both DOE  monitoring staff and recipients having problems with PAGE that hindered  DOE\u2019s ability to administer the program. Specifically, we previously  reported that some DOE staff and recipients noted that the time and effort  that project officers spent with recipients to help them understand and  navigate the PAGE system significantly increased the administrative  burden of the program.", "In reviewing PAGE\u2019s development process, DOE\u2019s Inspector General  found significant issues, noting that DOE did not seek input from grant  recipients in designing PAGE because it had to be developed and  implemented so quickly. The Inspector General\u2019s report noted that user  input significantly increases the likelihood that the system will meet user  needs and also helps avoid rework costs due to a lack of functionality.  Similarly, we previously reported on the importance of eliciting the users\u2019  needs to identify and prioritize system requirements. Without gathering  this information, programs and systems may not meet the needs of their  users.", "DOE officials stated that they have implemented a number of  improvements to both the administration of PAGE, and the system itself,  to help address user concerns and that they are currently implementing  more changes. For example, DOE established a PAGE hotline to assist  users and gather users\u2019 feedback and also provided training videos for  recipients using PAGE. DOE officials also stated that they recently  implemented a new software tool to gather and prioritize user feedback  from large numbers of recipients to better address users\u2019 major concerns.  Additionally, DOE officials said that among other improvements, they plan  to incorporate a new interface in the next few months for DOE staff to  review data reported in PAGE, which was designed to improve usability of  the system. DOE officials stated that these improvements will take time to  implement and have to be carefully considered so as not to negatively  affect other PAGE functions. For example, PAGE is also used for recipient  reporting by DOE\u2019s Weatherization Assistance and State Energy programs.  DOE officials also stated that they have had to adapt their process to  handle the large number of PAGE users, in contrast to the previous  system. Specifically, DOE officials stated that approximately 50 state users  and a limited number of federal staff used the previous system, while  PAGE had 4,292 recipient and 411 federal users as of December 8, 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staffing and Expertise Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Some DOE officials, monitoring staff, and grant recipients, as well as all  stakeholders we contacted, stated that some recipients are also  encountering staffing and expertise challenges that have limited their  ability to monitor the use of Recovery Act funds and ensure effective and  efficient use of funds while also meeting Recovery Act and other federal  requirements. As noted previously, some project officers stated that some  recipients may lack sufficient resources and staffing for program oversight  such as monitoring. Some DOE officials also acknowledged the significant  recipient workload associated with monitoring. These officials stated that  the biggest overall challenge to monitoring was the need to determine the  right amount of information to collect from recipients so as to ensure  recipient compliance with applicable federal requirements while not  burdening recipients with reporting requirements. These officials also  stated that they took steps to decrease the reporting burden on recipients,  including decreasing certain monitoring requirements. Further, these DOE  officials also stated that some recipients said that they might have trouble  ensuring compliance with program requirements due to limited staffing  and were focused on Recovery Act requirements such as Davis-Bacon and  Buy American. Finally, the NASEO and USCM representatives we spoke  with stated that some recipients have expressed concerns about  complying with Davis-Bacon requirements, especially with limited staff  and a large number of projects. For example, both USCM representatives  stated that while some city and county projects already had Davis-Bacon  or Buy American requirements before the Recovery Act, they were  typically on much larger projects in excess of $30 million, such as  transportation projects, with dedicated resources to ensure compliance  with these requirements.", "Some DOE monitoring staff and the NASEO and USCM representatives  stated that some recipients found compliance with federal laws, including  Recovery Act provisions, such as those for financial management  monitoring and Davis-Bacon, difficult because of a lack of previous  expertise with those requirements. Additionally, some DOE monitoring  staff stated that some recipients have limited experience with federal  grants and faced a steep learning curve with implementing projects, and  that this inexperience has limited monitoring efforts, making it more  difficult to ensure that funds were spent properly. For example, several  DOE staff in one field office stated that, in particular, those recipients that  did not have previous experience performing a Single Audit Act report  tended to have more trouble meeting EECBG requirements than others  due to inexperience. Additionally, some DOE project officers also stated  that some smaller recipients with fewer staff did not have specific  expertise in energy management and that this made it more difficult to  monitor programs. Further, these DOE project officers also noted that  certain project types, such as energy loan programs, may have fewer  tangible outcomes than others such as building retrofits, and are thus  more difficult to monitor, especially without specific staff expertise.  Additionally, certain Recovery Act requirements can also prove more  difficult to ensure compliance with than others. For example, both NASEO  representatives stated that some recipients found compliance with the Buy  American provision difficult, especially for items with multiple  components such as air conditioners.", "DOE is taking steps to address staffing and expertise challenges by  expanding support to recipients. Some DOE officials and the NASEO and  USCM representatives stated that DOE\u2019s administration of EECBG was  initially limited during the program\u2019s early stages and that this hindered  early program administration including oversight. Overall, the NASEO and  USCM representatives stated that while the DOE program office has  improved significantly in providing support such as guidance to recipients,  the program was significantly impacted by these early delays. DOE has  gradually expanded the amount of support provided to recipients. For  example, while DOE project officers continue to provide individualized  support to recipients, DOE has also developed a Technical Assistance and  Solution Center to provide information related to monitoring recipient  activities such as project implementation. Through the Technical  Assistance and Solution Center, DOE has provided near daily Web  seminars on specific energy topics while also helping connect recipients  with specific technical expertise. Further, DOE continues to issue  programwide guidance to help recipients comply with Recovery Act and  program requirements. For example, on January 4, 2011, DOE issued  guidance to help recipients determine the eligibility of recipient programs  for Recovery Act funds. DOE has also hosted seminars with recipients and  subrecipients to help identify and share monitoring best practices. Finally,  DOE is working with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to  update OMB\u2019s Compliance Supplement to its guidance for the Single Audit  Act (Cir. No. A-133) regarding EECBG program requirements."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Has Faced Challenges in Determining the Extent to Which the EECBG Program is Meeting Recovery Act and Program Goals for Energy Savings", "paragraphs": ["EECBG program recipients reported using EECBG grant funding to  develop projects designed to achieve a variety of benefits in line with  Recovery Act and program goals, including reducing total energy use and  increasing energy savings for local governments and residents. For  example, some recipients we contacted reported anticipating energy  savings and reduced overall energy usage from such projects as powering  the electrical needs for a large city park with solar panels; maximizing the  use of day lighting in government buildings; installing more energy- efficient technology in households and businesses; replacing convention  center light fixtures with light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs to reduce  energy usage; and updating and remodeling a 40-year-old public building  with more energy-efficient products, including new windows and doors,  and HVAC systems.", "Furthermore, DOE officials told us that some recipients are already  reporting achieving benefits consistent with Recovery Act and program  goals. For example, DOE reported that according to initial recipient self- reporting through December 2010, EECBG recipients have upgraded more  than 10,000 buildings, installed 40,000 efficient street lights, and upgraded  more than 100,000 traffic signals. DOE has put some examples of program  successes on its Web site. For example, a small town in southwestern  Wyoming used its EECBG funds to convert its streetlights to LED fixtures.  Town officials reported better lighting quality and visibility, less light  pollution, and lower energy use that has reduced lighting-related energy  costs by almost two-thirds. In North Carolina, local officials used EECBG  funds to convert an abandoned grocery store into an energy-efficient  community training center and classroom. By installing a more energy- efficient roof, new insulation, and HVAC systems, local officials said they  anticipate achieving substantial energy savings. Another recipient in  Oklahoma used EECBG funds to purchase five wind turbines. According  to the recipient, the new wind energy technology has offset the electrical  costs for all town-owned buildings, and the recipient reported anticipating  saving $24,000 annually.", "However, DOE officials have experienced challenges in assessing whether  the EECBG program is meeting Recovery Act and program goals for  energy savings because most recipients do not measure energy savings by  collecting actual data and several factors affect the reasonableness of  energy-savings estimates. Additionally, while DOE officials say they have  anecdotal examples of program successes, DOE lacks actual programwide  data on energy savings. DOE guidance requires that recipients report  impact metrics\u2014which include energy savings, energy cost savings,  renewable-energy generation, and emissions reductions\u2014on a quarterly  basis and verify cumulative totals when grants are closed out, but it does  not require that these impact metrics be based on actual, as opposed to  estimated, data. Furthermore, according to some DOE officials, there  have been only a few opportunities for recipients to collect actual energy- savings data because in most cases actual data are only available after a  project has been completed, and recipients are just beginning to complete  projects. These officials said that instead of collecting actual energy- savings data, most recipients report estimates to comply with program  reporting requirements.", "As part of the quarterly review process, DOE\u2019s monitoring plan appendix  requires project officers to assess whether recipients\u2019 estimates of impact  metrics, including energy savings, are reasonable and to determine  whether grant recipients have an adequate procedure in place to collect,  verify, and report these data. Project officers are further instructed, as part  of this quarterly review process, to review recipients\u2019 reported impact  metrics and determine whether they are within a range of values that DOE  would expect. For example, DOE\u2019s EECBG desktop review guidance  instructs project officers to consider rejecting recipients\u2019 quarterly reports  in cases where the estimates entered by recipients appear too low or too  high.", "According to DOE officials, several factors affect the extent to which  estimates are reasonable. One factor is the variance in the type and  robustness of methodologies that recipients use to develop estimates.  DOE guidance allows recipients flexibility in how they estimate impact  metrics, such as energy savings. For example, DOE\u2019s Program Notice 10- 07B requires that recipients \u201ctake care to account for other determinant  factors (e.g., weather variation)\u201d when recipients develop estimates. DOE  officials said that they prefer that recipients rely on certain estimation  methods and tools that DOE would expect to produce more accurate and  sophisticated estimates of grant project results\u2014such as contractor- or  engineering-supplied estimates of project savings or estimates calculated  with the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Portfolio Manager tool. For  recipients that are not able to use methods or tools that are specific to  their grant projects, DOE has provided recipients with tools that DOE  officials believe are capable of calculating \u201chigh-level\u201d estimates of energy- related impact metrics. Since the beginning of the EECBG program in  2009, DOE has updated and refined its estimating tool and underlying  assumptions several times and may update the tool and assumptions in the  future as well. While DOE officials said they believe that estimates  calculated with the current version of this tool are more accurate than  those calculated with previous versions, DOE does not require that  recipients who use its estimating tool to use the most updated version  when calculating and reporting estimates. Consequently, some recipients  may use DOE\u2019s earlier, less refined tool to develop estimates of energy- related impact metrics.", "Another factor that affects DOE officials\u2019 ability to assess reasonableness  is the fact that the agency recommends but does not require, that  recipients report the methods or tools used to calculate estimates, so DOE  officials do not know which recipients are using older versions of DOE\u2019s  estimation tool or other methods to estimate energy-related impact  metrics. Knowing which method or version of a tool recipients used to  calculate estimates may be more important for smaller grant recipients, as  DOE officials told us they believe that smaller grant recipients who do not  have the expertise at hand or resources to hire energy-efficiency experts  are more likely to use a DOE-supplied estimation tool. Without knowing  the methods being used by recipients to estimate energy-related impacts,  DOE cannot identify instances where the method along with the  associated assumptions being used in calculating estimates may need to be  more carefully reviewed.", "A third factor that DOE officials said can affect the development and  reporting of reasonable estimates is the level of expertise available to  recipients to develop impact metrics, as this can vary. According to DOE  officials, some EECBG recipients are receiving federal grants for the very  first time through the EECBG program, which was implemented in March  2009. Some communities may have limited (if any) direct experience with  federal grant program requirements, and likewise have limited experience  in measuring and reporting impact metrics. As a result, DOE officials  reported that some recipients have had difficulty developing their  estimates. In addition, DOE officials said that some recipients may also  have made errors in reporting their estimates of energy-related impact  metrics. For example, DOE officials said that some recipients may be  incorrectly aggregating impact metrics from multiple project sites and, as  a result, producing errors in the estimated energy-related impacts.", "In December 2010, DOE issued guidance to recipients outlining the steps  DOE and recipients must take to formally close out EECBG grants. As part  of this process, project officers are required to review recipients\u2019 final  quarterly performance report and federal financial report for  completeness and reasonableness. However, this guidance does not  specify how project officers should assess reasonableness. DOE officials  said that the agency is in the process of drafting internal closeout guidance  for its project officers that will outline the procedures the project officers  must follow to formally close out a grant. According to DOE officials, the  upcoming internal closeout guidance intends to recommend, but not  require, that recipients confirm they are reporting the most accurate data  available at the time of closeout. DOE officials told us that once a grant is  closed out, the agency does not require and cannot legally obligate the  recipients to capture additional energy-savings data. For the few grants  that have been closed, DOE expects its project officers to rely on their  own expertise to assess the reasonableness of the estimates, according to  DOE officials. For example, one project officer told us that as a project is  completed, he determines whether the reported energy savings are  reasonable by comparing the estimate when the project is completed to  the recipient\u2019s original estimates, saying that he expects the estimates to  be comparable unless the recipient has changed the scope of the project  or received updated information from vendors or engineers. Even if the  scope of the project has not changed or no new information has been  provided, differences may be observed if recipients used an earlier version  of the DOE tool to prepare an initial estimate and then used the updated  DOE tool to compute the energy savings at the end of the project. Given  that DOE may not know what method the recipient used to estimate  energy savings, project officers may not be able to determine the level of  review necessary to ensure reasonable reporting. Additionally, some of the  project officers noted that they do not have the technical expertise to  independently verify energy-savings estimates.", "To determine overall program outcomes, DOE officials told us they plan to  conduct a program-wide evaluation measurement and verification study  after the end of the EECBG program, which will be designed to measure  and report the program\u2019s energy savings and cost savings. However, this  effort is still in the design phase. As part of this study, the officials said  that they would need to capture more than a year\u2019s worth of data to  account for weather and seasonal variations that impact energy needs.  While DOE collects some information regarding expected energy savings,  officials noted that they were uncomfortable reporting these numbers  before completing the study, which may be as long as 2 to 3 years after the  projects are completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oversight of Recipient Reporting Data Quality Continues for the Sixth Round of Reporting", "paragraphs": ["To meet our mandate to comment on recipient reports, we have continued  monitoring data that recipients reported for Recovery.gov, including data  on jobs funded.

The size of this decline in reporting was  somewhat mitigated by the number of prime recipients reporting for the  first time in round six. In round five, 7,465 recipients identified that round as  their final report and did not report in round six. This was more than three  times the number of prime recipients reporting for the first time in round six  and suggests that further decreases in the number of recipients reporting in  the next quarter are likely. For our analyses, in addition to this sixth round  of recipient report data, we also used all the previous rounds of data as  posted on Recovery.gov as of February 2, 2011.", "In examining recipient reports, we continued to look for progress in  addressing limitations we noted in our prior reports. In those prior rounds,  we reviewed data logic and consistency and reviewed unusual or atypical  data. Data logic and consistency provide information on whether the data  are believable, given program guidelines and objectives; unusual or  atypical data values indicate potential inaccuracies. As with previous  quarterly report rounds, these reviews included (1) the ability to link  reports for the same project across quarters and (2) concerns in the data  logic and consistency, such as reports marked final that show a significant  portion of the award amount not spent. We continued to see minor  variations in the number or percent of reports appearing atypical or  showing some form of data discrepancy. For example, we continued to  find a small number of prime recipient reports for which there were  potential linkage issues across quarters. For this latest round, there was a  slight increase from 1.5 percent to 2.2 percent in the number of prime  reports appearing across all quarters showing a skip in reporting for one  or more quarters. This may impact the ability to track project funding and  FTEs over quarters. The number of reports marked \u201cfinal\u201d for which there  appeared to be some discrepancy, such as reports marked \u201cfinal\u201d but for  which project status was marked as less than 50 percent completed,  continued to be quite small and unchanged from the previous round.", "We continued to examine the recipient reports\u2019 agency review flag field as  part of our examination of data logic and consistency, since we have noted  inconsistencies between agencies\u2019 accounts of their review process and  the data shown in that field. Prime recipient report records include a  review flag indicating whether or not a federal agency reviewed the record  during the data quality review time frames. Prior analyses suggested that,  for some agencies, the data in this field might not correctly reflect the  extent of their review process. However, this did not seem to be the case  for the EECBG program. EECBG program data in this field in this sixth  round showed that 93 percent of the prime recipient reports were marked  as reviewed by DOE, which was generally consistent with accounts of  agency officials about their review process. However, we continue to  observe some inconsistency when another data field on recipient reports,  which shows whether or not a correction was initiated, is considered in  conjunction with agency and recipient review flags. A correction could be  initiated by either the prime recipient or the reviewing agency. Logically,  one might expect that if a correction was made, it would have been  initiated by a reviewer, and therefore the review flag should also be set to  \u201cyes.\u201d In this sixth round, as in the prior round, 10 percent of all prime  recipient reports for all programs had this correction flag set to \u201cyes\u201d even  though the review flags indicated that neither the agency nor prime  recipient had reviewed those reports.", "As part of our focus on EECBG recipient reports for this sixth round of  reporting, we examined reported FTE data since they can provide insight  into the use and impact of the Recovery Act funds. Recipient reports of  FTEs, however, cover only direct jobs funded by the Recovery Act.

(1) To provide more direct focus on Recovery Act programs to help ensure  that smaller programs with higher risk have audit coverage in the area of  internal controls and compliance through the Single Audit, OMB updated  its single audit guidance in the OMB Circular A-133, Audits of States, Local  Government, and Non-Profit Organizations Compliance Supplement in  July 2010. This compliance supplement requires auditors to consider all  federal programs with expenditures of Recovery Act awards to be  considered programs with higher risks when performing standard risk- based tests to select programs to be audited. The compliance supplement  also clarified information to assist auditors in determining the appropriate  risk levels for programs with Recovery Act expenditures. OMB officials  have stated that they are in the process of completing the 2011 Compliance  Supplement which they expected to issue by March 31, 2011. As of April 4,  2011, the 2011 Compliance Supplement had not yet been issued. They also  stated that this compliance supplement will continue to provide guidance  that addresses some of the higher risks inherent in Recovery Act  programs. The most significant of these risks are associated with newer  programs that may not yet have the internal controls and accounting  systems in place to help ensure that funds are distributed and used in  accordance with program regulations and objectives.", "Since Recovery Act spending is projected to continue through 2016, we  believe that it is essential that OMB provide direction in Single Audit  guidance so that some smaller programs with higher risk would not be  automatically excluded from receiving audit coverage based upon the  requirements in the Single Audit Act. In recent discussions with OMB  officials, we communicated our concern that future Single Audit guidance  provide instruction that helps to ensure that smaller programs with higher  risk have audit coverage in the area of internal controls and compliance.  OMB officials agreed and stated that they plan to continue including  similar language in the Compliance Supplement and performing outreach  training throughout the duration of the Recovery Act.  (2) To address the recommendation for taking additional efforts to  encourage more timely reporting on internal controls for Recovery Act  programs for 2010 and beyond, OMB commenced a second voluntary  Single Audit Internal Control Project (project) in August 2010 for states  that received Recovery Act funds in fiscal year 2010. Similar to the prior  project (which did not get started until October 2009), one of the project\u2019s  goals is to achieve more timely communication of internal control  deficiencies for higher-risk Recovery Act programs so that corrective  action can be taken more quickly. Specifically, the project encourages  participating auditors of states that received Recovery Act funds to  identify and communicate deficiencies in internal control to management  3 months sooner than the 9-month time frame currently required under  OMB Circular No. A-133. The project also requires that management  provide, 2 months earlier than required under statute, plans for correcting  internal control deficiencies to the cognizant agency for audit for  immediate distribution to the appropriate federal agencies. The federal  agency is then to have provided its concerns relating to management\u2019s  plan of corrective actions in a written decision as promptly as possible and  no later than 90 days after the corrective action plan is received by the  cognizant agency for audit. According to OMB officials, 14 states  volunteered to participate in the second project. Each participating state  was to select a minimum of four Recovery Act programs for inclusion in  the project.", "We assessed the results of the first OMB Single Audit Internal Control  Project for fiscal year 2009 and found that it was helpful in communicating  internal control deficiencies earlier than required under statute. We  reported that 16 states participated in the first project and that the states  selected at least two Recovery programs for the project. We also reported  that the project\u2019s dependence on voluntary participation limited its scope  and coverage and that voluntary participation may also bias the project\u2019s  results by excluding from analysis states or auditors with practices that  cannot accommodate the project\u2019s requirement for early reporting of  control deficiencies. Overall, we concluded that although the project\u2019s  coverage could have been more comprehensive, the analysis of the  project\u2019s results provided meaningful information to OMB for better  oversight of the Recovery Act programs selected and information for  making future improvements to the Single Audit guidance.", "OMB\u2019s second Single Audit Internal Control Project is in progress and its  planned completion date is June 2011. OMB plans to assess the project\u2019s  results after its completion date. As of February 9, 2011, OMB officials  have stated that the 14 participating states have met the milestones for  submitting interim internal control reports by December 31, 2010 and their  corrective action plans by January 31, 2011. We believe that OMB needs to  continue taking steps to encourage timelier reporting on internal controls  through Single Audits for Recovery Act programs.  (3) OMB officials have stated that they are aware of the increase in  workload for state auditors who perform Single Audits due to the  additional funding to Recovery Act programs and corresponding increases  in programs being subject to audit requirements. OMB officials stated that  they solicited suggestions from state auditors to gain further insights to  develop measures for providing audit relief. However, OMB has not yet  identified viable alternatives that would provide relief to all state auditors  that conduct Single Audits. For state auditors that are participating in the  second OMB Single Audit Internal Control Project, OMB has provided  some audit relief in that they have modified the requirements under  Circular No. A-133 to reduce the number of low-risk programs that are to  be included in some project participants\u2019 risk assessment requirements. As  expenditures of Recovery Act funds are expected to continue through  2016, it is important that OMB look for opportunities and implement  various options for providing audit relief in future years.  (4) (5) With regard to issuing Single Audit Guidance in a timely manner,  and specifically the OMB Circular A-133 Compliance Supplement, we  previously reported in December 2010 that OMB officials stated that they  intended to issue the 2011 Compliance Supplement by March 31, 2011. In  January 2011, OMB officials reported that the production of the 2011  Compliance Supplement was on schedule for issuance by March 31, 2011.  As of April 4, 2011, the 2011 Compliance Supplement had not yet been  issued, and we will continue to monitor OMB\u2019s progress to achieve this  objective.  (6) (7) In October 2010, OMB officials stated that, based on their  assessment of the results of the project, they have discussed alternatives  for helping to ensure that federal awarding agencies provide their  management decisions on the corrective action plans in a timely manner,  including possibly shortening the time frames required for federal agencies  to provide their management decisions to grant recipients. However,  OMB officials have yet to decide on the course of action that they will  pursue to implement our related recommendations. OMB officials  acknowledged that the results of the 2009 OMB Single Audit Internal  Control Project confirmed that this issue continues to be a challenge. They  stated that they have met individually with several federal awarding  agencies that were late in providing their management decisions in the  2009 project to discuss the measures that the agencies will take to improve  the timeliness of their management decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Open Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that Congress and the public have accurate information on the  extent to which the goals of the Recovery Act are being met, we  recommended that the Secretary of Transportation direct the Federal  Highway Administration (FHWA) to take the following two actions:  1.

DOT further explained that  limitations in its data systems, coupled with the magnitude of Recovery  Act funds relative to overall annual federal investment in transportation,  would make assessing the benefits of Recovery Act funds difficult. DOT  indicated that, with these limitations in mind, it is examining its existing  data availability and, as necessary, would seek additional data collection  authority from Congress if it became apparent that such authority were  needed.
