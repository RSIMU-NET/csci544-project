Allegations of fraud and corruption have plagued the Oil for Food program. As we have testified and others have reported, the former regime gained illicit revenues through smuggling and through illegal surcharges and commissions on Oil for Food contracts. The United Nations' Independent Inquiry Committee was established in April 2004 to investigate allegations of corruption and misconduct within the Oil for Food program and its overall management of the humanitarian program. In January 2005, the Committee publicly released 58 internal audit reports conducted by the United Nations' Office of Internal Oversight Services (OIOS).

In 1993, the United States proposed the establishment of an inspector general position within the United Nations and withheld U.S. funds until such an office was established. In 1994, the General Assembly created OIOS and tasked it with conducting audits, investigations, inspections, and evaluations of U.N. programs and funds. OIOS has generally provided audit reports to the head of the U.N. agency or program subject to the audit but also provided certain reports of interest to the General Assembly. However, this limited distribution hampered member states' efforts to oversee important U.N. programs. In December 2004, the General Assembly directed OIOS to publish the titles and summaries of all audit reports and provide member states with access to these reports on request. The audit reports released in January 2005 found deficiencies in the management of the Oil for Food program and made numerous recommendations. We identified 702 findings in these reports. Most reports focused on U.N. activities in northern Iraq, the operations of the U.N. Compensation Commission, and the implementation of U.N. inspection contracts. In the north, OIOS audits found problems with coordination, planning, procurement, asset management, and cash management. For example, U.N. agencies had purchased diesel generators in an area where diesel fuel was not readily available and constructed a health facility subject to frequent flooding. An audit of U.N.-Habitat found $1.6 million in excess construction material on hand after most projects were complete. OIOS audits of the U.N. Compensation Commission found poor internal controls and recommended downward adjustments totaling more than $500 million. The United Nations asserted that OIOS had limited audit authority over the Commission. Finally, OIOS audits of the contractors inspecting Iraq's oil exports and commodity imports found procurement irregularities and limited U.N. oversight. OIOS' audits and summary reports revealed deficiencies in the management and internal controls of the Oil for Food program. However, OIOS did not examine certain headquarters functions--particularly OIP's oversight of the contracts for central and southern Iraq that accounted for 59 percent or almost $40 billion in Oil for Food proceeds. The Independent Inquiry Committee noted several factors that limited OIOS' scope and authority. First, OIOS did not believe it had purview over the humanitarian contracts because the sanctions committee approved the contracts. Second, the U.N. Office of the Iraq Program steered OIOS toward programs in the field rather than at headquarters. Third, the Office of the Iraq Program refused to fund an OIOS risk assessment of its program management division. Finally, U.N. management and the Office of the Iraq Program prevented OIOS from reporting its audit results directly to the Security Council."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our review of the internal audit  reports of the United Nations (U.N.)

From 1997  through 2002, Iraq sold more than $67 billion in oil through the program  and issued $38 billion in letters of credit to purchase commodities.", "The Oil for Food program initially permitted Iraq to sell up to $1 billion  worth of oil every 90 days to pay for humanitarian goods. Subsequent U.N.  resolutions increased the amount of oil that could be sold and expanded  the humanitarian goods that could be imported. In 1999, the Security  Council removed all restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq could sell to  purchase civilian goods. The United Nations and the Security Council  monitored and screened contracts that the Iraqi government signed with  commodity suppliers and oil purchasers, and Iraq\u2019s oil revenue was placed  in a U.N.-controlled escrow account. In May 2003, U.N. resolution 1483  requested the U.N. Secretary General to transfer the Oil for Food program  to the Coalition Provisional Authority by November 2003. The United  Nations allocated 59 percent of the oil revenue for the 15 central and  southern governorates, which were controlled by the central government;  13 percent for the 3 northern Kurdish governorates; 25 percent for a war  reparations fund for victims of the Iraq invasion of Kuwait in 1990; and 3  percent for U.N. administrative costs, including the costs of weapons  inspectors.", "In central and southern Iraq, the Iraqi government used the proceeds from  its oil sales to purchase food, medicines, and infrastructure supplies and  equipment. The Iraqi government negotiated directly with suppliers and  distributed food in accordance with its Public Distribution System, a food  ration basket for all Iraqis. In northern Iraq, nine U.N. agencies  implemented the program, primarily through constructing or rehabilitating  schools, health clinics, power generation facilities, and houses. Local  authorities submitted project proposals to the United Nations to consider  and implement. The Iraqi government in Baghdad procured bulk food and  medicines for the northern region, but the World Food Program and the  World Health Organization were responsible for ensuring the delivery of  these items.", "From 1997 to 2002, the Oil for Food program was responsible for more  than $67 billion of Iraq\u2019s oil revenue. Through a large portion of this  revenue, the United Nations provided food, medicine, and services to 24  million people and helped the Iraqi government supply goods to 24  economic sectors. In February 2002, the United Nations reported that the  Oil for Food program had considerable success in sectors such as  agriculture, food, health, and nutrition by arresting the decline in living  conditions and improving the nutritional status of the average Iraqi citizen."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OIOS History, Organization, and Resources", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the creation of OIOS, the United States and other member states  had expressed concern about the ability of the United Nations to conduct  internal oversight.

In response, the Secretary General  established the Office for Inspections and Investigations in August 1993  under the leadership of an Assistant Secretary General. However, member  states\u2014primarily the United States\u2014wanted a more autonomous  oversight body with greater authority.", "In November 1993, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United  Nations proposed the establishment of an \u201coffice of inspector general\u201d to  the General Assembly. The office would be headed by an \u201cinspector  general\u201d who, although an integral part of the Secretariat, would carry out  his/her responsibilities independently of the Secretariat and all U.N.  governing bodies. According to the proposal, the office would support  member states and the Secretary General by providing independent advice  based on an examination of all activities carried out at all U.N.  headquarters and field locations financed by the regular budget,  peacekeeping budgets, and voluntary contributions. At the same time, the  new office would have external reporting responsibilities.", "In April 1994, Congress enacted Public Law 103-236, which required  certain funds to be withheld from the United Nations until the President  certified that it had established an independent office of inspector general  to conduct and supervise objective audits, investigations, and inspections.  The legislation stated, among other things, that the inspector general  should have access to all records, documents, and offices related to U.N.  programs and operations. The legislation also called for the United  Nations to have procedures to (1) ensure compliance with the inspector  general office\u2019s recommendations and (2) protect the identity of, and  prevent reprisals against, any staff members making a complaint,  disclosing information, or cooperating in any investigation or inspection  by the inspector general\u2019s office.", "After a series of negotiations among member states, including the United  States, a compromise was reached. The General Assembly, in July 1994,  approved a resolution creating OIOS within the U.N. Secretariat. OIOS\u2019  mandate reflects many of the characteristics of U.S. inspector general  offices in purpose, authority, and budget. For example, OIOS staff have  access to all records, documents, or other material assets necessary to  fulfill their responsibilities.", "OIOS\u2019 reporting mandate calls for it to submit reports to the Secretary  General and the General Assembly. Since its inception, OIOS has generally  submitted its reports to the head of the unit audited. If program officials  disagreed with the report\u2019s recommendations, the report was submitted to  the Secretary General. However, beginning in 1997, OIOS began listing all  its reports in its annual reports to the General Assembly and briefing  representatives of member states interested in a particular report. It also  provided certain reports of interest to the General Assembly. Further  transparency over OIOS audit reports occurred in December 2004 when  the General Assembly approved a resolution calling for OIOS to include in  its annual and semi-annual reports the titles and brief summaries of all  OIOS reports issued during the reporting period.

For example, U.N.-Habitat provided high-capacity generators but  had not contacted the U.N. Development Program\u2014the entity responsible  for the power sector\u2014to provide electric power connections. OIOS also  found that about 3,200 houses were unoccupied for extended periods due  to a lack of coordination with agencies providing complementary services.", "An August 2000 report noted a lack of planning that resulted in the  questionable viability of some Oil for Food projects in northern Iraq. For  example, six diesel generators were procured in an area where diesel fuel  was not readily available. In addition, local authorities would not accept a  newly constructed health facility subject to flooding. A December 2000  report also noted that highways and a sports stadium were built in  violation of criteria established by the Security Council and the Iraqi  government.", "In November 2002, OIOS reported that almost $38 million in procurement  of equipment for the U.N.-Habitat program was not based on a needs  assessment. As a result, 51 generators went unused from September 2000  to March 2002, and 12 generators meant for project-related activities were  converted to office use. In addition, OIOS reported that 11 purchase orders  totaling almost $14 million showed no documentary evidence supporting  the requisitions.", "In 2002, OIOS found that the U.N-Habitat program lacked a proper asset  inventory system and that no policies and procedures governing asset  management were evident. As a result, the value of assets was not readily  available. In one case, $1.6 million in excess construction material  remained after most projects were complete.", "OIOS also reported that a lack of effective cash management policies  meant that project funds were misused or put at risk. In a March 2000  audit, OIOS reported that the U.N. Development Program\u2019s country office  used $500,000 in project funds for office expenses without authorization or  proper documentation.

Compensation Commission (UNCC), a subsidiary unit of the  Security Council, was established in 1991 to process claims and provide  compensation for losses resulting from Iraq\u2019s invasion and occupation of  Kuwait. Compensation is payable from a special fund that initially received  30 percent of the proceeds from Iraqi oil sales. The claims are resolved by  panels, each of which is made up of three commissioners who are experts  in law, accounting, loss adjustment, assessment of environmental damage,  and engineering, according to UNCC.", "The UNCC received more than 2.6 million claims for death, injury, loss of  or damage to property, commercial claims, and claims for environmental  damage resulting from Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1991. As of December  2004, all but about 25,000 of these claims had been resolved, and almost  $19 billion had been paid in compensation, according to UNCC.", "In a July 2002 risk assessment of UNCC, OIOS found that controls to  prevent employee fraud were marginal, operations required close  monitoring to prevent possible collusion, possibilities existed for illegal  activities, and payment processing controls were inadequate. The report  concluded that the overcompensation of claims and irregular or fraudulent  activities could lead to significant financial risks.", "OIOS audits identified weaknesses in UNCC\u2019s management of claims  processing and payments resulting in recommended downward  adjustments of more than $500 million. For example, in a September 2002  audit, OIOS found potential overpayments of $419 million in compensation  awarded to Kuwait. OIOS identified duplicate payments, calculation  errors, insufficient evidence to support losses, and inconsistent  application of claims methodology.", "In a December 2004 audit, OIOS found that using the exchange rate against  the U.S. dollar on the date of the claimed loss, rather than the date of  payment as consistent with U.N. financial rules and regulations, had  resulted in substantial overpayments. OIOS estimated that the likely  overpayments were about $510 million.", "Previously in 2002, UNCC had challenged OIOS\u2019 audit authority. In a legal  opinion on OIOS\u2019 authority requested by UNCC, the U.N. Office of Legal  Affairs noted that the audit authority extended to computing the amounts  of compensation but did not extend to reviewing those aspects of the  panels\u2019 work that constitute a legal process. However, OIOS disputed the  legal opinion, noting that its mandate was to review and appraise the use  of financial resources of the United Nations. OIOS believed that the  opinion would effectively restrict any meaningful audit of the claims  process.", "As a result of the legal opinion, UNCC did not respond to many OIOS  observations and recommendations, considering them beyond the scope  of an audit. According to OIOS, UNCC accepted about $3.3 million of the  more than $500 million in recommended claims reductions.

At the time of the audit report in July 2002, the estimated  total value of the contract was $21.3 million, with an annual contract value  of $5.3 million. OIOS found that OIP had made no inspection visits to Iraq  and posted no contract management staff in Iraq. However, OIP had  certified that Saybolt\u2019s compliance with the contract was satisfactory and  approved extensions to the contract. In addition, OIOS estimated that the  United Nations paid $1 million more than was necessary because  equipment costs were already built into the inspectors\u2019 daily fee structure.  OIOS asserted that these costs should have been charged as a one-time  expenditure. OIOS recommended that OIP recover the $1 million paid for  equipment and that future contracts provide for equipment purchases as  one-time expenditures. OIP did not respond to the auditors\u2019 first  recommendation and did not agree with the second recommendation.", "The first contract for inspecting imported commodities was with Lloyds\u2019  Register Inspection Ltd.; the initial 6-month contract was for $4.5 million,  and the total value of the contract increased to more than $25 million by  July 1999. Lloyds\u2019 agents were to monitor, verify, inspect, test, and  authenticate humanitarian supplies imported into Iraq at three entry  points.", "In July 1999, OIOS found deficiencies in OIP\u2019s oversight of Lloyds\u2019  contract. OIP had certified Lloyd\u2019s invoices for payment without any on- site verification or inspection reports. OIOS reported that Lloyds\u2019 used  suppliers\u2019 manifests to authenticate the weight of bulk cargo and did not  independently test the quality of medicines and vaccines supplied. In  responding to the audit\u2019s findings, OIP rejected the call for on-site  inspections and stated that any dissatisfaction with Lloyds\u2019 services should  come from the suppliers or their home countries.", "OIP awarded a new contract to Cotecna Inspection S.A. Similar to Lloyd\u2019s,  Cotecna was to verify that the description, value, quantity, and quality of  supplies arriving in Iraq were in accordance with the criteria established  by the sanctions committee. In April 2003, OIOS cited concerns about  procurement issues and amendments and extensions to Cotecna\u2019s original  $4.9 million contract. Specifically, OIOS found that, 4 days after the  contract was signed, OIP increased Cotecna\u2019s contract by $356,000. The  amendment included additional costs for communication equipment and  operations that OIOS asserted were included in the original contract.

The Iraqi  government used these funds to purchase goods and equipment for central  and southern Iraq and food and medical supplies for the entire country. As  we reported in 2004, the Iraqi government\u2019s ability to negotiate contracts  directly with the suppliers of commodities was an important factor in  enabling Iraq to levy illegal commissions.", "OIP was responsible for examining contracts for price and value at its New  York headquarters. In addition, the U.N. sanctions committee reviewed  contracts primarily to remove dual-use items that Iraq could use in its  weapons programs. However, it remains unclear which U.N. entity  reviewed Iraq contracts for price reasonableness.", "OIOS did not assess the humanitarian contracts or OIP\u2019s roles and  responsibilities and its relationship with the sanctions committee. OIOS  believed that these contracts were outside its purview because the  sanctions committee was responsible for their approval. OIP management  also steered OIOS toward program activities in Iraq rather than  headquarters functions where OIP reviewed the humanitarian contracts.", "Even when OIOS requested funds to conduct an assessment of OIP  operations, the funds were denied. For example, in May 2002, OIP\u2019s  executive director did not approve a request to conduct a risk assessment  of OIP\u2019s Program Management Division, citing financial reasons. The  Committee also noted that the practice of allowing the heads of programs  the right to fund internal audit activities leads to excluding high-risk areas  from internal audit examination. The Committee therefore recommended  that the Internal Audit Division\u2019s budgets and staffing levels for all  activities be submitted directly to the General Assembly.", "In addition, OIOS assigned only 2 to 6 auditors to cover the Oil for Food  program. The Committee found that this level of staffing was low  compared to OIOS\u2019 oversight of peacekeeping operations. In addition, the  U.N. Board of Auditors indicated that 12 auditors were needed for every  $1 billion in U.N. expenditures. The Committee concluded that the Oil for  Food program should therefore have had more than 160 auditors at its  height in 2000. However, the Committee found no instances in which OIOS  communicated broad concerns about insufficient staff levels to U.N.  management.", "OIOS also encountered problems in its efforts to widen the distribution of  its reporting beyond the head of the agency audited. In August 2000, OIOS  proposed to send its reports to the Security Council. However, the  Committee reported that the OIP director opposed this proposal, stating  that it would compromise the division of responsibility between internal  and external audit.
