The SOPP is to provide guidance and direction, while  preserving some autonomy for field unit commanders to conduct  operations, as events require.", "As shown in Figure 3, as part of the SOPP, Coast Guard headquarters  issues an annual Strategic Planning Direction, which is to be the primary  mechanism for allocating resources and providing strategic direction to  operational commanders at the Area, District, and Sector levels. To  determine and plan for how assets are to be allocated, Coast Guard  headquarters are to rely on mission priorities, data on historical and  current-year mission performance, and operational and intelligence  assessments. As part of the planning process, field commands are  allocated resource hours by asset type to be used for meeting strategic  commitments and executing the 11 statutory missions. The Strategic  Planning Direction is annually disseminated to the two Area Commands  that are then to disseminate their own Operational Planning Directions  through their command levels, with each District command developing its  own plan to cover its area of responsibility.

Rather, headquarters\u2019  allocations of assets in the Strategic Planning Directions that we reviewed  for fiscal years 2010 through 2016 were based on assets\u2019 maximum  performance capacities. For example, the Strategic Planning Directions  allocated each Hercules fixed wing aircraft (HC-130H) 800 hours per  year, each Jayhawk helicopter (MH-60T) 700 hours per year, and each  210-foot or 270-foot medium endurance cutter (WMEC) 3,330 hours per  year, irrespective of the condition, age, or availability of these assets. As  a result, as shown in figure 4, the asset resource hours allocated in the  Strategic Planning Directions have consistently exceeded the asset  resource hours actually used by Coast Guard field units during fiscal  years 2010 through 2015. For example, in fiscal year 2015, the Strategic  Planning Direction allocated a total of 1,075,015 resource hours for field  unit assets whereas the actual asset resource hours used was 804,048  hours, or about 75 percent of the allocated hours for that year.", "Coast Guard field unit officials we spoke with and Coast Guard planning  documents we reviewed indicate that the Coast Guard is not able to  achieve the resource allocation capacities set by the headquarters\u2019  Strategic Planning Directions for several reasons, including asset  condition and unscheduled maintenance. The field unit officials told us  they provide Coast Guard headquarters with information on their assets\u2019  availabilities through Operational Planning Directions, Operational  Performance Assessment Reports, and Planning Assessments. For  example, in its Planning Assessment for fiscal years 2015-2016, an Area  Command noted that one of its classes of cutters was 50 years old and  the cutters were hampered by mechanical failures requiring emergency  dry dock repairs resulting in reduced availability to carry out their missions  during the year. In another example, an Area Command stated in its fiscal  year 2015 Operational Planning Direction that based on historical use, it  planned for 575 hours per vessel for one type of cutter instead of the 825  hours performance capacity, as specified in the Strategic Planning  Direction. Further, district officials we interviewed told us that they do not  expect to use all of the boat asset resource hours allocated to their units  because they do not have sufficient crews available, or needed  maintenance prevents them from operating the boats at their capacity  resource hours.", "Our analyses of Coast Guard resource hour data across asset types for  fiscal years 2011 through 2015 show that actual asset use differed by  asset type, but overall fell below asset resource hour projected capacities,  as shown in figure 5. During this time period, the percent difference  between resource hour capacities and actual resource hours used for  rotary-wing aircraft were relatively close\u2014for example, about 7 percent  fewer hours were used than allocated for fiscal year 2015. In contrast, the  percent difference between boat resource hour capacities and actual boat  resource hours used during fiscal years 2011 through 2015 were more  sizable\u2014for example, about 35 percent fewer hours were used than  allocated for fiscal year 2015.", "Our review of Coast Guard planning documents and discussions with field  unit officials also show that Operational Planning Directions developed by  field unit commands can differ from headquarters\u2019 Strategic Planning  Directions. For example, officials from one district told us that based on  their analyses, they determined that their district could realistically use  only about two-thirds of the performance capacity hours for boats  allocated for one mission. Specifically, in fiscal year 2013, for the ports,  waterways, and coastal security mission, the district\u2019s Operational  Planning Direction included 8,126 hours, or 63 percent, of the 13,000  hours allocated in headquarters\u2019 Strategic Planning Direction, as shown in  figure 6. The district officials stated that allocating 13,000 hours (total  assets\u2019 capacity) was not practical based on their analysis of the boat  station locations and events requiring protection, among other things.", "District officials we met with told us that actual asset use for other  missions was similarly below performance capacities, such as cutters that  used about 75 percent of the capacity hours for the aids to navigation  mission. These officials stated that the differences did not reflect an  underutilization of their assets; rather, they considered the boat stations  to be appropriately staffed with sufficient numbers of boats to meet  mission demands. Thus, the capacity resource hours allocated to the  district\u2019s various missions through the SOPP do not align with the  district\u2019s actual asset resource hours used\u2014as reported in the  Operational Performance Assessment Reports.", "Because actual asset use has consistently fallen below asset  performance capacities, headquarters\u2019 Strategic Planning Directions have  steadily overstated the amount of asset resource hours available to  achieve the Coast Guard\u2019s strategic commitments and missions, and  there is not a direct alignment between the Coast Guard\u2019s strategic goals  and its prospects for achieving those goals. As a result, the headquarters\u2019  strategic intent is not effectively communicated to field units when  allocating asset resource hours. According to a Coast Guard  Commandant Instruction, the SOPP is to effectively translate strategic  intent to mission execution by, for example, issuing guidance and  direction; setting performance targets; allocating resources; and providing  effective feedback, including operational status and desired outputs.  The Coast Guard Instruction also states that the intent of the Operational  Performance Assessment Reports is for operational commanders to  inform pertinent stakeholders about their resource utilization and mission  performance, identify operational gaps, and provide a forecast of  operational requirements for the next 4 quarters. In addition to the Coast  Guard Commandant Instruction, Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government states that for an agency to run and control its  operations, it must have relevant, reliable, and timely communications  relating to internal, as well as external events. Moreover, agencies  should use quality information to achieve objectives and address related  risks. Quality information should be appropriate, current, complete,  accurate, accessible, and timely. Agency management can then use this  information to make informed decisions and evaluate performance in  achieving key objectives and addressing risks. Further, agencies should  internally communicate the necessary, quality information to achieve the  agency\u2019s objectives.", "Coast Guard headquarters officials told us that they use assets\u2019 maximum  performance capacities as a basis for asset allocations in the Strategic  Planning Directions because (1) they do not have the necessary  information and methods to realistically predict the operational availability  of all assets, and (2) they need to identify assets\u2019 maximum performance  capacities available to field units in the event of needed surge operations  or to respond to emergency situations.", "With regard to asset operational availability, the Coast Guard is in the  process of implementing the Coast Guard Logistics Information  Management System (CG-LIMS), which is intended to improve  information on assets\u2019 operational availability by consolidating its legacy  logistics systems into one system, and providing timely and accurate  information on the location, movement, and operational status of assets,  among other things. According to Coast Guard officials, CG-LIMS could  provide more centralized and systematic information on the operational  availability of the assets, such as when assets are scheduled to be in  maintenance during the year. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2017,  one major cutter\u2014a National Security Cutter\u2014is expected to be out of  commission for about 1 year for needed structural enhancements. An  official from a Coast Guard Area Command stated that the Area  Command has planned for the reduction in available resource hours for  this cutter, but it would be useful to have more systematic information on  operational availability across all assets. In December 2014, CG-LIMS  began consolidating data on one aircraft type and the system is to expand  to support all Coast Guard aircraft and some of its boats by the end of  2018. Coast Guard officials noted, though, that a decision has not yet  been made to expand CG-LIMS to consolidate the logistics systems of  other assets, such as cutters. The officials said that if the Coast Guard  makes a determination to include all of its assets into the new CG-LIMS  system, it should provide more systematic and centralized operational  data across all assets.", "With regard to the use of asset capacities, we do not disagree that  information on assets\u2019 performance capacities can help inform decisions  regarding surge operations or emergency situations. However, in addition  to asset capacities, information on assets\u2019 actual performance in the  Strategic Planning Directions would more effectively communicate the  Coast Guard\u2019s strategic intent and more closely align asset allocations to  the field units\u2019 actual use of the assets in carrying out their various  missions. For example, as stated earlier, one district had sufficient  numbers of assets to meet demands in one mission while about 25  percent under capacity hours. Coast Guard officials stated that although  they consider Operational Performance Assessment Report data when  determining the number of asset resource hours to allocate among the  missions in the annual Strategic Planning Directions, they do not reduce  the estimates of total asset capacity and align actual resource hour use  accordingly.", "Until the Coast Guard implements CG-LIMS or another system for asset  allocation, using current and accessible information from field units, such  as Operational Performance Assessment Reports and Planning  Assessments, to inform asset hour allocations in the annual Strategic  Planning Directions\u2014in addition to the asset performance capacities  currently used\u2014will better ensure that the Coast Guard is effectively  communicating strategic intent to its field units, realistically identifying any  operational limitations of its assets, and making more informed asset  resource hour allocation decisions that are aligned with its strategic goals.  Further, without this alignment, Coast Guard headquarters does not know  the extent to which field units are effectively and meaningfully carrying out  the intent of the Strategic Planning Directions, and field units do not have  the benefit of headquarters\u2019 strategic direction in terms of the actual use  of their assets in carrying out missions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard is Taking Steps to Improve Data Quality for Resource Hours Used to Support Each Mission", "paragraphs": ["Coast Guard field officials we met with told us that total asset resource  hours recorded in Operational Performance Assessment Reports are  accurate, but noted that data on asset resource hours used to support  each mission may not be accurate. As stated earlier, Coast Guard  guidance states that units should report at least one primary employment  category, such as one of the 11 statutory missions, for the time an asset  is deployed. The officials told us that data on resource hours, by mission,  for all assets may not be accurate because the Coast Guard does not  have a systematic way for field units to (1) record time spent on more  than one mission during an asset\u2019s deployment or (2) consistently  account for time assets spend in transit to designated operational areas.  For example, officials from six of the nine Coast Guard districts we  interviewed told us that they generally record one mission per asset  deployment, even though each asset\u2019s crew may have performed two or  more missions during a deployment. Officials from the remaining three  districts told us that if their assets\u2019 crews perform more than one mission  per deployment, the crews generally apportion the number of hours spent  on each mission performed. Thus, for example, if a cutter is deployed on  a ports, waterways, and coastal security mission and is diverted to an  emergency search and rescue mission, the cutter\u2019s crew would record the  hours spent on each respective mission. The officials noted, though,  that this may not be a consistent practice across all units.", "In September 2013, the Coast Guard began drafting guidance for field  units to capture assets\u2019 transit times in order to better account for both the  direct and indirect costs of conducting missions. Area and district officials  we met with told us that it is important to accurately capture the time an  asset is in transit because, for example, it can sometimes take a number  of days for a cutter to transit to an operational area to conduct its mission  because of vast geographic areas of responsibility. As of February 2016,  Coast Guard officials informed us that the Coast Guard was investigating  potential solutions to enhance the current software and information  technology systems\u2019 capabilities, but did not have an estimated date for  finalizing the guidance.", "The Coast Guard has acknowledged these data limitations and Coast  Guard officials stated that the resource hour data were accurate enough  for operational planning purposes. Further, the Coast Guard officials  stated that the Coast Guard was in the process of determining how best  to account for time spent by assets on multiple missions and in transit in  order to obtain more accurate and complete data on the time assets  spend conducting each of its missions. For example, in April 2014, the  Coast Guard issued instructions to its field units to provide definitions,  policies, and processes for reporting their operational activities and also  established a council to coordinate changes among the various  operational reporting systems used by different field units. These are  positive steps and should help the Coast Guard address limitations that  currently hinder its ability to accurately capture assets\u2019 operational data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Is Taking Steps to Track How Increased Strategic Commitments Affect Resource Hours Available for Other Missions", "paragraphs": ["In the headquarters\u2019 Strategic Planning Directions, according to Coast  Guard headquarters\u2019 officials, the allocations of certain assets\u2019 hours in  support of strategic commitments has grown from fiscal year 2010 to  fiscal year 2016, including commitments in support of the Coast Guard\u2019s  Western Hemisphere Strategy issued in September 2014 and the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Southern Borders and Approaches  Campaign Plan issued in January 2015. These strategic commitments  of assets are made at the headquarters level and, as stated earlier, are  deemed critical to the implementation of national, Department of  Homeland Security, and the Commandant\u2019s strategic priorities.  Headquarters and field unit officials we met with told us that it has  become increasingly difficult to fulfill these growing strategic commitments  when asset performance levels have generally remained the same or  declined in recent years. For example, one Area Command stated that its  ability to meet the strategic commitments and other priority missions was  severely strained because of concerns over the reliability of some cutters  in its fleet that are 50 years old and operating beyond their useful service  lives. Area command officials stated that after meeting these priority  missions, it has been challenging to respond to threats within their areas  of responsibility with the remaining asset resource hours. Further, the  Coast Guard Commandant testified before a congressional subcommittee  in February 2015 that the Coast Guard\u2019s mission demands continue to  grow and evolve and that given the age and condition of some of its  legacy assets, the success of future missions relies on the continued  recapitalization of Coast Guard aircraft, cutters, boats, and  infrastructure.", "To address these challenges, the Coast Guard is taking steps to provide  more transparency regarding asset resource hours needed to support  strategic commitments and the remaining resource hours available to field  unit commanders. For example starting in fiscal year 2015, the Coast  Guard began using a new data field to track the time assets spent  supporting its Arctic strategy. Moving forward, these efforts will continue  to be important if current trends continue\u2014that is, actual asset  performance levels remaining the same or declining and strategic  commitments and other mission needs increasing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Does Not Document the Extent to Which Risk Assessments Affect Asset Allocation Decisions", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard does not maintain documentation on the extent to which  risk factors have affected the allocation of resource hours to missions  through its Strategic Planning Directions. For example, Coast Guard  officials told us that the Coast Guard conducts a National Maritime  Security Risk Assessment every 2 years to inform its asset allocations;  however, the Coast Guard does not document how these risk  assessments have affected asset allocation decisions across its  missions. Further, these officials told us that they consider this risk  assessment, as well as other information, such as intelligence reports, to  establish planning priorities across its 11 statutory missions in the  Strategic Planning Directions. The officials added that changes made to  Strategic Planning Directions\u2019 resource allocations, by mission, are  discussed in verbal briefings but are not formally documented.  Specifically, Coast Guard officials stated that the National Maritime  Security Risk Assessment informs allocations for 7 of the 11 statutory  missions. For the remaining 4 missions, the Coast Guard relies on other  factors\u2014such as historic use of asset resource hours by mission and field  unit Planning Assessments\u2014to inform allocations for those 4 missions.", "Written statements provided to us by the Coast Guard indicate that all  projections and changes to resource hours, such as changes made to  allocations among missions in the Strategic Planning Directions, are to be  documented throughout the planning process. In addition, SOPP  guidance states that risk-informed methods and processes are to be  incorporated to support establishing planning priorities across missions,  performance targets, and force apportionment to better understand and  articulate the impacts of shifting resources from one mission to another.  Further, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state  that agencies should identify, analyze, and respond to changes and  related risks that may impact internal control systems as part of its risk  assessment process; and create and maintain documentation to provide  evidence of the execution of these control activities. Coast Guard  officials told us that while they have identified, analyzed, and incorporated  risk factors as part of the SOPP, it is not their practice to maintain  documentation on the extent to which risk factors have affected resource  allocation decisions. Without documenting how risk factors have informed  the asset allocation decisions, the Coast Guard lacks a record to help  ensure that its decisions are transparent and the most effective ones for  fulfilling its missions given existing risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Made Progress in Determining Workforce Needs, but Lacks Priorities for Remaining Workforce Requirements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Made Progress in Determining Workforce Requirements, but Does Not Have a Plan to Prioritize Remaining Work", "paragraphs": ["As stated earlier, a manpower requirements analysis (MRA) is to turn  documented mission requirements into manpower requirements, which a  unit can use to compare against actual personnel assigned. As shown  in table 4, for its 134 unit types, the Coast Guard has completed 9 MRAs  along with the accompanying manpower requirements determinations  (MRD); as well as an additional 42 MRAs, as of December 2015.  According to Coast Guard officials, unit types can represent an asset,  such as the National Security Cutter, or an office, such as the Office of  Civilian Human Resources.", "In June 2015, Coast Guard officials told us that based on current staffing  levels, they estimate it could take 10 years to complete baseline MRAs for  all Coast Guard units and were working on a strategy to prioritize and  complete them. Further, these officials said that they cannot meet the  demand for MRAs in a timely manner and that the units that can fund a  contractor to conduct an MRA are the ones that are most likely to be  completed. As of February 2016, the Coast Guard had not made  progress on this strategy or established a process for prioritizing the MRA  workload.", "Coast Guard guidance states that the MRA sponsor\u2014such as the heads  of the 134 unit types mentioned above\u2014are to use the data provided in  MRAs and decide if the personnel requirements recommended by the  MRAs are feasible in the context of the program\u2019s overall strategies,  goals, and objectives. Coast Guard MRA guidance states that the Coast  Guard should seek efficient staff, overhead, and support organizations  with a goal of ensuring that high priority mission activities are fully  supported. Further, the Coast Guard\u2019s January 2016 Human Capital  Strategy states that when an adjustment to personnel strength or  competencies is necessary, the MRD process is the primary tool to be  used by planners to define the human capital required to accomplish the  mission. The Standard for Program Management calls for agencies to  engage in (1) resource planning to determine which resources are  needed and when they are needed to successfully implement the  program, and (2) resource prioritization to allow the program manager to  prioritize critical resources that are not available in abundance and to  optimize their use across all program components.", "A Coast Guard official in charge of MRAs and MRDs told us in December  2015 that the Coast Guard has not issued the strategy because it does  not have sufficient resources. In particular, the official noted that the  Coast Guard does not have enough staff and lacks a system to store  analyses from previously completed MRAs\u2014such as standard workweek  calculations for different personnel\u2014that could help analyze the MRA  workload and facilitate better risk management decision making. Because  the Coast Guard does not have a systematic process that allows it to  prioritize critical resources and to optimize their use across all program  components, it faces risks in its ability to identify and prioritize the most  important MRAs to complete and does not have reasonable assurance  that the high priority mission activities are fully supported with the  appropriate number of staff possessing the requisite mix of skills and  abilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Staffing Changes Identified in the Sector Staffing Model Are to Be Implemented by the End of 2017", "paragraphs": ["In 2012, the Coast Guard implemented what it called the Sector Staffing  Model (SSM) to redistribute and balance existing personnel across its  sectors, based on its analyses of the sectors\u2019 workloads from about 2009  through 2012. Coast Guard officials told us that, given overall limited  resources, the sectors were staffed at lower staffing levels than were  identified in the SSM. Officials we interviewed at the two Area Commands  and nine districts stated that they thought that implementing the SSM was  an important step in analyzing sector workload and balancing personnel  across the sectors to meet workload demands. In total, the SSM involved  the redistribution of about 1,400 positions, including about 1,280 active  duty and 122 civilian personnel. Coast Guard officials told us that  beginning in 2014, active duty positions identified in the SSM began to be  redistributed through normal active duty transfer cycles and the officials  noted that they expected all active duty position redistributions to be  completed by the end of 2017. As of the end of 2015, 1,167 of the 1,280  active duty positions and 57 of the 122 civilian positions identified in the  SSM had been redistributed.", "According to business rules the Coast Guard established for  implementing the SSM, changes to civilian positions identified by the  SSM did not require mandatory transfers or positions to be vacated in  order to minimize disruption to the civilian workforce. This has resulted in  staffing challenges for some field units. Officials we spoke with at seven  of the nine districts stated that they faced staffing challenges because  targeted civilian positions could not be redistributed until the civilians  voluntarily transfer to a different position or retire. For example, officials  from one district told us that one of its sectors was waiting for a civilian  specialist to help manage hazardous materials, but they could not fill the  position until a targeted civilian position was vacated. Further, officials at  another district told us that one of its sectors was waiting for a civilian port  security specialist, but the sector could not fill this position until a civilian  administrative position was vacated in another sector. Because the  business rules state that changes to civilian positions were not  mandatory, it could be a number of years before some civilian positions  are vacated, if the civilians in those positions have no desire to move to a  different position and have years to work before they retire.", "Coast Guard headquarters officials told us they recognized that staffing  gaps would remain in some civilian positions after SSM implementation,  but noted they were waiting for the normal active duty transfer cycles to  be completed by the end of 2017 before considering any updates to the  SSM. Further, the officials said they were cognizant of the difficulties that  some field units are facing since some needed civilian positions have not  been filled or some unneeded civilian positions have not been vacated as  identified in the SSM. These officials noted, though, that SSM business  rules state that field units can request headquarters\u2019 consideration of staff  reprogramming proposals to make changes to their existing staff to align  with the SSM and that they have been working to rectify these staffing  imbalances and accommodate staffing changes as field units make staff  reprogramming requests."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the declining availability of its aging assets and the constrained  budgets in recent years to replace legacy assets, together with growing  strategic commitments, the Coast Guard will continue to face critical  decisions about how to best allocate its limited assets to meet its  mandated mission responsibilities. The Coast Guard uses the Standard  Operational Planning Process (SOPP) to allocate asset resource hours to  its field units for meeting their missions, but this planning process  allocates maximum asset resource hour capacities and does not also  include more realistic operational targets. However, by incorporating data  that field units provide to Coast Guard headquarters on assets\u2019  performance\u2014such as Operational Performance Assessment Reports  and Planning Assessments\u2014to inform asset hour allocations in  headquarters\u2019 annual Strategic Planning Directions, the Coast Guard  would be better positioned to ensure it is identifying any operational  limitations of its assets, making more informed asset resource hour  allocation decisions, and more effectively communicating strategic intent  to its field units.", "The Coast Guard does not maintain documentation on the extent to which  risk factors have affected the allocation of asset resource hours to  missions through its annual Strategic Planning Directions.
