The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (known as the Welfare Reform Act) made major changes to this program, effective in January 1997. It reduced the federal reimbursements that sponsors receive for meals served and eliminated the federal reimbursement for a fourth daily meal provided in summer camps and in programs that primarily serve migrant children.", "Because of questions raised about the impact that the reductions in the federal reimbursements might have had on access to the program, you asked us to report on (1) the number and characteristics of sponsors participating in and dropping out of the program before and after the decrease in the reimbursements, (2) the number of children and meals served by the program before and after the reduction, and (3) the changes sponsors made to their programs as a result of the reduced reimbursements.", "Our report is based on our analyses of the data provided to us by the 50 states about the program\u2019s sponsors. Through two mail surveys, we collected detailed information on the sponsors for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 and on sponsors\u2019 participation in 1998. We also conducted a telephone survey with officials for the Summer Food Service Program in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In addition, to obtain their views on the effect the changes had on the program, we visited 20 sponsors in six states as well as advocacy organizations. Appendix I discusses our scope and methodology in more detail."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Summer Food Service Program is a federal entitlement program that provides funds for program sponsors to serve free nutritious meals to children in low-income areas when school is not in session. It is administered by USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service, which provides money to state agencies to operate the program and to reimburse local eligible sponsors for meals served to children at designated locations. Eligible sponsoring organizations include (1) public or private nonprofit schools; (2) units of local, municipal, county, or state governments, such as county or city recreation programs; (3) private nonprofit groups, such as Boys and Girls Clubs or churches; (4) residential camps; and (5) National Youth Sports Programs. In fiscal year 1997, sponsors served over 128 million meals at a total federal cost of about $258 million.", "Local program sponsors can qualify to be reimbursed for the free meals served to all children 18 or younger by operating a site in an eligible area. Eligible areas are those in which at least 50 percent of the local children are from households with an income at or below the eligibility level for free and reduced-price school meals\u2014185 percent of the federal poverty guidelines ($29,693 for a family of four in the summer of 1997). Sponsors can also qualify for reimbursements for free meals served to all children at sites not located in eligible areas if at least 50 percent of the children enrolled at such sites are eligible for free or reduced-price school meals. Finally, camps may be reimbursed only for meals that are served to children who have been individually determined to be eligible because of their household income.", "The meals that sponsors provide must meet the program\u2019s nutritional requirements. Most sponsors can receive federal subsidies for only two meals per child per day. However, camps and programs primarily serving migrant children can receive subsidies for up to three meals each day for each child. This three-meal allowance is a change in the program made by the Welfare Reform Act. Previously, these sponsors could receive reimbursements for up to four meals per day.", "Sponsors are reimbursed in two different categories for their costs of preparing and serving free meals. One category covers the administrative costs incurred in the management of the Summer Food Service Program, such as office expenses, the support staff\u2019s salaries, insurance, and some financial management costs. The second category covers the operating costs for purchasing, preparing, transporting, and serving the food; supporting program activities, paying salaries for the staff supervising the children; and providing transportation in rural areas. Sponsors must maintain records to document all costs and the number of meals they claim for reimbursements.", "Sponsors\u2019 reimbursements are based on the lesser of (1) the number of approved meals served multiplied by the established rate for each type of meal or (2) the actual costs reported. The reimbursement rates for both administrative and operating costs are set by law and adjusted each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Sponsors with costs that exceed the federal reimbursements must find other sources of funding to pay their additional costs. Some sponsors anticipate that program costs will exceed the federal reimbursements, and these sponsors offset their excess costs with other sources of funds. Other sponsors inadvertently exceed the federal reimbursements by small amounts because it is difficult to budget the program exactly. Because sponsors can claim reimbursements only for meals that are served to eligible children, their costs would exceed reimbursements if they have low attendance or prepare too many meals that cannot be claimed for reimbursements.", "The Welfare Reform Act reduced the operating subsidies for meals and snacks served under the Summer Food Service Program, effective for the 1997 summer. It did not reduce subsidies for administrative costs. Table 1 highlights the changes in the reimbursement rates for meals since 1996. While the 1997 and 1998 rates reflect increases to account for inflation, they are still lower than the rates established for 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number and Characteristics of Sponsors Participating in and Dropping Out of the Program Since the Reimbursements Were Reduced", "paragraphs": ["Since the reduced reimbursements went into effect in 1997, the number of sponsors participating in the program has increased by 8 percent overall.

However, this overall increase is lower than the increases that occurred from 1991 through 1994, when the number of sponsors grew each year by about 8 to 10 percent. According to USDA officials, no growth occurred from 1995 to 1996 because of uncertainty stemming from the public policy debates over the future of the Summer Food Service Program and other child nutrition programs.

School sponsors can serve meals to children at school buildings as well as at other types of locations, such as parks and churches.", "Similarly, the rate reduction did not have a significant effect on the number of sites operated by sponsors. For example, in both fiscal years, half of the sponsors (51 percent) operated 1 site, and 6 percent operated 25 or more sites. In addition, between fiscal years 1996 and 1997, the total number of sites increased by 5 percent, from 29,220 to 30,587.", "As tables 2 and 3 show, the 1997 reduction in meal reimbursements did not appear to cause sponsors to change the size of their programs. There was little change in the size of sponsors\u2014in terms of the number of meals and children served\u2014between fiscal years 1996 and 1997. However, the number of meals and children served by individual sponsors varied greatly in each year. For example, one of the smallest nonprofit sponsors served 92 meals in 1997, while the largest\u2014the New York City Board of Education\u2014served over 8.8 million meals. In both years, a small percentage of the sponsors provided most of the meals. Only 5 percent of the sponsors served 62 percent of children participating in July of each year, 1996 and 1997.

USDA officials believed that some sponsors chose to continue participating in the program in 1997 to test their ability to manage the program financially with the reduced reimbursements and to determine whether they would continue in 1998. However, an increase in dropouts did not occur in 1998.", "According to the states\u2019 information, a total of 675 sponsors have stopped participating in the Summer Food Service Program since the reimbursements were reduced.

State officials identified the reduced reimbursements as the major reason for dropping out for only 37 (5.5 percent) of the 675 sponsors that left in fiscal years 1997 and 1998. For an additional 182 sponsors, state officials were unable to identify the major reason for dropping out. For some of these sponsors, the reduction may have been the reason they dropped out.

To encourage participation in 1998, USDA provided program information to the American School Food Service Journal, the National Conference of Mayors, and the National Recreation and Park Associations for distribution to schools, local governments, and private nonprofit organizations.
