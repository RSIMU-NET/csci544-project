The predictable result of not effectively addressing these three areas has been numerous agency systems throughout the federal government that did not meet their cost, schedule, and performance objectives. Problems related to disciplined processes included requirements management, testing, data conversion and system interfaces, and risk and project management. Human capital management issues included strategic workforce planning, human resources, and change management. Other areas of IT management identified as problems included enterprise architecture, investment management, and information security. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has undertaken a number of initiatives to reduce the risks associated with acquiring and implementing financial management systems and addressing long-standing financial management problems. Some of these initiatives are in collaboration with others and are broad-based attempts to reform financial management operations governmentwide. First, OMB has developed and continues to evolve Federal Enterprise Architecture products and has required a mapping of agency architectures to this federal architecture. Another key OMB initiative is referred to as the financial management line of business which established centers of excellence to consolidate financial management activities for major agencies through cross-servicing arrangements. Finally, certain financial management activities and responsibilities have been reassigned to OMB, the Financial Systems Integration Office, and a Chief Financial Officers Council Committee. OMB's initiatives for reforming financial management systems governmentwide could help address the key causes of system implementation failures, but further actions are needed to fully define and implement the processes necessary to successfully complete these initiatives. OMB has correctly recognized the need to implement financial management systems as a governmentwide solution, rather than individual agency stove-piped efforts designed to meet a given entity's needs. Based on industry best practices, GAO believes that four concepts are integral to OMB's approach and key to successfully implementing financial management systems: a concept of operations provides the foundation, standard business processes promote consistency, a strategy for implementing the financial management line of business, and disciplined processes to help ensure successful implementations. GAO recognizes that implementing these concepts is a complex undertaking and raises a number of issues that have far-reaching implications for the government and private sector application service providers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has long been plagued by financial management  system modernization efforts that have failed to meet their cost, schedule,  and performance goals.

Modernizing financial management systems is expensive  but critical to instituting strong financial management as called for by the  Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, Federal Financial  Management Improvement Act of 1996 (FFMIA), and other financial  management reform legislation. The CFO Act calls for the improvement of  financial management systems in departments and major agencies  throughout the federal government to achieve the systematic  measurement of performance, the development of cost information, and  the integration of program, budget, and financial information for  management reporting. FFMIA builds on the foundation laid by the CFO  Act by reflecting the need for CFO Act agencies to have financial  management systems that can generate reliable, useful, and timely  information with which to make fully informed decisions and to ensure  accountability on an ongoing basis.", "Billions of dollars have been spent on developing and implementing  financial management systems throughout the federal government.

Many efforts are under way to implement  new core financial systems and supporting financial management systems  such as logistics, acquisition, and human resources. However, recent  efforts to modernize financial management systems have often exceeded  budgeted cost, resulted in delays in delivery dates, and did not provide the  anticipated system functionality and performance. For example, as we  testified in May 2004, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) was on its third attempt in 12 years to modernize its financial  management processes and systems and has spent about $180 million on  two failed prior attempts to implement core financial systems. NASA\u2019s  current effort is estimated to cost about $983 million. In another case, the  Navy largely wasted approximately $1 billion on four pilot Enterprise  Resource Planning (ERP) program efforts, without marked improvement  in its day-to-day operations, which resulted in four more stove-piped  systems that did not enhance overall efficiency at the Department of  Defense (DOD). The Navy is now working on a new project to consolidate  these four systems into one at an additional cost of $800 million.", "Because of your concern about failures at some agencies to successfully  modernize or implement financial management systems, you asked us to  identify (1) the key causes for financial management system  implementation failures, which we define as financial management system  improvement efforts that did not meet cost, schedule, or performance  goals, and (2) the significant governmentwide initiatives currently under  way that are intended to address the key causes of financial management  system implementation failures.

Among the key issues  OFFM addresses in addition to financial management systems, are agency  and governmentwide financial reporting, asset management, grants  management, improper payments, performance measurement, single  audits, and travel and purchase cards. Within OFFM, the Federal Financial  Systems Branch is responsible for orchestrating all of the elements of the  financial systems governmentwide into a coherent, coordinated  architecture. These elements include    agency financial management systems and JFMIP standards;  interfaces between agency financial systems and other systems that  support business processes (e.g., human resources systems,  procurement systems, databases supporting performance  management);    common financial management services, including e-Travel, e-Learning,  Contractor Central Registry, Intragovernmental Payment and  Collection System, and Electronic Certification System; and    governmentwide accounting and other data consolidation systems.", "Another office in OMB, the Office of Electronic Government and  Information Technology, has responsibility for providing overall  leadership and direction to the executive branch on electronic  government.

We and others, such as the Software Engineering  Institute (SEI), have identified and promoted the use of a number of best  practices associated with acquiring IT systems. For the purposes of this  report, we have identified various elements of IT management and  categorized them as disciplined processes, human capital and other IT  management practices that are critical elements for minimizing the risks  related to financial management system implementations. These areas are  interrelated and interdependent, collectively providing an agency with a  comprehensive understanding both of current business approaches and of  efforts (under way or planned) to change these approaches and a means to  implement those changes. Understanding the relationships among these  areas can help an agency determine how it is applying its resources,  analyze how to redirect these resources in the face of change, implement  such redirections, and measure success. With this decision-making  capability, the agency is better positioned to deploy financial management  systems and direct appropriate responses to unexpected changes in its  environment.

A disciplined software development and acquisition process can  maximize the likelihood of achieving the intended results (performance)  within established resources (costs) on schedule. Although there is no  standard set of practices that will ever guarantee success, several  organizations, such as the SEI and the Institute of Electrical and  Electronic Engineers (IEEE), as well as individual experts, have  identified and developed the types of policies, procedures, and practices  that have been demonstrated to reduce development time and enhance  effectiveness. The key to having a disciplined system development effort is  to have disciplined processes in multiple areas, including requirements  management, testing, data conversion and system interfaces,  configuration, risk and project management, and quality assurance.  Effective processes should be implemented in each of these areas  throughout the project life cycle because change is constant. Effectively  implementing the disciplined processes necessary to reduce project risks  to acceptable levels is difficult to achieve because a project must  effectively implement several best practices, and inadequate  implementation of any one may significantly reduce or even negate the  positive benefits of the others.", "Figure 1 shows how organizations that do not effectively implement the  disciplined processes lose the productive benefits of their efforts as a  project continues through its development and implementation cycle.  Although undisciplined projects show a great deal of what appears to be  productive work at the beginning of the project, the rework associated  with defects begins to consume more and more resources. In response,  processes are adopted in the hopes of managing what later turns out, in  reality, to have been unproductive work. Generally, these processes are  \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d because sufficient foundations for building the systems  were not done or not done adequately. Experience in both the private  sector and the government has shown that projects for which disciplined  processes are not implemented at the beginning then must be  implemented later, when it takes more time and they are less effective.", "As shown in figure 1, a major consumer of project resources in  undisciplined efforts is rework (also known as thrashing). Rework occurs  when the original work has defects or is no longer needed because of  changes in project direction. Disciplined organizations focus their efforts  on reducing the amount of rework because it is expensive. Fixing a  requirements defect after the system is released costs anywhere from 10 to  100 times the cost of fixing it when the requirements are defined.

Strategic human capital management for financial management projects  includes organizational planning, staff acquisition, and team development.  Human capital planning is necessary for all stages of the system  implementation. It is important that agencies incorporate strategic  workforce planning by (1) aligning an organization\u2019s human capital  program with its current and emerging mission and programmatic goals  and (2) developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and  retaining an organization\u2019s total workforce to meet the needs of the future.  This incorporates a range of activities from identifying and defining roles  and responsibilities, to identifying team members, to developing individual  competencies that enhance performance. It is essential that an agency  take the necessary steps to ensure that it has the human resources to  design, implement, and operate a financial management system.

Some experts caution that unless planning and accountability for  change management are given a separate focus, the efforts will not be  managed well. Management roles in implementing a new system include  establishing business goals, realistic expectations, accountability, and  leading cultural change necessary to accept the capabilities of a new  system.

However, as we reported in June 2005, the Army had not  effectively addressed its requirements management and testing  problems and data conversion weaknesses had hampered the Army\u2019s  ability to address the problems that need to be corrected before the  system can be fielded to other locations. For example, the system  cannot properly recognize revenue nor bill customers. Data conversion  problems resulted in general ledger account balances that were not  properly converted to the new system in July 2003, and these  differences remained unresolved almost 18 months later. These  weaknesses adversely affected the Army\u2019s ability to set the prices for  the work performed at the Tobyhanna Army Depot. In addition, data  conversion problems resulted in excess items being ordered and  shipped to Tobyhanna. As noted in our June 2005 report, three  truckloads of locking washers (for bolts) were mistakenly ordered and  received, and subsequently returned, because of data conversion  problems. As a result of the problems, the Army has implemented  error-prone, time-consuming manual workarounds as a means to  minimize disruption to critical operations; however, the depot\u2019s  financial management operations continue to be adversely affected by  systems problems.", "NASA has struggled to implement a modern integrated financial  management system.

This raised  concerns that similar conversion problems would occur at other VA  facilities if the conditions identified were not addressed and resolved  nationwide prior to roll out. Some of the specific conditions the IG  noted were that contracting and monitoring of the project were not  adequate, and the deployment of the new system encountered multiple  problems including those related to software testing, data conversion  and system interfaces, and project management. When the new  financial system was deployed at the pilot location in October 2003, it  did not function as project managers had expected because of  inaccurate or incomplete vendor and inventory system data.

As we previously reported in our Executive Guide:  Creating Value Through World-class Financial Management, having  staff with the appropriate skills is key to achieving financial management  improvements, and managing an organization\u2019s employees is essential to  achieving results. By not identifying staff with the requisite skills to  implement such systems and by not identifying gaps in needed skills and  filling them, agencies reduce their chances of successfully implementing  and operating new financial management systems. For example, in our  prior report on building the IT workforce, we found that in the 1990s the  initial rounds of downsizing were set in motion without considering the  longer-term effects on agencies\u2019 IT performance capacity. Additionally, a  number of individual agencies drastically reduced or froze their hiring  efforts for extended periods. Consequently, following a decade of  downsizing and curtailed investments in human capital, federal agencies  face skills, knowledge, and experience imbalances, especially in their IT  workforces.

Customs had decided to compress its time frame for  delivering its new system from 5 to 4 years and was taking a schedule- driven approach to acquiring the system because of the system\u2019s  national importance. This exacerbated the level of project risk by  introducing more overlap among incremental system releases and  stretching critical resources. In our most recent report issued in March  2005, we found that although Customs had developed a staffing plan,  it had not been approved and was already out of date because the  modernization office subsequently implemented a reorganization that  transferred government and contractor personnel to the modernization  office. We also observed that changes in roles and responsibilities had  the modernization office and the contractor sharing development  duties of the new system. Finally, Customs developed a revised  organizational change approach with new change management  activities, but key actions associated with the revised approach were  not planned for implementation because the funding request for fiscal  year 2005 did not fully reflect the revised approach. In July 2004,  Customs extended delivery of the last release from fiscal year 2007 to  fiscal year 2010, adding a new release for screening and targeting, and  increasing the life-cycle cost estimate by about $1 billion to   $3.1 billion. The new schedule reflected less overlap between future  releases. While Customs, which is now under the Department of  Homeland Security, has taken important actions to help address  release-by-release cost and schedule overruns that we previously  identified, we concluded that it was unlikely that these actions would  prevent the past pattern of overruns from recurring because the  Department of Homeland Security had relaxed system quality  standards, so that milestones were being passed despite material  system defects, and because correcting these defects will ultimately  require the program to expend resources, such as people and test  environments, at the expense of later system releases (some of which  are now under way).", "We reported, in September 2004, that staff shortages and limited  strategic workforce planning resulted in HHS not having the resources  needed to effectively design and operate its new financial management  system. HHS had taken the first steps in strategic workforce planning.  For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  where the first deployment was scheduled, was the only operating  division that had prepared a competency report, but a skills gap  analysis and training plan for CDC had not been completed. In addition,  many government and contractor positions on the implementation  project were not filled as planned. For example, an independent  verification and validation contractor reported that some key personnel  filled multiple positions and their actual available time was inadequate  to perform the allocated tasks. As a result, some personnel were  overworked, which, according to the independent verification and  validation contractor could lead to poor morale. The organization chart  for the project showed that the project team was understaffed and that  several integral positions were vacant or filled with part-time detailees.  While HHS and the systems integrator had taken measures to acquire  additional human resources for the implementation of the new  financial management system, we concluded that scarce resources  could significantly jeopardize the project\u2019s success and lead to several  key deliverables being significantly behind schedule.

In May 2004, we reported that we  had not seen any significant change in the content of DOD\u2019s  architecture or in DOD\u2019s approach to investing billions of dollars  annually in existing and new systems. Few actions had been taken to  address prior recommendations, which were aimed at improving  DOD\u2019s plans for developing the next version of the architecture and  implementing the institutional means for selecting and controlling both  planned and ongoing business systems investments. In April 2005, we  reported that DOD still did not have an effective departmentwide  management structure for controlling business investments despite  DOD requesting over $13 billion in fiscal year 2005 to operate,  maintain, and modernize its existing duplicative business systems. In  addition, because DOD lacked a well-defined business enterprise  architecture and transition plan, billions of dollars continued to be at  risk of being spent on systems that would be duplicative, not  interoperable, cost more to maintain than necessary, and would not  optimize mission performance and accountability. In July 2005, we  reported that despite spending almost 4 years and about $318 million,  DOD still did not have an effective architecture program, and as a  result its modernization program remained a high risk.", "We reported, in February 2005, that OPM had implemented selected  processes in the areas of systems acquisition, investment management,  and information security; however, many processes were not  sufficiently developed, were still under development, or were planned  for future development. Although OPM had an executive steering  committee chaired by the deputy associate director of the Center for  Retirement and Insurance Services that acted as an IT investment  management board for the new retirement system, program officials  were not aware of formal policies or procedures guiding the board\u2019s  oversight responsibilities or activities. Agency officials stated that they  would define such a governance structure for the retirement system  project during the contract award process. In addition, the agency had  not yet developed security plans for the licensed technology and data  conversion portions of the new system. Agency officials said they did  not have detailed security requirements for the licensed technology  portion of the new system, although the request for proposals  identified the need for high-level security requirements. They planned  to develop detailed security requirements after awarding the licensed  technology contract to a vendor. Without fully developed security plans  and security requirements for the licensed technology and data  conversion portions of the new system, OPM increased the risk that  both it and its vendors would not meet information security needs for  these portions of the program expected to be implemented in fiscal  year 2008."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Initiatives Under Way to Improve System Implementations", "paragraphs": ["As the federal organization with key responsibility for federal financial  management systems, OMB has undertaken a number of initiatives related  to acquiring and implementing financial management system capabilities.

While reforming federal  financial management is an undertaking of tremendous complexity, it  presents great opportunities for improvements in financial management  system implementations and related business operations.", "Notably, OMB has developed and continues to evolve governmentwide  Federal Enterprise Architecture products and has required a mapping of  agency architectures to this federal architecture as part of the budget  review process. Another key OMB initiative is referred to as the lines of  business and promotes streamlining common systems to enhance the  government\u2019s performance and services, such as establishing centers of  excellence to consolidate financial management activities for major  agencies through cross-servicing arrangements. The advantages of this  approach are many, including the implementation of standard business  processes and focusing system acquisition, development, and maintenance  activities at select agencies or entities with experience that have the  necessary resources to reduce the risks associated with such efforts.  Furthermore, certain activities and responsibilities performed by JFMIP  prior to its termination have been reassigned to OMB\u2019s OFFM, the  Financial Systems Integration Office, and a CFO Council Committee  providing guidance and oversight.

These models are  intended to facilitate governmentwide improvement through cross-agency  analysis and the identification of duplicative investments, gaps, and  opportunities for collaboration, interoperability, and integration within  and across government agencies. According to OMB, the result will be a  more citizen-centered, customer-focused government that maximizes  technology investments to better achieve mission outcomes. The Federal  Enterprise Architecture reference models are summarized in table 6.", "In May 2005, the five reference models were combined into the  Consolidated Reference Model document to compose a framework for  describing important elements of the Federal Enterprise Architecture in a  common and consistent way. OMB views the Federal Enterprise  Architecture not as a static model, but as a program, built into the annual  budget process to repeatedly and consistently improve all aspects of  government service delivery. OMB officials acknowledged that they are  still mapping out the Federal Enterprise Architecture and making it more  robust and recognized that some lines of business have fleshed out their  areas in more detail than others. In prior testimony on the Federal  Enterprise Architecture, we recognized that OMB and the CIO Council  have made important progress, but that hard work lies ahead to ensure  that the Federal Enterprise Architecture is appropriately described,  matured, and used. The development of the Federal Enterprise  Architecture has continued to evolve and OMB has been promoting the  adoption of the Federal Enterprise Architecture. For example, for the  fiscal year 2007 budget submission, agencies will be required to use  predetermined codes to link their major IT investments on Exhibit 53 to  the Federal Enterprise Architecture. For fiscal year 2005, agencies were  required to use the Federal Enterprise Architecture Performance  Reference Model to identify performance measurements for each new  major IT investment. As we have previously testified, questions remain  regarding the nature of the Federal Enterprise Architecture, the  relationship of agency enterprise architectures to the Federal Enterprise  Architecture, and the security aspects of the Federal Enterprise  Architecture.

Driven from a  business perspective rather than a technology focus, the solutions are  expected to address distinct business improvements to enhance the  government\u2019s performance and services for citizens. The end results of the  lines of business efforts are expected to save taxpayer dollars, reduce  administrative burden, and significantly improve service delivery.", "We have long supported and called for such initiatives to standardize and  streamline common systems, which can reduce costs and, if done  correctly, can also improve accountability. OMB officials from both OFFM  and the Electronic Government office told us that they worked  collaboratively to develop the financial management line of business along  with an interagency task force. The interagency task force recommended  the establishment of governmentwide service providers in the areas of  financial management and human resources management. The financial  management line of business raises a number of issues that have far- reaching implications for the government and private sector application  service providers. This concept has commonly been used in the private  sector where application service providers provide services such as  payroll, sales force automation, and human resource applications to many  corporate clients. The interagency task force analysis estimated that  savings of more than $5 billion can be expected over a 10-year time frame  through consolidation of financial management and human resources  systems and the standardization and optimization of associated business  processes and functions. To help realize these benefits, OMB evaluated  agencies\u2019 business cases submitted as part of the fiscal year 2006 budget  process. On the basis of the review, the following four agencies were  designated as governmentwide financial management application service  providers, which OMB refers to as centers of excellence.", "Department of the Interior (National Business Center)    General Services Administration    Department of the Treasury (Bureau of the Public Debt\u2019s  Administrative Resource Center)", "Department of Transportation (Enterprise Services Center)", "The National Business Center, the General Services Administration, and  the Bureau of the Public Debt have significant experience providing  financial management services to other federal entities. For a number of  years, these entities have provided financial management services\u2014 primarily to smaller federal agencies such as the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, the Office of Government Ethics, and the Panama Canal  Commission. The Department of Transportation plans to utilize its newly  implemented financial management system to provide services to other  agencies. OMB officials told us that, at a minimum, centers of excellence  must be able to support, or must use, core financial system software that  has passed the most recent qualification test of the Financial Systems  Integration Office, which is the current entity that performs many of the  roles and responsibilities of the former JFMIP Program Management  Office as we discuss below. Centers of excellence may provide related  maintenance, interfaces with feeder systems, and transaction processing.", "Other services may also be offered, including hosting and other financial  applications such as payroll and travel. OMB also indicated that it plans to  explore using private sector application service providers to serve as  centers of excellence.", "OMB expects to manage the migrations of agencies to centers of  excellence using the agencies\u2019 business cases submitted as part of the  annual budget process. According to OMB, agencies that submit business  cases with proposals to develop new financial systems or significantly  update or enhance current financial systems are prime candidates for  moving to a financial management center of excellence. The general  principle OMB plans to follow is that agencies should migrate to a  financial management center of excellence when it is cost effective to do  so and they have maximized the return on investment in the current  system, which averages about 5 to 7 years. OMB officials told us that  several major executive branch agencies are considering moving to a  financial management center of excellence.", "In August 2005, OPM was the first large agency to announce its plans to  move to a designated center of excellence. At the time of our review, OPM  was still in the planning phase; although it had selected the Bureau of the  Public Debt as the provider, it did not yet have a project plan. OPM  officials recognized that moving to a center of excellence at the beginning  of a fiscal year and not converting mid-year was a best practice they  planned to follow. In addition, at the time of our review, the  Environmental Protection Agency was in the planning and acquisition  phase of its Financial System Modernization Project. As part of its best- value determination, the Environmental Protection Agency was  considering the designated centers of excellence as well as private sector  providers for software, integration, and hosting and had issued a draft  request for quotations. Also, OMB officials stated that they helped the  National Gallery of Art in preparing its solicitation for a new system, and  the agency recently selected a private sector firm as its application service  provider. OMB expects that most agencies will move to a center of  excellence or private sector firm within the next 7 to 8 years.

However, the full committee will periodically  evaluate the subcommittees and whether they are well aligned and still  needed or if additional subcommittees are needed.", "Other significant responsibilities of the former JFMIP Program  Management Office, which was previously managed by the JFMIP  executive director using funds provided by the CFO Council, were shifted  to the Financial Systems Integration Office (FSIO), which was established  with staff from the original JFMIP Program Management Office. The FSIO  will now report to the FSIO executive director, who will report to the OMB  Controller. Before the realignment, the JFMIP Program Management  Office was responsible for the testing and certification of commercial off- the-shelf (COTS) core financial systems for use by federal agencies and  coordinating the development and publication of functional requirements  for financial management systems, among other things. OMB officials  expect that the FSIO will continue to focus on core financial systems and  still be responsible for certification and testing of core systems, but they  plan to evaluate the effectiveness of the certification and testing function.  In addition, OMB has recognized the need for standardization and the  inclusion of key stakeholders in developing systems requirements and  processes, but considers it a long-term goal. The FSIO will develop  systems requirements and the Financial Systems Integration Committee  will be responsible for advising OFFM on the systems requirements. OFFM  will now be responsible for issuing new systems requirements.", "According to OMB officials, the FSIO is reassessing the realignment plan  described in the December 2004 OMB memorandum and recently  developed foundational materials including the mission statement, goals,  objectives, performance indicators, scope of activities, prioritization of  work, budget, organizational chart, and communication plan.

Although OMB has  articulated an approach for reforming financial management systems  governmentwide under its financial management line of business and  JFMIP realignment initiatives, implementing these initiatives will be  complex and challenging. OMB has correctly recognized that enhancing  the government\u2019s ability to implement financial management systems that  are capable of providing accurate, reliable, and timely information on the  results of operations needs to be addressed as a governmentwide solution,  rather than as individual agency stove-piped efforts designed to meet a  given entity\u2019s needs. However, OMB has not yet fully defined and  implemented the processes needed to successfully complete these  initiatives. Specifically, based on industry best practices, we identified  four key concepts that are not yet fully developed and integrated in OMB\u2019s  initiatives and related processes. While OMB has addressed certain  elements of these best practices in its initiatives, many specific steps are  not yet completed. Careful consideration of these four concepts, each one  building upon the next, will be integral to the success of OMB\u2019s initiatives  and will help break the cycle of failure in implementing financial  management systems. The four concepts are (1) developing a concept of  operations, (2) defining standard business processes, (3) developing a  strategy for ensuring that agencies are migrated to a limited number of  application service providers in accordance with OMB\u2019s stated approach,  and (4) defining and effectively implementing disciplined processes  necessary to properly manage the specific projects. The following sections  highlight the key issues to be considered for each of the four areas."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Concept of Operations Provides Foundation", "paragraphs": ["What is considered a financial management system?", "Who will be responsible for developing a governmentwide concept of operations and  what process will be used to ensure that the resulting document reflects the  governmentwide solution rather than individual agency stove-piped efforts?", "How will the concept of operations be linked to the Federal Enterprise Architecture?", "How can the federal government obtain reliable information on the costs of its financial  management systems investments?", "A concept of operations defines how an organization\u2019s day-to-day  operations are (or will be) carried out to meet mission needs. The concept  of operations includes high-level descriptions of information systems, their  interrelationships, and information flows. It also describes the operations  that must be performed, who must perform them, and where and how the  operations will be carried out. Further, it provides the foundation on  which requirements definitions and the rest of the systems planning  process are built. Normally, a concept of operations document is one of  the first documents to be produced during a disciplined development  effort and flows from both the vision statement and the enterprise  architecture. According to the IEEE standards, a concept of operations is  a user-oriented document that describes the characteristics of a proposed  system from the users\u2019 viewpoint. The key elements that should be  included in a concept of operations are major system components,  interfaces to external systems, and performance characteristics such as  speed and volume.", "In the case of federal financial management systems, another key element  for the concept of operations would be a clear definition and scope of the  financial management activities to be included. One problem with the  current OMB approach for reporting is that systems that have historically  been considered part of financial management, such as payroll and  inventory management, are not captured under the financial management  line of business when a particular agency reports IT investments to OMB  as part of the annual budget submission for inclusion in the Budget of the  United States Government. This is because the Federal Enterprise  Architecture coding structure for agencies to use when transmitting IT  investment information to OMB calls for only IT investments that support  certain financial system functions to be identified as a financial  management system. An effective concept of operations would help  identify these omissions.", "Financial management systems are defined by OMB in Circulars No. A-11  and A-127 in similar terms to that found in statutes such as FFMIA. This  definition is also similar to that used by DOD to define a defense business  system as provided by the fiscal year 2005 Defense Authorization Act.  These various sources generally consider financial management systems  to be financial systems and the financial portion of mixed systems that  support the interrelationships and interdependencies between budget,  cost, and management functions, and the information associated with  business activities. A mixed system is an information system that supports  both financial and nonfinancial functions of the federal government. At  DOD, for example, an estimated 80 percent of the information needed to  prepare annual financial statements comes from mixed systems such as  logistics, personnel, and procurement systems that are outside of the  responsibility of the DOD CFO. In contrast, the Federal Enterprise  Architecture\u2019s Business Reference Model defines a financial management  system as one that uses financial information to measure, operate, and  predict the effectiveness and efficiency of an entity\u2019s activities in relation  to its objectives. These differences illustrate that a consistent definition of  financial management systems is not being used across the federal  government.", "One of the key challenges faced by OMB when evaluating financial  management system implementation efforts is capturing all financial  management system investments and their related costs. The fiscal year  2006 budget requests for IT spending totaled about $65.2 billion. Our  analysis showed that, of this amount, only $3.9 billion, less than 6 percent,  is reflected under the financial management mission as defined by OMB  using the definition of a financial management system in its Federal  Enterprise Architecture. A more comprehensive analysis of financial  management system investments using the definition in OMB Circular No.  A-127 that includes mixed systems such as payroll and inventory and  including those considered by DOD as business systems brings the total to  about $20 billion. Payroll and inventory management systems clearly  support financial management activities, but these systems are not  included in the financial management line of business within the Federal  Enterprise Architecture framework. The payroll and inventory systems are  reflected under the human resource management and supply chain  management lines of business, respectively.", "Because of these differing definitions, the total number of systems and the  respective costs associated with financial management system  implementation efforts are difficult to capture. OMB officials stated that  they are currently revising OMB Circular No. A-127 and will consider  clarifying the definition to ensure that it is consistent with FFMIA. In  addition, an effective concept of operations would help bridge this gap and  facilitate the monitoring of the activity related to financial management  systems. Addressing this issue would be a key factor in developing a  foundation for the lines of business initiative to consolidate federal  financial management systems under a limited number of application  service providers.", "An effective concept of operations would describe, at a high level (1) how  all of the various elements of federal financial systems and mixed systems  relate to each other, and (2) how information flows from and through  these systems. Further, a concept of operations would provide a useful  tool to explain how financial management systems at the agency and  governmentwide levels can operate cohesively. It would be geared to a  governmentwide solution rather than individual agency stove-piped  efforts. Further, it would provide a road map that can be used to   (1) measure progress and (2) focus future efforts. OMB officials told us  that they had developed a concept of operations, but did not know when it  would be released or if it meets the criteria in the IEEE standards.  Because the federal government has lacked such a document, a clear  understanding of the interrelationships among federal financial systems  and how the application service provider concept fits into this framework  has not yet been achieved.", "While the Federal Enterprise Architecture, when fully populated, could  provide some of this perspective, a concept of operations document  presents these items from a user\u2019s viewpoint in nontechnical terms. Such a  document would be invaluable in getting various stakeholders, including  those at the agency and governmentwide levels, the software vendors, and  the three branches of the federal government, to understand how the  financial systems are expected to operate cohesively and how they fit into  \u201cthe big picture.\u201d A concept of operations from this perspective would  clarify which financial management systems should be operated at an  agency level and which ones would be handled at a governmentwide level  and how those two would integrate. In addition, it could identify the  nature and extent of skills needed to effectively operate these systems.  This would play a part in resolving some of the human capital  management problems discussed previously.", "Another key element of a concept of operations is a transition strategy that  is useful for developing an understanding of how and when changes will  occur. Not only is this needed from an investment management point of  view, it is a key element in the human capital problems discussed  previously that revolved around change management strategies.  Describing how to implement OMB\u2019s approach for outsourcing financial  management systems and the process that will be used to deactivate  legacy systems that will be replaced or interfaced with a new financial  management system are key aspects that need to be addressed in a  transition strategy. This, in turn, allows the agencies to begin taking the  necessary actions to integrate this approach into their investment  management and change management processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standard Business Processes Promote Consistency", "paragraphs": ["How can governmentwide standard business processes be developed to meet the  needs of federal agencies?", "How can agencies be encouraged to adopt new processes, rather than selecting other  methods that result in simply automating old ways of doing business?", "How will the standard business processes be implemented by the application service  providers to provide consistency across government agencies and among the  application service providers?", "What process will be used to determine and validate the processes needed for  agencies that have unique needs?", "Business process models provide a way of expressing the procedures,  activities, and behaviors needed to accomplish an organization\u2019s mission  and are helpful tools to document and understand complex systems.  Business processes are the various steps that must be followed to perform  a certain activity. For example, the procurement process would start when  the agency defines its needs, issues a solicitation for goods or services and  would continue through contract award, receipt of goods and services,  and would end when the vendor properly receives payment. The  identification of preferred business processes would be critical for  standardization of applications and training and portability of staff, as well  as for the software vendor community to use for software design and  implementation purposes. Without standard processes, the federal  government will continue to spend funds to develop individual agency  stove-piped efforts that may or may not meet a given entity\u2019s needs.", "To maximize the success of a new system acquisition, organizations need  to consider the redesign of current business processes. As we noted in our  Executive Guide: Creating Value Through World-class Financial  Management, leading finance organizations have found that productivity  gains typically result from more efficient processes, not from simply  automating old processes. Moreover, the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996  requires agencies to analyze the missions of the agency and, based on the  analysis, revise mission-related and administrative processes, as  appropriate, before making significant investments in information  technology used to support those missions. Another benefit of what is  often called business process modeling is that it generates better system  requirements, since the business process models drive the creation of  information systems that fit in the organization and will be used by end  users. Other benefits include (1) providing a foundation for agency efforts  to describe the business processes needed for unique missions, or to  develop subprocesses to support those at the governmentwide level and  (2) describing the business processes of the federal government to the  vendor community for standardization. While in many cases, government  business processes will be identical or very similar to processes used by  the private sector, these standards should also describe processes unique  to federal accounting.", "However, according to OMB officials, the lines of business initiative is  moving forward even though this important key issue has not yet been  addressed. OMB officials believed that for standardized processes, it is  important to get buy-in as the processes are developed, and not force the  process from the top. OMB officials we talked with recognized that  standardization of business processes is important, but they did not want  to wait to deploy the financial management line of business initiative until  standard business processes had been developed. OMB planned to task  the newly created CFO Council Transaction Processing Standardization  Subcommittee with the responsibility for developing standard federal  business processes. Because this key issue has not been addressed, and  the other key issues flow from it, little has been done to address those  important considerations. From our perspective, adopting standardized  processes is a fundamental step needed for all financial system  implementations, but especially for making the financial management line  of business initiative successful. Otherwise, we believe that there is a  much greater risk of the continued proliferation of nonstandard business  processes that would not result in a marked improvement from the current  environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategy for Implementing the Financial Management Line of Business Initiative Will Be Key", "paragraphs": ["What guidance will be provided to assist agencies in adopting a change management  strategy that reduces the risks of moving to the application service provider  approach?", "What processes will be put in place to ensure that agency financial management  system investment decisions focus on the benefits of standard processes and  application service providers?", "What process will be used to facilitate the decision-making process used by agencies  to select a given provider?", "How will agencies incorporate strategic workforce planning in the implementation of  the application service provider approach?", "Although OMB has a goal of migrating agencies to a limited number of  application service providers within the next 7 to 8 years to deliver the  standard business processes, rather than funding individual agency efforts,  it has not yet articulated a clear and measurable strategy for achieving this  goal. This is important because there has been a historical tendency for  agencies and units within agencies to view their needs as urgent and resist  standardization. Decisive action will be needed to ensure that agencies  adopt the application service provider concept and that agencies do not  continue to attempt to develop and implement their own financial  management systems. OMB has been proactive since the beginning of the  financial management line of business initiative in describing the goals of  the initiative by making speeches, discussing the initiative with the media,  including it in the President\u2019s budget request, and highlighting it on its Web  site. However, there are limited tools and guidance available and OMB has  not provided centers of excellence with standard document templates  needed to minimize risk, provide assurance, and develop understandings  with customers on topics such as service level agreements and concept of  operations. A service level agreement is critical for both the application  service providers and the agencies to be held accountable for their  respective parts of the agreement. Much work remains to develop a  change management strategy that addresses key activities needed to  minimize the risk associated with the implementation of the financial  management line of business initiative.", "Change management in the context of migrating federal agencies to an  application service provider will need to include activities such as   (1) developing specific criteria for requiring agencies to migrate to an  application service provider rather than attempting to develop and  implement their own stove-piped business systems; (2) providing the  necessary information for an agency to make a selection of an application  service provider; (3) defining and instilling new values, norms, and  behaviors within agencies that support new ways of doing work and  overcoming resistance to change; (4) building consensus among  customers and stakeholders on specific changes designed to better meet  their needs; and (5) planning, testing, and implementing all aspects of the  transition from one organizational structure and business process to  another.", "According to leading IT organizations, organizational change management  is the process of preparing users for the business process changes that will  accompany implementation of a new system. An effective organizational  change management process includes project plans and training that  prepare users for impacts the new system might have on their roles and  responsibilities and a process to manage those changes. We have reported  on various problems with agencies\u2019 change management including the  failure to develop transition plans, reengineer business processes, and  limit customization. In addition, one CFO Council member told us that  from his perspective systems do not fail, but there is an implementation  failure because of (1) ineffective coordination and communication  between the CFO and CIO offices, (2) excessive modification of COTS  systems, (3) business processes not being reengineered correctly,  completely, or timely, and (4) a lack of authority and leadership for the  CFO and project management offices to make the implementation work.", "With regard to establishing criteria for transitioning agencies to an  application service provider, we note that providing governmentwide  financial services is not a new concept to the federal government. One of  the 24 Presidential Electronic Government initiatives is e-payroll, which  was intended to consolidate 22 federal payroll systems into 4 federal  payroll providers to simplify and standardize federal human  resources/payroll policies and procedures to better integrate payroll,  human resources, and finance functions. Numerous agencies had targeted  their payroll operations for costly modernizations, and according to OMB,  by consolidating duplicative payroll modernization efforts, an estimated  $1.1 billion can be saved over the next decade in future IT investments  given the economies of scale and cost avoidance. Federal agencies already  have or will be migrating to one of the four selected payroll providers to  process payroll and pay employees.", "OMB officials told us they learned from the e-payroll initiative that  directing and forcing change as they had done with the e-payroll effort was  not palatable to federal agencies. The agencies preferred having choices  on timing the move and on having options for various providers. As a  result, for the financial management line of business initiative, they do not  plan to establish a migration path or time table. Further, processes have  not been put in place to facilitate agency decisions on selecting a provider  or focusing investment decisions on the benefits of standard processes  and application service providers. It is not clear how this will impact the  adoption of this initiative. Given the pressures to reduce budgets,  discipline with respect to following a clear migration path will be  essential. Without such a migration path, while some agencies may readily  migrate to a center of excellence or application service provider to  minimize the tremendous undertaking of implementing or significantly  upgrading a financial system, other agencies will likely perpetuate the  waste of taxpayer dollars previously described related to failed system  implementation efforts.", "The need for clear criteria on migrating agencies to the financial  management line of business initiative is highlighted by the following  example.", "In fiscal year 2004, the Department of Justice embarked on  implementing a new core financial system and is not planning to move  to a center of excellence. OMB officials stated that they were not  requiring Justice to move to a center of excellence because it had  unique needs and was already far enough along in its attempt to  modernize and consolidate the financial systems used throughout the  agency. OMB officials also speculated that Justice might eventually  become a center of excellence that focuses on law enforcement  agencies and addresses the law enforcement community\u2019s unique  needs. According to a supporting document of the Analytical  Perspectives, Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year  2006, Justice spent about $6.9 million on modernizing its core financial  system in fiscal year 2004. Further, Justice planned to spend $23.1  million for modernization during fiscal year 2005, and expects fiscal  year 2006 modernization costs to more than triple to $72.5 million. In  October 2004, the IG reported that little progress had been made in  implementing the new system and continued to report financial  management and systems as a top management challenge. Thus, it is  not clear why Justice should continue with its financial systems  development project when the cost is expected to significantly escalate  and significant challenges remain.", "Further, the application service provider concept will still require that  agencies address long-standing human capital problems by incorporating  elements of strategic workforce planning such as (1) aligning an  organization\u2019s human capital program with its current and emerging  mission and programmatic goals and (2) developing long-term strategies  for acquiring, developing, and retaining an organization\u2019s total workforce  to meet the needs of the future. This includes a range of activities from  identifying and defining roles and responsibilities, to identifying team  members, to developing individual competencies that enhance  performance. To maintain and enhance the capabilities of IT staff,  organizations should develop and implement a human capital strategy  that, among other things, includes assessing competencies and skills  needed to effectively perform IT operations to support agency mission and  goals, inventorying the competencies and skills of current IT staff to  identify gaps in needed capabilities, and developing and implementing  plans to fill the gap between requirements and current staffing.", "As we have testified, having sufficient numbers of people on board with  the right mix of knowledge and skills can make the difference between  success and failure. This is especially true in the IT area, where  widespread shortfalls in human capital have contributed to demonstrable  shortfalls in agency and program performance. According to Building the  Work Force Capacity to Successfully Implement Financial Systems, the  roles needed on an implementation team are consistent across financial  system implementation projects and include a project manager, systems  integrator, functional experts, information technology manager, and IT  analysts. Many of these roles require the dedication of full-time staff for  one or more of the project\u2019s phases.", "Finally, sustained leadership will be key to a successful strategy for  moving federal agencies towards consolidated financial management  systems. In our Executive Guide: Creating Value Through World-class  Financial Management, we found that leading organizations made  financial management improvement an entitywide priority by, among  other things, providing clear, strong executive leadership. We also  reported that making financial management a priority throughout the  federal government involves changing the organizational culture of federal  agencies. Although the views about how an organization can change its  culture can vary considerably, leadership (executive support) is often  viewed as the most important factor in successfully making cultural  changes. Top management must be totally committed in both words and  actions to changing the culture, and this commitment must be sustained  and demonstrated to staff. In addition, a recent best practice guide on  shared services stated that it is not enough for management to merely  support the financial operations\u2019 shared service implementation\u2014top  management must provide the leadership structure to ensure that the  transition is successful.

Although application service providers may provide a COTS solution,  effective implementation and testing processes are still required to ensure  that the system delivers the desired functionality on time and within  budget. As previously discussed, a partnership between the CIO and CFO  offices, as well as with those program management offices responsible for  financial or mixed systems such as payroll and inventory, is critical for  success. Agencies have frequently struggled to implement key best  practices when implementing COTS financial management systems. The  key to avoiding these long-standing implementation problems is to provide  specific guidance to agencies for financial management system  implementations, incorporating the best practices identified by the SEI,  the IEEE, the Project Management Institute, and other experts that have  been proven to reduce risk in implementing systems. Such guidance  should include the various disciplined processes such as requirements  management, testing, data conversion and system interfaces, risk and  project management, and related activities, which have been problematic  in the financial systems implementation projects we reviewed.", "Disciplined processes have been shown to reduce the risks associated  with software development and acquisition efforts to acceptable levels and  are fundamental to successful system implementations. The principles of  disciplined IT systems development and acquisition of services apply to  shared services implementation. A disciplined software implementation  process can maximize the likelihood of achieving the intended results  (performance) within established resources (costs) on schedule. For  example, disciplined processes should be in place to address the areas of  data conversion and interfaces, two of the many critical elements  necessary to successfully implement a new system that have contributed  to the failure of previous agency efforts. The former JFMIP provided  guidance on data conversion, and the Configuration Control  Subcommittee under the CFO Council\u2019s Financial Systems Integration  Committee was tasked with focusing on interface requirements.  However, a standard set of practices will be needed to guide the migration  from legacy systems to new systems and application service providers.  Further details on disciplined processes needed can be found in appendix  III.", "In addition, oversight to help ensure that the disciplined processes are in  place and operating as intended will be a critical factor in the success of  the implementation of new and consolidated financial management  systems. Currently, OMB guidance requires agencies to have qualified  project managers and to use earned value management tools for major IT  investments. However, OMB only performs limited reviews of agencies\u2019  financial management systems implementations. OFFM officials told us  that these reviews vary considerably in scope and that one of their goals is  to provide more structure to the reviews. OMB\u2019s review depends on the  agency and the phase of the project, and generally does not focus on  implementation of the disciplined processes used. Industry experts agree  that the best indicator of whether risks have been reduced to an  acceptable level is an assessment of the disciplined processes in place. For  example, in the area of requirements management, disciplined processes  would help ensure (1) the requirements document contains all the  requirements identified by the customer, as well as those needed for the  definition of the system, (2) the requirements fully describe the software  functionality to be delivered, (3) the requirements are stated in clear terms  that allow for quantitative evaluation, and (4) traceability among various  documents is maintained. Proper oversight would entail verification of  these requirements-related disciplined processes.", "In addition to problems with the structure and scope of OMB\u2019s current  system reviews, we noted that OFFM has a staff of only four employees  dedicated to reviewing federal executive branch agency projects to  implement financial management systems. These four staff also have other  time-consuming duties such as developing a coherent, coordinated  architecture and issuing federal financial system requirements. As a result,  the current level of detail in the existing system reviews is necessarily  limited. Moreover, there is limited follow-up by OMB on suggested  improvements they have made to agency officials, and there is not any  impetus for agencies to implement suggested improvements. For example,  OFFM officials told us that they advised an agency that there were  numerous disadvantages to deploying a new financial management system  mid-year. Nonetheless, the agency deployed the system at mid-year and  has faced problems by doing so. The FSIO also has a limited number of  staff to perform its numerous financial management policy and oversight  activities and is currently reassessing its priorities and available resources.  Given the range of OMB\u2019s leadership roles and its relatively small size as  part of the Executive Office of the President, it is not realistic to expect  OMB to be able to carry out a comprehensive review function. Instead,  agencies could be required to have their financial management system  projects undergo independent verification and validation reviews to  ensure that the projects adequately implemented the disciplined processes  needed to manage the risks to acceptable levels. OMB could then review  reports produced as a result of the independent verification and validation  process to leverage its oversight efforts. Accordingly, OMB could then  focus its oversight efforts on the projects with the greatest risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Because the federal government is one of the largest and most complex  organizations in the world, operating, maintaining, and modernizing its  financial management systems represent a monumental challenge\u2014 technically and cost-wise.

Thus, a more holistic  governmentwide approach as OMB has been advocating is necessary to  address the key causes of failure. OMB has recognized the seriousness of  the problems. Its primary initiative related to the use of a limited number  of application service providers is a step in the right direction. This  initiative is in the early stage and does not yet include basic elements that  are integral to its success. Based on industry best practices, the following  four concepts would help ensure a sound foundation for developing and  implementing a governmentwide solution for long-standing financial  management system implementation failures: (1) developing a concept of  operations that ties in other systems, (2) defining standard business  processes, (3) developing a strategy for ensuring that agencies are  migrated to a limited number of application service providers, and   (4) defining and effectively implementing applicable disciplined processes.  As pressure mounts to do more with less, to increase accountability, and  to reduce fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, and efforts to reduce  federal spending intensify, sustained and committed leadership will be a  key factor in the successful implementation of these governmentwide  initiatives.

According to one author, the average project expends about  80 percent of the time on unplanned rework\u2014fixing mistakes that were  made earlier in the project. Recognizing that mistakes will be made in a  project is an important part of planning. According to this author,  successful system development activities are designed so that the project  team makes a carefully planned series of small mistakes to avoid making  large, unplanned mistakes. For example, spending the time to adequately  analyze three design alternatives before selecting one results in time spent  analyzing two alternatives that were not selected. However, discovering  that a design is inadequate after development can result in code that must  be rewritten, at a cost greater than analyzing the three alternatives in the  first place. This same author notes that a good rule of thumb is that each  hour a developer spends reviewing project requirements and architecture  saves 3 to 10 hours later in the project.", "Project monitoring and control help to understand the progress of the  project and determine when corrective actions are needed based on the  project\u2019s performance. Best business practices indicate that a key facet of  project management and oversight is the ability to effectively monitor and  evaluate a project\u2019s actual performance, cost, and schedule against what  was planned. In order to perform this critical task, the accumulation of  quantitative data or metrics is required and can be used to evaluate a  project\u2019s performance. An effective project management and oversight  process uses quantitative data or metrics to understand matters such as  (1) whether the project plan needs to be adjusted and (2) oversight actions  that may be needed to ensure that the project meets its stated goals and  complies with agency guidance. For example, an earned value  management system is one metric that can be employed to better manage  and oversee a system project. An earned value management system  attempts to compare the value of work accomplished during a given  period with the work scheduled for that period. With ineffective project  oversight, management can only respond to problems as they arise.", "Agency management can also perform oversight functions, such as project  reviews and participation in key meetings, to help ensure that the project  will meet the agency needs. Management can use independent verification  and validation reviews to provide it with assessments of the project\u2019s  software deliverables and processes. Although independent of the  developer, verification and validation is an integral part of the overall  development program and helps management mitigate risks. This core  element involves having an independent third party\u2014such as an internal  audit function or a contractor that is not involved with any of the system  implementation efforts\u2014verify and validate that the systems were  implemented in accordance with the established business processes and  standards. Doing so provides agencies with needed assurance about the  quality of the system, which is discussed in more detail in the following  section."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quality Assurance", "paragraphs": ["Quality assurance is defined as a set of procedures designed to ensure that  quality standards and processes are adhered to and that the final product  meets or exceeds the required technical and performance requirements.  Quality assurance is a widely used approach in the software industry to  improve upon product delivery and the meeting of customer requirements  and expectations. The SEI indicates that quality assurance should begin in  the early phases of a project to establish plans, processes, standards, and  procedures that will add value to the project and satisfy the requirements  of the project and the organizational policies. Quality assurance provides  independent assessments, typically performed by an independent  verification and validation or internal audit team, of whether management  process requirements are being followed and whether product standards  and requirements are being satisfied. Some of the widely used quality  assurance activities include defect tracking, technical reviews, and system  testing.", "Defect tracking\u2013keeping a record of each defect found, its source,  when it was detected, when it was resolved, how it was resolved (fixed  or not), and so on.", "Technical reviews\u2013reviewing user interface prototypes, requirements  specifications, architecture, designs, and all other technical work  products.", "System testing\u2013executing software for the purpose of finding defects,  typically performed by an independent test organization or quality  assurance group.", "According to one author, quality assurance activities might seem to result  in a lot of overhead, but in actuality, exactly the opposite is true. If  defects can be prevented or removed early, a significant schedule benefit  can be realized. For example, studies have shown that reworking defective  requirements, design, and code typically consumes 40 to 50 percent of the  total costs of software development projects. An effective quality  assurance approach is to detect as many defects as possible as early as  possible to keep the costs of corrections down. However, enormous  amounts of time can be saved by detecting defects earlier than during  system testing."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Office of Management and Budget", "paragraphs": ["Appendix IV: Comments from the Office of  Management and Budget  o Facilitate stronger internal controls that ensure integrity in accounting and other  o Reduce costs by providing a competitive alternative for agencies to acquire, develop,  implement, and operate financial management systems through shared service solutions;  o Standardize systems, business processes and data elements; and  o Provide for seamless data exchange between and among Federal agencies by  implementing a common language and structure for financial information and system  interfaces. 3. What are the critical milestones that must be accomplished in order to achieve  the vision and goals of the FMLOB?", "Federal agencies have begun implementing the FMLOB initiative by actively migrating to shared  service providers and initiating solutions to integrate financial data among and between agency  business systems.  Nothing in this memorandum changes the expectation that agencies will  continue to take all the necessary steps (in the earliest possible timeframes) to meet FMLOB  objectives.  The milestones described below, therefore, are intended to facilitate, not delay,  agency efforts.", "As depicted in Attachment 1, the critical milestones of the FMLOB can be broken down into  three stages \u2013 (i) transparency and standardization; (ii) competitive environment and seamless  data integration; and (iii) results.", "Stage 1: Transparency and Standardization.   In order to enable a competitive environment  where agencies have more options and leverage in choosing a financial system, and in order to  facilitate seamless integration of financial data among agency business systems, additional  transparency and standardization is required.", "Transparency:   In determining the best options available when modernizing financial systems,  the Federal financial community must have clarity on how to evaluate the performance and cost  of shared service alternatives (i.e., Centers of Excellence (COE)) as well as clarity on what steps  Federal agencies are expected to undertake in order to migrate to a COE.  As described in more  detail below, a COE is a shared service solution where a single entity provides financial  management services for multiple organizations.  In order to achieve additional transparency,  two specific projects (with associated milestones) will be undertaken:    Establishment of Common Performance Measures \u2013 This project will result in standard  quality and cost measures for agencies to benchmark and compare the performance of  financial system alternatives.", "Development of Migration Planning Guidance \u2013 This project will result in  comprehensive guidance that helps Federal agencies describe, prepare for, and manage an  agency\u2019s migration to a COE.  This guidance will also include a definition of the full  range of services to be provided by all COEs and a description of the \u201crules of  2 engagement,\u201d including templates for service level agreements outlining provider and  client responsibilities.", "Standardization:  In order to mitigate the cost and risk of migrations to a COE and to ensure that  financial data can be shared across agency business systems, the Federal government must  ensure greater standardization of business processes, interfaces, and data.  To this end, two  specific projects (with associated milestones) will be undertaken:    Development of Standard Business Processes \u2013 This project will result in government- wide common business rules, data components, and policies for funds control, accounts  payable, accounts receivable, and fixed assets.", "Creation of a Common Government-wide Accounting Code \u2013 This project will result in a  uniform accounting code structure, layout, and definitions.", "Once established, all agencies will be expected to adopt these common processes on a schedule  agreed upon between the agency and OMB.   See Attachment 2 for additional details on the  priority projects related to the transparency and standardization initiatives described above.", "Stage 2: Competitive Environment and Seamless Data Integration.  In order to enable  improved performance of financial systems, the FMLOB envisions more competitive alternatives  for financial systems and an environment where financial data can be more easily compared and  aggregated across agencies.", "Competitive Environment:  To enable improved cost, quality, and performance of financial  systems, Federal agencies must have competitive options available for financial systems.  The  COE framework is intended to help achieve these results.  A COE is a shared service solution  where a single entity provides financial management services for multiple organizations.   When  the FMLOB is successful, there will be a limited number of stable and high performing COEs  that provide competitive alternatives for agencies investing in financial system modernizations.    The economies of scale and skill of a COE will allow it to provide Federal agencies with a lower  risk, lower cost, and increased service quality alternative for financial system modernization  efforts.", "Notably, a competitive environment is sustainable if Federal agencies have the ability to migrate  from one solution to a more competitive or better performing alternative that is offered.  The  transparency and standardization efforts described above will lay the foundation for facilitating  better portability of agency systems from one solution to another.", "Seamless Data Integration:   The standardization efforts, associated with Stage 1 of the FMLOB  initiative, will enable financial data to be easily compared and aggregated across agencies.  For  3 example, the development of a common government-wide accounting code will assist in the  intra-governmental reconciliation process by requiring that all common types of financial data be  accounted for in a similar format.  A common structure will also enable easier transmission of  financial reports to OMB and Treasury and assist these central agencies with aggregating  similar-type data on a government-wide basis.  Seamless and standardized data exchange will  enable the government to streamline operations through more efficient information management  and increased data accuracy.", "In addition, seamless data integration will reduce the costs and risks of establishing interfaces  between agency business systems.  By requiring standard core business processes, rules, data  definitions, and a common government-wide accounting code, interfacing systems, such as  travel, will not have to be specifically designed for each agency.  This will save agencies money  and enable them to more easily migrate between different system solutions.", "Stage 3: Results.   When the FMLOB is fully realized, agencies\u2019 data will be more timely and  accurate for decision-making and there will be improved government-wide stewardship and  accounting.  More timely and accurate data will result from the standardization and seamless  data integration efforts, including the implementation of centralized interfaces between core  financial systems and other systems.  These efforts will focus on promoting strong internal  controls and ensuring the integrity of accounting data.  The easy exchange of data between  federal agencies will increase federal managers\u2019 stewardship abilities.", "There will also be a reduction of government-wide information technology costs and risks.   These benefits will be the result of shared-service solutions, also assisted by the standardization  and seamless data integration efforts.  Shared-service solutions will enable economies of scale by  centrally locating, or consolidating, solution assets and reusing Federal and commercial subject  matter expertise through common acquisitions, interface development, and application  management.  The reduction in the number of agencies implementing their own systems will  reduce the risks, and associated costs, of systems implementations.  4.  What governance structure will be in place to ensure accountability for  successful completion of priority FMLOB initiatives?", "As depicted in Attachment 3, FSIO will have direct responsibility for completing priority  projects under the FMLOB.  OMB, in consultation with the Financial Systems Integration  Committee (FSIC) of the CFO Council, will provide oversight and guidance to FSIO on  priorities and expected performance in meeting these priorities.", "OMB will continue its role as Executive Sponsors of the FMLOB.  The FSIC chair will be the  lead agency sponsor for the FMLOB.  A liaison from the CIO community and the Executive  Director of FSIO will serve on the FSIC and support the FSIC chair in his/her responsibilities as  they relate to the FMLOB.  Going forward, FSIO will coordinate the collection and expenditure  of FMLOB funds. 4 The FSIC will assist OMB in evaluating and monitoring FSIO\u2019s progress in completing FMLOB  projects and provide feedback to OMB and FSIO.   As appropriate, members of the FSIC will  participate in working groups to assist FSIO with completing deliverables.  The FSIC will  evaluate its current subcommittee structure to assess whether changes are needed to best meet  these objectives.", "The updated governance structure ensures that the FSIO, FMLOB, and the FSIC do not operate  in separate stovepipes.  In addition, responsibility for work products will now rest with FSIO,  where full time dedicated staff will be held accountable for achieving FMLOB milestones.   5. What is the status of the realignment of JFMIP to FSIO?", "In December of 2004, the JFMIP Principals voted to modify the roles and responsibilities of the  JFMIP Program Office, now FSIO.  As a result, OMB and the FSIC were given an increased  management and oversight role in the activities of FSIO.  OMB and the FSIC have worked  closely with FSIO staff to update FSIO\u2019s mission statement and define FSIO\u2019s scope of activities  and priorities for FY 2006.", "In terms of mission and scope, FSIO has three major areas of responsibilities:  (a) continuing its  primary role of core financial system requirements development, testing, and certification; (b)  providing support to the Federal financial community by taking on special priority projects as  determined by the OMB Controller, CFO Council, and the FSIO Executive Director, and (c)  conducting outreach through the annual financial management conference and other related  activities.", "Most importantly, the projects that FSIO undertakes will directly reflect the priorities of the CFO  Community and OMB.  As noted above, the priority projects to be undertaken in the near term  will relate to the transparency and standardization initiatives of the FMLOB.  Other projects that  were previously under FSIO\u2019s purview \u2013 acquisition, budget formulation, and property system  requirements \u2013 have been transitioned to the Chief Acquisition Council, the Budget Officers  Advisory Council, and the Federal Real Property Council, respectively, for their consideration  and completion.", "Also, effective January 2006, the FSIO office will be transferred from the General Service  Administration\u2019s (GSA) Office of the Chief Financial Officer to the Office of Government-wide  Policy, Office of Technology Strategy (OTS).   There are several significant benefits of this  move: lower administrative cost through shared resources (rent, supplies, equipment, etc.)  permanent SES in place to  provide leadership to FSIO staff  access to immediate resources and expertise on IT, administrative management, contract  management, testing, etc.  fits well with current mission and stakeholder focused model of OTS   5 6. What specific actions are expected of Federal agencies?", "As described above, a central goal of the FMLOB is that financial system investments will be at  lower risk and lower cost as agencies leverage the economies offered by shared service solutions  (i.e., COEs).   To this end, OMB has instituted a policy that agencies seeking to modernize their  financial system must either be designated a public COE or must migrate to a COE (public,  private, or a combination of both).  Although exceptions to this policy will be made in limited  situations when an agency demonstrates compelling evidence of a best value and lower risk  alternative, it is OMB\u2019s intent to avoid investments in \u201cin-house\u201d solutions wherever possible so  that the shared service framework can fully achieve potential and anticipated returns.", "To the extent we require any specific action on your part to carry out the priority initiatives and  milestones outlined above, we will communicate such requests through subsequent memos from  OMB or the FSIC.", "Performance Measures Performance Measures Performance Measures Performance Measures Performance Measures Performance Measures Project Description: Develop a  Project Description: Develop a  Project Description: Develop a  Project Description: Develop a  Project Description: Develop a  Project Description: Develop a  series of measures (i.e., cost,  series of measures (i.e., cost,  series of measures (i.e., cost,  series of measures (i.e., cost,  series of measures (i.e., cost,  series of measures (i.e., cost,  quality, timeliness) to assess the  quality, timeliness) to assess the  quality, timeliness) to assess the  quality, timeliness) to assess the  quality, timeliness) to assess the  quality, timeliness) to assess the  performance of those services.   performance of those services.   performance of those services.   performance of those services.   performance of those services.   performance of those services.
