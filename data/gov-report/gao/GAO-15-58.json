According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that oversees the SHOPs, all 33 of the SHOPs run by CMS (federally facilitated, or FF-SHOPs) and 14 of the 18 SHOPs run by states (state-based, or SB-SHOPs) were accepting enrollment applications as of the October 1, 2013, deadline. The remaining 4 SB-SHOPs became operational by the following May. Websites where employers could review plan information such as premiums and benefits were available on October 1, 2013, for all FF-SHOPs and most SB-SHOPs. Other key SHOP features\u2014online enrollment and employee choice, the ability for employees to choose among multiple plans\u2014were delayed for all FF-SHOPs, but available for most of the SB-SHOPs. CMS is currently preparing to implement online enrollment for all FF-SHOPs and employee choice for many of the FF-SHOPs for 2015. Based on official estimates and stakeholders' expectations, enrollment for the SB-SHOPs has been significantly lower than expected. The 18 SB-SHOPs had enrolled about 76,000 individuals\u2014including employees, their spouses, and dependent children\u2014in plans purchased through nearly 12,000 small employers, as of June 1, 2014, for most states. Enrollment data for the FF-SHOPs was not yet available, although CMS was in the process of collecting the data from issuers and expected to have complete data by early 2015. However, CMS officials said they do not expect major differences in enrollment trends for 2014 between SB-SHOPs and FF-SHOPs. Finally, most SHOPs had multiple plans available in each county, although a small number of states had counties with no plans available. Premiums for SHOP plans varied across states and were generally comparable to premiums for other small group plans offered within a state but outside of the SHOP.", "Stakeholders identified several factors that may have led to current low SHOP enrollment and that may affect future enrollment growth. Many stakeholders reported that the primary incentive for employers to use the SHOPs has been the small business tax credit available to eligible employers who offer coverage through a SHOP, although some noted that the credit may be too small and administratively complex to motivate many employers to enroll. Other factors identified that may have hindered current enrollment include the ability of employers to renew plans that existed before the SHOPs\u2014which, depending on state requirements, is permitted until October 1, 2016\u2014and employer misconceptions about SHOP availability. Stakeholders also described factors that may help stimulate or detract from future SHOP enrollment growth. For example, the phase-out of existing pre-SHOP plans, the implementation of employee choice by an increasing number of SHOPs, improved coordination with agents and brokers, and increased marketing to small employers may help stimulate enrollment growth. Conversely, other factors, such as the 2-year limit on the availability of the small business tax credit and the likelihood, according to stakeholders, that SHOP premiums will not be lower than non-SHOP premiums, may hinder future enrollment growth. The evolving and localized nature of these factors suggests that that a determination of the SHOPs' long-term impact remains premature at this time."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) required the  creation in all states of Small Business Health Options Programs  (SHOPs)\u2014exchanges, or marketplaces, where small employers can  shop for and purchase health coverage for their employees.

The average costs covered by each  plan are reflected in different plan levels, or tiers, and each tier is  designated as bronze, silver, gold, or platinum. In addition, beginning on  January 1, 2014, issuers are no longer able to consider the average  health status of a particular group when setting premium rates and can  only adjust premiums based on enrollment type (individual or family  enrollment), geographic area, age, and tobacco use.

In addition, stakeholders said that low awareness  stemmed from a federal and state emphasis on highlighting the  availability of the individual exchanges. For example, exchange  officials from one SB-SHOP state noted that employer awareness of  the SHOP remained low in part because the state initially focused  outreach and marketing efforts on the individual exchange. However,  exchange officials from this and another SB-SHOP state reported that  with the end of their individual exchanges\u2019 open enrollment periods,  the states are now focusing outreach and marketing efforts on their  SHOPs, which must provide for rolling enrollment.", "Renewal of existing, noncompliant plans. The majority of  stakeholders\u2014including national-level groups as well as stakeholders  representing four of the five states included in our study\u2014said that the  ability for employers to renew their existing, non-PPACA compliant  plans may have limited SHOP enrollment. National-level employer  and agent and broker groups we interviewed said that most small  employers chose to renew their existing plans in states where this  was permitted, in part due to a general preference for the status quo,  as well as other factors, such as concerns about potential premium  increases associated with new plans. Kentucky, California, and  Illinois exchange officials, as well as CMS officials who participated in  the implementation of the SHOP in Illinois and Texas, said that the  renewal of these plans may have limited SHOP enrollment in these  states.", "Technical challenges and administrative burden. Some  stakeholders said that the ongoing technical challenges and  administrative burden associated with many of the SHOPs have  served as a barrier to entry for employers, in part by discouraging  some agents and brokers from recommending the SHOP to  employers. National- and state-level employer group representatives  reported hearing from small employers that they have avoided SHOPs  due to technical challenges with SHOP websites, as well as  administrative burdens, such as difficulty reaching customer service  and, in some cases, the need to send application paperwork by mail.  State exchange officials reported that they worked closely with agents  and brokers to establish their SB-SHOPs, particularly given that most  small employers have traditionally relied on agents and brokers when  purchasing coverage for their employees. However, state exchange  officials and other stakeholders, including CMS officials, noted that  agents and brokers still faced challenges associated with using  SHOPs. These challenges included, in some cases, poor or  inaccessible customer service for brokers; poor training for brokers on  SHOP requirements; the extra time required to explain SHOP  requirements to clients; challenges receiving compensation; and the  lack of a dedicated broker \u201cportal\u201d on some SHOP websites that  would allow brokers to set up and help manage accounts for their  clients.challenges such as these have led some agents and brokers to avoid  recommending that their small employer clients use the SHOP."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Identified Various Factors That Have the Potential to Contribute to or Detract from Future SHOP Enrollment Growth", "paragraphs": ["Despite the various factors that may have restrained SHOP enrollment to  date, many stakeholders noted that certain other factors suggest that the  SHOPs have the potential to experience future enrollment growth.  According to some stakeholders, central to enrollment growth will be the  phasing out of noncompliant plans, the resolution of the technical  challenges and reduction of the administrative burden cited as hampering  current enrollment, and the demonstration of a \u201cvalue proposition\u201d that  gives employers a reason for preferring SHOP-based coverage to  coverage available outside the SHOP. Stakeholders suggested several  additional factors that could help stimulate future SHOP enrollment  growth.", "Improved coordination with agents and brokers. Stakeholders,  including CMS officials, state exchange officials, and issuer,  employer, and agent and broker representatives, emphasized the  importance of coordinating with and providing improved web- or  phone-based tools to agents and brokers in order to facilitate SHOP  enrollment. States and CMS reported taking steps to resolve certain  challenges faced by agents and brokers when using the SHOP. For  example, Kentucky exchange officials said that they are working to  develop a tool that will allow agents and brokers to easily provide  price quotes across multiple SHOP plans to their clients, and are  considering allowing SHOP-certified agents and brokers to initiate  applications on behalf of employers. Illinois exchange officials  reported developing a dedicated section for agents and brokers on the  state\u2019s SHOP website through which agents and brokers can obtain  updated information on the SHOP, in response to feedback from  agent and broker community leaders. CMS officials said that  establishing a broker portal for the FF-SHOPs is a key agency priority,  and that the agency plans to have a broker portal in place when FF- SHOP online enrollment becomes available in fall 2014. According to  CMS officials, the portal will, among other functions, allow agents and  brokers to search for and communicate with employer clients; monitor  employees\u2019 enrollment progress; make changes to employee rosters;  and receive messages regarding employers\u2019 monthly invoices,  including any late payment warnings.", "Availability of employee choice. Some stakeholders stated that the  employee choice feature, when fully implemented in all states, will be  a key value proposition for the SHOPs. For instance, CMS officials  said that employers will likely value being able to offer employees a  choice from among multiple plan and issuer options\u2014an ability that  small employers typically have not been able to offer. Employer group  representatives reported that their members consider employee  choice to be an important benefit of the SHOPs, as employees will be  able to decide on their own the coverage that best suits their needs  and, if necessary, will have the option to spend more to purchase  more comprehensive plans. Evidence from Kentucky and Rhode  Island, whose SHOPs offer, but do not require, the use of employee  choice, further suggests that employers may value this feature. As  discussed previously, according to state exchange officials, the  majority of employers in Kentucky and Rhode Island that enrolled in  the SHOPs chose to offer their employees the choice of multiple  plans.", "However, some issuer representatives and other stakeholders were  uncertain about the value of employee choice, noting that it is  challenging for issuers to implement and that too many choices may  be overwhelming for employers and employees. Representatives from  national issuer and insurance commissioner groups reported that it is  time consuming and expensive for issuers to build the information  technology systems required for premium aggregation and other  issuer-specific functions necessary for employee choice. In addition,  issuers and other stakeholders have reported concerns regarding  whether employee choice would lead to adverse selection among  plans in the SHOP\u2014a concern that has, in part, led some states to  delay their implementation of employee choice until 2016.", "Increased marketing to employers. Some stakeholders said that  states need to better market the SHOP to small employers to increase  SHOP awareness. Some employer group representatives said states  need to improve outreach by more aggressively targeting small  employers and highlighting the value of the SHOPs in their marketing.  Exchange officials in one state emphasized the importance of  marketing the SHOPs to small employers as a product that offers  value, rather than performing traditional outreach, which is more  characteristic of public programs. The officials also noted that  marketing must be conducted continuously throughout the year, given  that employers renew their coverage at different points in the year.", "Robust issuer participation. Although stakeholders representing  four of the five states included in our study reported that issuer  participation has not been a challenge, CMS officials said that robust  issuer participation will be important in ensuring the SHOPs\u2019 long-term  viability. Issuer representatives noted that, due to the requirement that  certain issuers must participate in a state\u2019s FF-SHOP if they wish to  participate in its federally facilitated individual exchange, some issuers  will be required to participate in the SHOPs. However, according to  the representatives, other issuers may be hesitant to participate given  factors such as uncertainties regarding delays in SHOP functionality  and technical readiness; potential new requirements, such as those  related to the adequacy of provider networks; the expense and  complexity of implementing employee choice and other SHOP  features; and the ability for employers to renew noncompliant plans.  CMS officials said that although some issuers may be reluctant to  participate in the FF-SHOPs in the early years of implementation,  once information technology systems have been fully developed and  refined, issuers may be more eager to participate.", "Expansion of the SHOPs to larger employers. Exchange officials in  one state noted that as eligibility for SHOP enrollment expands to  employers with up to 100 employees\u2014which must occur no later than  January 1, 2016\u2014and, eventually, to larger employers in some states,  additional employers may consider the SHOP as an option for  purchasing coverage. However, based on the small average number  of employees per employer enrolled in SB-SHOPs, it remains to be  seen whether larger employers will enroll when given the opportunity.", "Financial sustainability of the SHOPs. Exchange officials in one  state noted that an essential element of SHOP viability will be  ensuring the SHOPs are financially sustainable. They and other SB-SHOP exchange officials we interviewed said that their states have  proposed or finalized funding mechanisms in place. In two of the  states, these funding mechanisms will draw from either all exchange  plans\u2014both individual and SHOP\u2014or all health plans in the state;  therefore, low initial SHOP enrollment is not likely to significantly  affect SHOP operating revenues in those states.stakeholder expressed concern regarding whether SHOPs will be  sustainable in the long run if enrollment remains low, particularly given  the expense required to maintain the SHOPs\u2019 information technology  systems.", "Stakeholders also described factors whose future effects on SHOP  enrollment are more uncertain or have the potential to detract from SHOP  enrollment growth in the long term.", "Loss of the tax credit. As noted previously, stakeholders and our  analysis of SB-SHOP enrollment data suggested that many  employers currently enrolling in the SHOP may be eligible for the tax  credit. However, employers may only receive the tax credit for a  maximum of 2 years. It therefore remains to be seen whether  employers will continue to purchase coverage through the SHOP  once they have exhausted their ability to receive the tax credit, and  how this will affect overall SHOP enrollment. One employer  representative suggested that an extension of the credit, or a re- design of the credit such that larger businesses are eligible, will help  ensure SHOP enrollment growth moving forward.", "Comparability of prices on and off the SHOP. Issuer  representatives and other stakeholders noted that prices for SHOP  plans are likely to remain similar to prices for non-SHOP small group  plans, which may limit the incentive for small employers to enroll in  coverage through the SHOP. According to stakeholders, small  employers\u2019 coverage decisions are largely driven by price. However,  as we noted previously, premiums are currently similar for plans  offered on and off the SHOP in part due to the requirement that prices  for identical plans in a given state be the same, regardless of whether  they are offered on or off the SHOP. In order for issuers to offer more  competitive prices through the SHOPs, they must offer unique,  SHOP-only plans that are lower in price when compared to non- SHOP options. However, according to issuer representatives, there  are limited mechanisms by which issuers could do so. As PPACA  requires that all plans offer a set of minimum essential health benefits,  issuers are limited in the extent to which they can lower prices by  restricting the benefits they offer in SHOP plans. In addition, though  issuers could lower prices for SHOP plans by offering narrower  provider networks, issuer representatives cite the high administrative  costs of creating and maintaining new networks as a deterrent.", "Competition with private exchanges. Some stakeholders, including  issuer, agent, and broker representatives, as well as exchange  officials from one state, reported that private exchanges for small  group coverage\u2014or online health coverage marketplaces managed  by private companies, such as issuers or benefits consulting firms\u2014 are becoming more prevalent and may compete with SHOPs for  employer enrollment. According to some agent and broker  representatives, private exchanges may appeal to employers  because, in some cases, they offer employee choice\u2014a key value  proposition of the SHOP that has not yet been implemented in all  states\u2014without many of the requirements associated with the SHOP.  Exchange officials from one state said that recently created private  exchanges in that state have been able to spend more on advertising,  which has made it difficult for the SHOP to compete. However, the  officials noted that the SHOPs provide increased value in that they  offer full transparency and choice of SHOP plans\u2014whereas some  private exchanges, despite claiming to offer full choice of plans,  simply offer plans from the carrier operating the exchange.", "Possibility of sending employees to the individual exchanges.", "Exchange officials from two states and some agent and broker  representatives reported that some small employers have chosen, or  may choose in upcoming years, to drop coverage for their employees  altogether, particularly in light of the availability of premium and cost- sharing assistance for eligible low- and moderate-income individuals  obtaining coverage through an individual exchange. CMS officials said  they have heard anecdotal information that this may be occurring, but  have no data. Several recent employer surveys have found that, while  the majority of surveyed small employers were not considering  dropping coverage for their employees, a minority were intending to or  considering whether to drop coverage and, in some cases, direct their  employees to the individual exchanges in 2014 or 2015.", "Potential for adverse selection. If it were to occur, adverse selection  between SHOP and non-SHOP plans could lead to increased SHOP  premiums and thus inhibit SHOP enrollment in the long term.  However, issuer representatives said that the similarity in premiums  seen thus far has diminished concerns about such adverse selection.  The issuer representatives said a greater concern is the risk for  adverse selection between PPACA-compliant plans\u2014that is, both the  SHOP and non-SHOP plans that comply with PPACA\u2019s insurance  reforms\u2014and the existing, noncompliant plans that have been  renewed. This risk may be temporary, as CMS\u2019s current transitional  relief policy, under which noncompliant plans may continue to be  offered, permits issuers of such plans to offer renewals of these plans  only for plan years beginning on or before October 1, 2016. In addition, PPACA established mechanisms to mitigate adverse  selection if it does occur among PPACA-compliant plans, and  stakeholders said it will be at least 1 year, if not several years, before  it becomes clear if adverse selection is occurring in the SHOPs, as  well as how well these mechanisms will mitigate its effect."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["The SHOPs are an important element of PPACA, intended to provide a  new mechanism by which small employers can shop for and purchase  health insurance coverage for their employees and to offer features not  typically available to the employees of small employers, such as the  ability to choose among multiple health plans. While much progress has  been made by CMS and states to ensure all SHOPs are now operational,  early evidence suggests enrollment is significantly lower than anticipated  amid the delayed availability of key functions among many SHOPs and  misconceptions by employers about the availability of SHOPs. CMS  officials and other stakeholders point to structural factors to help explain  the current low enrollment\u2014such as the temporary ability for employers in  many states to renew their existing plans even if they do not comply with  PPACA insurance reforms\u2014and suggest reasons for optimism about  future SHOP enrollment trends. They point to such factors as the phase- out of the noncompliant plans, the expected availability of online  enrollment and employee choice functions in many more SHOPs, and  intended CMS or state efforts to improve SHOP awareness and  coordination with agents and brokers. Nevertheless, other factors may  temper such optimism, such as the loss of the small business tax credit  for some employers, the potential for adverse selection, and the  challenge SHOPs may face in competing with plans offered to small  employers outside of the SHOPs. These collective factors will vary across  states and continue to evolve, suggesting that a determination of the  long-term impact of the SHOPs remains premature at this time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We received comments from HHS on a draft of this report (see app. V).
