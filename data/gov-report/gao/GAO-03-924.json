In the Public Health Improvement Act that was passed in 2000, Congress directed GAO to examine preparedness for a bioterrorist attack. In this report GAO provides information on the extent of bioterrorism preparedness among hospitals in urban areas in the United States.

Four out of five hospitals reported having a written emergency response plan addressing bioterrorism, but many plans omitted some key contacts, such as other laboratories. Almost all hospitals reported participating in a local, state, or regional interagency disaster preparedness committee. In addition, most hospitals reported having provided at least some training to their personnel on identification and diagnosis of disease caused by biological agents considered likely to be used in a bioterrorist attack, such as anthrax or botulism. In contrast, fewer than half of hospitals have conducted drills or exercises simulating response to a bioterrorist incident. Hospitals also reported that they lacked the medical equipment necessary for a large influx of patients. For example, if a large number of patients with severe respiratory problems associated with anthrax or botulism were to arrive at a hospital, a comparable number of ventilators would be required to treat them. Yet half of hospitals reported having fewer than six ventilators per 100 staffed beds. In general, larger hospitals reported more planning and training activities than smaller hospitals. Representatives from the American Hospital Association provided oral comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate. They generally agreed with the findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the event of a large-scale infectious disease outbreak, as could be seen  with a bioterrorist attack, hospitals and their emergency departments  would be on the front line. The release of a biological agent by a terrorist  might not be recognized for several days, during which time a  communicable disease could be spread to many people who were not  initially exposed. Because hospitals are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a  week, victims would be likely to seek treatment of their symptoms there,  putting hospital personnel in the role of first responders. Federal, state,  and local officials are concerned, however, that hospitals may not have the  capacity to accept and treat a sudden, large increase in the number of  patients, as might be seen in a bioterrorist attack. For example, these  officials are concerned that this surge in patients would be likely to  overwhelm emergency departments in urban areas, many of which are  already operating at or above capacity.", "The Public Health Improvement Act directed that we examine state and  local levels of preparedness for a bioterrorist attack. We have previously  reported on activities by federal agencies and state and local public health  agencies and health care organizations, including hospitals, to prepare for  and respond to bioterrorism. In this report we are providing you with  additional information on the extent of bioterrorism preparedness among  urban hospitals in the United States, specifically with respect to planning  activities, staff training, and capacity for response.", "To obtain information on the extent of hospital bioterrorism preparedness,  we conducted a survey between May and September 2002 of 2,041 urban  hospitals across the country that have emergency departments. (See app. I  for a description of the hospitals we surveyed.) The survey asked  questions relating to emergency room functioning and hospital  bioterrorism preparedness. We reported our survey findings on emergency  room functioning in March 2003. We obtained responses to the survey  addressing bioterrorism preparedness from 1,482 hospitals, for a response  rate of 73 percent and we are providing our survey findings in the current  report. The survey covered key components of hospital preparedness for  bioterrorism, including planning activities related to communication and  coordination with community and state organizations (e.g., participation in  an interagency disaster preparedness committee); staff training; and the  response capacity of the facility (e.g., number of isolation beds) and of the  equipment (e.g., number of ventilators). We weighted responses to adjust  for a lower response rate from investor-owned (for-profit) hospitals to  provide estimates representative of the entire universe of urban hospitals  we surveyed. Our report reflects hospital preparedness at the time of our  survey in 2002. Improvements in hospital preparedness may have occurred  since these data were collected. (For more detail on our scope and  methodology, see app. II.) We did our work from May 2002 through July  2003 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The resources that hospitals and their emergency departments would  require for responding to a large-scale bioterrorist attack are far greater  than those needed for everyday performance. The specific equipment,  supplies, and facilities needed could vary depending upon what type of  attack occurred, but many scenarios anticipate that the demand for health  care could quickly outstrip the ability of hospitals to respond. For  example, the TOPOFF 2000 exercise testing terrorism preparedness  included a bioterrorism scenario of an attack using pneumonic plague  released at a public event in a single location in one city. In this exercise,  officials found that by the third day following the covert release, 500  persons with symptoms had been reported and antibiotic and ventilator  shortages were beginning to occur. By the end of this day, nearly 800 cases  were identified and over 100 persons had died. In each of the succeeding 2  days, the situation worsened and medical care in the city was described as  beginning to shut down, with insufficient hospital staff, beds, ventilators,  and drugs. At the conclusion of the exercise, 1 week after the attack, an  estimated 3,700 cases of plague had been reported, with 950 to 2,000  deaths, including cases in other cities and abroad. In the early stages of the  epidemic, hospitals were seeing 2 to 3 times their normal volume of  patients and later in the exercise up to 10 times normal volumes were  arriving at hospitals. Hospitals were not able to effectively isolate patients  to prevent the spread of the disease to hospital staff.", "In order to be adequately prepared for bioterrorism, hospitals would need  to have several basic capabilities, whether they possess them directly or  have access to them through regional agreements. Plans that describe how  hospitals would work with state and local officials to manage and  coordinate an emergency response would need to be in place and to have  been tested in an exercise, both at the state and local levels and at the  regional level. Regional plans can help address capacity deficiencies by  providing for the sharing, among hospitals and other community and state  agencies and organizations, of resources that, while adequate for everyday  needs, may be in short supply on a local level in an emergency. In addition,  hospitals would need to be able to communicate easily with all  organizations involved in the response as events unfold and critical  information is acquired. Staff would need to be able to recognize and  report to their state or local health department any illness patterns or  diagnostic clues that might indicate an outbreak of a disease caused by a  biological agent likely to be used by a terrorist. Finally, hospitals would  need to have the capacity and staff necessary to treat large numbers of  severely ill patients and limit the spread of infectious disease. They would  need adequate stores of equipment and supplies, including medications,  personal protective equipment, quarantine and isolation facilities, and air  handling and filtration equipment.", "Many of the capabilities required for responding to a large-scale  bioterrorist attack are also required for response to naturally occurring  disease outbreaks. Such a \u201cdual-use\u201d response infrastructure improves the  capacity of local public health agencies to respond to all hazards. For  example, a large-scale outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome  (SARS) would require many of the same capabilities that would be needed  to respond to an intentionally caused epidemic.", "Prior to our survey, efforts had been made by organizations to assist  hospitals in preparing for bioterrorism. For example, the American  Hospital Association distributed a checklist to help hospitals describe and  assess their state of preparedness for chemical and biological incidents.  This checklist covered, for example, emergency response plans for  hospital operations during a biological or chemical disaster; emergency  preparedness training of the workers; and the hospital\u2019s ability to increase  its capacity\u2014for example, in terms of such items as ventilators and  decontamination equipment\u2014in the event of a large number of patients  seeking care. Another organization, the Association for Professionals in  Infection Control and Epidemiology, developed a mass casualty disaster  plan checklist for health care facilities, including hospitals. This checklist  included disease surveillance activities, communication systems, plans  for receiving and treating casualties, and plans for the organized discharge  of nonemergency patients on short notice.", "Nevertheless, in our April 2003 report, we noted the general lack of  guidance on what capacities hospitals should have to be prepared for  bioterrorism. We also noted that efforts to improve hospitals\u2019 bioterrorism  response capacities must be mindful that hospitals face multiple  challenges, including having to prepare for other types of disasters and  continuing to meet the everyday needs of cities for emergency care. In that  report, among other things, we recommended that the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) develop specific benchmarks that  define adequate preparedness for a bioterrorist attack and can be used to  guide preparedness efforts.", "Since our survey, there have been continuing efforts to assist hospitals in  bioterrorism preparedness. For example, the Joint Commission on  Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations released a report in 2003 on  strategies for creating and sustaining communitywide preparedness  systems for health care organizations, including hospitals. The report  outlined critical issues to be addressed in developing communitywide  preparedness and discussed federal and state responsibilities for  eliminating barriers to preparedness and for facilitating and sustaining  hospital and community-based emergency preparedness. It called for  hospitals to address the full range of potential disasters, including  terrorism, in their planning and to be aware of the specific hazards  applicable to their communities.", "The federal government has also provided assistance for improving the  bioterrorism preparedness of hospitals. In January 2002 HHS announced  the availability of funding for that purpose. The Bioterrorism Hospital  Preparedness Program, administered by HHS\u2019s Health Resources and  Services Administration (HRSA), provided funding in fiscal year 2002 of  approximately $125 million through cooperative agreements to states and  eligible municipalities to enhance the capacity of hospitals and associated  health care entities to respond to bioterrorism.", "These noncompetitive cooperative agreements covered two phases. In the  first phase, states and municipalities applying for this funding were  required to develop a needs assessment for a comprehensive bioterrorism  preparedness program for hospitals and other health care entities, such as  community health centers, and an implementation plan, as well as to begin  initial implementation of the plan. Applications for the first phase were  due to HHS by February 25, 2002, and funding for this phase,  approximately $25 million, was awarded shortly after receipt of  applications. For the second phase, jurisdictions were required to submit  more detailed implementation plans, in which they addressed three  \u201ccritical benchmarks,\u201d including a regional hospital plan for dealing with a  potential epidemic involving at least 500 patients. In addition, applicants  were to address four top-priority planning areas: medications and  vaccines; personal protection, quarantine, and decontamination;  communications; and biological disaster drills. Applications for the second  phase were due April 15, 2002, and the additional funding, approximately  $100 million, was awarded after HHS\u2019s review and approval of the plans. In  March 2003, HHS announced that HRSA\u2019s National Bioterrorism Hospital  Preparedness Program would provide funding in fiscal year 2003 of  approximately $498 million through cooperative agreements to states and  eligible municipalities. In response to our recommendations concerning  additional guidance, HHS noted that it is developing some additional  guidelines and templates to assist in preparedness efforts.", "In addition, the federal government has established a stockpile of  pharmaceuticals, antidotes, and medical supplies that can be delivered to  the site of a bioterrorist (or other) attack. This Strategic National Stockpile  has recently been expanded and HHS disclosed that it is planning to  purchase 2,700 ventilators by September 2003 to supplement those now  available in the stockpile. These supplies could be deployed to the site of  an attack within 12 to 36 hours following a declaration of an emergency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hospitals Reported Planning for Bioterrorism Response but Do Not Have Certain Medical Capacities to Handle a Large Increase in Patient Load", "paragraphs": ["Most hospitals in urban areas across the country reported participating in  basic planning and coordination activities for bioterrorism response.

As shown in figure  2, of the hospitals that reported having an emergency response plan for  bioterrorism, approximately 90 percent reported specifying in their plan to  contact state and local government agencies, public health agencies, other  hospitals, hazardous materials (HAZMAT) teams, emergency medical  services (EMS), fire departments, or law enforcement. These entities  would be critical to mounting a larger communitywide response,  communicating with the public, investigating and controlling sources of  the outbreak, transporting patients, maintaining order, and investigating  those responsible for the bioterrorism. Hospitals that planned to contact  HAZMAT teams or public health agencies were on average around 15 and  20 percent larger, respectively, than those that did not. There were no  significant differences in average sizes of hospitals with respect to  contacting any of the other entities. Approximately 75 percent of hospitals  reported planning to contact public or private utilities, whose assistance  could be needed to increase or maintain power supplies to critical  equipment or to control water- or sewer-borne pathogens. Although  establishing contact with other laboratories that could potentially provide  additional capacity for overstretched hospital laboratories would be  critical, the percentage of hospitals planning to make that link was lowest,  at approximately 60 percent. Approximately 40 percent of hospitals  reported specifying contacting all nine types of entities listed in figure 2.", "As shown in figure 3, most of the hospitals that reported having an  emergency response plan for bioterrorism indicated that they specified in  that plan how certain critical functions were to be managed. The functions  specified by more than 87 percent of hospitals included providing for  hospital security to control entry to and exit from all parts of the hospital;  obtaining additional staff, supplies, and pharmaceuticals to increase the  hospital\u2019s capacity to handle a surge of patients; or planning for mass  evacuation of nonemergency patients on short notice. In general, larger  hospitals had emergency response plans that covered more of these  functions than the plans of smaller hospitals. Hospitals that reported  addressing how to obtain additional pharmaceuticals for surge capacity,  \u201cworried well\u201d management, and mass fatalities were on average around  15 percent larger than those that did not. There were no significant  differences in average sizes of hospitals with respect to any of the other  functions. Approximately 77 percent of the hospitals reported addressing  the question of how to manage a large influx of the worried well and  distinguish them from victims who may be in the early stages of illness.  Approximately 50 percent of hospitals addressed the management of all of  the critical functions listed in figure 3.", "Whether they had an emergency response plan addressing bioterrorism or  not, more than 95 percent of hospitals reported participating in a local,  state, or regional interagency disaster preparedness committee, task force,  or working group. Most commonly, these committees also included  representatives from city and county emergency medical services  organizations, fire departments, city and county offices of emergency  management, other local hospitals or medical institutions, city and county  public health or health departments and agencies, and law enforcement  organizations (see table 1).

We  asked about agreements at the hospital, city, county, state, and regional  levels.

About 70 percent of hospitals reported that they had  agreements, such as memoranda of understanding or mutual aid  agreements, with other hospitals to provide or share personnel,  equipment, or other resources (see fig. 4). Fewer (between 37 and 54  percent) hospitals had agreements with regional, state, county, or city  organizations (fig. 4).

Meeting those needs fully could be extremely difficult because  bioterrorism preparedness is expensive and hospitals are reluctant to  create capacity that is not needed on a routine basis and may never be  used. In addition, along with a hospital\u2019s ability to meet the routine needs  of the community, needs for additional capacity for responding to  bioterrorism emergencies must be balanced with the need to be prepared  for all types of emergencies. Hospital officials have recognized that their  facilities are an essential component of our nation\u2019s bioterrorism  preparedness and have begun planning and training efforts to increase  their response capacity. Most hospitals, however, still lack equipment,  medical stockpiles, and quarantine and isolation facilities for even a small- scale response. The additional funding that is to be provided under the  National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program in fiscal year 2003  can be used to help hospitals address these issues.
