GAO's analysis of available data shows that, in the aggregate, SNFs' nurse staffing ratios changed little after the increase in the nursing component of the Medicare payment took effect.

In recent years, many  analysts and other observers, including members of the Congress, have  expressed concern about the level of nursing staff in SNFs and the impact  of inadequate staffing on the quality of care. In 2000, the Congress  responded to these concerns with a temporary increase in Medicare  payment intended to encourage SNFs to increase their nursing staff.", "Medicare pays SNFs through a prospective payment system (PPS) in  which they receive a fixed amount for each day that a patient receives  care. This daily payment rate varies according to a patient\u2019s expected  needs for care, and is the sum of nursing, therapy, and routine cost  components. The Congress, through the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP  Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), increased the  nursing component of the PPS SNF rate by 16.66 percent, effective April 1,  2001. This raised the overall SNF payment rates by 4 to 12 percent,  depending on the patient\u2019s expected care needs. However, the law did not  require facilities to spend this additional money on nursing staff. This was  not the only recent legislative change to SNF payments. A year earlier,  payment rates for certain types of patients had been increased by 20  percent, and for fiscal years 2001 and 2002, overall rates were boosted by 4  percent. The nursing component increase expired on October 1, 2002, and  the Congress is considering whether to reinstate it.", "BIPA directed us to assess the impact of the increase in the nursing  component on SNF nurse staffing ratios. The law also required that we  recommend whether the increased payments should continue.  Specifically, this report examines whether nurse staffing ratios\u2014overall  and for categories of SNFs, such as for-profit and not-for-profit facilities\u2014 rose after April 1, 2001, when the payment increase took effect.", "To address this issue, we used data from the Online Survey Certification  and Reporting System (OSCAR), maintained by the Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services (CMS), to assess nurse staffing ratios. We examined  all SNFs that at the time of our analysis had OSCAR data on staffing levels  available both before and after the payment increase. There were slightly  over 6,500 SNFs\u2014over one-third of all SNFs\u2014for which these data were  available. We tested for differences between these 6,500 and the 13,454  SNFs that were surveyed in calendar year 2000. We found no statistically  significant differences in terms of type of facility, size, ownership, and the  share of SNF patients paid for by Medicare. However, we found  statistically significant differences between these two groups of SNFs in  terms of the distribution by state. (See app. I, table 6.) To improve the  accuracy of the OSCAR data, we identified over 500 SNFs in our sample  that had apparent data entry or other data reporting errors, compared  those data to source documents, and made corrections where appropriate.  For 179 of these cases, we contacted facilities to resolve data issues. These  verification and correction procedures resulted in useable data for about  5,000 SNFs. For each facility, we compared the 2001 nurse staffing ratio to  the staffing ratio in 2000. We were not able to incorporate data reported  after January 2002, in order to accommodate the schedule set by BIPA. To  supplement this analysis, we also examined staffing ratio changes from  1999 to 2000. In addition to analyzing these data, we interviewed  representatives of three industry associations, CMS officials, and several  independent researchers. Although OSCAR data allowed us to compare  staffing ratios before and after the 16.66 percent payment increase took  effect, our analysis was limited in several ways. OSCAR data pertain to a  limited period\u20142 weeks for staffing and 1 day for the number of patients.  Further, staffing cannot be examined separately for Medicare patients,  who represent about 11 percent of total SNF patients; Medicaid patients,  who represent over 66 percent of total SNF patients; or patients whose  care is paid for by other sources, who represent about 23 percent of total  SNF patients.

For qualified beneficiaries, Medicare will pay for medically  necessary SNF services, including room and board; nursing care; and  ancillary services, such as drugs, laboratory tests, and physical therapy, for  up to 100 days per spell of illness. In 2002, beneficiaries are responsible  for a $101.50 daily copayment after the 20th day of SNF care, regardless of  the cost of services received.", "Eighty-eight percent of SNFs are freestanding\u2014that is, not attached to a  hospital.

Medicare  pays for a relatively small portion of patients cared for in SNFs\u2014about 11  percent. Over 66 percent of SNF patients have their care paid for by  Medicaid, and another 23 percent have their care paid for by other sources  or pay for the care themselves."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicare Payment for SNF Care", "paragraphs": ["In the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), the Congress established the  PPS for SNFs. Under the PPS, SNFs receive a daily payment that covers  almost all services provided to Medicare beneficiaries during a SNF stay,  which is adjusted for geographic differences in labor costs and differences  in the resource needs of patients. Adjustments for resource needs are  based on a patient classification system that assigns each patient to 1 of 44  payment groups, known as resource utilization groups (RUG). For each  group, the daily payment rate is the sum of the payments for three  components: (1) the nursing component, which includes costs related to  nursing as well as to medical social services and nontherapy ancillary  services, (2) the therapy component, which includes costs related to  occupational, physical, and speech therapy, and (3) the routine cost  component, which includes costs for capital, maintenance, and food. The  routine cost component is the same for all patient groups, while the  nursing and therapy components vary according to the expected needs of  each group. Before the 16.66 percent increase provided by BIPA took  effect, the nursing component varied from 26 percent to 74 percent of the  daily payment rate, depending on the patient\u2019s RUG. In 2001, Medicare  expenditures on SNF care were $13.3 billion. The 16.66 percent increase in  the nursing component raised Medicare payments about $1 billion  annually\u2014about 8 percent of Medicare\u2019s total annual spending on SNF  care.", "The increase in the nursing component is one of several temporary  changes made to the PPS payment rates since the PPS was implemented in  1998. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement  Act of 1999 (BBRA) raised the daily payment rates by 20 percent for 15  high-cost RUGs beginning in April 2000. BBRA also increased the daily  rate for all RUGs by 4 percent for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. BIPA upped  the daily payment rates by 6.7 percent for 14 RUGs, effective April 2001.  This increase was budget neutral; that is, it modified BBRA\u2019s 20 percent  increase for 15 RUGs by taking the funds directed at 3 rehabilitation RUGs  and applying those funds to all 14 rehabilitation RUGs. Two of these  temporary payment changes, the 20 percent and 6.7 percent increases, will  remain in effect until CMS refines the RUG system. CMS has announced  that, although it is examining possible refinements, the system will not be  changed for the 2003 payment year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SNF Staffing", "paragraphs": ["In providing care to their patients, SNFs employ over 850,000 licensed  nurses and nurse aides nationwide. Licensed nurses include RNs and  LPNs. RNs generally manage patients\u2019 nursing care and perform more  complex procedures, such as starting intravenous fluids. LPNs provide  routine bedside care, such as taking vital signs and supervising nurse  aides. Aides generally have more contact with patients than other  members of the SNF staff. Their responsibilities may include assisting  individuals with eating, dressing, bathing, and toileting, under the  supervision of licensed nursing and medical staff.", "Several studies have shown that nursing staff levels are linked to quality of  care. The Social Security Act, which established and governs the  Medicare program, requires that SNFs have sufficient nursing staff to  provide nursing and related services to attain or maintain the highest  practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each patient,  as determined by patient assessments and individual plans of care. More  specifically, SNFs must have an RN on duty for at least 8 consecutive  hours a day for 7 days per week, and must have 24 hours of licensed nurse  coverage per day. SNFs also must designate an RN to serve as the  director of nursing on a full-time basis, and must designate a licensed  nurse to serve as a charge nurse on each tour of duty.", "SNF staffing varies by type of facility and by state. Hospital-based SNFs  tend to have higher staffing ratios than other SNFs. In 2001, hospital-based  SNFs provided 5.5 hours of nursing time per patient day, compared with  3.1 hours among freestanding SNFs. Hospital-based SNFs also rely more  heavily on licensed nursing staff than do freestanding facilities, which rely  more on nurse aides. Staffing also differs by state\u2014from 2 hours and 54  minutes per patient day in South Dakota in 2000 to 4 hours and 58 minutes  per patient day in Alaska.", "Many states have established their own nursing staff requirements for  state licensure, which vary considerably. Some states require a minimum  number of nursing hours per patient per day, while others require a  minimum number of nursing staff relative to patients. Some states\u2019  requirements apply only to licensed nurses, while others apply to nurse  aides as well. Some states also require an RN to be present 24 hours per  day, 7 days per week. As of 1999, 37 states had nursing staff requirements  that differed from federal requirements. Since 1998, many states have  raised their minimum staffing requirements or have implemented other  changes aimed at increasing staffing in nursing homes, such as increasing  workers\u2019 wages or raising reimbursement rates for providers whose  staffing exceeds minimum requirements.", "While states have set minimum requirements for nursing staff, there are  indications of an emerging shortage of nursing staff, particularly RNs, in a  variety of health care settings. The unemployment rate for RNs in 2000  was about 1 percent\u2014very low by historical standards. As a result, SNFs  must compete with other providers, such as hospitals, for a limited supply  of nursing staff. According to associations representing the industry,  nursing homes have had difficulty recruiting and retaining staff. The  American Health Care Association (AHCA) reported vacancy rates for  nursing staff in nursing homes for 2001 ranging from 11.9 percent for aides  to 18.5 percent for staff RNs. Labor shortages are generally expected to  result in increased compensation\u2014wages and benefits\u2014as employers  seek to recruit new workers and retain existing staff. Our analysis of  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data shows that, from 1999 to 2000,  average wages for nurses and aides employed by the nursing home  industry increased by 6.3 percent, compared to 2.9 percent among workers  in private industry and state and local government.

Although SNFs with relatively low  staffing ratios in 2000 increased their staffing ratios in 2001, SNFs with  relatively high staffing ratios decreased their staffing. Our analysis  indicates that the nursing component payment increase was unlikely to  have been a factor in these staffing changes.

Finally, they noted that SNFs could have used the increased  Medicare payments to raise wages or improve benefits rather than hire  additional nursing staff.", "The industry representatives expressed several concerns about the  limitations of our data and analysis. The AAHSA representatives noted  that, for individual SNFs, the accuracy of OSCAR is questionable; they  agreed, however, that the average staffing ratios we reported for different  types of SNFs looked reasonable and were consistent with their  expectations. The AHA representatives said that, while OSCAR data are  adequate for examining staffing ratios, we should nonetheless have used  other sources of nurse staffing data\u2014such as payroll records and Medicaid  cost reports\u2014before making such a strong statement to the Congress. The  AHCA representatives noted that, due to the limitations of OSCAR data,  our analyses of staffing ratios reflect staffing for all SNF patients rather  than staffing specifically for SNF patients whose stays are covered by  Medicare. They stressed that the small increase in staffing for patients  overall could have represented a much larger increase for Medicare- covered SNF patients. In addition, representatives from both AHCA and  AHA were concerned that our period of study after the payment  increase\u2014May through December 2001\u2014was too short to determine  whether SNFs were responding to the added payments. They also cited  delays in SNFs being paid under the increased rates as an explanation for  our findings. The AHCA representatives further noted that the lack of  change in staffing was not surprising, given the short period, and that the  payment increase was temporary, applied to only one payer, and affected  only about 10 to 12 percent of SNFs\u2019 business. AAHSA representatives  noted that, to be meaningful, staffing ratios must be adjusted for acuity\u2014 the severity of patients\u2019 conditions.", "Representatives from all three groups also stated that the report lacked  sufficient information on contextual factors that could have affected SNF  staffing ratios during our period of study.

Finally, both AAHSA and AHA  representatives commented that the report gave too little attention to state  minimum staffing requirements, indicating that SNFs would be more  responsive to those requirements than to the Medicare payment increase.  The AAHSA representatives noted that facilities may have increased their  nursing staff to meet state minimum staffing requirements prior to the  Medicare increase. The AHA representatives stated that we may not have  found staffing increases because, when states require a minimum level of  staff, facilities tend to staff only to that minimum.

In the draft report, we stated that while nurse staffing ratios apply to all  SNF patients and not just Medicare patients, we found no relationship  between changes in staffing ratios and the percentage of a SNF\u2019s patients  paid for by Medicare.

We considered several sources of nursing staff data, including SNF  payroll data, Medicaid cost reports, and CMS\u2019s OSCAR system.", "We determined that payroll records could not be used for several reasons.  CMS has collected and analyzed nursing home payroll data in several  states and has found that it is difficult to ensure that the staffing data refer  to hours worked (as required for an analysis of nurse staffing ratios) rather  than hours paid, which includes time such as vacation and sick leave.  CMS also found that although current nursing home payroll records were  usually available, older records were difficult to obtain; consequently, it is  unlikely that we would have been able to get records prior to the rate  increase. Finally, payroll records do not include information on the  number of patients and would have had to be supplemented with other  data.", "Similarly, Medicaid cost reports were not an appropriate source of data.  While these reports by SNFs to state Medicaid agencies contain data on  both patients and nursing staff, Medicaid cost reports do not permit a  comparison of staffing ratios before and after the 16.66 percent increase in  the nursing component because these reports cover a 12-month period  that cannot be subdivided. Furthermore, these reports do not contain  nationally uniform staffing data because the categories and definitions  differ from state to state. Finally, the 2001 reports were not available in  time for our analysis.", "OSCAR is the only uniform data source that contains data on both patients  and nursing staff. Moreover, OSCAR data are collected at least every 15  months, allowing us to compare staffing ratios before and after the 16.66  percent increase in the nursing component."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OSCAR Data", "paragraphs": ["The states and the federal government share responsibility for monitoring  compliance with federal standards in the nation\u2019s roughly 15,000 SNFs. To  be certified for participation in Medicare, Medicaid, or both, a SNF must  have had an initial survey as well as subsequent, periodic surveys to  establish compliance. On average, SNFs are surveyed every 12 to 15  months by state agencies under contract to CMS. In a standard survey, a  team of state surveyors spends several days at the SNF, conducting a  broad review of care and services to ensure that the facility complies with  federal standards and meets the assessed needs of the patients. Data on  facility characteristics, patient characteristics, and staffing levels are  collected on standard forms. These forms are filled out by each facility at  the beginning of the survey and are certified by the facility as being  accurate. After the survey is completed, the state agency enters the data  from these forms into OSCAR, which stores data from the most current  and previous three surveys.", "Although OSCAR was the most suitable data source available for our  analysis, it has several limitations. First, OSCAR provides a 2-week  snapshot of staffing and a 1 day snapshot of patients at the time of the  survey, so it may not accurately depict the facility\u2019s staffing and number of  patients over a longer period. Second, staffing is reported across the entire  facility, while the number of patients are reported only for Medicare- and  Medicaid-certified beds. OSCAR, like other data sources, does not  distinguish between staffing for Medicare patients and staffing for other  patient groups. Finally, the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA)  reported that OSCAR data are unreliable at the individual SNF level.  However, the agency\u2019s recent analysis has concluded that the OSCAR- based staffing measures appear \u201creasonably accurate\u201d at the aggregate  level (e.g., across states). Neither CMS nor the states attempt to verify the  accuracy of the staffing data regularly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limitations to Our Analysis", "paragraphs": ["In addition to limitations inherent in OSCAR data, our analysis was limited  in several ways. First, our sample included only SNFs for which OSCAR  data were available both before and after the 16.66 percent increase in the  nursing component took effect. Second, our analysis of staffing ratios after  the increase took effect was limited to data collected from May through  December 2001. As a result, we only reviewed data for 8 months after the  payment increase was implemented, although our results do not appear to  be affected by any seasonal trends in staffing. We were not able to review  data for a later period when facilities might have used the payment  increase differently. Finally, due to data entry lags, when we drew our  sample in January 2002, OSCAR did not include data from some facilities  surveyed from May through December 2001."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Creation of the Sample", "paragraphs": ["To determine the change in nurse staffing ratios, we selected all facilities  surveyed from May through December 2001 that also had a survey during  2000, which could serve as the comparison. This sample contained OSCAR  data for 6,522 facilities. (See table 5.) Although not a statistical sample that  can be projected to all SNFs using statistical principles, the sample is  unlikely to be biased because it was selected on the basis of survey month.  Our sampling procedure, in which selection depended solely on the time  of survey, was unlikely to yield a sample with characteristics that differ  substantially from those of the entire population of SNFs. We found no  significant differences between these 6,522 SNFs and the 13,454 SNFs that  were surveyed in calendar year 2000, in terms of various characteristics\u2014 the proportion that are hospital-based, the proportion that are for-profit,  the share of a facility\u2019s patients that are paid for by Medicare, and the  capacity of the facilities. However, our sample was not distributed across  states like the population of SNFs. (See table 6.) This may be because state  agencies differ in the amount of time required to complete entry of survey  data into OSCAR. In addition, we excluded from our sample 449 SNFs that,  based on their 2000 Medicare claims data, had received payments from  Medicare that were not determined under the PPS.

In addition, we identified facilities in our sample  that had changes in their nurse staffing ratios greater than 100 percent, but  that did not report 100 percent changes in both total patients and total  beds. Using these rules, we identified 570 facilities for review. For 536 of  these facilities, we obtained the original forms completed by SNF staff and  used for entering data into OSCAR, from the state survey agencies. We  compared the data on the forms to the OSCAR entries and identified 159  facilities with data entry errors. For these facilities, we corrected the data,  although 12 continued to be outliers and were excluded. For 179 facilities,  we telephoned the SNF to verify its data; 65 facilities confirmed that  OSCAR correctly reported their data. Based on the information gathered in  these calls, we were able to correct the data for an additional 47 facilities.  We also excluded 35 facilities for which we could not correct the data. In  addition, we excluded 915 SNFs with more total beds than certified beds  because they may have inaccurate staffing ratios. Other facilities were  excluded because we did not receive their forms, we were unable to call  the SNFs, or we did not receive replies from them.
