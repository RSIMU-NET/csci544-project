It found that neither LCS variant with minor modifications met the Navy's desired capabilities without further tradeoffs. After briefing senior Navy leadership, the task force was directed to further examine the LCS options, which required it to alter or in some cases reduce some capabilities. In late 2014, the Navy recommended (and the Secretary of Defense approved) procuring both variants of a minor modified LCS, designating it a \u201cfrigate.\u201d The Navy prioritized this option because of its relatively lower cost and quicker ability to field, as well as the ability to upgrade remaining LCS, over making more significant capability improvements. GAO's analysis found the planned frigate will not provide much greater capability in some areas than LCS and that some cost assumptions may have overstated this option's affordability.", "As the Navy pivots from LCS to the frigate program, which is estimated to cost more than $8 billion for ship construction alone, its approach would require Congress to appropriate funding with key unknowns. The table outlines GAO's observations on the Navy's acquisition strategy.", "Of note, the industrial base considerations that have factored into prior LCS decisions are less compelling, as both yards will be building LCS currently under contract through fiscal year 2021. Finally, there are no current plans for official DOD milestone reviews of the frigate program, which is a major acquisition program based on its anticipated costs. In addition, the Navy does not plan to develop key frigate program documents or to reflect frigate cost, schedule, and performance information in the annual Selected Acquisition Reports (SAR) submitted to Congress. Without adequate oversight, federal funds may not be effectively spent."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider not funding any requested LCS in fiscal year 2017 and should consider requiring the Navy to revise its acquisition strategy for the frigate.

As we have previously reported, LCS was initially envisioned  as a self-sufficient combatant designed to fight and win in shallow water  and near-land environments, but this concept has weakened over time  based on the realization that the ship would be less capable of operating  independently in higher threat environments than expected and would  play a more limited role in major combat operations. Recently, several  Department of Defense (DOD) directions have further changed plans for  the ship.", "In February 2014, approximately 9 years after the first LCS started in  production and with 9 ships under construction at each of two shipyards,  then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced that he had  considerable reservations about the level of capability and lethality of LCS  and directed the Navy to contract for no more than 32 ships instead of 52  ships as originally planned. The Secretary directed the Navy to study  alternatives to the LCS that would provide capabilities \u201cconsistent with a  frigate.\u201d In response, the Navy established the Small Surface Combatant  Task Force, which we refer to in this report as the task force, to evaluate  different design solutions including completely new and existing ship  designs and LCS options with both major and minor modifications.", "In November 2014, the Navy recommended buying a small surface  combatant (SSC) based on an LCS design with minor modifications. The  Navy refers to this ship as a frigate. Secretary Hagel approved the Navy\u2019s  plan and, in December 2014, authorized the Navy to buy a mix of 52 LCS  and frigates with the mix determined by the Navy. Combined, LCS and  the frigate will represent approximately one-sixth of the Navy\u2019s entire 300- ship fleet. The Navy moved forward with plans to acquire 20 frigates and  intended to begin frigate production in 2019 after the first 32 LCS were  completed. However, in December 2015, Secretary of Defense Ashton  Carter provided new direction to the Navy. Citing concerns with the  Navy\u2019s balance between capability and quantity of platforms, he directed  a number of actions, including that the Navy would buy only 40 LCS and  frigates\u2014a reduction of 12 ships.", "Since 2005, we have raised many concerns about the Navy\u2019s acquisition  of LCS, including its combat effectiveness and decreased expectations of  its capability. In July 2013, we highlighted the program\u2019s risk of cost  growth, schedule delays, and technical problems related to delivering  intended capabilities. Most recently, in December 2015, we concluded  that the lethality and survivability of LCS is still largely unproven, and that  important questions remain about how LCS will operate and what  capabilities it will provide the Navy. The House Armed Services  committee report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2015 included a provision that we examine a number of elements  related to the task force\u2019s work\u2014including whether the study equated to a  formal analysis of alternatives\u2014and the Navy\u2019s future SSC plans. This  report examines: (1) the task force\u2019s process for doing its study and the  findings presented to Navy leadership; (2) how the Navy arrived at its  preferred solution of a modified LCS for its future SSC and the extent to  which this solution will address survivability and lethality concerns, and  (3) the potential risks associated with the Navy\u2019s approach to acquiring  the SSC and continued procurement of LCS.", "To conduct our work, we analyzed the task force\u2019s February 2015 final  report and associated classified and unclassified appendices and working  papers.

To assess any potential risks  associated with continued procurement of LCS, we analyzed LCS  contracts and contract modifications, as well as production data related to  cost and schedule performance for LCS currently in production. We also  interviewed officials from the LCS program office and shipyard  representatives from Lockheed Martin and Austal USA, where the LCS  variants are being constructed. To assess any potential risks associated  with the procurement of the future frigate, we analyzed frigate  requirements documentation and available design-related documentation,  as well as the preliminary acquisition documentation, and we interviewed  officials from the frigate program office.

This ability to  conduct only one primary mission at a given time is called a single- mission capability. The LCS consists of two distinct parts\u2014the ship itself  (called a seaframe) and the interchangeable package of sensors,  weapons, and aircraft that it carries and deploys (called a mission  package), which enables one of the three primary missions. The mission  packages provide the majority of the ship\u2019s combat capability. The Navy  envisioned LCS as a \u201ctruck\u201d that could swap payloads to reconfigure its  capabilities based on mission needs. LCS also has a minimal crew size  compared to other ships, with much of its maintenance and support  performed on shore instead of onboard by the crew.", "Two shipyards are currently building an equal number of two different  versions of the LCS seaframe: Lockheed Martin\u2014which builds its ships at  Fincantieri Marinette Marine in Marinette, Wisconsin\u2014and Austal USA,  which builds its ships in Mobile, Alabama. This report refers to the  Lockheed Martin ships as the Freedom variant and the Austal USA ships  as the Independence variant. The two designs reflect different contractor  solutions to meeting the same set of performance requirements. The  most notable difference is that the Freedom variant (LCS 1 and other  odd-numbered seaframes) is a monohull design with a steel hull and  aluminum superstructure, while the Independence variant (LCS 2 and  other even-numbered seaframes) is an aluminum trimaran. The Navy  had planned to award contracts for 6 additional LCS seaframes in 2017  and 2018 and transition to the frigate on the 33rd seaframe; however,  recent direction from the Secretary of Defense to reduce the total number  of seaframes from 52 to 40 has changed this plan.

In addition to highlighting concerns about the ship\u2019s combat  capabilities, we have also reported on significant changes to the Navy\u2019s  acquisition strategy for buying LCS. For example, as we reported in 2010,  the Navy announced that, following unsuccessful contract negotiations for  fiscal year 2010 funded seaframes, it would switch from its plan to  continue buying both ship designs and move to a downselect approach,  where one shipyard would be awarded contracts for future LCS.  Following approval of this strategy in January 2010, the Navy issued a  new solicitation\u2014intended to lead to a downselect\u2014for fiscal year 2010  seaframes. However, in November 2010, following receipt of new industry  proposals, the Navy proposed changing its acquisition strategy back to  awarding new construction contracts to both industry teams. Congress  approved this approach in December 2010.", "In July 2013, we highlighted a number of risks related to the LCS  program, including cost growth, schedule delays, and technical problems  related to delivering intended capabilities. We found that the LCS  concept has changed significantly over time due, in large part, to  problems associated with technology development and integration, and  we questioned the soundness of the Navy\u2019s business case for continuing  to buy LCS seaframes and mission packages given the unknowns related  to its ability to address key warfighting and support concepts. Due to  these unknowns, we asked Congress to consider restricting future  funding for construction of LCS seaframes until the Navy conducted  certain technical studies and reported on the relative strengths and  weaknesses of both seaframe variants. We also recommended that the  Navy only buy the minimum quantity and rate of LCS required to maintain  the production base and mission modules to support operational testing.  DOD did not agree with our recommendation to slow the procurement of  either LCS seaframes or mission packages, citing in part industrial base  considerations. Congress did not restrict funding, but directed the  seaframe variant assessment. As we reported in December 2015,  however, the resulting report was not adequately detailed. The Navy  essentially suggested that since the two variants are built to the same  requirements they perform the same way. The Navy did not present a  more detailed comparison that would address our recommendation.", "In July 2014, we found that key LCS concepts remained untested and  concurrency risks\u2014continuing to buy ships while key concepts and  performance are still being tested\u2014remained. We also found that the  Navy and its shipyards were having difficulty managing the weight of the  seaframes, which can create potential complications for making additional  changes to each seaframe design, and that weight growth during  construction had negatively affected performance of the initial LCS  seaframes. We have also reported that the Independence variant was  behind the Freedom variant in terms of overseas deployment experience,  with an Independence variant yet to deploy. In that report, we  recommended that before approving the release of the request for  proposals (RFP) for future contracts for either seaframe variant, the Office  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics (USD(AT&L)) require that both variants have deployed overseas  and completed certain testing, including testing of the ships\u2019 lethality and  survivability. We also recommended the Navy take steps to improve its  ability to effectively oversee weight management of the LCS seaframes.  DOD partially agreed with our recommendations to complete deployment  activities and testing before approving the release of the request for  proposals for future seaframes and agreed with our recommendations  related to seaframe weight management. To date, certain LCS test  events remain incomplete or the Navy has not yet provided test results to  Congress and GAO.", "In December 2015, we issued an unclassified version of a classified July  2015 report that identified concerns with elements of LCS lethality and  survivability. Survivability is the ability of a ship to avoid, withstand, or  recover from damage. It consists of three elements: susceptibility,  vulnerability, and recoverability. We found that the lethality and  survivability of both LCS variants is still largely unproven. We also found  that the Navy lacks a full understanding of LCS vulnerability, particularly  with respect to the Independence variant\u2019s aluminum hull. In this report,  we asked Congress to consider restricting funding for LCS construction in  2016 and beyond until the Navy submitted an acquisition strategy for the  frigate that was approved by the Secretary of Defense; a plan to upgrade  the existing LCS and an analysis of the cost and engineering feasibility  and risks of doing so; and report on the results of a rough water trial  report for both variants. We also recommended that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Navy to investigate more operationally stressing  mission package testing and solicit an independent technical assessment  on Independence variant survivability. DOD largely agreed with our  recommendations.

As shown in figure 2 above,  this concept did not include a local AAW capability.", "Because the minor modified LCS was judged not feasible for capability  concept 7, the task force then had to consider what trade-offs could be  made to create the needed space and weight to develop marginally  feasible options. The task force created two additional minor modified  LCS options for which it would be marginally feasible to meet a revised  version of capability concept 7 that was less capable than the original  concept. These options would retain the modular mission packages  characteristic of the LCS program, but add some systems to provide a  limited multi-mission capability instead of the single-mission capability of  LCS. For example, the task force found that it was feasible to  permanently install an over-the-horizon missile on both LCS variants to  offer over-the-horizon SUW capability, plus a lightweight towed torpedo  countermeasure and multi-function towed array sonar to offer some ASW  capability. But this option would still need to be augmented by an LCS  SUW or ASW mission package to provide the full suite of capability  (adding 30mm guns and Hellfire missiles for SUW, or the variable depth  sonar and torpedoes for ASW). The task force found that it was not  technically feasible to include additional vulnerability capabilities beyond  adding armor protection to some vital spaces.", "The task force documentation stated that in developing these alternate  minor modified LCS options, it had to trade some capabilities like speed,  range, and the number of rigid hull inflatable boats the ships could carry.  In some instances, these trade-offs resulted in capabilities equal to or  below the capabilities expected with the current LCS. However, according  to the task force, these trades were thoroughly assessed and deemed  acceptable to the warfighter by the fleet, though the report is not specific  as to how this determination was reached. Table 2 shows several  examples of these trade-offs and how they compare to current LCS  requirements.", "In some cases, the trade-offs made to accommodate the minor modified  LCS were significant. For example, during the fleet engagement process,  the operators consistently prioritized a range of 4,000 nautical miles and  30 underway days, and the task force analysis also found that a range of  4,000 nautical miles was needed for an SSC. Accommodating a minor  modified LCS would result in as much as a 30 percent reduction in range,  but the task force did not provide analysis of the operational impact of  reducing the speed and range requirements. It is not clear, for example,  what impact, if any, there would be on maintaining a forward presence  after a reduction in the range and speed. We previously reported that fleet  users in the Western Pacific identified concerns with the current LCS\u2019s  limited range and the demands this might place on the limited number of  refueling platforms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "By Selecting a Minor Modified LCS, the Navy Prioritized Affordability and Schedule over Higher Levels of Combat Capability Compared to Current LCS", "paragraphs": ["Based on analysis provided by the task force, the Navy recommended\u2014 and Secretary Hagel approved\u2014procuring an SSC (termed a frigate)  based on a minor modified LCS.

The Navy noted in its recommendation that the minor modified LCS will  provide improvements in combat capability over the current LCS fleet\u2014 specifically due to its multi-mission capability. However, the frigate will  have similar capability in most areas as the current LCS; many of the  performance requirements for the frigate are the same as LCS  requirements.

Table 3 depicts the  comparative costs identified in the task force report for the design options  equipped with the mix of combat capabilities ultimately selected by Navy  leadership (referred to as capability concept 7).", "The Navy also noted that the minor modified LCS solution would not  negatively impact LCS training and support infrastructure; in its memo  recommending a minor modified LCS option, the Navy wrote that a minor  modified LCS would maximize the operations and support investments  made to date, including shore-based trainers and maintenance facilities,  which would also avoid some potential costs that might be required for  other options.", "While large ships and new designs tend to be more expensive than  smaller ships and repeat designs, we found that the task force study\u2019s  cost estimating methodology and assumptions used to create these  estimates may have overstated the affordability of LCS compared to the  costs of other options. This is due to the assumptions the task force made  about: (1) the contracting strategy of maintaining two shipyards instead of  down-selecting to one, and (2) crew size and manning profiles.", "First, we found inconsistencies in the task force\u2019s assumptions about  whether the frigate would represent a single, down-selected LCS variant  or whether both LCS variants would be modified. Specifically, the task  force cost analysis assumed that the Navy would select a single variant of  an LCS-based frigate. However, the task force\u2019s separate analysis  examining programmatic plans and considerations for each ship design  concept assumed that the Navy would build both variants of the minor  modified LCS, consistent with the LCS program to date. A lead task force  cost analyst told us that if there were no downselect to a single SSC  variant, costs for a minor modified LCS would be higher for several  reasons: the construction costs for building two\u2014rather than one\u2014lead  ships; reduced quantities of follow on ships for each yard; and the cost of  testing two different hulls. This analyst explained that the task force used  the assumption of a downselect because it provided a simpler cost  comparison. While the task force\u2019s overall conclusion that a minor  modified LCS would be less expensive than the other options is likely  accurate based on the data provided in the workpapers, the magnitude of  cost differential for procurement costs between minor modified LCS and  the other options is overstated in the event that the Navy continues with  two variants. The task force did not document difference because task  force officials told us that it was not a part of their original tasking to  estimate the costs of a non-downselect option, and therefore such  analysis was not conducted or included as a part of the final report.", "Second, we found that when estimating the cost of new and existing  designs, the task force made assumptions related to crew size that  resulted in the non-LCS options appearing more costly by comparison.  Specifically, we found that the task force produced a manning estimate  for each design concept, but when it then estimated costs it assigned  crew sizes to the non-LCS options that were considerably higher than  even the upper range identified in the manning estimates. Conversely, the  cost estimators assigned a notional crew size that was within the manning  estimate range for the major and minor modified LCS options. This  approach made the non-LCS design options appear more costly. Task  force officials told us that they chose more conservative manning  estimates for the non-LCS designs than what it initially identified based on  a detailed, bottom-up analysis but  did not provide any additional  information on this analysis.", "We also found that while the task force created estimates of potential  crew sizes\u2014including a reduced manning profile\u2014a concept currently  used on LCS as a cost reduction measure\u2014for the ship options, it used  the reduced manning profile to estimate costs for the minor modified LCS  but not for the other options. As a result, the costs of a minor modified  LCS are comparatively less expensive than the other options. The task  force cost analyst told us that they did not estimate these costs for the  other ship options because they did not have enough time.", "Manning assumptions have significant implication on costs: crew size is a  significant driver of operation and support costs (which typically make up  around 70 percent of a ship\u2019s life-cycle cost). The task force estimated  that over the entire life cycle of the ship class (assuming 20 ships, with a  25-year service life), a minor modified LCS option would cost  approximately $10 billion less in crew-related expenses than the other  ship design options. This accounts for almost half the difference in  operations and support costs reflected in table 4 (in fiscal year 2014  dollars).", "Table 4 shows the comparison in direct and indirect manning costs for  each of the options considered; major modified LCS, and new and  existing designs have the same cost estimates due to the task force  choosing the same manning levels for each of these three options.", "According to the task force, these comparisons do not include all  maintenance costs for the minor modified LCS.", "The magnitude of differences in these operation and support cost  estimates would likely be reduced if the task force had estimated the  minimal manning concept options on the other design options, though the  Navy did not have the data to quantify this difference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Prioritized Speed with Which Minor Modified LCS Could Start Production", "paragraphs": ["In a November 2014 memo in which it recommends selecting a minor  modified LCS, senior Navy leadership also highlighted the speed with  which they believe a minor modified LCS based frigate could be fielded  as a deciding factor in its deliberations, as well as a desire to maintain  stability in the LCS industrial base and vendor supply chain.

The shipyards will also  propose commensurate weight-reduction efforts needed to incorporate  these changes. Implementing these improvements is contingent on both  the affordability of the offers submitted by the shipbuilders and the  technical feasibility of incorporating additional weight to the ship.", "Further, the ability to make these upgrades is dependent on the  availability of funds. The Navy told us that a prior request in the fiscal year  2016 President\u2019s budget request for funds to forward fit and backfit LCS  with selected lethality and survivability features was not funded.  Additionally, cost growth in the program will likely limit the availability of  funding for forward fit improvements in the near future.

Weight is a critical aspect of ship design  because the total weight of a ship and the locations of weight  concentrations dictate the center of gravity and the stability of the vessel.  As a result, all ships are designed with service life allowances to account  for future weight growth. These allowances provide for the addition of  future capability and weight while providing margin before reaching the  ship\u2019s naval architectural limit, which is the maximum weight a ship can  tolerate while still meeting its stability and survivability requirements.", "As we found in July 2014, the Navy has faced challenges managing the  weight of both variants of LCS, and weight growth during construction has  required the Navy to make compromises on LCS 1 and 2 performance.  We also found that because of the LCS\u2019s low service life allowance  requirements for weight and center of gravity compared to other ship  classes, the Navy\u2019s ability to accommodate alterations and growth on  these ships over their expected 25-year minimum service lives will be  significantly more constrained than is typical for other surface ships. The  LCS weight margins are also lower than those called for under Navy  instruction and industry recommended practices. Specifically, LCS has a  requirement to retain a margin of only 50 metric tons of weight, which  translates to just over 1 percent of the total weight, while other ship  classes typically must reserve between 5-10 percent of their total weight  to accommodate future upgrades or equipment changes. In 2012, an  Office of the Chief of Naval Operations instruction highlighted the  importance of weight management across ship classes, noting that  inadequate service life allowances for weight and vertical center of gravity  have resulted in expensive corrective ship changes or in the inability to  modernize ships through installation of new weapons systems.", "According to preliminary frigate design documentation, the Navy\u2019s  proposed frigate changes could add significant weight to both variants.  According to the Navy, the Frigate program has directed an increase to  the naval architectural limits of each frigate variant to accommodate the  required frigate capabilities. Additionally, the frigate is not going to have  the same type of mission package swap requirement as LCS, and the  Navy stated that the removal of these requirements allows the shipyards  to change and compartmentalize the large reconfigurable spaces that  typically accommodate mission package equipment. This results in a  design that carries more stability and weight margins, and allows for the  vessels to accommodate added frigate capabilities without a required and  costly corresponding weight removal. Some of the weight reduction  changes will alter the frigate\u2019s performance compared to LCS capabilities.  For example, the Navy is planning a reduction in the size of the rigid- hulled inflatable boats that the ship can carry and deploy. An LCS  configured with an SUW mission package can carry two 11-meter boats  used by boarding teams to interdict other vessels, utilizing specific  launch, handling, and recovery systems to facilitate these missions. On  LCS, the 11-meter boats are in addition to a 7-meter rescue boat. On the  frigate, the Navy is proposing changing the two 11-meter boats to two 7- meter boats, and small boat launching systems to simpler side-launch  boat cranes. This plan could provide significant weight savings for the  Navy. Further, the Navy has applied a reduced endurance range  requirement for the frigate when compared to LCS.", "Adding capability to the frigate depends on the success of these and  other design initiatives. It is too early to determine how successful these  efforts will be. If the planned weight reductions cannot be achieved, the  Navy and shipyards will have to identify other weight reduction efforts, or  will have to reduce capability of the frigate. The program office has  already stated that both variants will have less than the required service  life allowance for both power and cooling, but that current power and  cooling needs will be met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Frigate Design Knowledge Prior to Downselect Decision", "paragraphs": ["Second, under the approved acquisition strategy, the Navy plans to  exercise a block buy contract option for frigate construction before the  shipyards have initiated detail design. Under an earlier draft acquisition  strategy, the program office would have awarded a contract to each  shipyard in fiscal year 2018 to support detail design of the frigate, which  was to occur before the award of the construction contract for frigates in  fiscal year 2019. With this approach, the Navy would have had detail  design data in hand while considering proposals for ship construction.  The Navy\u2019s approved acquisition strategy now places detail design after  the Navy has contracted for ship construction. This puts the Navy in the  position of having to negotiate the contract target prices for construction  of the lead and follow-on ships without the benefit of information gained  during detail design about the materials and equipment or specific  processes that will be used to construct the ship.", "We have previously reported that this type of approach\u2014which is a  common Navy practice that has also been used on other Navy ship  acquisitions\u2014has resulted in increased ship target prices. For example,  for the San Antonio (LPD 17) class ships, the Navy negotiated prices for  the detail design and construction of the lead ship (LPD 17) and the first  two follow-on ships (LPD 18 and LPD 19) at the same time. By  negotiating target prices for these ships before detail design even began,  target prices for these three ships did not benefit from information gained  during detail design. An alternative approach would be the Navy\u2019s original  plan, which was also used on the Virginia class submarine program  where the Navy negotiated detail design separately from construction,  thus benefitting from the knowledge gained from detail design in  negotiating prices for construction. The Navy also plans to use this  approach with the Ohio class replacement submarine program and  intends to have a high level of design complete prior to the award of the  lead ship construction contract. Assuming it continues to employ a block  buy approach for the frigate as it has on the LCS program, the Navy will  have to request funding for at least detail design and lead ship  construction in its fiscal year 2018 President\u2019s budget request. The  Navy\u2019s request would be based on target prices that it negotiated in the  absence of detail design information, which affects the realism of the  budget request."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contractor Driven Frigate Design May Reduce Commonality", "paragraphs": ["Third, the Navy is also transitioning to a less prescriptive design approach  under which the shipyards have more latitude in proposing design  approaches and equipment than was initially planned. Frigate program  officials told us that they had initially planned on giving the shipyards a  more prescriptive set of design parameters with specific systems  identified that the shipyards would need to incorporate into their designs.  Program officials told us that they are adjusting this approach; now it will  be similar to the original LCS program, whereby the shipyards were given  performance specifications and requirements. The shipyards then  selected the design and systems that they felt best met these  requirements, but that were also the most affordable and best suited to  fitting their design in a producible manner.", "Program officials told us that this new approach should yield cost  efficiencies. They told us that they are transitioning from a plan where the  government would furnish some frigate equipment to having the  contractors furnish equipment, which they believe allows the shipyards to  potentially secure better pricing for systems such as the air search radar.  A similar approach was used during initial LCS design; in some instances,  this led to the ships having non-standard equipment, making the ships not  common with either one another or the rest of the Navy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Frigate Costs Remain Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["According to the fiscal year 2017 President\u2019s budget request, the Navy  estimates almost $10 billion for the remaining LCS and frigate  procurements, with the lead frigate expected to cost $188 million or  approximately 30 percent more than the single LCS requested in fiscal  year 2018, and follow-on frigates in 2020-2021 closer to an increase of 20  percent more per ship. Program officials said that the acquisition strategy,  which would downselect to a frigate as early as fiscal year 2018, but no  later than fiscal year 2019, is contingent on securing additional funding a  year earlier than planned. The Navy, however, does not yet have a  complete estimate of frigate costs. The Navy had planned to approve its  frigate service cost position\u2014which is the Navy\u2019s cost estimate for the  program\u2014in late 2015. However, as of February 2016, the frigate  program office told us that it needs to revise its estimate due to the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s 2015 direction to reduce frigate procurement  quantities. As a result, the Navy currently does not have an approved cost  estimate for the frigate. Navy officials told us that they expect the frigate  to cost no more than 20 percent\u2014approximately $100 million\u2014more per  ship than the average LCS seaframes. However, we were unable to  assess this cost as the Navy did not provide us the basis for its estimate  and has not yet completed its estimate.", "The Navy has also not yet determined the quantity of mission package  equipment that will be required for the frigate, which will be another cost  element. Unlike LCS, the frigate concept does not entail readily  interchangeable mission packages to provide single mission capability;  rather, the multi-mission functionality will enable the frigate to carry both  SUW and ASW equipment simultaneously. However, as noted above,  frigate program officials told us that they have not yet decided if every  frigate will be equipped with all mission equipment at all times, or if the  Navy will buy a smaller subset of equipment for the frigates to share as  they deploy. The Navy had planned to buy 64 LCS mission packages, but  a senior Navy official and a mission packages program official told us that  this will change based on the Secretary of Defense\u2019s 2015 direction.  Additionally, frigate program officials told us that four systems\u2014the  variable depth sonar, the 30mm gun modules, the airborne torpedo, and  the surface-to-surface missile module\u2014will not be funded with  shipbuilding procurement money but that they will instead be funded from  other procurement accounts.

The frigate program  office is under the purview of the LCS Program Executive Office, which  oversees the LCS seaframe and mission packages program offices,  among other offices. The Navy also assigned a new system  designation\u2014FF\u2014specific to the frigate and received procurement and  research and development funds within the LCS fiscal year 2016 budget.  In the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget request, the Navy created a  new budget line item for research and development funds and included  frigate procurement cost information within the LCS procurement budget  line.", "Navy officials, including frigate program office officials, told us that they  will develop some key requirements and acquisition documentation, but  that they do not envision formal frigate milestone reviews. Frigate  program officials told us that a determining factor of whether or not they  will be able to procure the lead frigate in fiscal year 2018 instead of 2019  is if the frigate design is matured to a sufficient level to allow the  shipbuilders to submit proposals for the frigate upgrade with minimum  risk. However, when we asked the program office how it would evaluate  the maturity of these designs before down-selecting to the winning  shipyard, the program office described an iterative review process but  with no formal milestone or event like a preliminary design review to  approve readiness to proceed. The Navy\u2019s approved acquisition  strategy\u2014which we obtained while DOD was reviewing our draft report\u2014 states that OSD will hold reviews called \u201cin process reviews\u201d in fiscal  years 2016 through 2025; according to frigate program officials, the Navy  plans to combine the frigate and LCS program reviews into this annual  review. The acquisition strategy does not provide details on the nature  of these reviews, including requirements and timing. At this time it is  unclear if one of these reviews will approve the release of the RFP for the  fiscal year 2017 LCS and the request for contract change proposals for  the frigate upgrade, and if another will be held to approve modifying the  2017 LCS contract to exercise the option for a block buy of 12 additional  LCS with the frigate upgrades.", "Frigate program officials also told us that they do not intend on  completing all the documentation that would normally be required of  major weapon system programs at the system development phase,  including developing an independent cost estimate for the frigate  program. Major defense acquisition programs, including acquisition  category (ACAT) I programs like the Navy\u2019s LCS and frigate programs,  are defined as such based on anticipated expenditures. Even with the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s reduction in quantity of ships, the expected dollar  value of frigate seaframe procurement alone, which according to the  Navy\u2019s latest budget submission exceeds $8 billion in current dollars,  makes the frigate acquisition equivalent to a major defense acquisition  program with ACAT I status. ACAT I programs generally go through a  series of phases as they progress from the identification of the need for a  new capability, through initial planning of a solution, to system  development, and finally production and deployment of the fielded  system. At Milestone B, which commonly corresponds to the start of detail  design for ship programs, major defense acquisition programs are  required to have approved requirements, an independent cost estimate,  and an acquisition program baseline which includes parameters to  describe the cost estimate, schedule, performance, supportability, and  other relevant factors. Additionally, major defense acquisition programs  begin tracking unit cost changes and report unit cost growth against  Nunn-McCurdy statutory thresholds and are required to periodically report  to Congress in Selected Acquisition Reports (SAR), a key source of  program information on cost, schedule, and performance progress.", "The Navy\u2019s approved acquisition strategy does not describe specific  documentation that the Navy will be required to submit for OSD approval.  Frigate program officials have stated that they do not intend on soliciting  an independent cost estimate from CAPE, and officials were unclear on  how or if they would generate a frigate-specific acquisition program  baseline or break out the frigate in SAR updates. We have previously  reported that milestone requirements form the basic oversight framework  to ensure that Congress and DOD decision makers are adequately  informed about the program\u2019s cost, schedule, and performance progress.  While DOD acquisition policy does allow for decision authorities to tailor  information requirements and the acquisition process to achieve cost,  schedule, and performance goals, the risk of prematurely committing  resources to the frigate before certain knowledge is attained will remain  until the Navy or OSD establishes a process through which the frigate will  be subject to acquisition criteria in the same manner as other major  defense programs. Without requiring the new frigate program to have a  formal review prior to awarding the frigate contract or to prepare key  program documentation such as those cited above, decision makers may  lack information on program cost and technical baselines on which to  base oversight of the program."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We and others, including the former Secretary of Defense and DOT&E,  have raised significant concerns about whether the LCS provides the  Navy with needed capabilities. In response to its own concerns about  LCS\u2019s combat capabilities, the department concluded that improvements  are necessary. In the past, we have recommended that LCS  procurements be paused while needed testing took place. The Navy has  cited reluctance to do so due to concerns about the industrial base;  specifically, keeping the two LCS shipyards in business. The continued  delays in production of LCS lessens this concern as a factor in the timing  of the frigate production start. The LCS delays, coupled with the absence  of planned upgrades to the two planned LCS in fiscal year 2017 that  would help mitigate some of the capability concerns and the persistent  unknowns with LCS combat capabilities, suggest that it is reasonable to  again consider a pause in production. The delays facing LCS already  under contract mean that the shipyards have ongoing LCS work through  fiscal year 2021. Not buying the proposed ships in 2017 would provide  the Navy and OSD time to buy the ships in an upgraded frigate  configuration that is more in line with the capabilities approved by the  former Secretary of Defense and complete further LCS testing.", "As the Navy pivots from LCS to the frigate\u2014which is expected to provide  some enhanced capabilities over the current LCS\u2014there are many  unknowns with regards to cost and the design of the frigate, and sufficient  oversight structures are not yet defined. The recently approved  acquisition strategy for the frigate reflects an accelerated approach.  Specifically, the Navy would now award a construction contract for the  frigate before having sufficient knowledge of the ship\u2019s detail design. This  situation is not consistent with best practices and puts the taxpayer at risk  of paying for cost overruns.", "Further, the planned oversight of the frigate program could be enhanced  by requiring the Navy to develop key oversight documents related to cost,  capability, and schedule; at the most basic level, these would include an  independent cost estimate, an acquisition program baseline, and a plan to  incorporate the frigate into SARs. Without these documents or a  milestone review, the program will not be subject to key statutory and  regulatory oversight requirements, such as providing Congress with  regular, formal reports on program cost and schedule performance that  are specific to the frigate program. Such information is needed to hold this  multi-billion dollar program accountable for achieving its cost, schedule,  and performance requirements, once they are defined. Further, aligning  OSD-level reviews of the program with key decision points\u2014including  approving the release of the request for contract change proposals for the  frigate upgrade and the frigate downselect\u2014would offer an important  oversight mechanism.", "While we are making new recommendations, we also believe that the  prior recommendations we made about LCS in our recent past work  would enhance the Navy\u2019s knowledge about LCS capabilities prior to  committing additional funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider not funding any requested LCS in fiscal year  2017 because of unresolved concerns with lethality and survivability; the  Navy\u2019s ability to make needed improvements; and the current schedule  performance of the shipyards.", "Congress should also consider directing the Navy to submit a revised,  OSD-approved acquisition strategy under which it completes a significant  portion of detail design for the frigates prior to soliciting proposals for the  frigate upgrade package."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following two  actions:  1.

DOD noted that the department already plans to conduct annual OSD- level reviews of the LCS and frigate program, stating that coordinating  future program reviews with key acquisition decisions is standard  practice.

While these are positive steps,  neither the department\u2019s response nor the approved acquisition strategy  elaborate on the specific requirements for these reviews or any specific  documentation requirements. To make these mechanisms effective, OSD  would need to ensure that these reviews occur regularly and in advance  of key decision points, including prior to committing to the frigate  downselect.
