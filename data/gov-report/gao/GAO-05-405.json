GAO was asked to determine, for fiscal year 2004, the volume and nature of FOIA request processing at the Department of Energy (DOE), to what extent DOE followed the act and related Office of Management and Budget and Department of Justice guidance in processing cases that involve fees, and to what extent DOE communicated its fee-related decisions to requesters."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2004, DOE received 2,289 new FOIA cases, of which 31 percent (705 of 2,289) were received by the department's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and DOE sites at Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Richland, Washington--the sites selected for our review. Generally, very few of the requests at these sites involved assessments of fees or requests for waivers of possible fees. DOE's process includes several phases ranging from initial processing and acknowledgement to preparing and releasing records to requesters. DOE generally followed FOIA and related guidance when determining fee categories for requesters, fee waivers, and actual fees to be charged. All three sites we reviewed always made explicit determinations about requesters' fee categories in accordance with guidance. DOE also generally adhered to guidance in determining fee waivers by seeking information addressing the prescribed criteria for making fee waiver determinations. In assessing actual fees to be charged, FOIA offices at all three sites charged fees in accordance with guidance. DOE's FOIA offices often did not communicate the specifics of their fee-related decisions to FOIA requesters. For example, while DOE headquarters often informed requesters of determinations about their fee category, the Richland and Albuquerque offices rarely did. In addition, the three sites rarely informed requesters of the outcome of fee waiver determinations. Further, when fees were not charged, requesters were rarely informed of the reason. Current FOIA guidelines do not require agencies to inform requesters of fee-related decisions. However, without being informed of fee-related determinations, requesters could misunderstand agency fee determinations and have false expectations for the handling of future FOIA requests."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) provides the public with a legal  right to access government information about the operations and decisions  of the federal government.

FOIA  also established a \u201cright to know\u201d standard for access, instead of a \u201cneed to  know,\u201d and shifted the burden of proof from the individual to the  government agency seeking to deny access. FOIA was originally enacted in  1966 and has been amended several times, most recently in 2002.", "Citizens are requesting an ever-increasing amount of information from the  federal government, as reflected in a steadily increasing number of FOIA  requests. In fiscal year 2003, over 3 million requests were received by  federal agencies, an increase of 36 percent over the previous year. Further,  the number of requests closed was also more than 3 million, an increase of  34 percent compared with the previous year. The number of requests  closed is, in part, an indicator of the responsiveness of agencies in  providing the public with requested information and shows that agencies  are taking steps to respond to the increasing FOIA workload.", "FOIA provides the public with access to government information either  through \u201caffirmative agency disclosure\u201d\u2014publishing information in the  Federal Register or making it available in reading rooms\u2014or in response to  public requests for disclosure. Public requests for disclosure of records are  the best known type of FOIA disclosure. Any member of the public may  request access to information held by federal agencies, without showing a  need or reason for seeking the information. Agencies may deny access to  material (e.g., by withholding records or redacting information) only if it  falls within any of nine statutory categories of exemptions. There are also  FOIA exclusions for specific, sensitive records held by law enforcement  agencies. In addition, agencies have a statutory requirement to meet certain  time frames for determining whether to comply with requests, making  determinations with respect to appeals of adverse determinations, and  determining whether to provide expedited processing of requests.  Requesters are entitled to know the reasons for denials, to appeal denials,  and to challenge them in court.

FOIA processing, especially review of classified, sensitive, or  privacy-related material, can be labor-intensive.", "DOE\u2019s process typically begins when the agency\u2019s headquarters FOIA office  receives a written request (fax, letter, e-mail, or electronic form on DOE\u2019s  Web site). From that point, the request goes through several phases, which  include   acknowledgment of the request,   fee determination and identification of office with relevant subject  matter expertise,   search and retrieval of records,   preparation of records for release, and   issuing of the final response to the requester.", "Initial processing is focused on ensuring that the request is a proper FOIA  request and that all relevant information has been obtained from the  requester. From here, an acknowledgment letter informs the requester that  the department received the request and also provides the requester with a  tracking number. FOIA officials then review the case to determine which  office may have responsive records and make an initial determination  about fees and, if a fee waiver has been requested, whether it is to be  granted. After the appropriate office has located responsive records, a  determination is made about what, if any, information is exempt from  public release and should be redacted from records planned to be released,  which would result in a \u201cpartial grant\u201d of requested information. Finally, the  agency assembles the responsive records to be released and provides them  to the requester. Figure 1 depicts the FOIA process at DOE Headquarters.", "From the receipt of the request until a final decision is made about the  release or withholding of documents, DOE has a number of opportunities  to communicate with requesters. As recorded in DOE\u2019s FOIA case files, the  types of communications included   acknowledgment letters, which informed requesters that DOE received   interim letters, which provided requesters with additional information  pertaining to their request and may have requested additional  information to clarify the request;  final letters, which provided requesters with the final outcome of their   oral communications, which were made typically via telephone and  provided clarification and additional information about how the request  was being handled; and  e-mail messages, which also provided clarification and additional  information about DOE\u2019s handling of the request.", "Aside from very minor variations, the FOIA process at the Albuquerque and  Richland field offices is essentially the same.

Further, fees can be charged for three types  of FOIA-related activities\u2014search, duplication, and review\u2014depending on  the requester\u2019s fee category. In addition, in certain situations fees may not  be charged to a requester, as, for example, when a fee waiver is granted or  when the applicable fees are below a certain threshold.", "Commercial users can be charged for the broadest range of FOIA-related  activities, including document search, review, and duplication. Commercial  use is defined in the OMB fee schedule guidelines as \u201ca use or purpose that  furthers the commercial, trade or profit interests of the requester or the  person on whose behalf the request is being made.\u201d The second category  exempts search and review fees for documents sought for noncommercial  use by educational or noncommercial scientific institutions, and for  representatives of the news media. The third category of fees, which  applies to all requesters who do not fall within either of the other two  categories, allows for \u201creasonable\u201d charges for document search and  duplication.

For example, as stipulated in the act, fees may not be charged  when the government\u2019s cost of collecting and processing the fee is likely to  equal or exceed the amount of the fee itself.", "Further, under certain circumstances, the act requires an agency to furnish  documents without charge, or at reduced charges. This is commonly  referred to as the FOIA fee waiver. An agency must provide a fee waiver if  two conditions are met:   disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because  it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the  operations or activities of the government, and  disclosure of the information is not primarily in the commercial interest  of the requester.", "Under the act and guidance, when these requirements are both satisfied,  based upon information supplied by a requester or otherwise made known  to the agency, the fee waiver or reduction is to be granted by the FOIA  officer. Where one or both of these requirements is not satisfied, a fee  waiver is not warranted. As these criteria suggest, fee waivers are to be  granted on a case-by-case basis.

First, FOIA  officers need to determine a requester\u2019s fee category in order to know what  types of activities the requester can be charged for. The three types of fee  categories for requesters are (1) commercial; (2) educational,  noncommercial scientific institution, and representative of the news media;  and (3) other. Then, if a requester is eligible to be charged fees, a  determination must be made if any of those fees can be waived. Assuming a  requester has asked for a fee waiver, FOIA personnel must evaluate  information provided by the requesters, addressing six criteria outlined in  the Justice guidance in order to make a fee waiver determination. Finally,  assuming fees have not been waived, FOIA personnel must assess the  actual fees to be charged. According to guidance, no fee is to be charged if  the requester has received a fee waiver or if the amount to be charged is  under a predetermined threshold. Otherwise, FOIA personnel are to  determine the amount of time spent on search, review, and duplication,  and, based on a requester\u2019s fee category, charge the appropriate fees.", "Determining a requester\u2019s fee category is the simplest of the three decisions  in terms of the information needed to make a decision, and it typically  takes little time. Officials at all three sites we reviewed always (170 of 170  cases) made explicit fee category determinations. Headquarters officials  stated that if a requester did not provide enough information to make a fee  category determination, FOIA personnel would often attempt to locate  additional information, for example through the Web, in order to make an  expeditious category determination.", "DOE also generally adhered to FOIA guidance in determining if a fee  waiver was to be granted by seeking information to address all relevant fee  waiver criteria. Often, if requesters did not sufficiently address all the fee- waiver criteria in their initial requests, officials sought additional  information from the requesters. DOE also generally adhered to FOIA  guidance by asking requesters to address all relevant fee waiver criteria.  For example, headquarters requested additional information to address fee  waiver criteria in 21 cases wherein sufficient information was not included  with the original request. Officials at all three sites indicated that if they  believed, based on their knowledge and experience, that the charge for the  request was going to be below the threshold, they would not go through the  process of making an explicit fee waiver determination.", "In assessing actual fees to be charged, if any, FOIA offices at all three sites  we reviewed charged fees in accordance with guidance. The three  locations charged fees in 34 completed cases. For example, requesters  were appropriately charged for search, review, or duplication based on  their FOIA category. In addition, all three locations uniformly complied  with the regulation of granting 2 hours of free search time and 100 pages of  free duplication to requesters in certain categories. Table 3 lists the 34  completed cases in which fees were charged, by location and category.", "In many cases in which fees were not charged to requesters, we could not  determine if DOE made its decision correctly, because the necessary  information to determine fees\u2014an accounting of search time and cost,  review time and cost, and the number of pages duplicated\u2014was not  routinely recorded.

However, informing requesters  about fee and fee-waiver decisions is important because it can provide an  explanation to the requester about the specific and possibly unique  circumstances of a particular fee determination. For example, although an  agency may determine that a requester is not eligible for a fee waiver, based  on the information provided, it may not actually charge any fee for the  request because the charges would be below the minimum threshold. If the  requester was not informed of this, he or she could mistakenly believe that  a waiver had indeed been granted and might expect that a similar waiver  would be granted for future FOIA requests. While not specifically referring  to fee determinations, Justice has cited the importance of communications  as an element of customer service.", "The three DOE sites did not always communicate fee category decisions to  requesters. Of the three locations, headquarters was most likely to inform  requesters of their fee category. Richland and Albuquerque rarely  communicated fee category determinations to requesters. Table 4  enumerates how often requesters were informed of fee category  determinations for the cases we reviewed.", "The three sites also rarely informed requesters of the outcome of fee  waiver determinations. Specifically, requesters were not informed of fee  waiver determinations in 87 percent of the completed fee waiver cases that  we reviewed (83 of 95). Whenever DOE\u2019s case files show that an explicit  determination was made denying a fee waiver, the requester was informed  of this decision. This occurred seven times in fiscal year 2004. However, fee  waiver determinations were not always recorded in the case files. DOE  officials indicated that if they believed fees would be below the threshold,  based on their knowledge and experience, they would not address a fee  waiver request explicitly, and, accordingly, requesters would not be  informed of any fee waiver decision. Further, in 22 cases at headquarters,  requesters were notified that a fee waiver determination would not be  addressed until they provided additional information addressing the fee  waiver criteria that DOE is required to use in reaching its fee waiver  determinations. However, the records in these cases do not indicate  whether additional information was obtained, nor do they reflect a final  determination of fee waiver status.

In  half of the cases we reviewed in which fees were not charged (68 of 136),  requesters were not informed about the decision not to charge a fee.  Without being informed about this decision, a requester could mistakenly  believe that fees were not applicable and develop a false expectation that  fees also would not be applicable for future requests.
