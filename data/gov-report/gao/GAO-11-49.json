This fragmentation can lead to poor quality of care, medical errors, and higher costs. Providers have formed integrated delivery systems (IDS) to improve efficiency, quality, and access. The Health Care Safety Net Act of 2008 directed GAO to report on IDSs that serve underserved populations--those that are uninsured or medically underserved (i.e., facing economic, geographic, cultural, or linguistic barriers to care, including Medicaid enrollees and rural populations). In October 2009, GAO provided an oral briefing. In this follow-on report, GAO describes (1) organizational features IDSs use to support strategies to improve care; (2) approaches IDSs use to facilitate access for underserved populations; and (3) challenges IDSs encounter in providing care, including to underserved populations. GAO selected a judgmental sample of 15 private and public IDSs that are clinically integrated across primary, specialty, and acute care; they vary in their degree of integration, specific organizational features, and payer mix (e.g., extent to which they serve Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured). GAO interviewed chief medical officers or other system officials at all 15 IDSs and conducted site visits at 4 IDSs, interviewing system executives and clinical staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IDSs in GAO's sample reported that using electronic health records (EHR), operating health insurance plans, and employing physicians all support strategies to improve patient care. An EHR contains patient and care information, such as progress notes and medications. Some IDSs said that using EHRs supports their patient care strategies such as care coordination, disease management, and use of care protocols by increasing the availability of individual patient and patient population data and by improving communication among providers. IDSs also reported that operating a health insurance plan can support patient care strategies by providing to the IDS both financial resources, such as savings from reducing avoidable hospitalizations for health insurance plan members, and data on plan members. For example, financial resources could be used to fund services such as care coordination--which many insurers do not reimburse--and the data could assist with strategies such as disease management. Employment of physicians was reported to facilitate physician accountability for quality of care because physicians who are employed by the IDS must meet certain performance indicators, and the IDSs collect data on and review physician performance. Employment of physicians was also reported to increase adherence to care protocols and to facilitate provision of care to underserved populations through compensation that mitigates physicians' concerns that they might not receive payment from uninsured patients. IDSs in the sample discussed several approaches they use to facilitate access to care for underserved populations. These approaches include using community-based settings, such as school-based health centers and federally qualified health centers (FQHC); conducting outreach; helping patients apply for coverage programs such as Medicaid; providing financial assistance; and collaborating with community organizations, including faith-based organizations. For example, some IDSs operate FQHCs within their system, and others collaborate with local FQHCs that are not part of their system. In addition, to improve access to mental health care services for patients, including those in underserved populations, some IDSs integrate mental health and primary care services. IDSs in the sample reported facing various operational challenges in providing care, including care for underserved populations. Some reported that not receiving reimbursement from health care insurance companies for the care coordination services they provide to patients is a financial challenge. Other operational challenges IDSs identified included finding specialty care for underserved patients, including mental health care; sharing clinical information in patients' EHRs with providers outside the system; and changing management and physician cultures to adapt to organizational change. The Department of Health and Human Services reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Health care delivery in the United States has long been characterized by  fragmentation at the national, state, and local levels. Care is delivered by  multiple providers, in multiple care settings, and often without systematic  coordination and communication across providers and settings.  Fragmentation of care delivery can lead to poor quality of care, medical  errors, inefficient delivery of services, higher costs, and patient  dissatisfaction. Fragmentation can be especially burdensome for patients  with chronic illnesses because of their ongoing care needs and for  underserved populations\u2014individuals who are uninsured or medically  underserved\u2014because of their financial and other challenges to accessing  services.", "One way that hospitals, physicians, and other providers have addressed  fragmentation is by forming integrated delivery systems (IDS) to improve  efficiency, quality, and access to care. An IDS can be integrated across its  providers and facilities in terms of such aspects as clinical care, financial  management, and human resources. These systems can vary in the way  they are organized, with services linked vertically, among different levels  of care (e.g., clinic, specialist\u2019s office, hospital), or horizontally, across one  level of care (e.g., hospitals). They can also vary in the extent to which  they are integrated. IDSs can be publicly owned or private.

To select our  sample, we began by reviewing published research and interviewing  researchers with expertise in IDSs. As a result, we identified 44 public and  private nonprofit systems from which to select our sample. In December  2009, we sent a Web-based data collection instrument to these systems to  determine the extent of their clinical integration and to obtain additional  information about organizational features of the system. This included  whether the system is made up of subsystems\u2014local or regional delivery  systems that are organized below the system level\u2014that integrate clinical  care within themselves. We sent e-mail reminders and conducted  telephone outreach to systems that had not responded by our requested  deadline. In the end, we received completed data collection instruments  from 19 systems. We excluded 4 systems from our study because their  responses indicated a lack of clinical integration or because of an  affiliation with a \u201cclosed system\u201d\u2014one that exclusively serves members of  the system\u2019s health insurance plan. Our final sample consisted of 15 IDSs,  which include five subsystems.

We reviewed the Web sites for the IDSs in our sample,  relevant articles and reports about the systems, and other documents the  systems provided. Based on our review of the extent of clinical integration  of each system, its location (census region and urban/rural), and whether  it is publicly or privately owned, we selected for site visits four systems  that reflected variation among these dimensions: Ascension Health\u2019s Seton  Family of Hospitals, Denver Health, Henry Ford Health System\u2019s Detroit  Region, and New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation\u2019s (NYCHHC)  Queens Health Network. We administered a structured interview protocol  with chief medical officers (or other system officials, as appropriate) to  obtain information on organizational features that IDSs use to support  strategies to improve patient care; approaches IDSs use to facilitate access  to care for underserved populations; and challenges IDSs encounter in  providing care, including care provided to underserved populations. To  gain additional in-depth information, we conducted interviews with IDS  officials at the four sites we visited, including system executives and  clinical staff. In some cases, information provided by IDS chief medical  officers and officials is specific to underserved populations, and we note it  as such in this report. In other cases, the information is more general,  relating to the overall system or patient population, which can include  underserved patients.", "Findings in this report are based on a judgmental sample and are not  generalizable to all IDSs. The organizational features, patient care  strategies, approaches to facilitate access, and challenges that we describe  are not necessarily unique to IDSs, but may also be found in other health  care settings and experienced by different providers.

Some IDSs are a single entity that includes a delivery system (hospitals,  physicians, and other providers) and a health insurance plan. Examples of  this type of IDS include NYCHHC and Geisinger Health System. Other IDSs  include a delivery system but do not have a health insurance plan, such as  Partners Healthcare and Memorial Healthcare System. IDSs may employ  their own physicians, rely on community-based physicians who are not  employed by the system but are granted use of the hospital facilities and  staff, or use a combination of those two approaches. An IDS can be  organized at the system level, or it can be more decentralized, having  subsystems that organize health care at the local or regional level. These  subsystems integrate care within themselves but not necessarily with  other subsystems in the overall system. IDSs can consist of multiple  subsystems. Because there is so much variation in the ways that IDSs can  be organized, it is difficult to determine the exact number of IDSs in the  country; however, millions of Americans receive care from IDSs.", "IDSs offer a continuum of services to a particular patient population or  community and can vary in what services are provided within this  continuum. For example, some IDSs provide nursing home care within  their systems, and others do not. Similarly, not all IDSs provide certain  specialized services such as organ transplantation or major burn services  within their systems. An IDS may have a contract with other providers to  offer certain services, or may refer patients to providers not affiliated with  the IDS for a service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Patient Care Strategies Used by IDSs", "paragraphs": ["IDSs use multiple strategies to improve patient care, such as care  coordination, disease management, clinical practice guidelines, and care  protocols. Care coordination is the integration of patient care activities  between two or more participants involved in a patient\u2019s care to facilitate  the appropriate delivery of services. It occurs across the continuum of  care and across different delivery sites, encompassing both health care  and social support interventions, and is often used for patients with  special health care needs or chronic health conditions. Care coordination  activities can include case management and patient navigation services.  Disease management involves providing coordinated health care  interventions and communications to patients who have chronic  conditions, such as diabetes or asthma, where patients\u2019 self-care efforts  can affect their health outcomes. Disease management is a systematic  approach to patient care that uses evidence-based practice guidelines.  Evidence-based practice guidelines, also referred to as clinical practice  guidelines, are systematically developed statements that guide providers  and patients in making decisions about appropriate health care for certain  conditions. They are typically based on an examination of the best  available scientific evidence and broad consensus about the best  treatment to follow. Care protocols, which are generally more specific  than guidelines, provide more detail about the management and treatment  of diseases and conditions. Patient care strategies can be designed to  achieve a variety of goals, such as improved health outcomes and quality  of care, increased efficiency, and lower costs. They may be performed by  physicians, nurses, or other clinical or nonclinical staff members and often  are implemented outside of a patient\u2019s face-to-face appointment with a  physician.", "Studies have shown that IDSs are more likely to use patient care strategies  than are other providers, such as solo practitioners. For example, a  national study of the management of chronic illness for patients with  asthma, congestive heart failure, depression, and diabetes found that  certain IDSs were significantly more likely to use recommended, evidence- based care management processes than were less organized providers. In  addition, a study of physician practices in California in the early 2000s  found that physicians affiliated with an IDS were more likely to use  disease management programs than were physicians in nonintegrated  medical group practices or small practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IDSs\u2019 Role in Serving Underserved Populations", "paragraphs": ["Depending on their geographic location and their mission, IDSs serve  varying proportions of underserved populations. Individuals who are  underserved have higher rates of illness, and they often face barriers to  accessing timely and needed care. For example, uninsured patients are  more likely than insured patients to have chronic illnesses that are  undiagnosed or undertreated. People with limited English proficiency  may have problems comprehending health care information and  complying with treatment. Rural residents also face barriers to access  because of physician shortages in rural areas. In addition, underserved  patients may have difficulty obtaining specialty services, including  diagnostic services. Integrating care, such as by linking primary and  specialty care, can reduce some of the access barriers that underserved  populations experience."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IDSs Reported That Using Electronic Health Records, Operating Health Insurance Plans, and Employing Physicians Support Strategies to Improve Patient Care", "paragraphs": ["The 15 IDSs in our sample collectively reported that organizational  features such as using electronic health records (EHR), operating health  insurance plans, and employing physicians all support various strategies  for improving patient care, including care coordination, disease  management, and use of care protocols."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Using EHRs Was Reported to Support Patient Care Strategies by Increasing Availability of Patient Information", "paragraphs": ["Officials at some IDSs in our sample told us that using EHRs supports  their strategies to improve the quality of patient care by increasing the  availability of clinical information and patient population data and by  improving communication.

For example, officials from Denver Health  characterized the EHR as a key component of integration. At Denver  Health, the EHR supports care coordination because physician notes from  patient encounters are scanned in within 24 hours of patient contact and  clinical information, such as previous laboratory tests, is available to all  providers (for additional information, see sidebar). Similarly, an official  from Mayo Clinic told us that the EHR helps avoid overutilization and  duplication of services, and an official from Partners Healthcare told us  that the EHR aids in care coordination because physicians can see patient  clinical information no matter where in the system the patient is.  Marshfield Clinic\u2019s EHR is also available at all of its facilities, giving  providers access to clinical information, digital radiology images, and  capabilities such as e-prescribing. At Marshfield Clinic, each patient\u2019s EHR  contains a \u201cdashboard\u201d with information on preventive services to  highlight needed services and to facilitate communication among  providers so that services and assistance can be requested electronically.  Marshfield\u2019s EHR also creates a list of high-risk patients with outcomes in  need of interventions so that physicians and other staff can follow up with  those patients."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disease Management", "paragraphs": ["According to IDS officials, using EHRs facilitates disease management by  making patient-level and population-level data available to providers,  which allows providers and IDSs to adjust approaches to treatment based  on individual patient and population-wide progress. NYCHHC, for  example, has disease management programs for patients with asthma,  diabetes, congestive heart failure, hypertension, cardiovascular disease,  and depression. Each regional subsystem within NYCHHC has its own  separate EHR. The EHRs update disease registries nightly, and through the  disease registries, providers can develop a comprehensive understanding  of a patient over time. For example, providers can assess a given diabetic  patient\u2019s health status at any point in time, and compare it to another point  in time to ascertain what may have been associated with a change in  health status. The diabetic disease registry also enables NYCHHC  physicians with similar groups of patients to compare their patients\u2019  outcomes. NYCHHC officials said that information technology makes it  easier to get data and identify trends, and that EHRs allow them to  anticipate and mitigate potential problems more easily and much earlier.  Because the EHR provides real-time clinical information, providers are  able to see test results immediately upon completion, which might not be  possible without an EHR. Having real-time information allows providers to  initiate appropriate treatment or follow-up. Similarly, the Doc Site Registry  at Henry Ford, which uses a common EHR across all its facilities, is a  disease registry program available for all patients that is linked to the  EHR. It covers diseases such as depression, chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease, hypertension, asthma, and chronic kidney disease. The  Doc Site Registry prompts providers to administer missing preventive  services during patients\u2019 visits. Staff at Henry Ford use the Doc Site  Registry to identify groups of patients who are in need of care  management. In addition, Hennepin Healthcare System has used an EHR  system since February 2007 for both inpatient and outpatient services.  According to officials at Hennepin Healthcare System, the EHR is  fundamental to providing real-time awareness and support for providing  clinical care, including care for patients with chronic diseases. One of the  officials added that using data from the EHR enables them to determine  which interventions are more effective in specific circumstances and gives  the staff insight into how to improve care.", "Officials at some of the IDSs reported that using EHRs with e-prescribing  and CPOE capabilities reduces errors and lowers costs. For example,   e-prescribing at Marshfield Clinic was reported to reduce errors related to  illegible handwriting and unintentional drug interactions. Through the  EHR, prescribers are alerted when an allergy or drug interaction exists.  Marshfield Clinic\u2019s EHR also requires physicians to consider appropriate  alternatives for prescription drugs, and a study found that Marshfield  Clinic\u2019s suggestions of \u201cpreferred alternative\u201d prescription drugs saved  payers and patients $2.5 million in 1 year. In addition, NYCHHC officials  told us that its CPOE includes drug interaction warnings and improves the  legibility of physician orders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Care Protocols and Clinical Practice Guidelines", "paragraphs": ["Officials from some IDSs told us that their systems\u2019 EHRs facilitate the use  of care protocols and clinical practice guidelines by prompting providers  to use them and tracking their use. At Denver Health, for example, when  entering an order into the CPOE through the EHR, the physician is  presented with a standard set of orders that is applicable to the patient.  The sets of orders are linked with guidelines explaining the need for the  specific orders, and physicians must explicitly de-select any orders they  disagree with. A Denver Health official told us that guidelines incorporated  into the EHR\u2019s CPOE function are more likely to be followed than  standalone guidelines. One example of the use of standardized order sets  is for Denver Health patients with ketoacidosis; this use of standardized  order sets was associated with a 23 percent decrease in intensive care unit  length of stay and a 30 percent decrease in hospital length of stay. In  another example, Allina Hospitals & Clinics, which uses a single EHR  system at all 11 of its hospitals and for all of its employed physicians,  created systemwide pneumonia vaccine guidelines to better identify  patients eligible for the vaccine.

According to the Geisinger Health System  official, the ProvenHealth Navigator program is associated with reductions  of up to 30 percent in hospital readmissions and about 20 percent in acute  admissions. Because Geisinger Health System hospitals have fewer  admissions, Geisinger Health System revenues from hospital care are  reduced.

Henry Ford  implemented an innovative protocol for use of an outpatient heparin  treatment in place of an inpatient heparin treatment for patients with deep  vein thrombosis before outpatient heparin was the standard of care. The  type of heparin used in the outpatient treatment was not covered by most  insurers. Because Henry Ford controls its own insurance benefit through  its health insurance plan, the Health Alliance Plan, it was able to cover the  cost of the outpatient heparin, which was associated with a decreased  length of stay, as well as a decreased cost per admission. Henry Ford also  uses its health insurance plan claims data to better inform patient care.  For example, Henry Ford has access to over 10 years of data on patients  with osteoporosis, allowing it to know how patients were treated and  what the outcomes of those treatments were, which can guide future  efforts to manage treatment of osteoporosis.

Through telehealth, Marshfield  Clinic specialists and primary care providers consult with each other and  outside referring physicians, and Marshfield Clinic patients can receive  services from other specialists located in academic medical and research  centers throughout the country. St. Edward Mercy Health System  facilitates access to health care services for pregnant women and  newborns in rural communities through its participation in the perinatal  telehealth program of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and  Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital. The program links physicians at St. Edward  Mercy Medical Center with a neonatalogist or an obstetrician who  specializes in high-risk pregnancies for consultation. To facilitate access to  psychiatric services for veterans living in rural communities, Geisinger  incorporates telemedicine into its Reaching Rural Veterans program.

For example, the NYCHHC Queens Health Network, which serves  a high proportion of patients who are uninsured or have Medicaid  coverage, annually screens all adult patients with diabetes for depression  in primary care settings. The primary care physicians treat patients with  mild to moderately severe depression, and patients needing more  specialized care are referred to the mental health clinic. Similarly, Henry  Ford conducts depression screening for patients with chronic conditions.  Henry Ford implemented a two-step screening process\u2014which is  embedded in the EHR\u2014in its primary care clinics. The patient is first  screened using a two-item screening questionnaire, and if that screening  indicates a need, the patient completes a second, more extensive  depression screening. The EHR uses the patient\u2019s responses to notify the  primary care provider if treatment for depression is required and provides  the evidence-based treatment protocol. Henry Ford reported that in a   12-month period from June 2007 to June 2008, its primary care doctors  were providing treatment for depression to 67 percent of the patients they  identified through screening. In addition, two IDSs with facilities in  Minnesota, Mayo Clinic and Allina, participate in a collaborative care  model in which primary care providers screen and treat adult patients with  depression. Primary care providers use a standardized questionnaire to  assess symptoms of depression, a tracking system to monitor patient  status, a medical guide for identifying appropriate treatment, care  coordination for patients, a psychiatrist who is available for consultations,  and tools for preventing relapses by patients in clinical remission.", "Another way some IDSs facilitate access to mental health care services is  by collocating providers such as social workers, nurses, and psychiatrists  in primary care settings. For example, Denver Health collocates some  mental health providers in community health clinics and school-based  health centers. Some of the community health clinics have a limited  number of mental health providers on site, as well as a psychologist or  psychiatrist. Staff at the school-based health centers include master\u2019s level  mental health clinicians and child psychiatrists for consultations as  needed. Another example of an IDS that collocates primary care and  mental health care is NYCHHC, where most mental health clinics are  collocated with primary care clinic locations. Therefore, patients needing  both primary care and mental health services can obtain those services in  one location.", "IDS officials told us that improving access to mental health care could  have a beneficial effect on a patient\u2019s physical health. A Denver Health  official noted that patients with unmet mental health care needs could face  difficulty adhering to medical care treatment plans.

In these collaborative efforts, IDSs work with organizations  such as other providers and faith-based organizations, sometimes  providing financial resources or directly providing patient care, referrals,  screening services, or health education. For example, Seton collaborates  with other local organizations through the Health Alliance for Austin  Musicians (HAAM) to provide physical and mental health care services to  low-income, uninsured musicians in Austin, Texas. Seton provides primary  care services through Seton Care Plus to HAAM members, while other  community organizations offer mental health, dental, and audiology  services. Although HAAM members obtain mental health care services  through a HAAM mental health provider, they obtain medications  prescribed by that provider through Seton Care Plus, which gives them  access to low-cost prescription drugs. Hennepin Healthcare System  collaborates with other providers in its community on a pilot program to  help patients who sought nonemergency care in the emergency  department to find a primary care home.", "Some other IDSs collaborate with health clinics in their communities by  providing in-kind and financial resources. For example, Intermountain and  Geisinger provide financial assistance to local health clinics. St. Edward  Mercy Health System provides office space to a local community  organization that provides social services and assistance to children who  have been abused, and a St. Edward Mercy Health System physician serves  as medical director for the organization. Some of the systems in our  sample work with local faith-based organizations. For example, Henry  Ford works with 15 to 20 local churches to offer health education and  screening related to issues such as nutrition, cancer, and heart disease.

Allina told us that  the Care Guide program increased the number of clinical goals that were  met for participating patients and decreased inpatient care costs.

For example, an official from Marshfield Clinic, which serves a  rural population, told us the system has difficulty recruiting mental health  care providers for its patient population, including Medicare and Medicaid  beneficiaries. As a result, the mental health care providers at Marshfield  Clinic have a large patient caseload and find it difficult to spend time  collaborating with other types of providers to integrate care. Like  Marshfield, Seton experiences difficulty recruiting psychiatrists to practice  at one of its rural facilities. Seton officials also told us that while  previously a psychiatrist worked in one of the system\u2019s urban primary care  clinics, the clinic could not sustain the funding for the position. Clinic staff  said they are able to consult with a psychiatrist only on a limited basis, and  that there are many patients at the clinic who have serious mental illnesses  but cannot access the care they need.

To  improve availability of patient clinical information, some IDSs make their  EHRs available to outside providers that also treat their patients. Of those  IDSs, some reported that while the outside providers can read the EHRs,  they cannot directly enter clinical information. For example, Geisinger  makes its EHR available to outside providers to give them immediate  access to patient medical records, but the providers are not able to enter  any additional clinical information directly into the EHR. Geisinger can  scan this information into the EHR if the outside provider communicates  it, but scanning is not instantaneous, as direct entry would be. A Geisinger  official noted that while scanning is not optimal, absent a common EHR  where information can be directly entered, the scanned records can be a  helpful supplement to a patient\u2019s EHR in many cases. Similarly, providers  serving patients at the FQHCs that Henry Ford partners with can only view  information in the EHR and cannot directly enter clinical information  themselves. While the Geisinger and Henry Ford EHRs are available as  read-only for outside providers, the Denver Health EHR cannot be viewed  by mental health care providers outside of its system. A Denver Health  official told us that, with the exception of enrollees in Denver Health\u2019s  managed care plans, Denver Health\u2019s patients with severe and persistent  mental illness receive their outpatient mental health care from a  community mental health center in Denver that uses an EHR that is  separate from Denver Health\u2019s EHR.

When the system transferred supervision of the  clinical services from the individual facilities to the central system, the  facility clinical directors were concerned that they would no longer have a  role in clinical management and would be responsible for administrative  functions only. The operational challenge was different at Intermountain,  where implementing care protocols required a change in the physician  culture because of the generally independent nature of physicians and  their concern that Intermountain was trying to \u201ctell them what to do.\u201d The  system has been making efforts to motivate physicians to use  Intermountain\u2019s voluntary care protocols for about 10 years. To do so,  Intermountain uses physician-level data to show how individual physicians  are performing relative to their colleagues. Intermountain has more buy-in  from physicians now than in the past, but officials there said changing the  culture continues to be a challenge.", "Some IDS officials said that implementing an EHR system is financially  and operationally challenging. For example, NYCHHC currently has eight  separate EHRs that were developed and customized at the subsystem  level, and it has been financially and operationally challenging to  consolidate them into an interoperable system.
