Our analysis of IRS data showed that certain cases  assigned to collection agencies generally have had limited results.

According to these fiscal year 2018 data, more  than 95 percent of the 17,000 cases\u2014involving $183 million in tax debt\u2014 were returned because the collection agencies indicated that:  they were unable to collect on the debt or contact the taxpayer, or  the taxpayer received Social Security supplemental or disability  income payments (which are to be returned because these taxpayers  have limited resources or ability to pay, according to IRS officials),  asked the collection agency to cease contact, or had died.", "When we shared our analysis with IRS officials, they said they were not  surprised by these limited PDC collection results because IRS considers  them to have low collection potential. Furthermore, many taxpayers may  not be able to pay because they have low income. In September 2018,  TIGTA reported that 54 percent of taxpayer accounts assigned to  collection agencies had a low income indicator. By pursuing such cases  that produce little or no revenue, IRS increases PDC program costs to  manage the cases being sent and returned as well as the burdens for  taxpayers who have to respond to collection agencies\u2019 contacts.  However, IRS officials said that they have not analyzed these results and  do not have data on either the costs or the burdens associated with these  cases.", "We also found that IRS does not have plans to analyze PDC program  results and inactive debt cases to identify cases that IRS will not pursue  that could be added to the PDC inventory. These cases could have higher  collection potential than many of the current PDC cases that are  collecting little or no revenue even though this potential has not been high  enough to be actively pursued by IRS. For example, IRS could use its  discretion to assign cases before they meet the FAST Act\u2019s case age  requirements criteria for collection agency assignment. Assigning such  cases earlier could improve PDC program results because of the debt  collection principle that collection success generally worsens as cases  age. Similarly, IRS does not have plans to analyze PDC results to  identify characteristics of cases with the highest collection results and use  that analysis to find other types of inactive cases with similar  characteristics that could be included in the PDC inventory. IRS officials  said they are not conducting or planning such analyses because their priority is to fully implement the program and assign the types of cases to  collection agencies that the FAST Act mandates. They said that they may  consider expanding the types of cases sent to collection agencies after  March 2019 and that they do not know whether they will do related  analyses or when any decision will occur. However, for both the debt  cases that could be excluded or added, IRS has existing discretionary  authority to revise the PDC inventory. For example, IRS has authority to  exclude cases from the PDC program if IRS determines they are not  potentially collectible. Furthermore, prior law grants IRS the discretion to  assign collection agencies cases beyond the three types of cases  specified by the FAST Act. Even so, IRS officials said that they have no  plans to analyze data on whether to revise the PDC inventory to reduce  costs or maximize revenue collection.", "By not analyzing the results of the PDC cases, IRS risks continuing to  send cases to collection agencies that collect little or no revenue and  incur costs that waste federal resources as well as burden taxpayers. If  most of the more than 2 million cases slated for collection agency  assignment into 2019 collect little or no revenue, the accumulated IRS  costs as well as burdens imposed on taxpayers could be significant.

Second, the register did not include some taxpayer  protection responses. Specifically, we identified taxpayer protection  responses in the collection agency contracts that were not included in the  risk register, such as 1) ensuring that collection agency employees are  not paid based on how much they collect, or 2) relying on taxpayers to  inform collection agencies if debt payments would cause a hardship.", "IRS officials acknowledged that their risk register does not align all of its  responses with specific risks, but said they created many responses to  generally protect taxpayers, although we did not find many of these  responses documented in the risk register.

In addition, IRS\u2019s not reporting TIGTA\u2019s costs to  administer the PDC taxpayer complaint system means Congress is not  informed of full PDC program costs. Furthermore, because IRS does not  have plans to analyze data to identify ways to improve the results of the  PDC program by using its discretion to revise the types of tax debt cases  it sends to collection agencies, IRS risks continuing to send cases to  collection agencies that incur costs but collect little or no revenue.

IRS said its approach to risk management is consistent with GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which is to  identify objectives before identifying risks to achieving those objectives.", "However, IRS did not document the program\u2019s objectives until October  2018, about two years after it validated identified PDC program risks, and  did not expect to finalize the objectives and related measures and targets  until fiscal year 2020 or later. Further, as discussed in the report, IRS\u2019s  stated objectives did not acknowledge all key PDC program risks, such as  scams and high costs compared to revenue collected.

IRS said that doing so  would be inconsistent with legislative requirements that define program  costs as IRS\u2019s costs and with IRS cost-accounting practices. However,  the FAST Act set minimum reporting requirements to which IRS can add  more information.  Also, the existing cost accounting standards and  practices to which IRS refers govern IRS\u2019s accounting for and reporting of  costs incurred by IRS. However, our intent is to ensure fuller reporting of  the PDC program\u2019s cost to the federal government. Therefore we stand  by our recommendation because without such reporting Congress is not  informed of full PDC program costs.", "IRS also disagreed that it should analyze PDC program results to identify  the types of cases that are not potentially collectible and therefore should  not be assigned to collection agencies (Recommendation 4). IRS said the  PDC statute requires the assignment of all inactive tax receivables to  collection agencies and therefore no collectability analysis is required or  necessary.  However, as we discuss in our report, the statute defines  \u201cinactive tax receivables\u201d as being in \u201cpotentially collectible inventory\u201d but  does not define \u201cpotentially collectible inventory.\u201d We also noted that IRS  has the discretion to define \u201cpotentially collectible inventory\u201d under its  general rulemaking authority in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7805 and can use this  authority to determine which cases are potentially collectible and which  are not.", "IRS also said it questioned whether the analysis we recommend would  improve efficiency and said there is very little cost associated with  assigning additional cases to collection agencies.

As we noted in  our report, IRS has incurred tens of millions of dollars in costs with little or  no revenue collected for most of the PDC cases that IRS has closed.", "IRS analysis to improve PDC case assignment could improve efficiency.   Under its general rulemaking authority, IRS is authorized to make rules it  deems necessary for the efficient administration of the tax code.

We look forward to IRS taking actions that will  address our findings. Without such analyses, IRS could miss  opportunities to assign cases that collect more revenue than cases that  collection agencies return with little or no revenue collected.", "Finally, although IRS agreed with our recommendation that it report the  amount of collected revenue sent to the general fund of the Treasury and  amounts retained by IRS to pay its costs (Recommendation 3), IRS said it  disagreed that its reports to Congress on the PDC program have not  provided complete financial information and said such reporting followed  statutory requirements.", "As we state in our report, IRS has documented PDC revenue collections  and costs in its annual report to Congress as required by the FAST Act.
