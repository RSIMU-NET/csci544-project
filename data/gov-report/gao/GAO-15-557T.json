To strengthen Ex-Im, Congress mandated several reform measures in the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012 and also required certain reviews and reports by GAO and others. Since March 2013, GAO has issued four reports mandated by the act ( GAO-13-303 , GAO-13-446 , GAO-13-620 , and GAO-14-574 ). In addition, in August and July 2014, GAO reported on Ex-Im's financing of exports with potential dual military and civilian uses and provided information on aircraft financing by Ex-Im and other countries' export credit agencies, respectively ( GAO-14-719 and GAO-14-642R ).", "This testimony summarizes the findings and recommendations in those six recent reports, and provides updated information on the status of Ex-Im's actions taken to address GAO's recommendations.

For example, in March and May 2013, GAO recommended addressing weaknesses in Ex-Im's model for estimating losses, data retained to analyze default risks, reporting of portfolio stress testing, and analysis of staff resources. Ex-Im has implemented all 6 of these recommendations.", "In September 2014, GAO found that Ex-Im had implemented many key aspects of its underwriting process but identified weaknesses in the design, implementation and documentation of some procedures. For example, GAO found that Ex-Im did not have mechanisms to verify compliance with certain loan guarantee eligibility procedures and had not documented its overall processes related to fraud. Ex-Im has implemented 4 of the 6 recommendations in this report. It has not fully implemented 2 recommendations concerning assessing collateral on certain transactions and verifying that applicants are not delinquent on federal debt. GAO's August 2014 report on Ex-Im's transactions involving exports with potential dual military and civilian uses also found documentation weaknesses and made one recommendation. GAO is reviewing the status of Ex-Im's actions in the context of GAO's ongoing dual use review.", "Finally, in May 2013, GAO found weaknesses in how Ex-Im forecasts its aggregate outstanding amount of financing (exposure) and how it reports estimates of its impact on U.S. jobs. GAO recommended that Ex-Im (1) adjust its exposure forecast model to incorporate previous experience and (2) assess and report the model's sensitivity to key assumptions.

To strengthen Ex-Im\u2019s governance and risk management  processes Congress included several reform measures as part of the  Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012 (2012 Reauthorization  Act), as well as several mandates requiring reviews and reports from Ex- Im, the Department of the Treasury, and GAO.

Detailed information on the scope and methodology for  our prior work summarized in this testimony can be found in the reports  cited.

Its mission is to support the export of U.S.  goods and services, thereby supporting U.S. jobs. Ex-Im\u2019s charter states  that it should not compete with the private sector. Rather, Ex-Im\u2019s role is  to assume the credit and other risks that the private sector is unable or  unwilling to accept, while still maintaining a reasonable assurance of  repayment. When private-sector lenders reduced the availability of their  financing after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis, demand for Ex-Im  products correspondingly increased. According to Ex-Im data, the amount  of financing Ex-Im authorized increased from $12.2 billion in fiscal year  2006 to $35.8 billion in fiscal year 2012, before declining to $27.3 billion in  fiscal year 2013 and $20.5 billion in fiscal year 2014. Though smaller than  the fiscal year 2012 peak, Ex-Im\u2019s fiscal year 2014 total authorizations are  a 68 percent increase in nominal terms over its total authorizations in  fiscal year 2006. Over the same period, Ex-Im\u2019s financial exposure  (outstanding financial commitments) increased from $57.8 billion to $112  billion, or by 94 percent in nominal terms. According to U.S. budget  documents, Ex-Im\u2019s number of full-time equivalent employees grew from  380 to 397 from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2014, an increase of  about 4.5 percent.", "Ex-Im offers export financing through direct loans, loan guarantees, and  insurance. Ex-Im\u2019s loan guarantees cover the repayment risk on the  foreign buyer\u2019s loan obligations incurred to purchase U.S. exports. Loan  guarantees are classified as short, medium, or long term. Although the  number of Ex-Im\u2019s short-term (working capital) guarantees greatly  exceeds the number of its medium- and long-term loan guarantees, long- term loan guarantees account for the greatest dollar value of Ex-Im loan  guarantees.", "Ex-Im is one of several ECAs worldwide that provide export financing  support. Other countries\u2019 ECAs range from government agencies to  private companies contracted by governments. Most, including Ex-Im, are  expected to supplement, not compete with, the private market. An  international agreement, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD) Arrangement on Officially Supported Export  Credits, governs various aspects of U.S. and other member countries\u2019  ECAs, but increasing activity of nonmembers threatens its ability to  provide a level playing field for exporters. Several agreements have been  made that decrease subsidies and increase transparency among ECAs.  However, these agreements apply to participant ECAs, and important  emerging countries, including China, are not part of the OECD  arrangement.", "Ex-Im faces multiple risks when it extends export credit financing,  including:", "Credit risk: the risk that an obligor may not have sufficient funds to  service its debt or be willing to service its debt even if sufficient funds  are available.", "Political risk: the risk of nonrepayment resulting from expropriation of  the obligor\u2019s property, war, or inconvertibility of the obligor\u2019s currency  into U.S. dollars.", "Market risk: the risk of loss from declining prices or volatility of prices  in the financial markets.", "Concentration risk: risk stemming from the composition of a credit  portfolio, for example through an uneven distribution of credits within a  portfolio.", "Foreign-currency risk: the risk of loss as a result of appreciation or  depreciation in the value of a foreign currency in relation to the U.S.  dollar in Ex-Im transactions denominated in that foreign currency.", "Operational risk: the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed  internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events.", "During underwriting, Ex-Im reviews a transaction and assigns it a risk  rating based on its assessment of the creditworthiness of the obligors and  to establish whether there is a reasonable assurance of repayment.

For example, since the 1980s,  Congress has required that Ex-Im make available a percentage of its total  export financing each year for small business. In 2002, this requirement  increased from 10 percent to 20 percent of total authorizations. Congress  further instructed that Ex-Im promote the expansion of its financial  commitments in sub-Saharan Africa.

Congress has also imposed a limit, currently $140 billion, on Ex-Im\u2019s total  aggregate outstanding amount of financing, referred to as the exposure  limit.
