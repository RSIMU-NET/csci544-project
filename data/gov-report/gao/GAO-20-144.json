This report: (1) identifies costs of these projects in the last 5 years and factors that contribute to those costs; (2) examines how GSA monitors and publicly communicates cost and schedule information; and (3) assesses GSA's efforts to confirm that projects meet GSA's requirements and that tenants are satisfied with completed projects. GAO analyzed GSA's performance data from fiscal years 2014 to 2018 for 36 projects with a minimum cost each of $20 million (i.e., a major construction project); selected five case-study projects representing diversity in project type, geographic area, building type, and range in cost and scope; reviewed applicable GSA policies, procedures, guidance, and reports; and interviewed GSA officials and project stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2014 through 2018, the General Services Administration (GSA) completed 36 major construction projects\u2014projects with a minimum cost of $20 million to construct new buildings or modernize existing buildings\u2014with a total cost of $3.2 billion. According to a GSA consultant, factors specific to federal construction projects may result in GSA's projects costing roughly 15 to 25 percent more than comparable private sector projects. For example, GSA uses more durable but more expensive materials to achieve a longer building service life compared to private owners who may plan for a shorter service life.", "GSA's Annual Performance Reports to Congress do not indicate how much GSA \u201crebaselined\u201d projects' schedules and costs. Rebaslining reestablishes the point at which GSA measures on-schedule and on-budget performance. In accordance with agency policy, GSA rebaselined 25 of 36 projects GAO reviewed to account for issues such as design changes and tenant-funded requests. For example, GSA rebaselined one of its modernization projects for a $2.7 million increase to the construction contract initially awarded for $21.8 million. The increase resulted from a design change to add a stairwell for fire safety purposes to accomodate the tenant's plan to increase the building's occupants (see figure). After GSA rebaselines a project, costs may differ from the project estimates approved by Congress. Because GSA does not report the extent that it has rebaselined projects or projects' final costs, Congress lacks information about GSA's performance: such as whether final costs are consistently above, below, or meeting estimated costs. Reporting such information could benefit Congress' ability to carry out its oversight role and improve transparency about the full costs of major federal construction projects.", "GSA assesses whether projects meet requirements and tenants' needs but does not fully capture or share lessons learned. For example, GSA uses \u201ccommissioning\u201d\u2014testing installed building systems\u2014to validate that the buildings' systems function as designed. However, because GSA's 2005 commissioning guide references outdated guidance, the effectiveness of its activities may be limited in assuring buildings are operating optimally. GSA also uses post occupany evaluations (POE) to assess projects' performance and tenants' satisfaction. However, in the last 5 years, GSA has not regularly conducted POEs, due in part to resource constraints, and lacks a policy for selecting projects for POEs and communicating findings from completed POEs. As a result, GSA may be missing opportunities to fully utilize POEs to gather tenants' feedback and inform the design and construction of future projects."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that GSA (1) report the extent projects were rebaselined and their final costs; (2) update GSA's commissioning guidance; and (3) identify and communicate when and how to conduct POEs and share lessons learned.

For example, cost models in the 2016 NIBS study indicate that  R&A projects cost roughly 15 to 25 percent more than R&A projects for a  comparable Class A private sector building. Although the study was  based on construction of R&A projects, both GSA and NIBS officials  agreed that these same factors can contribute to similar cost premiums  for GSA\u2019s new construction projects compared to private sector projects.  However, the NIBS staff who conducted the study told us that GSA\u2019s  more recent adoption of performance-based design standards, as  compared to previously prescriptive standards, likely lowers the federal  construction cost\u2019s premium relative to private sector projects but some  premium still exists. The performance-based design standards, for  example, provide contractors greater latitude in selecting construction  materials, which can have cost implications.", "According to the GSA\u2019s internal construction-cost study, the factors that  contribute to higher estimated costs for GSA construction projects when  compared to similar private sector projects primarily include design and  procurement requirements specific to federal projects that private sector  counterparts may not have to comply with.

GSA officials said  that the cost of making information technology systems FISMA-compliant  leads to federal projects costing more than private sector projects.

The fifth project\u2019s PMP was developed  prior to GSA\u2019s 2012 update to its PMP standard format, which then  required the use of a revision history log. More information pertaining to  our case-study projects, including some information from the GSA PMPs  we reviewed can be found in appendix II.", "The second tool GSA utilizes to monitor its construction projects is peer  reviews. GSA policy requires that external peer reviews be conducted on  projects with a construction cost over $25 million. Per GSA guidance,  these on-site peer reviews typically occur twice during construction\u2014 when projects are about 15 percent and 60 percent complete. External  peers\u2014typically, construction industry experts who were not involved with  the project\u2014assess whether a project is progressing as planned and  identify for GSA managers and project stakeholders any issues they  observe that may affect its timely completion or cost. In general, peers  also assess stakeholders\u2019 working relationships and make  recommendations for improvement or identify opportunities for greater  consistency in the performance of GSA\u2019s construction program or greater  efficiency among project stakeholders.", "We found that four of our case-study projects utilized external peer  reviews during construction, as required. For example, one peer review  report included the following observations:  The project team showed great progress toward completing the  project on time, and potentially ahead of schedule; the  implementation of the recommendations made during the initial  external peer review resolved potential unknowns and cost issues  that would have put the project at high financial risk; the safety  record was exceptional; tenants were better informed; and  security issues had been streamlined, allowing the contractor to  staff the project in a timely manner.", "Most of the GSA\u2019s project managers and construction contractors we  interviewed for these four case study projects said they generally believed  the external peer reviews were fair and added value. Our fifth case-study  project did not utilize an external peer review because it was not required  at the time GSA awarded the construction contract.", "The third tool GSA uses is EVM, which is an industry-recognized project  management tool and is required for major federal acquisitions, such as  construction projects, to help project managers monitor cost and schedule  during project execution. According to the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s (OMB) guidance and GAO\u2019s cost-estimating guide, EVM  measures the value of work accomplished in a given period and  compares it with the planned value of work scheduled for that period and  the actual cost of work accomplished in that period. The differences  between the estimated and actual costs and schedule are used to  determine, for example, whether less or more work had been completed  than had been planned. By tracking these differences, EVM can provide  warning signs of impending cost overruns or schedule delays and provide  estimates of anticipated costs at completion.", "Consistent with our previous findings related to GSA\u2019s use of EVM, we  found that GSA continues to use EVM to assess its construction project  delivery performance on two dimensions\u2014on-schedule and on-budget:", "On schedule: GSA considers a construction project to be on- schedule if its construction duration is within 10 percent of the planned  duration, from the construction start date to the substantial completion  date (i.e., GSA considers a project to be substantially complete on the  date the project space is suitable for tenant occupancy; however, the  project\u2019s cost could change prior to the actual contract close-out).", "On budget: GSA considers a construction project to be on budget if  its actual cost is within the planned construction cost (as measured by  the construction contract\u2019s value at award or the contract value as  adjusted based on post-award contract modifications) and the  additional 7 to 10 percent construction contingency. According to  GSA guidance, a project\u2019s construction contingency is intended to  cover unforeseen conditions and design deficiencies; it does not apply  to additional scope.", "According to GSA officials, GSA\u2019s central office uses EVM to conduct  monthly performance reviews of GSA\u2019s major construction projects. At  these reviews, GSA\u2019s central office considers certain proposed project  changes forwarded for approval by GSA regional offices. We have  previously reported that federal construction projects typically involve  some degree of change as the project progresses and that contract  changes, made through contract modifications, can occur for a variety of  reasons, including design errors and unforeseen site conditions. In  addition, GSA officials said that funding delays, tenant-caused delays,  and site acquisition issues can also be factors that cause project delays.  According to GSA guidance, while GSA regional offices have some  latitude to make contract changes, the regional offices and their project  managers must get central office approval if a proposed change is  anticipated to exceed the approved contract cost, construction  contingency, or schedule contingency. If such a change is approved, GSA  will then revise\u2014commonly referred to as \u201crebaseline\u201d\u2014either the  construction contract cost, the planned schedule duration, or both. GSA  will then use that new value to measure and report on the project\u2019s  budget and schedule performance.", "According to GSA officials and summary data on its rebaselining  decisions, the majority of GSA\u2019s major construction projects within our 5- year scope were rebaselined, within its policy, to account for changes to  projects\u2019 costs and schedules. Specifically, GSA officials told us they  rebaselined 25 of the 36 projects (about 70 percent). Of those projects,  18 (50 percent) were driven, at least in part, by tenant-requested  changes, which GSA officials said were the most prevalent reasons for  rebaselining a project. According to GSA policy, if a tenant agency  requests a project change that falls outside the original scope, the project  manager is to ensure that the tenant agency provides all the associated  design-related requirements and funding necessary to perform this  additional scope. For example, for one of our case study projects, the  tenant provided $17.7 million in additional funding as part of the final  phase of its headquarters building\u2019s multi-year modernization. The  tenant\u2019s funds paid for, among other things, the tenant-requested change  to convert part of the multi-story library into offices to increase the  building\u2019s space efficiency and allow more staff to move into the building.", "Based on our review of GSA\u2019s internal data, we found that four of our five  case-study projects were rebaselined; GSA rebaselined the cost of two  projects, the schedule of one project, and both the cost and schedule of  one project. For example, concerning costs, GSA rebaselined one project  to account for a $2.7 million increase to the contract\u2014initially awarded for  $21.8 million\u2014upon realizing that the tenant\u2019s plan to increase the  number of occupants in the building required another stairwell be added  for fire safety purposes. With regard to schedule, GSA rebaselined one  project, as previously discussed, to address a tenant-requested change to  convert parts of the library into offices; this change extended the schedule  by about 1 year. Given GSA\u2019s methodology that allows for rebaselining  and GSA\u2019s cost and schedule contingencies, GSA\u2019s EVM performance  data showed that all five case-study projects were completed on budget  and on schedule, if not early.

As noted above, GSA regularly rebaselines projects, within  policy, to account for changes to projects that affect construction contract  costs and schedules due to a variety of reasons. GSA officials told us  that they manage total project costs to be within the original prospectus  estimate provided to Congress adjusted, as applicable, by funds it  receives for tenant-requested changes; the officials do not believe that it  is critical to report final costs or if projects have been rebaselined.", "However, we have found that simply measuring and reporting  performance based on the most recent baseline may obscure how  projects have performed over their entire construction time frame. Being  more transparent about which projects or how many projects were  rebaselined, as well as reporting cost and schedule growth from original  baselines, can provide stakeholders with a more accurate view of project  performance and enhance accountability. Reporting on such cost  information, for example, would allow GSA to communicate to Congress  actual construction costs at a project\u2019s completion that may be different  than the estimated costs on the prospectus approved by Congress at the  project\u2019s initiation which likely did not account for items to be funded by  tenants. Without that information, it is not possible for Congress to know  how projects performed against approved estimated costs and whether  final project costs are consistently above, below, or meeting estimated  costs.

According to the Guide, the commissioning process is intended  to assist in preparing maintenance personnel to operate and maintain any  newly installed building systems.", "We found that GSA conducted commissioning largely in alignment with  the Guide on our five case-study projects based on our review of project  documentation and interviews with GSA\u2019s project managers, facilities  managers, and contractors. Further, we identified two key challenges in  regard to state-of-the-art building systems\u2019 and building contractors\u2019  capabilities. See sidebar for additional information on the two  challenges.", "While GSA generally conducted commissioning according to its Guide on  the five case-study projects we reviewed, we found that the 2005 Guide is  outdated. For example, the Guide references dated industry practices and  some outdated external guidance, both of which were in existence at the  time the Guide was developed. Specifically, it references the 2003  Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), Green Building  Rating System, Version 2.1; however, the LEED rating system for  projects since 2016 was Version 4.0, and Version 4.1 was recently issued  in 2019. We also found disconnects between the 2005 Guide and  GSA\u2019s current design standards or industry practices. For example:", "While the Guide states that GSA buildings should be LEED certified  and strive for a Silver certification, GSA now requires buildings to  achieve a higher certification, LEED Gold.", "The Guide states that GSA \u201cstrongly recommends\u201d that GSA  regions\u2014and agencies to which GSA has delegated the operations of  federal buildings\u2014recommission buildings every 3 to 5 years. The  current LEED standards call for \u201cperiodic commissioning  requirements, ongoing commissioning tasks, and continuous tasks for  critical facilities.\u201d", "In general, over the past decade, federal statutes, guidance,  executive orders, and changes to industry building certifications have  moved the federal government and the industry toward more real- time, continuous monitoring and commissioning in cases where  advanced building-automation systems, energy information- management systems, and advanced meters (e.g., electrical, water,  gas, temperature, and light meters) have been installed. The  continuous data provided by these systems can help building owners  make real-time adjustments to optimize building operations. However,  the Guide does not mention continuous monitoring-based  commissioning as a possible option to, or in addition to,  recommissioning buildings.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should periodically review policies, procedures, and related  control activities for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving  the entity\u2019s objectives or addressing related risks. Those standards also  indicate that if there is a significant change in an entity\u2019s process,  management should review this process in a timely manner after the  change to determine that the control activities are designed and  implemented appropriately. Without updated guidance, GSA\u2019s  commissioning activities may be limited in their effectiveness in assuring  building systems are operating optimally. Two of the five GSA contractors  we interviewed expressed frustration that the commissioning process on  their projects did not run smoothly. GSA\u2019s external peer reviews for those  same two projects also found that the roles of the various stakeholders in  the commissioning process were not clear. In addition, three stakeholders  on one of those projects said that some stakeholders\u2014especially GSA\u2019s  contracted design team\u2014were not fully involved during part of building\u2019s  commissioning. In light of our review, GSA is planning to evaluate its  commissioning guidance to determine an appropriate update. GSA  officials stated that this update may result in revising the existing  commissioning guide or replacing it with industry-recognized guidance.  However, GSA is still in the process of identifying the scope of the  update, including a timeline and resources required to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Intermittently Conducts POEs but Lacks Established Policies and Procedures and a Formal Mechanism for Sharing Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["According to OMB guidance, Post Occupancy Evaluations (POE) are  tools to evaluate the effectiveness of an agency\u2019s overall capital  acquisition process. The primary objectives of a POE include (1)  identifying how accurately a project meets its objectives, expected  benefits, and strategic goals of the agency and (2) ensuring the continual  improvement of an agency\u2019s capital-programming process based on  lessons learned. The guidance also states that agencies should have a  documented methodology for conducting POEs to ensure that each asset  is evaluated consistently. The guidance identifies 17 factors to be  considered for evaluation in conducting a POE, such as a project\u2019s  performance, compliance with design standards, maintenance issues and  building workforce competences, use of advanced building technologies,  tenant satisfaction, and cost savings. The guidance also notes that a POE  should generally be conducted 12 months after the project has been  occupied to allow time for the tenant to evaluate the building\u2019s  performance and the delivery of the project. However, the guidance  allows agencies some flexibility in the timing of a POE to meet their  unique needs if 12 months is not the optimal timing to conduct the  evaluation.", "We found GSA did not conduct any POEs on its completed major  construction projects in the 4-year period from 2014 to 2017, as called for  by OMB guidance. In fiscal year 2018, GSA contracted with the National  Institute of Building Sciences (NIBS) to conduct six POEs and seven  additional POEs in fiscal year 2019. GSA officials told us that while they  understand the value POEs can provide, they are only able to conduct  them when funding is available. They explained that POEs are funded  through general program funding (not project funding based on the  approved prospectus) within GSA\u2019s Office of Facilities Management, and  the available resources to conduct such efforts are limited given other  GSA portfolio-wide maintenance and operations priorities. GSA  acknowledged that it did not have a specific policy for conducting POEs  or selecting completed projects for POEs. Instead, GSA officials said  when selecting which buildings should undergo a POE, they ensure there  is a representation of different building types (i.e., federal buildings, U.S.  courthouses, and land ports of entry) and a mix of new and R&A projects.  Because GSA does not have a policy for POEs, NIBS developed a  general methodology, which it used for conducting each of those POEs.", "While GSA tries to ensure there is a mix of projects represented when  selecting POEs, it is not clear that its selection factors help ensure GSA  makes the best use of its limited resources. To balance OMB\u2019s guidance  to agencies that POEs should be conducted on agencies\u2019 completed  capital-construction projects, and given its resource constraints, GSA  could benefit from a more strategic approach to select the projects for  POEs. For example, GSA could use a risk-based approach to select for  POEs (e.g., more expensive projects or those that include the integration  of advanced, state-of-the-art building systems) to help improve the design  and construction of future projects. Such an approach is consistent with  the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, which  states that management should design control activities to achieve  objectives and respond to risks and implement those control activities  through policies. Control activities could include establishing criteria for  selecting projects for POEs and formalizing it through policy.", "GSA officials also noted that GSA has conducted multi-building studies\u2014 which share some similarities with individual building POEs\u2014that GSA  officials broadly consider to be POEs. However, while the studies  assessed some of the factors described in OMB guidance (e.g., project  performance, maintenance, or advanced technology use), none of them  comprehensively reviewed the 36 projects in our 5-year time frame.  Accordingly, while these broader studies can provide some useful  information to GSA, they are limited in their ability to provide GSA with  timely information that meets the POE goal stated in OMB\u2019s guidance: \u201cto  evaluate the overall effectiveness of the agency\u2019s capital planning and  acquisition process\u201d and to \u201csolicit customer feedback and incorporate  that feedback into improvements to the performance and delivery of the  capital investment process.\u201d", "OMB guidance states that agencies should establish mechanisms to use  lessons learned from POEs to minimize risks of repeating past mistakes  on future projects. Along these lines, NIBS produced a summary report  for GSA of the six 2018 POEs it conducted; the report identified design,  construction, commissioning, and operational maintenance issues and  lessons learned. From these lessons learned, NIBS also offered some  recommendations to GSA. For example, NIBS said that GSA should  establish a POE review committee to examine GSA\u2019s building designs to  highlight and offer solutions to previously identified problems in other  buildings and develop and distribute a checklist describing the identified  problems to teams that are responsible for designing new buildings. GSA  developed an operational guide to synopsize the lessons learned from the  NIBS report and expects that future building projects will benefit through  its efforts to incorporate these lessons in the design of future projects.  Further, NIBS reported that improvements to future projects in response  to the issues identified in the six 2018 POE projects would result in  reductions to GSA\u2019s future operational costs. However, it is unclear  whether the extent of these issues and lessons learned are unique to the  2018 POE projects reviewed by NIBS, or may be occurring across more  of GSA\u2019s construction projects. According to NIBS officials, they have  observed some recurring project issues among the six POEs conducted  in fiscal year 2018 and two of the seven conducted in fiscal year 2019.  GSA officials said that they plan to implement lessons learned from these  POEs into GSA\u2019s design standards by the end of 2019 and expect to later  update these design standards based on future POEs.", "According to GSA officials, they made NIBS\u2019s individual POE reports and  the 2018 POE summary report available to their project managers  through a shared folder on GSA\u2019s internal intranet site, which can be  accessed by over 120 staff. In addition, one GSA project manager told us  that GSA periodically holds knowledge-sharing webinars with its project  managers where lessons learned from specific projects may be  presented. This official indicated that the knowledge-sharing  presentations are heavy on photos and that there is no real prescribed  format or requirements for content. Accordingly, the presentations are an  informal way for project teams to share project knowledge across GSA\u2019s  regions. Further, this official said the lessons-learned presentations from  those webinars are also posted for a period of time on GSA\u2019s internal  website. However, communicating information via such means provides  ad-hoc benefits to only the select individuals who know about the  availability of the reports or webinars, and choose to access them. This  approach may not effectively expand the broader knowledge base of the  organization or best position GSA to, as OMB guidance indicates, ensure  continual improvement of an agency\u2019s capital-programming process  based on lessons learned. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government also indicate that management should communicate  necessary quality information to all relevant internal stakeholders to  achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.", "Without a sustained effort to consistently conduct POEs on its completed  projects, GSA may miss opportunities to gather valuable tenant feedback  and to identify marked successes or notable problems, including any  issues that are recurring. Such information could inform future  improvements to GSA\u2019s major construction projects and increase tenant  satisfaction. Further, such information may also help identify the need to  change or update some of GSA\u2019s policies, standards, guidance, or  practices, such as those recommended by NIBS or other project  stakeholders. However, even if GSA undertakes a more systematic  approach to conducting POEs, the benefits of doing so can only fully  materialize if GSA takes steps to effectively communicate POE lessons  learned to all staff who may be at risk of repeating previously identified  project mistakes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["GSA annually spends hundreds of millions of dollars on major  construction projects to provide tenant agencies with new buildings and  modernized spaces that help support agencies\u2019 missions and enable the  effective delivery of government services.

Providing the  additional information on projects\u2019 schedule and cost rebaselining, and  projects\u2019 final costs could further benefit Congress in its oversight role and  improve public knowledge about the full costs of major federal  construction projects. In addition, given the significant fiscal exposure for  the government to maintain these buildings for the long term, having  updated guidance on commissioning would enable GSA to better ensure  that completed projects are meeting GSA\u2019s design standards.

As we noted in the report, under its current process, GSA  selects the number of facilities evaluated as its annual budget allows  based on several selection factors. We continue to believe that GSA  could benefit from a more formalized and strategic approach to identifying  and communicating when and how POEs should be conducted to make  best use of its limited resources. GSA also mentioned its Design Guide  for Operational Excellence as a tool to communicate lessons learned from  POEs. We agree that such a guide is a good example of how POEs can  be used to inform the design of future projects.

However, the project was not awarded at that time. The U.S. Courts and  GSA had to revisit the long-term space needs for the U.S. Courts, which  was later done as part of GSA\u2019s 2013 feasibility study. In fiscal year 2014,  an additional $69.5 million was appropriated for a new approach that  would involve repairs and alterations to the existing Campbell  Courthouse, as well as the construction of a new federal courthouse  (which was to be smaller than originally designed), adjacent to the  Campbell Courthouse. GSA fiscal year 2014 documentation for the new  courthouse project estimated the total design cost at $8.5 million and the  total construction cost at $71.1 million, which excluded any prior funding  spent on site acquisition costs and the project\u2019s earlier design. In April  2015, GSA awarded a single design-build contract for both the design  and construction of the new courthouse and for the repairs and alteration  of the existing Campbell Courthouse. GSA baselined the construction  cost for the new courthouse\uf8e7exclusive of the costs for the Campbell  Courthouse alterations\uf8e7at $70 million. GSA data showed that the final  construction cost for the new courthouse was $72.6 million (an increase  of about 4 percent over the baseline cost of $70 million; roughly 9 percent  less than the $79.6 million total estimated costs for both the design and  construction). Construction started in Spring 2016 and was completed in  just over 2 years, in June 2018.
