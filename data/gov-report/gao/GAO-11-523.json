The Marine Corps is taking steps to develop such a strategy; however, the timeline for completing and issuing this strategy is uncertain. Although Marine Corps officials agreed that a reset strategy for ground equipment will be needed, they stated that they do not plan to issue a strategy until there is a better understanding of the dates for drawdown of forces from Afghanistan. While more specific drawdown information is desirable and will be needed to firm up reset plans, the President stated that troops would begin to withdraw in July 2011, working towards a transfer of all security operations to Afghan National Security Forces by 2014. Until the ground equipment reset strategy is issued, establishing firm plans for reset may be difficult for the Marine Corps Logistics Command to effectively manage the rotation of equipment to units to sustain combat operations. It is also uncertain to what extent the Marine Corps plans to align its ground equipment reset strategy with its ground equipment modernization plan. GAO found that the Iraq reset strategy for ground equipment contained no direct reference to the service's equipment modernization plans, leaving unclear the relationship between reset and modernization. A clear alignment of the ground equipment reset strategy for Afghanistan and modernization plans would help to ensure that the identification, development, and integration of warfighting capabilities also factor in equipment reset strategies so that equipment planned for modernization is not unnecessarily repaired. The total costs of reset estimated by the Marine Corps may not be accurate or consistent because of differing definitions of reset that have been used for aviation and ground equipment. These differing definitions exist because Department of Defense (DOD) has not established a single standard definition for use in DOD's budget process. Specifically, the Marine Corps does not include aviation equipment procurement costs when estimating total reset costs. According to Marine Corps officials, procurement costs are excluded because such costs are not consistent with its definition of aviation equipment reset. In contrast, the Marine Corps' definition of reset for ground equipment includes procurement costs to replace theater losses. However, GAO found that the Office of the Secretary of Defense Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation had obtained a procurement cost estimate for Marine Corps aviation equipment as part of its efforts to track reset costs for the department.

In the meantime, Marine Corps officials are taking the following steps  toward developing a reset strategy:  \uf0b7  First, the Marine Corps completed a force structure review in early  2011 that is aimed at ensuring the service is properly configured. The  force structure review included a determination of equipment reset  requirements to support the post-Afghanistan Marine Corps force  structure.  \uf0b7  Second, the Marine Corps is currently developing an implementation  plan based on the results of the force structure review. A goal of the  force structure implementation plan is to ensure that the Marine Corps  achieves a restructured force by the time the reset of equipment used  in Afghanistan is complete. The focus of this implementation plan is  the establishment of the mission-essential tasks and the development  of refined tables of equipment in support of those tasks. These refined  tables of equipment will determine what equipment the Marine Corps  will reset and how the equipment will be reintegrated into  nondeployed Marine Corps forces. The Marine Corps plans to issue  this force structure implementation plan in summer 2011.  \uf0b7  Third, following issuance of the force structure implementation plan,  the Marine Corps plans to develop and issue formal reset planning  guidance that informs operating force units and the Marine Corps  Logistics Command what equipment they will receive and be  responsible for resetting. Specifically, Marine Corps officials stated  that the planning guidance is intended to allow Marine Forces  Commands, Marine Expeditionary Forces, and Marine Corps Logistics  Command to assess their reset maintenance capacity requirements  and identify additional support requirements beyond the maintenance  centers\u2019 capacity. The officials indicated that the planning guidance  would serve as a precursor to a comprehensive reset strategy.", "Although the Marine Corps has laid out several steps toward developing  its ground equipment reset strategy, it has not specified timelines for  completing and issuing either the formal reset planning guidance or its  reset strategy or indicated how it plans to take into consideration the  current dates announced by the President for withdrawal in its reset  strategy for Afghanistan. The reset strategy is necessary to help ensure  that life-cycle management governance is provided to key organizations  responsible for executing reset, such as the Marine Corps Logistics  Command.

The ground equipment modernization plan is used annually to  develop future warfighting capabilities to meet national security  objectives. Following the plan guides the Marine Corps in the  identification, development, and integration of warfighting and associated  support and infrastructure capabilities. Marine Corps officials have  stated that they plan to establish a link between the reset strategy for  Afghanistan and the ground modernization plan. As a basis for evaluating  current reset planning for ground equipment used in Afghanistan, we also  reviewed both the aviation reset strategy for Afghanistan and the ground  equipment reset strategy that the Marine Corps developed for Iraq.

Specifically, DOD\u2019s response has both the formal reset  planning guidance and the ground equipment reset strategy being issued  at the same time. Marine Corps officials stated that the formal reset  planning guidance is intended to serve as a precursor to a  comprehensive reset strategy that will allow Marine Forces Commands,  Marine Expeditionary Forces, and Marine Corps Logistics Command to  assess their reset maintenance capacity requirements and identify  additional support requirements beyond the maintenance centers\u2019  capacity. We believe this guidance will not be useful if it is not issued  sufficiently ahead of time to guide the development of the ground  equipment reset strategy. Consequently, we disagree with DOD\u2019s  statement that the Marine Corps does not need further direction to  establish a timeline for completing and issuing formal reset planning  guidance and a ground equipment reset strategy for equipment used in  Afghanistan.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of  Defense direct the Commandant of the Marine Corps to provide linkages  between the ground equipment reset strategy for equipment used in  Afghanistan and equipment modernization plans, including the  Expeditionary Force Development System and the annual Program  Objective Memorandum Marine Air-Ground Task Force Requirements  List. DOD commented that it recognizes the importance of providing a  linkage between ground equipment reset strategies and equipment  modernization plans. Specifically, DOD commented that the Marine Corps  plans to outline these linkages in their Operation Enduring Freedom  Reset Plan, the Operation Enduring Freedom Reset Playbook, and the  Marine Air Ground Task Force Integration Plan, which are currently being  developed. While, as previously mentioned, the Marine Corps did not  provide specific details regarding the three documents cited above during  the course of our review, we believe that including this linkage in these  documents would be responsive to our recommendation and will allow the  Marine Corps to more effectively and efficiently plan and execute ground  equipment reset.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in  coordination with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation, the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisitions, Technology and Logistics, the services, and  the Joint Staff to act on the tasking in the Resource Management  Decision 700 to develop and publish a DOD definition of reset for use in  the DOD overseas contingency operations budgeting process. DOD  commented that it is developing a definition of reset for use in the  overseas contingencies operations budgeting process that will be  incorporated into the DOD Financial Management Regulation. However,  during the course of our review DOD had not yet taken action to develop  a reset definition, which was to have been submitted by the Comptroller  to the Deputy Secretary of Defense for approval by January 15, 2010. In  addition, DOD commented that in the interim the department is using  specific criteria provided by OMB guidance for determining the reset  requirements that are overseas contingency operations or base. While  OMB has provided guidance for overseas contingency operations budget  requests, this guidance does not provide specific direction concerning  what constitutes reset. Consequently, DOD recognizes the need for a  common definition of equipment reset for budget purposes, but has not  met its goal of establishing one. Resource Management Decision 700  established a January 2010 date for approving a common reset definition,  and that definition could have been used in developing the department\u2019s  fiscal year 2012 budget submission. DOD is now developing its fiscal year  2013 budget submission without the benefit of a common definition.  Therefore, we disagree with DOD\u2019s statement that additional and  separate guidance from the Secretary of Defense is not necessary, and  believe that additional direction is needed to emphasize that the Under  Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), in coordination with the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisitions,  Technology and Logistics, the services, and the Joint Staff should  expedite the development and publication of a DOD definition of reset for  use in the DOD overseas contingency operations budgeting process.

As a basis for assessing  current reset planning efforts for Afghanistan, we also reviewed the reset  strategy that the Marine Corps prepared for equipment used in Iraq. We  collected written responses and supporting documentation to our inquiries  and data requests from Marine Corps officials related to ground and  aviation equipment reset strategies. We also discussed with Marine  Corps officials the process used and the factors considered when  developing these reset strategies.

In performing our analysis, we reviewed  the strategies to determine if they included, partially included, or did not  include each of the six key elements. Through our assessment we  determined the guidance documents in addition to the aviation equipment  reset strategy that comprises the Marine Corps strategic plan for reset. In  addition, to understand the extent to which the Marine Corps aligns its  modernization plans with its reset strategies, we interviewed Marine  Corps officials to discuss the plans used for modernization and discussed  the process for how these plans are incorporated with the strategies for  equipment reset.", "To assess the Marine Corps\u2019 estimates of total reset costs, we obtained  and reviewed the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) Resource  Management Decision 700\u2014separate from the budget formulation  guidance\u2014tasking the services to provide annual reset cost updates, and  the Marine Corps processes for determining total reset costs for ground  and aviation equipment.

We then analyzed the  Marine Corps\u2019 reset budgets from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year  2010 for the reset of ground and aviation equipment to identify any trends  in the operations and maintenance and procurement funding categories.  We discussed the results of our analysis with Marine Corps officials to  determine the rationale for any trends in the funding. We interviewed  Office of the Secretary of Defense, Department of the Navy, and Marine  Corps officials to obtain information and any guidance documents  pertaining to the process used for budget development and budget review  and approval.
