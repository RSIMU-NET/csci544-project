These audits were conducted under the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, as expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA). Our review of the general and application computer controls over key BPD financial systems was performed as part of these audits. On July 31, 1998, we issued a \u201cLimited Official Use\u201d report to you detailing the results of our review. This version of the excerpted report for public release provides a general summary of the vulnerabilities we identified and the recommendations we made.", "This report discusses general and application controls that support key automated financial systems maintained and operated by BPD. These systems process investments and redemptions of Treasury securities, generate interest payments, account for the resulting debt, and provide financial reports to the public and the federal government.", "General controls affect the overall effectiveness and security of a computer processing facility as opposed to being unique to any specific computer application processed there. They are intended to (1) protect data, files, and programs from unauthorized access, modification, and destruction, (2) prevent the introduction of unauthorized changes to systems and applications software, (3) ensure that system software development and maintenance, applications software development and maintenance, computer operations, security, and quality assurance functions are performed by different people, (4) ensure recovery of computer processing operations in case of a disaster or other unexpected interruption, and (5) ensure that an adequate computer security planning and management program is in place.", "Application controls are the structure, policies, and procedures that apply to individual application systems. These controls help to ensure that transactions are valid; properly authorized; and completely, promptly, and accurately processed by the computer.", "As we reported in connection with our audit of the Schedule of Federal Debt, management of BPD fairly stated that its related internal controls, including computer controls, were effective. However, as discussed in this report, we found vulnerabilities involving computer controls that we did not consider reportable conditions, but, if left uncorrected, could increase the risk of inappropriate disclosure and modification of sensitive information, misuse or damage of computer resources, and disruption of critical operations. These vulnerabilities warrant management\u2019s attention and action. While performing our work, we communicated our interim findings and recommended corrective actions for each specific finding to BPD management. This report summarizes those findings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Treasury is authorized by the Congress to borrow money on the credit of the United States to fund operations of the federal government. The Bureau of the Public Debt is the organizational entity within Treasury that is responsible for prescribing the debt instruments and limiting and restricting the amount and composition of the debt. BPD accomplishes this by issuing marketable Treasury bills, notes, and bonds as well as nonmarketable securities, such as U.S. Savings Bonds. The bureau is also responsible for paying interest to investors and redeeming investors\u2019 securities. In addition, BPD has been given the responsibility to issue Treasury securities to trust funds for trust fund receipts not needed for current benefits and expenses.", "During fiscal year 1997, BPD issued over $2.34 trillion in Treasury securities to the public while redeeming about $2.31 trillion of debt held by the public. Most of the $2.34 trillion was raised through more than 160 securities auctions as well as the continual sale of savings securities at 40,000 locations throughout the country and investments in securities by state and local governments. Further, there was $152 billion of net borrowings from federal entities, primarily trust funds.", "BPD relies on a number of financial systems to process and track the money that is borrowed and to account for the securities it issues. One of its primary systems is the Public Debt Accounting and Reporting System, which is used to account for the federal debt. BPD also relies on various other systems to track marketable securities, savings bonds, and securities issued to state and local government entities and to generate interest transactions for the different securities. All of BPD\u2019s financial activities are processed at its data processing center in Parkersburg, West Virginia.", "In carrying out its debt responsibilities, BPD receives assistance from Federal Reserve Banks (FRB) located throughout the country, which serve as Treasury\u2019s fiscal agents. For instance, FRBs issue Treasury securities in electronic (book entry) form upon authorization by the Treasury and administer principal and interest payments on these securities. There are 12 FRBs with 25 branches throughout the country.", "FRBs use a number of information systems to help process issuance and redemption activities; generate interest payments; and account for marketable Treasury securities, nonmarketable savings securities, and savings securities stock. Data are initially processed at FRBs and then forwarded to BPD\u2019s Parkersburg, West Virginia, data center for further processing.", "The overall effectiveness of the BPD computer controls depends on the controls implemented by BPD\u2019s Assistant Commissioner for the Office of Information Technology.

In addition, we attempted to obtain access to sensitive data and programs. These attempts, referred to as penetration testing, were performed with the knowledge and cooperation of BPD officials.", "To evaluate certain application controls, we tested two key BPD financial applications maintained and operated at the data center. Specifically, we evaluated application controls intended to ensure that access privileges establish individual accountability and proper segregation of duties, limit the processing privileges of individuals, and prevent and detect inappropriate or unauthorized activities; data are authorized, converted to an automated form, and entered into the application accurately, completely, and promptly; data are properly processed by the computer and files are updated correctly; and files and reports generated by the application (1) represent transactions that actually occur and (2) accurately reflect the results of processing, and reports are controlled and distributed to the authorized users.", "To assist in our evaluation and testing of general and application controls, we contracted with an independent public accounting firm. We determined the scope of our contractor\u2019s audit work, monitored its progress, and reviewed related working papers to ensure that the resulting findings were adequately supported.", "During the course of our work, we communicated interim findings and recommended corrective actions to BPD officials who informed us of the steps they planned to take or had taken to address the vulnerabilities we identified. We performed follow-up work to assess the status of any corrective actions taken as of September 30, 1997. The results of the follow-up work were also communicated to BPD.", "We performed our work at the BPD data center in Parkersburg, West Virginia, from March 1997 through January 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested oral comments on a draft of this report from the Secretary of the Treasury or his designee.

Specifically, we found that BPD could improve its general controls by (1) strengthening logical access controls over the use of powerful system capabilities that can be used to access data and programs, (2) strengthening physical controls to further restrict and prevent unauthorized access, and (3) enhancing its service continuity and contingency plans.

The plan specifies the organization\u2019s emergency response, backup operations, and postdisaster recovery procedures to ensure the availability of critical resources and facilitate the continuity of operations.
