For the May 2016 report, GAO visited the VCL's primary center and two backup call centers; tested VCL response time through a generalizable sample of covert telephone calls and a nongeneralizable sample of text messages in July and August 2015; reviewed internal reports and policies and plans; and interviewed VA officials.

VA's goal was to answer 90 percent of VCL calls at the VCL primary center within 30 seconds in the period GAO studied. Calls not answered within 30 seconds were to route to VCL backup call centers; however, for 5 months of fiscal year 2015, calls were routed to VCL backup call centers after 60 seconds. According to VA officials about 65 to 75 percent of VCL calls were answered at the VCL primary center in fiscal year 2015 within either 30 or 60 seconds. GAO's covert testing in July and August 2015 confirmed this. Specifically, 119 covert test calls showed that an estimated 73 percent of calls made during this period were answered within 30 seconds. GAO also covertly tested the VCL's text messaging services and found that 4 of 14 GAO test text messages did not receive responses. GAO recommended that VA regularly test the VCL's text messaging system to identify issues and correct them promptly. In response, VA developed and implemented procedures to regularly test the VCL's text messaging system, as well as its telephone and online chat systems.", "In May 2016, GAO found that VA had taken a number of steps to improve its monitoring of the VCL primary center operations. For example, VA had established a permanent VCL call center evaluation team and created a mechanism for tracking complaints about the performance of the VCL primary center from VCL callers or external parties. However, GAO found that VA had not specified quantifiable or otherwise measurable targets and had not included dates for when it would expect the VCL to complete actions covered by each key performance indicator. This was inconsistent with guidance provided by the Office of Management and Budget. GAO recommended that VA document clearly stated and measurable targets and time frames for key performance indicators needed to assess VCL performance. Although VA agreed, as of March 2017, this recommendation remains open.", "GAO also found that VA had established an interagency agreement with its service partner, the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), to manage the shared operations of the VCL and Lifeline (a public-private network that provides free and confidential support to people in suicidal crisis or emotional distress). Despite these efforts to coordinate, VA and SAMHSA did not collect information needed to assess how often and why callers intending to reach the VCL do not follow voice prompts and instead reach Lifeline local crisis centers. As a result, VA and SAMHSA did not know the extent to which this occurred and could not determine the underlying causes that may need to be addressed. GAO recommended that VA and SAMHSA (1) collect information on how often and why callers intending to reach the VCL instead reach Lifeline local crisis centers and (2) review the information collected and, if necessary, develop plans to address the underlying causes.

As VA endeavored to address  increasing numbers of requests for assistance, reports of dissatisfaction  with VCL service periodically appeared in the media, and the VA Office of  Inspector General was asked to investigate complaints about the VCL\u2019s  lack of timely response to callers. The Inspector General identified gaps  in the VCL quality-assurance process, including challenges associated  with supervisory review, tracking of issues, and collection and analysis of  data from VCL backup call centers.

VA implemented staggered shifts for responders  at the VCL primary center on September 6, 2015. Staggered shifts are  work schedules that allow employees to start and stop their shifts at  different times as a way to ensure better coverage during peak calling  periods. Specifically, it helps schedule more employees to work when call  volume is highest and fewer employees to work when call volume is  lowest. Additionally, staggered shifts help limit disruptions in service as  responders begin and end their shifts.", "By comparing VCL telephone call data from September through  December of 2014 to that of September through December of 2015, we  found that VA\u2019s implementation of staggered shifts at the VCL primary  center had mixed results. For example, the average percentage of calls  answered per hour at the VCL primary center from September through  December 2015\u2014after staggered shifts were implemented\u2014was 75  percent, slightly less than the average of 79 percent answered during the  corresponding period in 2014 before staggered shifts were implemented.  However, the VCL received an average of about 1.3 more calls per hour  during this period in 2015 than it received during the corresponding period  in 2014 and, according to VA officials, the VCL primary center employed  fewer responder staff in 2015 than 2014.", "New call-handling procedures.

For example, VA officials  reported that some veterans did not receive complete suicide  assessments when their calls were answered at VCL backup call centers.  In addition, VA officials noted that they had observed some VCL backup  call centers failing to follow VCL procedures, such as not calling a veteran  who may be in crisis when a third-party caller requested that the  responder contact the veteran.

We  found that these new proposed contract terms included the same  performance requirement modifications that were made in March 2015,  as well as additional performance requirements and better data reporting  from the contractor that could be used to improve VA\u2019s oversight of the  VCL backup call centers. Specifically, the proposed contract terms added  performance requirements to address VCL backup call center  performance\u2014including a requirement for 90 percent of VCL calls  received by a VCL backup call center to be answered by a backup call  center responder within 30 seconds and 100 percent to be answered by a  backup call center responder within 2 minutes. In addition, the proposed  contract terms included numerous data reporting requirements that could  allow VA to routinely assess the performance of its VCL backup call  centers and identify patterns of noncompliance with the contract\u2019s  performance requirements more efficiently and effectively than under the  prior contract. The proposed terms for the new contract also state that VA  will initially provide and approve all changes to training documentation  and supporting materials provided to VCL backup call centers in order to  promote the contractor\u2019s ability to provide the same level of service that is  being provided by the VCL primary center."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA and SAMHSA Did Not Collect Information Needed to Assess How Often and Why Callers Were Not Reaching the VCL", "paragraphs": ["In May 2016, we found that when callers did not press \u201c1\u201d during the initial  Lifeline greeting, their calls may take longer to answer than if the caller  had pressed \u201c1\u201d and been routed to either the VCL primary center or a  VCL backup call center. As previously discussed, VA and SAMHSA  collaborated to link the toll-free numbers for both Lifeline and the VCL  through an interagency agreement. The greeting instructs callers to press  \u201c1\u201d to be connected to the VCL; if callers do not press \u201c1,\u201d they will be  routed to one of SAMHSA\u2019s 164 Lifeline local crisis centers. To mimic the  experience of callers who did not press \u201c1\u201d to reach the VCL when  prompted, we made 34 covert nongeneralizable test calls to the national  toll-free number that connects callers to both Lifeline and the VCL during  August 2015 and we did not press \u201c1\u201d to be directed to the VCL. For 23  of these 34 calls, our call was answered in 30 seconds or less. For 11 of  these calls, we waited more than 30 seconds for a responder to answer\u2014 including 3 calls with wait times of 8, 9, and 18 minutes. Additionally, one  of our test calls did not go through, and during another test call we were  asked if we were safe and able to hold. VA\u2019s policy prohibits VCL  responders from placing callers on hold prior to completing a suicide  assessment; Lifeline has its own policies and procedures.", "According to officials and representatives from VA, SAMHSA, and the  VCL backup call centers, as well as our experience making test calls  where we did not press \u201c1,\u201d there are several reasons why a veteran may  not press \u201c1\u201d to be routed to the VCL, including an intentional desire to not connect with VA,  failure to recognize the prompt to press \u201c1\u201d to be directed to the VCL, waiting too long to respond to the prompt to press \u201c1\u201d to be directed to  calling from a rotary telephone that does not allow the caller to press  \u201c1\u201d when prompted.", "As we found in May 2016, VA officials had not estimated the extent to  which veterans intending to reach the VCL did not press \u201c1\u201d during the  Lifeline greeting. These officials explained that their focus had been on  ensuring that veterans who did reach the VCL received appropriate  service from the VCL primary center and backup call centers. In addition,  SAMHSA officials said that they also did not collect this information.  These officials reported that SAMHSA did not require the collection of  demographic information, including veteran status, for a local crisis center  to participate in the Lifeline network. However, they noted that SAMHSA  could request through its grantee that administers the Lifeline network  that local crisis centers conduct a one-time collection of information to  help determine how often and why veterans reach Lifeline local crisis  centers. SAMHSA officials explained that they could work with the Lifeline  grantee to explore optimal ways of collecting this information that would  be (1) clinically appropriate, (2) a minimal burden to callers and Lifeline\u2019s  local crisis centers, and (3) in compliance with the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s paperwork reduction and information collection policies. The  interagency agreement between VA and SAMHSA assigns SAMHSA  responsibilities for monitoring the use of the national toll-free number that  is used to direct callers to both the VCL and Lifeline. These  responsibilities include monitoring the use of the line, analyzing trends,  and providing recommendations about projected needs and technical  modifications needed to meet these projected needs. Using the  information collected from the Lifeline local crisis centers on how often  and why veterans reach Lifeline, as opposed to the VCL, VA and  SAMHSA officials could then assess whether the extent to which this  occurs merits further review and action.", "Although the results of our test were not generalizable, substantial wait  times for a few of our covert calls suggested that some callers may  experience longer wait times to speak with a responder in the Lifeline  network than they would in the VCL\u2019s network. We concluded that without  collecting information to examine how often and why veterans do not  press \u201c1\u201d when prompted to reach the VCL, VA and SAMHSA could not  determine the extent veterans reach the Lifeline network when intending  to reach the VCL and may experience longer wait times as a result. In  addition, limitations in information on how often and why this occurs did  not allow VA and SAMHSA to determine whether or not they should  collaborate on plans to address the underlying causes of veterans not  reaching the VCL. Standards for internal control in the federal  government state that information should be communicated both  internally and externally to enable the agency to carry out its  responsibilities. For external communications, management should  ensure there are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining  information from, external stakeholders that may have a significant impact  on the agency achieving its goals.", "We recommended VA and SAMHSA collaborate in taking the following  two actions: (1) collect information on how often and why callers intending  to reach the VCL instead reach Lifeline local crisis centers and (2) review  the information collected and, if necessary, develop plans to address the  underlying causes. We understand that VA and SAMHSA have been  coordinating on these issues. However, as of March 2017, both of these  recommendations remain open.", "Chairman Roe, Ranking Member Walz, and Members of the Committee,  this concludes our statement for the record."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For questions about this statement, please contact Seto J.
