While crime, poverty, and the physical and social deterioration of urban neighborhoods increased, intergovernmental aid to cities declined between 1980 and 1993 by about 19.4 percent in constant dollars. Meanwhile, the out-migration of many middle-income residents and businesses has caused city tax bases to shrink, hampering the ability of local governments to assist economically and socially distressed areas suffering from a mix of interrelated problems.", "Over the past several decades, the public and private sectors have tried different strategies to assist people living in distressed communities. Some of these efforts have focused on improving the chances for individuals in these areas to obtain the education, social services, and other support they need to leave their neighborhoods. Others have focused on improving the neighborhood\u2019s physical environment through affordable housing or economic development. Still others have combined aspects of both approaches by addressing the needs of residents and their environment. These latter efforts are referred to as comprehensive by community development experts because they consider the housing, social service, and economic development needs of the community. They are considered community-based because they focus on a specific geographic area and involve the residents in planning and implementing the effort. Comprehensive community-based efforts have often begun within a community in response to neighborhood conditions\u2014rather than in response to a federal program\u2014and are operated by local nonprofit organizations. While the structures of these organizations and the programs they provide vary, figure 1.1 illustrates a likely design for a comprehensive community-based development effort."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Major Community Development Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["During the 1960s, as a part of its overall strategy to better serve the needs of the poor, the federal government supported broad comprehensive initiatives, such as the Community Action Program (CAP) and Model Cities. CAP established community action agencies (CAA) at the local level to combine and redirect a wide range of federal, state, local, and private resources to make a comprehensive attack on poverty. Participation by beneficiaries and decentralization of decision-making were also major elements of the program. As we reported in 1992, the program lacked sufficient authority and political support at the federal and local levels to influence agencies\u2019 practices and improve service delivery.", "Model Cities sought to rebuild deteriorated neighborhoods in selected cities by coordinating the array of resources from assistance programs at all levels of government, particularly in housing, education, health, and transportation. Like CAP, Model Cities attempted to unify these efforts into an interrelated system. The program was administered by city demonstration agencies that were an integral part of city administrations. In retrospect, according to our 1992 report, the results of the Model Cities program were mixed because the program lacked incentives to promote cooperation and consensus on priorities. The Model Cities program was terminated as of January 1975 by the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The act consolidated seven community development categorical grant programs into the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. Federal support and sponsorship for comprehensive efforts slowed after this, and funding for many community development programs declined in the 1980s.", "Meanwhile, the private sector, which had started its own comprehensive effort to revitalize distressed communities, continued to shape the comprehensive approach. The Ford Foundation, early in the 1960s, developed the Gray Areas Project in New Haven, Connecticut. Its purpose was to address the multiple needs of a distressed inner city neighborhood by rehabilitating existing housing, providing new affordable housing, and addressing residents\u2019 social and economic needs.", "Experiences from the private and the federal efforts of the 1960s led to the concept of the Community Development Corporation (CDC). CDCs are private nonprofit organizations that focus their efforts on specific distressed geographic areas. As originally envisioned, these groups emphasized economic and physical development as well as social service delivery. Their boards of directors were composed of residents from the area and representatives of concerned businesses and institutions. CDCs typically entered into partnerships with local governments and corporate entities and relied on both public and private funding. Since the early 1970s, the number of Community-Based Development Organizations\u2014also known as CDCs\u2014has more than tripled, according to a Fannie Mae Foundation study. Studies by the National Congress for Community Economic Development indicate that there are currently at least 2,500 CDCs around the country. However, many of these CDCs do not offer comprehensive services but focus primarily on housing production or economic development.", "As federal involvement in community development declined and private participation grew, entities known as intermediaries evolved to provide CDCs with financial and technical assistance. In 1979, the Ford Foundation created the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC), a national intermediary set up to provide grants, loans, and technical assistance to nonprofit community development organizations. Another prominent national intermediary\u2014the Enterprise Foundation\u2014has focused on strengthening nonprofit housing development groups, forging local housing partnerships, and helping local groups link needed services into housing, as well as on demonstrating creative approaches to community development.", "The federal government also supported the use of national intermediaries. In 1978, the Congress chartered the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC) (42 U.S.C. 8101 et. seq.), a public nonprofit corporation. NRC\u2019s mission included the revitalization of declining lower-income neighborhoods and the provision of affordable housing. NRC works with local organizations that are known collectively as NeighborWorks. There are several different types of NeighborWorks organizations, including Neighborhood Housing Services (NHS). NHSs are partnerships of local business leaders, local government officials, and neighborhood residents that function as NRC\u2019s main vehicle for revitalizing distressed neighborhoods.", "A major new federal initiative to assist urban and rural communities in their revitalization efforts\u2014the Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities (EZ/EC) program\u2014was adopted in 1993 under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. This program promotes the comprehensive revitalization of distressed communities by funding broad, community-based strategic plans. The bulk of the benefits under the program go to nine areas\u2014six urban and three rural\u2014designated as empowerment zones. Considerably fewer benefits are available to the 95 areas\u201465 urban and 30 rural\u2014designated as enterprise communities.", "Although the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Agriculture were responsible for designating the areas, the President also established the Community Enterprise Board\u2014a federal, Cabinet-level entity\u2014to assist in implementing the EZ/EC program. The Board is composed of the Vice President, who serves as its Chair; the President\u2019s assistants for domestic policy and economic policy, who each serve as vice chairs; the secretaries of 10 Cabinet departments; and the heads of several other agencies. In addition, the Board is tasked with advising the President on how federal programs can be better coordinated across agencies to respond to the needs of distressed communities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sources of Funding and Technical Support for Community Development Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Community development initiatives typically rely on a patchwork of different funding and technical support sources from both the public and the private sectors.

Private funding and technical assistance come from a myriad of sources, including intermediaries and foundations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Public Funding and Support", "paragraphs": ["Several federal block grant funding sources are available to community development organizations through state and local governments. Under HUD\u2019s CDBG program, a wide range of neighborhood revitalization activities can be funded. For example, these grants may be used to rehabilitate housing, support economic revitalization projects, and provide public facilities. HUD also offers funding for housing development through the Home Investment Partnership (HOME) program to state and local governments, which may pass a portion of the funds on to eligible housing development organizations. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) makes funds available through the Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) and the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG). The CSBG funds can be used for a range of activities to provide social services, such as emergency assistance, employment assistance, and elderly care. The SSBG funds can also be used for a wide variety of social services, including preventing and treating drug and alcohol abuse and training and employing disadvantaged adults and youth in housing construction and rehabilitation.", "The federal government also provides funding to community organizations through many separate programs operated across federal departments. This funding tends to be categorical\u2014designated for specific activities\u2014and must be applied for in accordance with specific program guidelines. For example, HUD offers funding for homeownership through the Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere (HOPE) program and for assistance to the homeless through the McKinney Act programs. HHS provides grants to local entities to develop and implement projects that create jobs for low-income people in distressed neighborhoods through its Community Initiatives Program. It also provides grants for substance abuse prevention and treatment demonstration projects, among other things. Other agencies\u2014including the Departments of Commerce, Education, Justice, Labor, and Transportation; the Environmental Protection Agency; and the Small Business Administration\u2014operate additional programs that are available to community organizations. In addition, various federal tax credit and loan guarantee programs are available to community organizations.", "Some states and localities administer additional programs and provide grants or loans to community organizations for affordable housing, economic development, and social services. For example, a city government may have its own homeownership program that the community organizations can use. Sometimes, state or local governments provide other types of assistance by donating land or offering to work with lenders to negotiate lower interest rates. In addition, some states and localities provide financing\u2014sometimes tax-exempt\u2014for specific projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Funding and Support", "paragraphs": ["National intermediaries provide grants and loans, technical assistance, and coordination with other organizations.

In addition to raising funds, NRC\u2019s Neighborhood Housing Service helps form local partnerships of residents, governments, and businesses. Local intermediaries also support community organizations by creating support systems, helping to arrange financing, and providing training and other technical assistance.", "Foundations provide funding and assistance in a variety of ways.

Some banks offer loan programs to promote housing, small business, and property development or make below-market-rate mortgage loans for low- and moderate-income housing. Some banks also invest in development projects and local businesses. Businesses and insurance companies have generally contributed to community-based organizations through donations to foundations and intermediaries. However, some businesses work directly with neighborhoods by providing technical support and by donating supplies or products for fund-raising or special events. Other businesses invest by locating their stores or plants in shopping centers or industrial parks within distressed communities.", "Other organizations, such as universities, hospitals, and religious institutions, also support community-based organizations. In some cities, universities and medical centers have teamed up with community-based groups to sponsor neighborhood-based development activities, such as housing rehabilitation or child care.

We neither evaluated these efforts to determine whether they were successful nor compared the comprehensive approach to single-focused approaches. Instead, we examined the history of each organization to find out why it chose a comprehensive approach and studied the major factors that helped and hindered its efforts.

Now, it is largely vacant, in terms of both people and businesses. Burned-out, abandoned, and boarded-up buildings and vacant lots are scattered throughout the neighborhood. In 1984, a local Catholic parish began community outreach efforts that resulted in the establishment of a nonprofit organization\u2014Core City Neighborhoods (CCN)\u2014that collaborates with other local organizations to provide comprehensive services to the neighborhood (see app. II).", "The Dudley Street neighborhood\u2014located about 2 miles south of Boston\u2019s major financial and cultural districts\u2014was once a thriving business and residential district. Over a period of nearly 30 years, the neighborhood was effectively isolated from the rest of the city and experienced financial disinvestment, arson, influxes of poor residents, and illegal garbage dumping. Twenty-seven percent of the households in the neighborhood receive public assistance, compared with 12 percent in Boston as a whole. The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative (DSNI) began in 1984 as a nonprofit community organizing and planning entity. It collaborates with neighborhood residents, nonprofit organizations, foundations, and city agencies to meet its planned housing, economic, and social service objectives (see app. III).", "Located in the northeast/southeast area of Washington, D.C., the Marshall Heights neighborhood was once a thriving African-American middle-class residential and business area. However, since the 1970s the community has suffered as its middle-class residents and businesses have moved out of the area. The community is cut off from the rest of the city by the Anacostia River and Interstate 295. It is home to one-third of the city\u2019s public housing units, yet 38 percent of its residents are homeowners. The Marshall Heights Community Development Organization (MHCDO) is a nonprofit CDC begun in 1978 to concentrate on economic development projects that would lead to self-sufficiency for the area\u2019s residents.

The majority of the community\u2019s small businesses are unstable, marginally profitable, and undercapitalized. The area has the city\u2019s highest living density and lowest household income. Until recently, the Pasadena city government played a limited role in the community, which, for the last 50 years has been socially isolated from the rest of the city. Adding to the sense of isolation, a highway was constructed in the early 1970s, displacing many residents and creating a shortage of affordable housing. The Pasadena Neighborhood Housing Services (PNHS) was formed in 1979 as a nonprofit organization after the city asked for help from the federally chartered NRC.

For example, a 1989 study reported that 81 percent of the families in poverty face two or more obstacles to achieving self-sufficiency. Such obstacles include joblessness, poor education, reliance on welfare, or poor health.", "Furthermore, over half of the families face three or more obstacles. According to an Annie E. Casey Foundation study, the vast assortment of interconnected problems, unmet needs, and disinvestment combine to produce dysfunctional and socially isolated neighborhoods. Another study by the Local Initiatives Support Corporation states that problems in low-income communities such as escalating crime, drug trafficking, joblessness, teen pregnancy and school dropout rates are both the causes and the effects of social disorganization.", "We found that despite the progress made by the organizations we studied, these same problems exist in our case study neighborhoods. Each of these neighborhoods has significantly higher rates of poverty and unemployment and higher proportions of welfare recipients and school dropouts than the city as a whole (see app. I).

They told us that the conditions in the neighborhoods are interrelated and need to be addressed in tandem if long-lasting results are to be achieved.", "An expert on comprehensive approaches does not believe that the comprehensive initiatives were begun in response to research or theory but were rather inspired by the logical appeal of the approach. She said that there has been an increasing recognition of the limits of narrowly defined, categorical strategies. For example, new housing has been built in many distressed communities without much attention having been given to the social problems facing its occupants. Social services have been carried out as if in a vacuum, separate from the conditions in the neighborhood. The expert said that each intervention was governed by a separate bureaucracy without any sense of coordination. In contrast, she said, a comprehensive approach recognizes that the problems in distressed communities are interrelated, and it tries to begin change in a number of areas. For example, she said, rather than addressing just one of a family\u2019s needs, such as housing, a comprehensive organization would also attempt to meet the family\u2019s needs for employment, education, child care, training in parenting skills, or treatment for substance abuse.", "The need to address the interrelated problems in distressed areas through a multifaceted approach is also recognized by researchers, HUD, and HHS. The appeal of the comprehensive approach is that it ensures attention to the interrelationships among the needs of the community by linking human services, physical revitalization, and economic development in a concerted effort, according to a University of Chicago study. A study by the New School for Social Research reported that the problems in distressed communities are \u201ccomplex and multidimensional and require long-term integrative approaches to their solution.\u201d In addition, HUD endorsed the comprehensive approach in its March 1994 publication entitled Strategies for Community Change in which the Secretary wrote, \u201cWe believe the best strategy to community empowerment is a community-driven comprehensive approach which coordinates economic, physical, environmental, community, and human needs.\u201d July 1994 initiatives by HHS\u2019 Administration for Children and Families are also intended to make it easier for community organizations to use HHS programs to meet community needs.", "Dissatisfied with the results of previous single-focused approaches to community revitalization, national organizations and foundations are also emphasizing a comprehensive approach. While they recognize that the comprehensive approach is not new, they said that such approaches are more feasible now than in the past because community organizations have gained experience and an infrastructure for providing funding and technical assistance has evolved. According to the Director of Field Services for the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (NRC), many programs supported by NRC in the past were developed with a housing rehabilitation focus. Over the years, however, the organization has learned that community needs extend beyond housing. As a result, NRC is encouraging its community organizations to make their programs more comprehensive. The Ford Foundation\u2019s Neighborhood and Family Initiative\u2014a multiyear program\u2014uses the comprehensive approach because the foundation believes single-focused approaches to neighborhood problems are not effective in providing for the range of interrelated needs in poor neighborhoods. Additionally, the Annie E. Casey Foundation found that efforts to assist low-income children at risk were insufficient and needed to be augmented with social and economic initiatives that target the whole community. To encourage comprehensive revitalization, the foundation has provided $160,000 in planning grants and is willing to commit up to $3 million to each of five comprehensive organizations that attempt to improve conditions in their neighborhoods, including two of our case study organizations.

For instance, a study by the University of Chicago suggests that many of the earlier community efforts did not achieve their goals because they were initiated by outside organizations and did not involve the residents. A study conducted by Rainbow Research stated that significant community development takes place only when residents are committed to investing themselves and their resources in the effort.

For example, Core City Neighborhoods collaborated with other groups extensively.

In addition, residents and community leaders from all four locations cited an improvement in the physical appearance of the neighborhood and the attitudes of some of the residents. For example, the Marshall Heights community organization believes that it has improved the quality of life for many residents by bringing services to the community. Residents no longer have to take several buses to obtain emergency services or housing assistance outside the community. From one organization, they can obtain emergency food, temporary housing, homeownership assistance, employment referrals, drug abuse prevention and treatment services, advice on starting a small business, and assistance in cleaning up and organizing the neighborhood. Some of these services were not previously available in the community but were developed by the organization over the last decade as it evolved and recognized the many needs of the community. For example, a lack of services for treating drug-addicted residents prompted the organization to create its own treatment center. The center takes a holistic approach and provides a framework for a wide range of prevention, intervention, treatment, and follow-up services and programs (see app. IV).", "The Dudley Street organization emphasized the value of being able to help people improve themselves from whatever level they begin. For example, one person may need access to elderly care only, while another may need assistance in finding affordable housing and child care. Dudley Street\u2019s goal is to help residents organize to gain access to services the community needs, according to the organization\u2019s executive director (see app. III). In Pasadena, the director of a program for potential small business owners described a number of outcomes from the program that go beyond the acquisition of business skills. Some participants reassess and replace their initial business ideas, others succeed in getting jobs, while some return to school. The director believes that for many of the participants, the motivational benefits gained from learning to organize efforts in pursuit of a goal are often more important than the economic benefits (see app. V).", "However, each organization stressed that its efforts would require a sustained commitment over a long period of time because of the magnitude of the problems being addressed. The Core City organization in Detroit has developed a 50-year strategic plan, anticipating that the neighborhood\u2019s revitalization will take a considerable amount of time (see app. II). The executive director of the Pasadena organization pointed out that because the housing stock is older and the population transient, the need for housing rehabilitation and social services will be ongoing.", "Figure 2.2 depicts conditions before and after cleanup and/or renovation in our four case study neighborhoods.

Such diversity makes generalization difficult. Second, the results of much of the work these groups do\u2014community outreach, counseling, and referral\u2014are difficult to measure or quantify. According to a University of Chicago study, traditional evaluations are rarely designed to measure the depth and complexity of factors occurring at the neighborhood level or to relate the cause and effect of changes over time. As a result, existing evaluations of these efforts generally focus on tangible benefits, such as the number of goods and services produced, rather than intangible benefits, such as building self-esteem, pride, and hope within the community.", "The few formal evaluations that have been completed for the four organizations we reviewed were requested and funded by outside organizations. For example, as a prerequisite for participating in an operating support initiative, LISC required and funded an evaluation of the Marshall Heights organization by a consulting firm in 1992. The evaluation pointed out success factors (holistic vision, strong leadership) and weaknesses (inability to integrate programs) and made several recommendations to the organization. The Pasadena organization is evaluated quarterly by its parent organization, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation. These evaluations focus on financial and program performance. The Annie E.

A resident in one of the communities we studied said that people were afraid to speak up in community meetings about problems such as drug dealing in their neighborhoods because they were afraid of retaliation.", "According to these officials, neighborhood conditions and the failures of past community development efforts to address the needs of residents were largely to blame for residents\u2019 feelings. At each case study location, conditions had declined as many middle-class residents and the businesses that served them moved out. Subsequently, poverty increased and related problems grew in these areas (see app. I). Physical isolation from the rest of the city and reductions in both private and public services also affected several locations.

One of the locations contained 2,995 public housing units\u2014one-third of the city\u2019s total units\u2014784 of which were vacant as of January 1994.

However, he said that without reducing the concentration of public housing units by creating mixed-income developments, it would be hard to end the feelings of isolation experienced by public housing residents.

For example, one organization decided not to apply for a community development initiative loan from HUD because it did not believe that the repayment term was realistic for the planned project. Another organization does not use federal funding for some of its programs because beneficiaries would be required to meet stricter eligibility standards than the organization deems reasonable. A third organization intended to use funds from HUD\u2019s Nehemiah Grants program to support its development of new homes in the community.However, since mortgages supported by a program grant could not be assumed by future homebuyers, the organization could not ensure that the housing would be kept affordable for future homebuyers. Because of this restriction, the organization decided not to accept the funding.", "In response to these problems, each of the four organizations we reviewed developed diverse funding sources to support its programs. All four organizations used funding from federal, state, and local programs and received support from foundations and corporations. Overall, the organizations relied on public funding for about 30 to 60 percent of their budgets. Much of this funding was obtained through CDBG or CSBG\u2014two relatively flexible federal grant programs. The organizations credited these programs with providing a long-term stream of funding for a wide range of services.

These include CDBG, Emergency Shelter Grants, HOME Investment Partnerships, and Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS. The proposed rule would also consolidate the reporting requirements for these programs, requiring one performance report instead of several program-specific reports. Other agencies that have taken steps to consolidate programs include HHS, Education, and Labor. However, according to OMB officials and public policy researchers, a significant reduction in the level of program fragmentation has historically been difficult to achieve because of the congressional subcommittee structure, the protectiveness of agencies toward their programs, and the strong support of constituent groups for particular programs. Nonetheless, HUD has announced plans, pending congressional approval, to consolidate 60 of its major programs into 3 flexible performance-based funds.
