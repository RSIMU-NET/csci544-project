DHS needs to continue to show sustained leadership commitment in implementing its Integrated Strategy for High-Risk Management to achieve the remaining outcomes. Leadership commitment is also pivotal in addressing other GAO high-risk areas where DHS has a role, such as ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation, the National Flood Insurance Program, and limiting the federal government's fiscal exposure by better managing climate change risks. Currently, DHS has acting officials serving in eight positions requiring Senate confirmation, including positions with responsibilities for implementing high-risk outcomes, such as the Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and Under Secretary for Management.", "a \u201cMostly addressed\u201d: Progress is significant and a small amount of work remains.", "b \u201cPartially addressed\u201d: Progress is measurable, but significant work remains.", "c \u201cInitiated\u201d: Activities have been initiated to address the outcome, but it is too early to report progress.", "In April 2019, GAO sent a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security detailing 26 open recommendations that GAO believes warrant the highest priority personal attention from the department and its components. These 26 recommendations fall into six major areas\u2014emergency preparedness and response, border security, transportation security, infrastructure and management, cybersecurity, and chemical and nuclear security. For example, GAO has recommended that DHS take steps to strengthen human capital management, such as better managing and assessing its cybersecurity workforce gaps and areas of critical need.

As you know, when  DHS began operations in 2003, department leadership faced the daunting  task of transforming 22 agencies\u2014several with major management  challenges\u2014into one department. At that time, we recognized that the  creation of DHS was an enormous undertaking that could take years to  implement. Failure to effectively address management challenges could  have serious national security consequences. In 2003, shortly after the  department was formed, we designated Implementing and Transforming  DHS as a high-risk area to the federal government. Today, the work to  strengthen DHS management continues.", "DHS has made considerable progress in transforming its original  component agencies into a single cabinet-level department. As a result, in  2013, we narrowed the scope of the high-risk area to focus on  strengthening DHS management functions (i.e., acquisition management,  information technology management, financial management, human  capital management, and management integration) and changed the  name of the high-risk area to Strengthening DHS Management Functions  to reflect this focus. Over the last 16 years, leadership commitment has  been a key factor in DHS\u2019s progress toward implementing our criteria for  removal from the High Risk List. It remains essential for DHS to maintain  top leadership support and sustained commitment to ensure continued  progress.", "In addition to addressing its management functions high-risk area, DHS  leadership is responsible for implementing numerous recommendations  that we have made to the department and its component agencies. Since  DHS began operations in 2003, we have made about 2,800  recommendations, and DHS has implemented more than 75 percent of  them, thereby strengthening program management and performance  measurement, among other things. In April 2019, we sent a letter to the  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security detailing 26 open  recommendations that we deem highest priority for implementation.  Given that these recommendations are often the most complex and  difficult to implement, top DHS leadership will play an important role in the  actions to address these recommendations.", "Current vacancies in top leadership positions could pose a challenge to  addressing high-risk areas and priority recommendations that span DHS\u2019s  diverse missions, which include preventing terrorism and enhancing  security, managing our borders, administering immigration laws, securing  cyberspace, and responding to disasters. Based on information we have  received from DHS in compliance with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act  of 1998 (Vacancies Act), there are currently acting officials serving in  eight positions requiring Senate confirmation. Specifically, as of April 26,  2019, the following positions remain vacant: Secretary (16 days), Deputy  Secretary (377 days), Under Secretary for Management (16 days), Under  Secretary for Science and Technology (826 days), Director of U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) (826 days), Administrator of  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) (50 days), Chief  Financial Officer (826 days), and Inspector General (512 days).", "Filling vacancies\u2014including top DHS leadership positions and the heads  of operational components\u2014with confirmed appointees, as applicable,  could help to ensure continued leadership commitment across all of  DHS\u2019s mission areas. Although the department was formed as part of a  determined national effort to safeguard the United States against  terrorism, department leaders must execute all of the department\u2019s  missions. For example, Hurricane Katrina in 2005, one of the largest  natural disasters in our nation\u2019s history, refocused attention on the  importance of DHS\u2019s role in providing the coordinated, comprehensive  federal response in the event of a natural disaster. In addition, DHS  focuses efforts on cybersecurity because cyber-based intrusions and  attacks on federal systems and systems supporting our nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure are evolving and becoming more sophisticated, such as the  significant 2015 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data breaches  that affected 21.5 million individuals. Such examples demonstrate the  range of threats that DHS leaders must be prepared to address.", "With DHS\u2019s wide-ranging missions, DHS leadership also has a pivotal  role in addressing other DHS-specific and government-wide areas on our  high-risk list. Specifically, DHS is responsible for addressing a high-risk  area related to FEMA\u2019s management of the National Flood Insurance  Program. DHS and FEMA will also play key roles in the high-risk area of  Limiting the Federal Government's Fiscal Exposure by Better Managing  Climate Change Risks. Additionally, DHS has a key role in ensuring  cybersecurity of the nation. For example, DHS has established the  National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center, which  functions as the 24/7 cyber monitoring, incident response, and  management center for the federal civilian government. Further, DHS has  a nexus and responsibilities in several of our other government-wide,  high-risk areas including (1) improving management of information  technology acquisitions and operations, (2) strategic human capital  management, (3) managing federal real property, and (4) the  government-wide security clearance process.", "My statement today discusses the need for DHS\u2019s continued leadership  commitment to (1) strengthen its management functions and (2) address  our priority recommendations. This statement is based on our 2019 high- risk update and other reports we issued from March 2006 through April  2019. For these products we analyzed DHS strategies and other  documents related to the department\u2019s efforts to address its high-risk  areas and interviewed DHS officials, among other things. More detailed  information on the scope and methodology of our prior work can be found  within each specific report. We conducted the work on which this  statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Top Leadership Commitment Is Critical to Sustained Progress in Strengthening Management Functions", "paragraphs": ["With top leadership support and commitment, DHS has made important  progress in strengthening its management functions, but considerable  work remains. As shown in figure 1, as of March 2019, DHS had met  three out of five criteria for removal from our High Risk List\u2014leadership  commitment, action planning, and monitoring progress.", "DHS has partially met the remaining two criteria: capacity (i.e., people  and other resources) and demonstrated, sustained progress. To address  the criteria for capacity, DHS needs to make additional progress in  identifying and allocating resources in certain areas\u2014namely, acquisition,  information technology, and financial management\u2014to fully demonstrate  its capacity. For the criteria for demonstrated, sustained progress, we  reported in March 2019 that DHS had fully addressed 17 out of the 30  outcomes that are the basis for gauging DHS\u2019s progress across  management areas, as shown in table 1.", "To fully meet the criteria for demonstrated, sustained progress, DHS  needs to continue implementing its Integrated Strategy for High-Risk  Management and maintain engagement with us to show measurable,  sustainable progress in implementing corrective actions and achieving  outcomes. DHS can accomplish this by, among other things, maintaining  a high level of top leadership support and sustained commitment to  ensure continued progress in executing its corrective actions through  completion, and increasing employee engagement and morale.", "Examples of important programs and remaining work in the key  management functions include:  In the key management function of human capital management, DHS  leadership is needed to address skills gaps that have had a significant  role in the DHS management high-risk area. For example, we have  found that DHS lacks guidance on how to identify critical cybersecurity  and acquisition skills needed to support its new information  technology delivery model. We have also found that DHS has  insufficient technical skills to support its biometric identification  services program. Addressing these skill gaps could help DHS fully  demonstrate its capacity to strengthen and integrate its management  functions.", "Additionally, within human capital management, DHS has struggled  with low employee morale scores since it began operations in 2003.  DHS\u2019s 2018 score ranked 20th among 20 large and very large federal  agencies. Increasing employee engagement and morale is critical to  strengthening DHS\u2019s mission and management functions. DHS has  continued to strengthen its employee engagement efforts by  implementing our 2012 recommendation to establish metrics of  success within components\u2019 action plans for addressing its employee  satisfaction problems. Further, DHS has conducted audits to better  ensure components are basing hiring decisions and promotions on  human capital competencies. In addition, OPM\u2019s 2018 Federal  Employee Viewpoint Survey data showed that in the past 2 years,  DHS\u2019s score on the Employee Engagement Index (EEI) increased by  4 points\u2014from 56 in 2016 to 60 in 2018\u2014which was 1 point more  than the government-wide increase over the same period. While this  improvement is notable, DHS\u2019s current EEI score is 1 point below its  EEI baseline score in 2010, suggesting that DHS is still working to  regain lost ground after an 8 point drop between 2010 and 2015.", "In the key management function of financial management, DHS  officials have faced challenges modernizing DHS components\u2019  financial management systems and business processes that affect the  department\u2019s ability to have ready access to timely and reliable  information for informed decision-making. Effectively modernizing  financial management systems for the Coast Guard, FEMA, and ICE  would help improve the reliability of their financial reporting.", "As we have reported, perhaps the single most important element of  successful management improvement and transformation initiatives is the  demonstrated commitment of top leaders, as shown by their personal  involvement in reform efforts. With regard to leadership commitment,  DHS\u2019s top leadership, including leaders at the Secretary and Deputy  Secretary level, has demonstrated exemplary commitment and support  for addressing the department\u2019s management challenges. They have also  taken actions to institutionalize this commitment to help ensure the long- term success of the department\u2019s efforts. One such effort is the Under  Secretary for Management\u2019s Integrated Priorities initiative to strengthen  the integration of DHS\u2019s business operations across the department.", "During monthly leadership meetings with the Under Secretary for  Management, the department\u2019s Chief Executive Officers have been  providing status updates on their respective actions to address this high- risk designation. Furthermore, top DHS leaders, such as the Under  Secretary for Management and the department\u2019s Chief Executive  Officers, routinely meet with our management to discuss progress on  high-risk areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continued Leadership Commitment Is Critical to Addressing Priority Open Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In April 2019, we sent a letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland  Security detailing 26 open recommendations that we deem highest  priority for implementation. Priority recommendations are those that we  believe warrant priority personal attention from heads of key departments  or agencies. These 26 recommendations fall into six major areas\u2014 emergency preparedness and response, border security, transportation  security, infrastructure and management, cybersecurity, and chemical  and nuclear security. Many of these recommendations cut across DHS\u2019s  mission areas that are critical for national security. Given that these  recommendations are often the most complex and difficult to implement,  top DHS leadership will play a critical role in addressing them.", "Fourteen of the 26 priority open recommendations we identified in the  April 2019 letter are directed to acting officials serving in vacant positions.  We have issued 12 recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland  Security who is currently an acting official. We have also issued two  recommendations to FEMA which is currently operating under acting  leadership.", "Committed and consistent leadership at the department and component  levels will be critical for addressing our priority recommendations.

We also recommended in September 2012 that  FEMA develop a methodology to better assess a jurisdiction's  capability to respond to and recover from a disaster without federal  assistance. In July 2015, we further recommended that the  Mitigation Framework Leadership Group establish an investment  strategy to identify, prioritize, and guide federal investments in  disaster resilience. Implementing these actions could limit the  federal government\u2019s fiscal exposure and increase the nation\u2019s  resilience to extreme weather events as the costs and impacts of  weather disasters resulting from floods, drought, and other events are  expected to increase in significance as previously \u201crare\u201d events  become more common and intense.", "In July 2018, we recommended that U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP) analyze the costs associated with future barrier  segments along the southwest border and include cost as a factor in  the Impedance and Denial Prioritization Strategy. Obtaining this key  information could help CBP evaluate designs and prioritize locations  for future border barrier segments to deter cross-border illegal  activity.", "In February 2017, we recommended that DHS establish metrics and  methods by which to evaluate the performance of DHS\u2019s National  Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center in relation to its  statutorily-required cybersecurity functions. Until it develops metrics  and methods to evaluate its performance, the center cannot ensure  that it is effectively meeting its statutory requirements, while cyber- based intrusions and attacks on federal systems and systems  supporting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure are becoming more  numerous, damaging, and disruptive. We also recommended in  February 2018 that DHS take steps to better manage and assess its  cybersecurity workforce gaps and areas of critical need.
