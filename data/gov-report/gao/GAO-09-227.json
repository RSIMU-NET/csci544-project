The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) administers BSA and relies on multiple federal and state agencies to ensure financial institution compliance. GAO was asked to (1) describe how BSA compliance and enforcement responsibilities are distributed, (2) describe how agencies other than FinCEN are implementing those responsibilities and evaluate their coordination efforts, and (3) evaluate how FinCEN is implementing its BSA responsibilities. Among other things, GAO reviewed legislation, past GAO and Treasury reports, and agreements and guidance from all relevant agencies; and interviewed agency, association, and financial institution officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN is responsible for the administration of the BSA regulatory structure, and has delegated examination responsibility to the federal banking regulators (Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, and National Credit Union Administration), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The federal banking regulators, SEC, CFTC, securities and futures self-regulatory organizations (SRO), and state agencies also have their own separate authorities to examine for compliance among institutions they supervise and take enforcement actions for noncompliance. FinCEN has retained enforcement authority for BSA and may take enforcement actions independently or concurrently with the regulators. While federal agencies have enhanced their BSA compliance programs, opportunities exist to improve interagency and state examination coordination. The federal banking regulators issued an interagency examination manual; SEC, CFTC, and their respective SROs developed BSA examination modules; and FinCEN and IRS, which examines nonbank financial institutions (NBFI), issued an examination manual for money services businesses (MSB). However, IRS has not fully coordinated MSB examination schedules with the states that also examine MSBs, potentially missing opportunities to reduce duplication and leverage resources. The federal financial regulators traditionally have different compliance approaches for their industries. With respect to BSA, multiple regulators are examining for compliance with the same legislation across industries and, for some larger holding companies, within the same institution. However, they do not have a mechanism through which all regulators discuss (without industry present) how to promote greater consistency, reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, and identify concerns across industries. Federal banking regulators reported improved transparency and coordination of enforcement actions. While FinCEN has increased regulatory resources, provided examination support, and made advances in outreach, it could improve its informationsharing efforts. FinCEN improved its system for tracking referrals but lack of a process for communication between IRS and FinCEN for IRS referrals, coupled with IRS's limited enforcement authority, may delay timely feedback to IRS-examined institutions. FinCEN completed more information-sharing memorandums of understanding (MOU) with federal and state agencies, but did not sign its MOU with CFTC until January 2009, which limited their information-sharing efforts. Some state regulators and securities and futures regulators continue to have no electronic access to BSA data. Lack of direct access to BSA data impedes their ability to identify potential risk areas on which to focus their examinations and effectively leverage resources. FinCEN officials said they finalized a data-access template in July 2008, and had begun providing more electronic access."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The legislative framework for combating money laundering and other  financial crimes has been built over nearly four decades. The Bank  Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA) established reporting and other anti-money  laundering (AML) requirements for domestic financial institutions. Due to  the increased sophistication of money laundering activities and concerns  about terrorist financing, Congress expanded AML legislation to cover  more types of institutions involved in a broader range of financial  transactions. In 2001, the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act  strengthened reporting and AML requirements for securities firms, futures  firms, money services businesses (MSB), and other financial institutions.  The regulators discussed in this report have developed programs to review  financial institutions\u2019 compliance with these reporting requirements and  AML requirements.", "Multiple federal and state agencies operate within the BSA framework.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the  U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), is the BSA administrator. The  federal financial regulators that compose the BSA compliance framework  are the federal banking regulators\u2014the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),  the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the National Credit Union  Administration (NCUA)\u2014as well as the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission  (CFTC). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has examination  responsibilities under BSA. To different extents, four of the federal  banking regulators\u2014the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and NCUA\u2014share  compliance responsibilities, such as examinations of institutions that they  oversee, with state regulators. IRS, which oversees BSA/AML compliance  among some state-chartered institutions, such as MSBs, also shares  responsibilities with state regulators. The self-regulatory organizations  (SRO) that SEC and CFTC oversee also have BSA/AML compliance  responsibilities for the activities of their members. Appendix II of this  report provides an overview of the missions and compliance and  enforcement activities of these entities and provides information on their  BSA/AML-related resources and training.", "As we have reported previously, FinCEN and these agencies have  responded to the challenge of increased BSA/AML responsibilities by  finalizing new regulations to implement the USA PATRIOT Act and  applying them to industries newer to BSA/AML efforts. In addition, the  federal banking regulators, FinCEN, and SEC have taken enforcement  actions involving BSA/AML-related violations that resulted in large  penalties. But, as BSA regulation has evolved, so have financial services  firms. They generally have become fewer in number and larger\u2014providing  more and varied services and products across one or more traditional  financial sectors (banking, securities, futures, and insurance). The  proliferation of activities across industry lines also has made it all the  more important that agencies with compliance-monitoring and  enforcement responsibilities coordinate with each other. Given that many  regulators and SROs have responsibility for overseeing compliance with  BSA, Congress has raised questions about how effectively FinCEN and  these entities are coordinating their BSA/AML efforts and the general  soundness of the current BSA compliance and enforcement framework.", "In response to your request that we review FinCEN and other federal  agencies\u2019 efforts to implement BSA, we (1) describe how BSA compliance  and enforcement efforts are distributed among federal and state  regulators, SROs, and FinCEN; (2) describe how federal agencies other  than FinCEN are implementing their BSA activities and evaluate their  coordination efforts; and (3) evaluate how FinCEN is executing its BSA  responsibilities and coordinating BSA efforts among the various agencies.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed relevant federal legislation and  prior GAO and Treasury Inspector General reports, and conducted  interviews with FinCEN, federal banking regulators, SEC, CFTC, IRS, and  Department of Justice (Justice) officials. We reviewed BSA compliance  and enforcement guidance from all relevant agencies, memorandums of  understanding (MOU), training documentation, staffing and performance  measurement data, strategic plans and annual reports, and internal  documentation. We also reviewed our collaboration best practices\u2014which  encompass a set of key practices that can help agencies enhance and  sustain collaborative efforts. Furthermore, we interviewed officials from  selected state banking agencies (based on factors such as geography and  types of financial activities within their states) and SROs, and officials  from associations representing banking, credit unions, MSBs, securities,  and futures industries, as well as a state regulatory association. We also  interviewed officials from 20 depository institutions, 8 securities firms,  and 2 futures firms. For the depository institutions, we interviewed all 5  institutions that had the largest number of suspicious activity report (SAR)  filings and randomly selected the remaining 15 based on their number of  SAR filings in calendar year 2007.

With the passage of the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, for the first  time financial institutions were required to maintain records and reports  determined to be useful to financial regulators and law enforcement  agencies in criminal, tax, and regulatory matters. BSA has three main  objectives: create an investigative audit trail through regulatory reporting  standards; impose civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance; and  improve the detection of criminal, tax, and regulatory violations.", "The reporting system first implemented under BSA was insufficient to  combat underlying money laundering activity. For example, before 1986,  BSA did not contain sanctions for money laundering, although it did  contain sanctions for failing to file reports or for doing so untruthfully. To  strengthen federal AML initiatives, Congress enacted the Money  Laundering Control Act of 1986. In addition to imposing criminal liability  for money laundering violations, the act directed each federal banking  regulator to require that insured depository institutions establish and  maintain a program that would ensure and monitor compliance with the  recording-keeping and reporting requirements of BSA.", "The Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 amended BSA and  authorized Treasury to require financial institutions to report any  suspicious transaction relevant to a possible violation of a law or  regulation. It authorized Treasury to require financial institutions to carry  out AML programs and, together with the Federal Reserve, to promulgate  record-keeping rules relating to funds transfer transactions. The act also  made the operation of an unlicensed, money-transmitting business illegal  under state law a crime.", "In 1994, the Secretary of the Treasury delegated overall authority for  enforcement of, and compliance with, BSA and its implementing  regulations to the Director of FinCEN. FinCEN was established within  Treasury in 1990 initially to support law enforcement by providing a  government-wide financial intelligence and analysis network, and became  a bureau in 2001. Among its current responsibilities, FinCEN issues  regulations; collects, analyzes, and maintains BSA-related reports and  information filed by financial institutions; makes those reports available to  law enforcement and regulators; and tries to ensure financial institution  compliance through enforcement actions. According to its strategic plan,  FinCEN seeks to ensure the effectiveness of the BSA regulatory  framework and facilitate interagency collaboration. FinCEN\u2019s RPPD is  responsible for BSA regulatory, compliance, and enforcement functions. In  August 2004, FinCEN created an Office of Compliance in RPPD to oversee  and work with the federal financial regulators on BSA examination and  compliance matters.", "The most recent expansion of BSA legislation occurred in October 2001  with enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act. Among other things, the act  required an entity defined in BSA as a \u201cfinancial institution\u201d to have an  AML program. Each program must incorporate: (1) written AML  compliance internal policies, procedures, and internal controls; (2) an  independent review; (3) a designated compliance person to coordinate and  monitor day-to-day compliance; and (4) training for appropriate personnel.  Entities not previously required under BSA to have such a program, such  as mutual funds, broker-dealers, MSBs, certain futures brokers, and  insurance companies, were required to do so under this act. Moreover,  the act mandated that Treasury issue regulations requiring registered  securities brokers-dealers to file SARs and provided Treasury with  authority to prescribe regulations requiring certain futures firms to submit  SARs. Among its other provisions, the act required that Treasury issue  regulations setting forth minimum standards for financial institutions  regarding verifying the identity of customers who open accounts. The USA  PATRIOT Act also required that financial institutions establish due  diligence and, in some cases, enhanced due diligence policies designed to  detect and report instances of money laundering through private banking  and correspondent accounts of non-United States persons; conduct  enhanced scrutiny of private banking accounts maintained by or on behalf  of foreign political figures or their families; and share information relating  to money laundering and terrorism with law enforcement authorities,  regulatory authorities, and financial institutions. In addition, nonfinancial  institutions also became subject to BSA currency transaction reporting  (CTR) requirements where, in the course of trade or business, the business  receives more than $10,000 in coins or currency in one transaction (or two  or more related transactions)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FinCEN Administers the BSA Framework, under which Many Regulatory Entities Exercise Delegated and Independent Compliance and Enforcement Authorities", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of U.S. financial services regulation are pursued by a  complex combination of federal and state government agencies and SROs.

The Federal  Reserve, FDIC, OTS, and NCUA alternate or conduct joint safety and  soundness examinations\u2014including a BSA/AML component\u2014with state  regulators, generally using the same examination procedures (shown  earlier in table 1). As recently as 2004, about one-third of state banking  departments reported not examining for BSA compliance; however, they  have taken a more active role in conducting these reviews more recently.

Consistent with this framework, SEC and CFTC regulate their  industries in part through oversight of SROs. SEC and CFTC have  authority under the Securities Exchange Act and the Commodity  Exchange Act, respectively, to inspect the books and records of firms that  they supervise.

Unlike the other  federal agencies with regulatory functions, IRS does not have independent  authority to conduct BSA examinations. Rather, under delegation of  examination authority from FinCEN, IRS examines any financial  institution not subject to BSA examination by the federal financial  regulators. Thus, institutions that IRS examines include MSBs; casinos  and card clubs; dealers of precious metals, stones, and jewels; and certain  insurance companies. IRS\u2019s Small Business/Self-Employed Division, which  reports directly to the Deputy Commissioner for Services and  Enforcement, conducts BSA compliance examinations of these types of  NBFIs. In 2004, IRS created the Office of BSA/Fraud within the division to  focus on BSA examinations of NBFIs.

In 2005, the federal banking  regulators, in collaboration with FinCEN, published the Federal Financial  Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) BSA/AML Examination Manual,  which was updated in 2006 and 2007. The manual provides an overview of  BSA compliance program requirements and guidance on identifying and  controlling money laundering and other illegal financial activities; presents  risk management expectations and sound practices for industry; and  identifies examination procedures. All federal and state banking regulators  use this manual when conducting BSA/AML examinations, whether they  are joint or independent examinations. As mentioned previously, the  Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OTS will conduct (on an alternating basis)  independent or joint examinations with state agencies. NCUA conducts  examinations at all federally chartered credit unions, while state  supervisory authorities conduct BSA examinations at all state-chartered  credit unions. Depending upon the risks, NCUA may conduct joint  examinations with the state authorities at the state-chartered credit  unions. OCC supervises nationally chartered banks and federal branches  of foreign banks and therefore does not share jurisdiction with state  banking regulators. Both federal and state examiners said that the manual  helped increase the consistency of examinations among the regulators.", "Federal banking regulators also generally share BSA/AML examination  workpapers and findings with their state counterparts in cases where they  share regulatory jurisdiction over an institution. For example, NCUA  officials said that their findings are shared with states to coordinate their  reports on joint examinations. State officials we interviewed concurred,  stating that they share workpapers in cases where they have federal  regulatory counterparts. Several industry officials we interviewed also  thought that the federal banking regulators collaborated well with other  federal banking regulators on their examinations.", "The new examination manual also has improved the consistency and  transparency of examinations by providing a framework for examinations,  requiring risk assessments and transaction testing, and providing publicly  available examination procedures for banks. For example, the manual lists  requirements for examination scoping and transaction testing. Officials  from one state regulator said the manual has helped answer questions for  institutions and regulators, and helped institutions structure their AML  programs. All of the federal banking regulators and most of the state  banking regulators and banking associations we interviewed consider the  process of gathering data for banks and the risk-assessment component of  the manual beneficial. As one regulator said, the manual helps an  examiner understand an institution\u2019s products and services and the steps  the institution took to mitigate risks. Most industry officials we  interviewed thought the manual provided more consistency to and clearer  guidance about the examination process.", "While regulators and industry officials said that the manual has been  beneficial overall, some banking regulator and industry association  officials said that initially it sometimes resulted in longer examinations or  additional procedures. Federal Reserve examiners noted that it is  important for examiners to apply the risk-based approach, using the  minimum procedures where appropriate, and to utilize work previously  done by a bank\u2019s independent audit, where possible. Similarly, NCUA  examiners added that initially the manual resulted in some expanded  examinations. However, by using the risk-based approach they are able to  focus their resources on the highest areas of risk. Federal Reserve officials  added that as examiners have become more familiar with the manual since  its adoption, the amount of background reading that examiners need to do  in preparing for a BSA/AML examination has decreased. Some officials  from the institutions we interviewed were less concerned with the length  of the examinations than with some examiners interpreting the manual\u2019s  requirements too literally or having expectations beyond those expressed  in the manual. For example, an official from one large bank said that when  the manual was first implemented, regulators were examining \u201cvery close  to the manual\u201d and interpreted it literally instead of conducting their  examinations based on risk. In another case, an official from one small  bank that files very few SARs noted that in recent examinations,  examiners unnecessarily focused on the bank\u2019s record keeping and  whether SAR reports were filed on time.", "FFIEC serves as the mechanism for the banking regulators to develop  interagency BSA/AML guidance for examiners and the industry. FFIEC is  also the forum in which banking regulators and FinCEN discuss and draft  manual revisions. In addition to its role in developing the manual, the  FFIEC BSA/AML Working Group is an interagency group through which  the banking regulators develop joint examiner training, such as the AML  Workshop and Advanced BSA/AML Specialists Conference. FinCEN  officials said that FinCEN specialists also teach at these workshops. Both  federal and state banking examiners participate in FFIEC AML workshops  and other training sessions offered through their agencies or vendors. In  interagency working groups, participants share their knowledge of and  experiences with BSA, which federal banking regulator officials have said  helped them work toward achieving consistency in their examination  processes. Federal banking regulators also train examiners within their  own agencies on the new manual.", "As a check on their examination programs, including their BSA/AML  examination programs, the federal banking regulators conduct quality  assurance reviews. The regulators\u2019 quality assurance reviews that we  examined, which were conducted from 2005 through 2008, indicated that  banking examiners were implementing BSA/AML compliance  appropriately, with some minor exceptions. For example, reviews from  one regulator noted that examiner staff were well trained, devoted  significant attention to BSA/AML issues, and generally had well-organized  workpapers. Reviews from a second regulator found that examiners  complied with BSA/AML guidance, quality control processes were  satisfactory, processes for determining enforcement actions and making  referrals to FinCEN were sufficient, SAR reviews were timely, and  communication between the regulator\u2019s headquarters and regions was  strong. Another regulator concluded that its examiners demonstrated  strong compliance with all issued national and regional guidance for BSA  examinations, and found adequate internal controls, no material  weaknesses in workpapers, and adequate supervisory and examination  resources for evaluating BSA compliance. While reviews generally were  positive, they also noted some weaknesses. One regulator recommended  that a regional office develop a process for a quality assurance group to  periodically review workpapers on a risk-focused basis because of the  complexity of the FFIEC BSA/AML examination procedures and also  expressed concern about turnover of qualified staff. A second regulator  noted a lack of both independent testing and identification of high-risk  accounts in one region, and inappropriate recording of a BSA violation in a  second region.

SEC staff explained that  BSA/AML examinations of mutual funds are more complex than  examinations of broker-dealers because mutual funds do not have their  own employees and are managed by investment advisors. Registered  investment advisors are rated according to the risk they manage, and those  with a higher risk profile are examined more frequently. SEC annually  completes approximately 100 mutual fund examinations covering BSA  issues.", "Working through the Joint Audit Committee, the futures SROs developed a  common, nonpublic BSA/AML examination module, which the futures  SROs (except NFA) use in their BSA/AML examinations. The Joint Audit  Committee updates the BSA module annually and submits the module to  CFTC. Unlike SEC, CFTC had not provided the examination modules to  FinCEN for its review because the agencies did not have an information- sharing MOU in place until January 2009. (We discuss MOUs in more detail  later in this report.) However, CFTC and FinCEN officials informally have  discussed procedures the futures SROs use during their BSA/AML  examinations.", "In lieu of making examination modules public, SEC, CFTC, and their SROs  offer public BSA guidance and education through various methods and  venues, including the Internet and industry conferences. For example,  SEC developed BSA \u201csource tools\u201d for broker-dealers and mutual funds,  which compile key laws, rules, and guidance and provide regulatory  contact information. The tools are available on SEC\u2019s Web site. Securities  SROs also provide training and update members on BSA/AML rules and  guidance. In addition, FINRA has developed an AML program template for  small firms on its Web site that provides possible language for procedures,  instructions, and relevant rules and Web sites, among other information.  Similarly, CFTC provides information on BSA/AML requirements on its  Web site and participates in industry conference panels and outreach  efforts with other regulators (in particular foreign regulators). In addition,  futures SROs also may provide training, send members updates on new  BSA/AML rules and guidance, and participate in industry conference  panels to help educate institutions on BSA/AML. For example, NFA  provides Web-based training and an AML questionnaire for futures  commission merchants and introducing brokers. Overall, industry  representatives have been complimentary about the information and  education provided by SEC, CFTC, and their SROs; however, they still  expressed a desire to have BSA/AML examination modules made public.", "SEC, CFTC, and their SROs also have coordinated on multiple-regulator  and cross-industry examination issues because many institutions can be  registered with more than one SRO or join more than one exchange. For  example, broker-dealers can be members of more than one securities SRO.  FINRA (which conducts almost 90 percent of broker-dealer examinations)  meets with other securities SROs to coordinate examination schedules  and ensure that all broker-dealers are covered by examinations. FINRA  also has several regulatory agreements to conduct work on behalf of other  SROs. In the futures industry, futures commission merchants must be  members of NFA and may be clearing members of more than one contract  market. Therefore, the Joint Audit Committee assigns an SRO to be the  lead regulator, responsible for conducting examinations for each firm with  multiple memberships. Examination reports and findings are shared  among futures industry SROs where the firm is a member.", "Some of the largest SEC-registered broker-dealers also may be registered  as futures commission merchants or introducing brokers on futures  exchanges. In these instances, FINRA and futures SROs may coordinate  informally on BSA/AML examinations of any futures firms that are  registered dually as securities broker-dealers. As part of FINRA\u2019s  information-sharing agreement with NFA, the two SROs meet at least  quarterly to share examination results and schedules. Other futures  industry SROs obtain FINRA examination results on an as-needed basis.  Futures SRO officials said that (1) if FINRA examined an institution\u2019s AML  program in the last 6 months and reported no major findings and (2) the  institution used the same BSA officer and procedures for its securities and  futures business, then SRO officials might refrain from conducting the full  range of their examination activities. Finally, SEC, CFTC, and the  securities and futures SROs participate in Intermarket Surveillance Group  meetings.", "In addition to working together to help promote consistency in  examinations, securities and futures regulators also have programs and  procedures\u2014similar to the quality assurance reviews of the federal  banking regulators\u2014to review examinations or specific issues. For  instance, SEC staff told us that liaisons to each of SEC\u2019s regional offices  conduct a quarterly review of a representative sample of examinations  reports that include AML findings. They added that SEC reviews the  examination reports to ensure that AML findings are sufficiently supported  and conclusions are valid. SEC staff conducts periodic inspections of  FINRA\u2019s overall BSA/AML examination program. The purpose of these  inspections is to identify any systemic deficiencies or trends in FINRA\u2019s  BSA/AML program. During previous SEC inspections, SEC and FINRA  staff said that SEC identified a few BSA/AML-related deficiencies in  specific FINRA examinations. FINRA officials stated that while SEC found  isolated weaknesses in some examinations, these findings did not indicate  any significant trends. FINRA officials stated they use findings from SEC\u2019s  reviews to identify areas for additional training. Similar to SEC, CFTC  conducts reviews of SROs\u2019 examinations, in which CFTC staff review SRO  examinations to ensure they are appropriately examining for compliance  with futures laws, including BSA. CFTC officials told us that these reviews  have not identified any problems with BSA/AML examination programs of  the futures SROs.", "Although SEC, CFTC, and SRO officials cited coordination on BSA issues,  industry officials at large financial companies with whom we spoke had  mixed opinions on coordination among the securities and futures  regulators. For example, one industry representative said that futures  SROs and FINRA coordinated well and shared examination information.  The representative also stated that the futures SRO would not conduct its  own examination if its review of FINRA\u2019s examination workpapers  showed the FINRA to be work sufficient. However, another industry  representative indicated that they had never seen FINRA and their futures  SRO coordinate on BSA/AML examinations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Improved Its BSA Compliance Efforts; However, It Does Not Fully Coordinate Examination Schedules with States", "paragraphs": ["Since our 2006 report, IRS has made improvements in its BSA/AML  compliance program by revising guidance, identifying additional NBFIs,  and coordinating with FinCEN and the states; however, IRS and state  agencies have missed opportunities to better leverage examination  resources by not coordinating their examination schedules. In response to  a December 2006 GAO recommendation, IRS updated its Internal Revenue  Manual to reflect changes in its BSA/AML program policies and  procedures and distributed the revisions to IRS staff.", "In our 2006 report, we also said that IRS had identified only a portion of  the NBFI population. In 2005, IRS\u2019s database contained approximately  107,000 potential NBFIs; however, during the same year FinCEN estimated  that there could be as many as 200,000 MSBs, the largest group of NBFIs  subject to BSA requirements. Through subsequent coordination with  FinCEN and state regulators and internal identification efforts, IRS  significantly increased the number of identified MSBs. For example, at  least three or four times a year, FinCEN sends IRS lists of anywhere from  100 to 300 potentially unregistered MSBs, which FinCEN identified by  reviewing SARs from depository institutions that mention unregistered  MSBs. Similarly, states that signed an MOU with IRS must provide IRS lists  of state-licensed and registered MSBs on a quarterly basis. IRS officials  said that the agency found about 20 percent of the new MSB locations as a  result of information provided by with the FinCEN and states\u2019, but that  most of the newly identified MSBs were added due to internal  identification efforts. According to IRS officials, in June 2008 the database  contained more than 200,000 unique locations of MSBs.", "In our 2006 report, we recommended that FinCEN and IRS develop a  documented and coordinated strategy that outlined priorities, time frames,  and resources needs for better identifying and selecting NBFIs for  examination. In response, IRS and FinCEN developed such a strategy.  Furthermore, IRS, in concert with FinCEN and state regulators, has  developed a BSA/AML examination manual for MSBs that was released in  December 2008. The manual contains an overview of AML program  requirements, discusses risks and risk-management expectations and  sound practices for industry, and details examination procedures. The  manual\u2019s main goals are to enhance consistency across BSA examiners,  promote efficient use of examination resources, and provide guidance to  examiners and MSBs about the BSA examination process.", "In July and August 2008, IRS and two state regulators tested the feasibility  of conducting joint examinations using the new MSB examination manual.  Many factors complicate joint examinations\u2014including varying state  licensing requirements, coordination of examiner resources, the  difficulties of sharing confidential information, and differing examination  scope and focus. For instance, one state may require licensing of only  money transmitters, while another state also might require check cashiers  and currency exchangers to obtain a license. Nonetheless, some state  regulators with whom we spoke expressed a desire to conduct joint or  alternating examinations with IRS to better leverage state resources. One  state regulator said that joint examinations would allow states to issue  enforcement actions pursuant to their own state authority against  institutions with AML violations since IRS lacks enforcement authority.  According to the Money Transmitter Regulators Association, state  financial regulators already conduct joint examinations with other states  to leverage examination resources and expertise. IRS officials said they  will review and incorporate examiner comments from the joint  examination pilot and work with the Conference of State Banking  Supervisors to develop formal guidance for IRS and state examiners.", "Additionally, IRS has increased the number of its information-sharing  MOUs with state financial regulators from 34 in 2005 to 43 as of October  2008. Under the MOU, the state regulators are typically required to provide  lists of state-licensed and chartered MSBs, examination reports,  information concerning BSA noncompliance, and examination schedules  on a quarterly basis to IRS. Also on a quarterly basis, IRS agreed to provide  copies of all Letter 1112 (letters of noncompliance sent to institutions with  BSA violations), copies of all Letter 1052 (notifications to new institutions  of relevant BSA regulations), lists of MSBs in the state, and examination  schedules to state financial regulators. According to the MOU, IRS officials  and state regulators will meet periodically to review the implementation of  the MOU. Following one state financial regulator comment on the  usefulness of the information provided in the Letter 1112, IRS officials  revised the form letter to include information on the type of institution  examined and the activities conducted by that institution.", "According to IRS officials, many state agencies are not living up to their  responsibilities as stated in the MOU. IRS data show that 28 of 43 state  agencies that signed an information-sharing MOU have not provided IRS  with MSB information and only 4 of 43 have provided examination  schedules. In addition, state financial regulators that send MSB data to IRS  do so using different formats, limiting the usefulness of the data for IRS.  IRS is working with states to develop a standardized format for all state  information, making it easier to provide the information to IRS and for IRS  to integrate the information into its database.", "While IRS provides MSB information to state regulators, it has not shared  its examination schedules with states, contrary to what it agreed to do as  part of their MOUs. IRS officials said they provide state regulators with  their annual workplans, which include the total number of NBFIs to be  examined but not the names of the institutions to be examined. Therefore,  the state financial regulators cannot plan their examinations to avoid  potential overlap or coordinate joint examinations. One state agency noted  that it had conducted examinations of MSBs, only to find out later that IRS  had conducted its examinations not long before. Several state agencies  said that greater coordination and sharing of examination schedules would  help reduce redundancy in examination resources. Best practices in  interagency coordination suggest agencies should assess their relative  strengths and limitations, identify their mutual needs, and look for  opportunities to leverage each others\u2019 resources\u2014thus obtaining  additional benefits that would not be available if they were to work  separately. IRS officials said state regulators would not derive much  benefit from IRS providing examination schedules on a quarterly basis  because new case files on institutions are sent to field managers often,  sometimes weekly, and field managers and examiners have flexibility and  discretion to determine their examination schedules. In addition, some  institutions on IRS examination lists may not appear on a state regulator\u2019s  list because of varying state licensing and examination requirements of  MSBs. However, by not implementing coordination of examination  schedules with states, IRS may have missed opportunities to leverage  resources, reduce regulatory duplication, maximize the number of MSBs  to be examined, and better ensure BSA compliance with MSBs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Do Not Hold Regular, Nonpublic Discussions about BSA Examination Issues, which Could Inhibit Their Ability to Leverage Resources", "paragraphs": ["While all federal agencies have made improvements in their BSA  compliance efforts, they have not established a formal mechanism through  which they collectively can discuss sensitive BSA examination processes  and findings in nonpublic meetings.

BSAAG also includes a number of  subcommittees on various BSA/AML issues. Representatives from the  SROs, industry, and law enforcement agencies are present at these  meetings and on some subcommittees. Some regulatory officials have told  us that the presence of industry representatives and the number of  participants in BSAAG inhibit more detailed discussion on some issues.  Further, sensitive information, such as examination processes and  findings, cannot be discussed due to the presence of industry.", "Some federal agency officials said they have held discussions with  regulators of other industries outside of BSAAG, but the discussions  generally were held on an informal basis and were not inclusive of all  federal agencies. Some banking regulators cited their public manual as a  reason for not meeting outside of BSAAG with regulators of other  industries. FDIC officials stated, outside of meetings with other federal  banking regulators, they had met with several state MSB regulators to  understand the MSB examination process and other state roles relating to  MSBs. One of the primary goals of these meetings was to determine if they  could share information about MSB examinations with some state  regulators. SEC staff said they informally have had discussions on  BSA/AML issues with federal bank regulators and CFTC. SEC and Federal  Reserve staff cited frequent, informal communications between the  agencies on BSA issues. Further, SEC and the Federal Reserve signed an  MOU in July 2008 under which they can share information on common  interests, which could include BSA violations. Under the MOU, if SEC or  the Federal Reserve became aware of a significant violation occurring in  an institution regulated by the other agency, they would notify the other  agency and provide additional information if requested. CFTC officials  said that outside of BSAAG, they generally discuss examination  procedures only with SEC and FINRA. Similarly, IRS officials stated they  have met with regulators on an ad hoc basis when there have been  overlapping issues. FINRA officials told us that they had very useful  meetings with the Federal Reserve on two occasions (in April and  December 2008) during which they discussed BSA examination  approaches and findings. These meetings will continue on a biannual  basis. In addition, SEC and FINRA staff said that in November 2008, SEC  and FINRA staff met with OCC and Federal Reserve staff to share general  information about SEC and FINRA\u2019s BSA/AML examination programs.", "While they did not discuss specific examination procedures, FINRA  officials said they would be willing to do so if it were useful.", "Some industry officials expressed concern about examination overlap and  suggested that if regulators collectively could discuss these issues, the  collaboration could help decrease resources expended on responding to  duplicative information requests and increase the consistency of  examination processes. Many of the largest financial institutions are part  of a bank or financial holding company structure\u2014companies that could  include broker-dealers and futures firms, as well as banks. Therefore,  some financial institutions have multiple regulators from various  institutions. Industry representatives said that large financial institutions  employ enterprise-wide, risk-based AML programs that have many similar  elements across business lines. As no single regulator examines BSA/AML  procedures for all of the institution\u2019s functions, in some cases they must  work with several regulators to review the same or similar policies and  procedures. In addition, some officials also mentioned that regulators  sometimes arrived at different findings when looking at the same BSA  processes.

As a result, the regulators may not be able to gain the benefits of  collaboration\u2014leveraging scarce resources and building on the  experiences and improvements of other agencies. Furthermore, by not  having a mechanism that could provide an overview of examination  efforts, regulators may be missing opportunities to (1) discuss BSA/AML  concerns from the viewpoint of all financial industries being  interconnected and (2) decrease the regulatory burden, where possible,  for the institutions under examination by multiple regulators."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Regulators with Enforcement Authority Took BSA-Related Enforcement Actions, and Federal Banking Regulators Reported Improved Coordination of Enforcement Actions", "paragraphs": ["The BSA/AML examinations that federal banking regulators, SEC, CFTC,  and their SROs conducted resulted in the citation of violations and the  taking of informal (in the case of the federal banking regulators) and  formal enforcement actions.

Under  the regulators\u2019 AML program rules, in 2008 the most frequently occurring  violations concern requirements to independently test an institution\u2019s  BSA/AML compliance program, train staff on BSA/AML, and maintain  internal controls. BSA requires that depository institutions implement and  maintain a system of internal controls to ensure an ongoing BSA  compliance program. An example of such a control is monitoring for  suspicious activity, which one regulator explained can be costly and  difficult, and time consuming for an institution to implement. With respect  to training, several federal banking regulators said that some banks\u2019 staff,  even BSA compliance officers, may lack adequate BSA/AML training,  especially when such staff are newly hired.", "The most frequently cited violations under Treasury\u2019s BSA rules are  similar across the banking regulators. These violations concern customer  identification programs (CIP), CTRs, and requests for filing reports. For  example, a violation of CIP requirements could mean that an institution  did not implement a written CIP. An institution violating 31 CFR 103.22 did  not adhere to the requirement regarding reporting currency transactions in  excess of $10,000. Violations of 31 CFR 103.27 could mean that an  institution failed to meet the filing and record-keeping requirements for  CTRs, reports of international transportation of currency or monetary  instruments, or reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. While  regulators emphasized that no one factor could explain upward or  downward trends in BSA violations, they cited several possible factors  influencing these trends\u2014the implementation of the FFIEC BSA/AML  examination manual, additional training for examiners and the banking  industry, banking regulators more clearly communicating their  expectations to institutions, and institutions developing better AML  programs. For example, one regulator said that implementing the  examination manual may have contributed to a decline in violations by  providing guidance to banks on identifying and controlling BSA/AML risk  and promoting consistency in the BSA/AML examination process.

Federal  banking regulators said that generally, informal corrective actions will  suffice for technical noncompliance or the failure of a portion of the AML  program that does not indicate that the entire program has failed. If a  compliance violation is significant and remains uncorrected after an  informal action has been taken against an institution, a federal banking  regulator may then decide to take a formal enforcement action. Banking  regulator officials said that formal enforcement actions are public and  generally considered more stringent than informal actions because they  address more significant or repeated BSA violations. Formal enforcement  actions can include cease and desist orders, assessments of civil money  penalties (CMP), or supervisory agreements, and are enforceable through  an administrative process or other injunctive relief in federal district  court.

As it collects and manages all BSA-related data,  FinCEN is in an optimal position to produce analytical products that  assess BSA-related issues within and among financial sectors and  regulators. FinCEN classifies the analytical reports it produces for its  stakeholders into two categories: reactive and proactive. As discussed  earlier, FinCEN conducts targeted financial institution analyses for  regulators at their request. These analyses are considered reactive reports.  As of September 2008, FinCEN\u2019s proactive reports included strategic BSA  data assessments, \u201cBy the Numbers\u201d reports (such as its SAR reports),  state-specific BSA data profiles, and reports of possible unregistered and  unlicensed MSBs (produced for IRS).", "FinCEN stated that the issues for which it chooses to conduct \u201cstrategic  BSA data assessments\u201d vary. For example, FinCEN officials said it  produced a residential real estate assessment after it produced an initial  report on commercial real estate as a possible venue for money  laundering. FinCEN also conducted an assessment of mortgage fraud after  its Office of Regulatory Analysis observed a spike in SAR filings related to  mortgage loan fraud. FinCEN officials said that it takes about 4-6 months  to produce such assessments, but that they expect this time would be  significantly shortened after FinCEN\u2019s planned modernization of the BSA  database. While the reports are not produced on a regular schedule,  FinCEN officials said that it has at least one assessment underway at all  times.", "FinCEN also biannually produces \u201cBy the Numbers\u201d public reports that  compile numerical data from SARs and supplement the \u201cSAR Activity  Review\u2014Tips, Trends, and Issues\u201d and state-specific BSA data profiles  showing analysis of BSA filing trends within the 46 states agencies with  which FinCEN has information-sharing MOUs. FinCEN began producing  \u201cState BSA Data Profiles\u201d in May 2007 and said it had received input and  some positive feedback from state and federal banking regulators.  Moreover, some industry officials told us that these publicly available SAR  reviews were very useful components of FinCEN\u2019s outreach efforts.", "In 2008, FinCEN, after discussions with SEC, began providing SEC with  reports of securities-related SARs filed by depository institutions. The  purpose of these reports is to alert SEC to any possible securities  violations observed by depository institutions. To compile the reports,  FinCEN analysts search on key terms provided by SEC. SEC staff said they  have found these downloads very useful to their general enforcement and  examination programs.", "Approximately each quarter since June 2006, FinCEN has issued reports  on possible unregistered and unlicensed MSBs (found by reviewing SARs  filed by depository institutions). IRS officials have used the information to  contact and register previously unregistered MSBs. IRS officials also  telephone the unregistered MSBs to make sure the entities understand  their BSA obligations.", "Despite the provision of more analyses, most MOU holders with whom we  spoke thought different or additional FinCEN analysis would be useful for  their BSA compliance activities and have been discussing such products  with FinCEN. In particular, some federal banking regulators said that the  summary reports of numbers of examinations, violations, and enforcement  actions among depository institutions that FinCEN provides them on a  quarterly basis were of little use as they were compilations of data the  federal banking regulators had given FinCEN. Although FinCEN provides  analyses of issues after reviewing data and reports, federal banking  regulator officials thought it would be more beneficial to receive analytical  information to assist them in examination preplanning and scoping  processes, which would allow them to better focus their BSA/AML  resources and efforts. Federal banking regulators have cited requests  regarding additional analysis made to FinCEN through the FFIEC  BSA/AML working group. For instance, several federal banking regulators  have requested state, regional, and national analysis of CTRs and SARs by  type of institution, and additional analysis of MSBs and 314(a) hits. As  they have limited access to BSA data, federal banking regulators are  unable to conduct these analyses themselves. (We discuss data access  issues in the following section.) IRS officials said they wanted reports  similar to what FinCEN provides to law enforcement, such as analyses of  potential money laundering regarding the U.S. southwest border. IRS  officials said such reports would be helpful in determining where to  allocate the agency\u2019s examination resources. FinCEN officials said that  they provide IRS (along with the federal banking regulators) a  consolidated package containing the annual BSA data profiles for all states  and certain U.S. territories. SEC staff they have had at least two  discussions with FinCEN staff about analytic products that FinCEN could  provide and they expected further discussions would take place.", "FinCEN officials stated they needed to concentrate on providing products  that could benefit multiple agencies to ensure they were using FinCEN  resources effectively. As part of its efficiency and effectiveness initiative,  FinCEN said it has identified ways it could increase its analytical support  to regulators by providing products with useful information on macro-level  risks. FinCEN officials said they are incorporating steps into its  information technology modernization plans that will make the  development of these products more feasible. FinCEN said it has been  developing analyses of 314(a) hits to better inform regulators. In addition,  one federal banking regulator and FinCEN have agreed to different  approaches for obtaining supplemental BSA data analysis. In fall 2008,  FDIC officials completed arrangements to have an FDIC analyst work at  FinCEN on a part-time basis and that analyst began work with the Office  of Regulatory Analysis. FinCEN officials said that they are open to  detailees from more regulators as it would also help them understand  better which types of analysis are more useful to the regulators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Different Levels of Direct Access to BSA Data, which Inhibits Some Compliance Activities", "paragraphs": ["With the exception of IRS, which maintains and stores all BSA information  filed, FinCEN has developed data-access MOUs with some financial  regulators to provide them with direct electronic access to BSA data.  However, the level of access across financial regulators is inconsistent and  has inhibited agencies\u2019 compliance activities. For example, FinCEN  provides the federal banking regulators with access to CTRs for  depository institutions, SARs for depository institutions, and other  reports. Federal banking regulators access this information through a  secure system but are limited to downloading a certain number of records  at a time. Officials from some federal banking regulators said that access  to SARs or CTRs filed by institutions other than depository institutions  would be useful. One official explained that some institutions, while  regulated by others, can be affiliated with their supervised institutions. For  example, an MSB may file a SAR on a bank\u2019s customer, but the federal  banking regulator does not have access to the SAR filed by the MSB.  Unlike other federal banking regulators, OCC officials arranged with  FinCEN to receive SAR data directly. For about 5 years, OCC has received  a monthly compact disc with SAR data for the banks it regulates. With  these data, OCC created the \u201cSAR Data Mart,\u201d which its staff use to take  action against unlawful activity committed by depository institution  insiders and for evaluating operational risk. OCC staff have found the  ability to conduct is own analyses very useful.", "SEC staff said they use their direct access to BSA data to review  approximately 100 to 150 SARs for securities and futures firms daily.  Furthermore, SEC staff said their access to these SARs has expanded their  SAR review activities and enhanced SEC\u2019s enforcement and examination  programs.", "In contrast, futures and securities SROs (including FINRA) and some state  agencies that conduct BSA/AML examinations currently do not have direct  electronic access to BSA data. Some of these regulators\u2019 requests for such  access have been pending for several years. FINRA\u2014which conducts the  majority of broker-dealer examinations (more than 2,000 in fiscal year  2008)\u2014does not have direct electronic access to BSA data and must  request SARs through SEC and FinCEN. With direct electronic access,  FINRA and state agency officials told us they could more effectively risk  scope their examination processes. Risk scoping by regulators may  include reviewing the number of SARs and CTRs filed by institutions  under their supervision to identify areas within an institution\u2019s program or  which institutions among their supervised entities on which to  concentrate, enabling regulators to better plan their examinations and  target their resources accordingly. As discussed above, federal banking  regulators use BSA data to risk scope their examinations. Further, due to  the large number of examinations they conduct, FINRA officials said it  would strain SEC\u2019s resources if FINRA asked SEC staff for access to every  SAR filed by the institution under review. Therefore, FINRA staff request  SARs from FinCEN primarily when FINRA staff suspect a firm may not  have filed all the SARs it says it filed. FINRA officials said they often  experienced delays in receiving the information. They also said they  started to develop an MOU with FinCEN in 2002; however, the last time  FINRA discussed data access with FinCEN was in March 2006.", "CFTC is the last federal functional regulator to be provided direct  electronic access to the BSA database. CFTC officials said that they made  a formal request for direct access to BSA data in 2005. FinCEN officials  said that, until recently, FinCEN and CFTC had not agreed on the terms of  an electronic access MOU for BSA data. FinCEN and CFTC signed a data- access MOU concurrently with their information-sharing MOU in January  2009. Previously, if CFTC wanted BSA information, it had to make case-by- case requests to FinCEN. Similar to FINRA, CFTC officials said while  FinCEN responded quickly to emergency BSA data requests,  nonemergency requests could take much longer. CFTC officials said that  the data-access MOU will permit CFTC to make BSA database inquiries in  certain circumstances on behalf of an SRO. They said that they recognize  the unique and highly sensitive nature of BSA data and providing the SROs  with direct access to BSA data presents certain legal and regulatory  oversight issues.", "FinCEN explained it has been conducting a comprehensive evaluation of  data access issues. In September 2008, FinCEN completed a bureau-wide  initiative to better define the types of regulatory agencies to which it will  provide electronic BSA data access and the criteria and processes for  evaluating data access requests. FinCEN determined it would consider  requests from agencies that examine for BSA compliance; supervise a  financial institution for safety and soundness or financial responsibility;  issue licenses or charters to financial institutions; or administer or enforce  laws, regulations, or rules affecting financial institutions or markets. In  evaluating these requests, FinCEN officials said that staff look at the  requester\u2019s regulatory authorities, ability to protect sensitive BSA data,  and ability to utilize confidential information. But they said that SROs  present unique issues because of their status as private actors, rather than  governmental authorities. Although FinCEN said it anticipates providing  SROs with access to appropriate data, their nongovernmental status  requires FinCEN to contemplate appropriate access restrictions. FinCEN  officials said they finalized a regulatory data-access template in July 2008  and have begun providing additional state regulators with direct electronic  access, and anticipate providing expanded access to the federal financial  regulators. A FinCEN official said that they are working on data-access  MOUs for SROs.", "Without electronic access to BSA data, some regulators cannot effectively  scope risks for examinations, affecting their ability to efficiently plan  examinations and target limited resources to areas of greatest risk. In  addition, without direct access, in accordance with their examination  procedures they cannot verify information that institutions are reporting  on their BSA filings without requesting this information from FinCEN or  another regulator who has access, thereby straining already limited  resources. For example, as discussed above, to obtain access to some  SARs, some regulators (such as FINRA) must contact FinCEN for access,  further expending FinCEN\u2019s and their limited resources."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Through the USA PATRIOT Act, more activities of a larger number of  financial institutions have come under the umbrella of U.S. anti-money  laundering efforts. As the BSA regulation framework has expanded, it also  has become more complex\u2014making it all the more important that FinCEN  and the regulators establish effective communication and information  exchanges to achieve their common goals. While the regulators take  different approaches to examination and enforcement within their  jurisdictions, they all have responsibilities in the BSA/AML regulatory  framework. Additional AML legislation has increased the number of  financial institutions that have come under the scope of BSA, as well as  regulators\u2019 interactions on these issues within and across their respective  financial sectors. At the time of our 2006 report, the federal banking  regulators and FinCEN already had achieved agreement on how to address  some key aspects of BSA compliance and enforcement and developed a  common examination manual.", "Since that report, FinCEN and the regulators have made additional  progress in ensuring the soundness of the current compliance and  enforcement framework. While many improvements in the coordination  among stakeholders\u2014FinCEN, regulators, law enforcement, and the  industries being regulated\u2014have occurred, other working relationships  among the stakeholders are not as efficient and effective as they could be.  IRS has not fully leveraged its resources with those of state regulators to  conduct examinations of MSBs. As a result of IRS not sharing its  examination schedules with state agencies, state agency officials told us  they sometimes have scheduled examinations shortly after IRS had  completed examinations on the same institutions, subjecting them to  duplicative monitoring. With approximately 200,000 MSBs in the United  States, better coordination of examination scheduling between IRS and its  state agency partners would both better leverage limited government  resources and minimize the burden placed on those being regulated.  Additionally, ongoing meetings such as those of BSAAG provide for some  exchange of information, but some important regulatory issues cannot be  discussed at meetings at which industry is present. While it is useful to  have forums in which the regulators and the regulated exchange  information, the sensitive nature of some BSA issues and the nonpublic  nature of some examination modules suggest that an additional forum for  regular information exchange among all the regulators is called for.  Whether it is coordination of efforts between IRS and state regulators or  among federal regulators, opening additional avenues for collaboration  can (1) facilitate the exchange of best practices and better leverage limited  regulatory resources, (2) minimize the regulatory burden on those being  regulated, and (3) most importantly, see that the critical concerns  embodied in BSA legislation are efficiently and effectively carried out.", "FinCEN has taken many significant steps to improve execution of its BSA  administrative and coordination responsibilities, but could make  improvements in three areas: sharing information with CFTC, improving  communication on IRS referrals and ensuring timely feedback to IRS- examined institutions, and reconciling outstanding data access issues.  FinCEN also serves as the BSA data manager and provides the regulators  with access to critical BSA data related to their supervised entities. With  these data, regulators are able to scope risks for their examinations, better  target their resources, and independently verify BSA data filings. However,  CFTC only received electronic access in January 2009, and securities and  futures SROs, and some state agencies do not yet have electronic access to  BSA data. With today\u2019s rapidly changing financial markets and the  relationship of the futures industry to other sectors of the financial  markets, it is especially important that SROs receive electronic access to  BSA data to facilitate their examinations. Furthermore, IRS is hampered in  carrying out its BSA-related compliance responsibilities because of  uncertainties about when FinCEN will take action on IRS\u2019s referrals. Since  IRS does not have enforcement authority in this area, it is important that  IRS and FinCEN develop a process that facilitates communication on IRS  referrals. Without timely feedback, MSBs may be allowed to continue  operating in violation of BSA statutes. Finally, delays in completing data- access agreements present obstacles to some regulators attempting to  carry out their BSA-related responsibilities. While FinCEN is justified in its  concerns about sharing very sensitive information, the delay in  establishing information-sharing and data-access MOUs with CFTC, and  the failure to establish data access MOUs with SROs and some states that  also have important BSA-related responsibilities, presents a different set of  potential problems, such as incomplete risk-scoping of examinations.  While we commend FinCEN and CFTC for finalizing their MOUs, the  benefits of the agreements will take some time to be realized. Until then,  the potential ramifications include less assurance on the part of regulators  that these financial institutions are complying fully with the BSA. Taking  steps to resolve these areas of concern could provide tangible benefits in  the BSA-related efforts of the regulators and build on recent  improvements that FinCEN has made in its administrative and  coordination responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the potential for duplicative efforts and better leverage limited  examination resources, we recommend that the Commissioner of IRS  work with state agencies to develop a process by which to coordinate  MSB examination schedules between IRS and state agencies that conduct  BSA examinations of MSBs.", "Further, to build on improvements made in examination processes vital to  ensuring BSA compliance, we recommend that the heads of FinCEN, the  Federal Reserve, FDIC, OTS, OCC, NCUA, SEC, CFTC, and IRS direct the  appropriate staff to consider developing or using an existing process to  share and discuss information on BSA/AML examination procedures and  general trends regularly in a nonpublic setting.

In technical comments, some agencies asked that  we be more specific about which component of their agencies should  participate in and conduct these discussions. We modified the  recommendation language to clarify that the heads of the agencies should  direct appropriate staff to undertake these actions. The Federal Reserve  commented that such discussions could build on improvements already  made in examination processes and that regular discussion of examination  procedures and general compliance trends could be beneficial. FDIC  agreed that periodic meetings with all federal agencies responsible for  BSA compliance could promote consistency and coordination in  examination and enforcement approaches and help reduce regulatory  burden. OCC commented that a number of groups and processes already  existed for sharing information and collaboration and that they would  continue to participate in these initiatives and look for opportunities to  share their practices and observations. OTS commented that that they  would collaborate and that the federal banking agencies and FinCEN have  established a number of formal committees and working groups to  promote collaboration on BSA issues. SEC agreed that the regulators  would benefit from the development of such a mechanism and noted that  it planned to attend a meeting in which FinCEN was planning to discuss  possible methods for achieving this goal. CFTC commented that it  supports all efforts to increase cooperation among regulators in the BSA  area and that it would be pleased to participate in discussions that would  allow the agency to share experiences and expertise in developing and  implementing BSA examination procedures.", "In its comments, FinCEN said it concurred with the intent of our  recommendations, particularly in regard to expanding information sharing  with authorized stakeholders, and hoped to be situated in the future to  meet them.

We subsequently broadened the  recommendation language to clarify that FinCEN should work with IRS to  develop a process to facilitate communication on referrals and ensure  timely feedback to IRS-examined institutions. FinCEN and IRS said they  agreed with this modification. Finally, in its comments, SEC also  supported our recommendation that FinCEN finalize data-access MOUs  with SROs that conduct BSA examinations.

Broadly,  the federal banking regulators that provide oversight for banks are the  Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC; thrifts\u2014OTS; and credit unions\u2014 NCUA. Banking regulators generally focus on ensuring the safety and  soundness of their supervised institutions. They conduct safety and  soundness examinations on-site to assess an institution\u2019s financial  condition, policies and procedures, and adherence to laws and regulations.  Generally, regulatory agencies perform these examinations every 12 to 18  months, based on the institution\u2019s risk.

Informal actions (which vary among the federal  banking regulators) may include the adoption of resolutions by an  institution\u2019s board of directors, the execution of a memorandums of  understanding between an institution and the regulators, notices of safety  and soundness deficiency for compliance, commitment letters, or  corrective actions to be taken to address regulatory concerns. Informal  actions usually are taken to address violations that are limited in scope  and technical in nature. Federal banking regulators also may take formal  enforcement actions if a depository institution is engaging in unsafe or  unsound practices or has violated a law or regulation. Formal enforcement  actions are public and generally considered more stringent than informal  actions and can address more significant, repeated, or systemic BSA  violations.
