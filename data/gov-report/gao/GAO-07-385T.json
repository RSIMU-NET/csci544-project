GAO's broad audit authority allows us to support Congress through strategic analyses of issues that cut across multiple federal agencies and sources of funding. Our work spans the security, political, and economic prongs of the U.S. national strategy in Iraq. The broad, cross-cutting nature of this work helps minimize the possibility of overlap and duplication by any individual Inspector General. Based on our work, we have made some unique contributions to Congress. Our past and ongoing work has focused on the U.S. strategy and costs of operating in Iraq, training and equipping the Iraqi security forces, governance issues, the readiness of U.S. military forces, and acquisition outcomes. Some highlights from our work follow. Our analysis of the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq recommended that the National Security Council improve the strategy by articulating clearer roles and responsibilities, specifying future contributions, and identifying current costs and future resources. In our examination of the cost of U.S. military operations abroad, we recommended that the Secretary of Defense improve the transparency and reliability of Department of Defense's (DOD) Global War on Terror (GWOT) obligation data. We also recommended that DOD build more funding into the baseline budget once an operation reaches a known level of effort and costs are more predictable. In assessing the capabilities of Iraqi security forces, we found that overall security conditions in Iraq have deteriorated despite increases in the numbers of trained and equipped security forces. A complete assessment of Iraqi security forces' capabilities is dependent on DOD providing GAO with the readiness levels of each Iraqi unit. We found that DOD faces significant challenges in maintaining U.S. military readiness for overseas and homeland missions and in sustaining rotational deployments of duty, especially if the duration and intensity of current operations continue at the present pace. In assessing the impact of ongoing military operations in Iraq on military equipment, we found that the Army and the Marine Corps have initiated programs to reset (repair or replace) equipment and are likely to incur large expenditures in the future. In reviewing efforts to secure munitions sites and provide force protection, we recommended that DOD conduct a theaterwide survey and risk assessment of unsecured conventional munitions in Iraq and incorporate storage site security into strategic planning efforts. In assessing acquisition outcomes, we found that DOD often entered into contract arrangements with unclear requirements, which posed additional risks to the government. DOD also lacked the capacity to provide sufficient numbers of contracting, logistics, and other personnel, thereby hindering oversight efforts. In April 2005, an international peer review team gave our quality assurance system a clean opinion--only the second time a national audit institution has received such a rating from a multinational team.

The U.S.  goals included establishing a peaceful, stable, and secure Iraq. Our July  2006 report assessed the extent to which the NSVI and its supporting  documents addressed the six characteristics of an effective national  strategy. While we reported that the NSVI was an improvement over  previous U.S. planning efforts for stabilizing and rebuilding Iraq, we  concluded that the strategy fell short in at least three key areas. First, it  only partially identified the agencies responsible for implementing key  aspects of the strategy. Second, it did not fully address how the United  States will integrate its goals with those of the Iraqis and the international  community, and it did not detail Iraq\u2019s anticipated contribution to its  future needs. Third, it only partially identified the current and future costs  of U.S. involvement in Iraq, including maintaining U.S. military operations,  building Iraqi government capacity, and rebuilding critical infrastructure.", "We recommended that the NSC improve the current strategy by  articulating clear roles and responsibilities, specifying future  contributions, and identifying current costs and future resources.

Efforts in Iraq involve various activities such as combating  insurgents, conducting civil affairs, building capacity, reconstructing  infrastructure, and training Iraqi military forces. To date, the United States  has reported substantial costs for Iraq and can expect to incur significant  costs in the foreseeable future, requiring decision-makers to consider  difficult trade-offs as the nation faces an increasing number of long-range  fiscal challenges. Funding for these efforts has been provided through  annual appropriations, as well as supplemental appropriations that are  outside the annual budget process. In our view, moving more funding into  baseline budgets, particularly for DOD, would enable decision-makers to  better weigh priorities and assess trade-offs.", "As of September 30, 2006, DOD had reported costs of about $257.5 billion  for military operations in Iraq. In addition, as of October 2006, about $29  billion had been obligated for Iraqi reconstruction and stabilization efforts.  However, problems with the processes for recording and reporting GWOT  costs raise concerns that these data may not accurately reflect the true  dollar value of war-related costs.", "U.S. military and diplomatic commitments in Iraq will continue for the  foreseeable future and are likely to involve hundreds of billions of  additional dollars. The magnitude of future costs will depend on several  direct and indirect variables and, in some cases, decisions that have not  been made. DOD\u2019s future costs will likely be affected by the pace and  duration of operations, the types of facilities needed to support troops  overseas, redeployment plans, and the amount of military equipment to be  repaired or replaced. Although reducing the number of troops would  appear to lower costs, we have seen from previous operations in the  Balkans and Kosovo that costs could rise\u2014if, for example, increased  numbers of contractors replace military personnel. With activities likely to  continue into the foreseeable future, decision-makers will have to  carefully weigh priorities and make difficult decisions when budgeting for  future costs.", "Over the years, we have made a series of recommendations to the  Secretary of Defense intended to improve the transparency and reliability  of DOD\u2019s GWOT obligation data, including recommendations that DOD (1)  revise the cost-reporting guidance so that large amounts of reported  obligations are not shown in \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d categories, and (2) take steps  to ensure that reported GWOT obligations are reliable.

The  number of trained and equipped Iraqi security forces has increased from  about 174,000 in July 2005 to about 323,000 in December 2006, at the same  time as more Iraqi army units have taken the lead for counterinsurgency  operations in specific geographic areas. Despite this progress, attacks on  coalition forces, Iraqi security forces, and civilians have all increased,  reaching record highs in October 2006. Because of the poor security in  Iraq, the United States could not draw down U.S. force levels in Iraq as  planned in 2004 and 2006, and U.S. forces have continued to conduct  combat operations in urban areas, especially Baghdad.", "Transferring security responsibilities to the Iraqi security forces and  provincial governments is a critical part of the U.S. government\u2019s strategy  in Iraq and key to allowing a drawdown of U.S. forces.

However, it is unclear whether  U.S. expenditures and efforts are having their intended effect in  developing capable forces and whether additional resources are needed. A  key measure of the capabilities of Iraqi forces is the Transition Readiness  Assessment (TRA) reports prepared by coalition advisors embedded in  Iraqi units.

Since the  funding did not go through traditional security assistance programs, the  accountability requirements normally applicable to these programs did not  necessarily apply, according to DOD officials. It is currently unclear what  accountability measures, if any, DOD has chosen to apply to the train-and- equip program for Iraq, as DOD officials have expressed differing opinions  on this matter. As part of our ongoing work, we have asked DOD to clarify  what accountability measures it has chosen to apply to the program.", "While it is unclear which regulations DOD has chosen to apply, beginning  in early 2004, MNF-I established requirements to control and account for  equipment provided to the Iraqi security forces by issuing orders that  outlined procedures for its subordinate commands. These included  obtaining signed records for equipment received by Iraqi units or  individuals and recording weapons serial numbers. Although MNF-I took  initial steps to establish property accountability procedures, limitations  such as the initial lack of a fully operational equipment distribution  network, staffing weaknesses, and the operational demands of equipping  the Iraqi forces during war hindered its ability to fully execute critical  tasks outlined in the property accountability orders. Since late 2005,  MNSTC-I has taken additional steps to improve its property accountability  procedures, including establishing property books for equipment issued  to Iraqi Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior forces. According to  MNSTC-I officials, MNSTC-I also recovered existing documentation for  equipment previously issued to Iraqi forces. However, according to our  preliminary analysis, DOD and MNF-I may not be able to account for Iraqi  security forces\u2019 receipt of about 90,000 rifles and about 80,000 pistols that  were reported as issued before early October 2005.

However, unclear budgeting and  procurement rules have affected Iraq\u2019s efforts to spend capital budgets  effectively and efficiently. Since most of the U.S. reconstruction funds  provided between fiscal years 2003 and 2006 have been obligated,  unexpended Iraqi funds represent an important source of additional  financing. Iraq had more than $6 billion in unspent capital project funds as  of August 2006.
