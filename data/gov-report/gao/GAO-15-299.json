However, bills introduced in the previous Congress would, if re-introduced and passed, make broad changes to the Code relevant to financial company bankruptcies. The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act of 2014 (H.R. 5421) and Taxpayer Protection and Responsible Resolution Act (S.1861) would have expanded to varying degrees the powers of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and would have imposed a temporary stay on financial derivatives (securities whose value is based on one or more underlying assets) that are exempt from the automatic stay under the Code. That stay would prohibit a creditor from seizing or taking other action to collect what the creditor is owed under the financial derivative. The bills also would have added to the Code processes for the resolution of large, complex financial companies similar in some ways to provisions currently in the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which grants FDIC the authority to resolve failed systemically important financial institutions under its receivership. For example, each bill would have allowed for the creation of a bridge company, in which certain assets and financial contracts of the holding-company would be transferred, allowing certain subsidiaries to continue their operations. The 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act of 2013\u2014a bill introduced in the House of Representatives (H.R. 3711) and the Senate (S. 1282)\u2014would have repealed safe-harbor provisions that allow most counterparties in a qualifying transaction with the debtor to exercise certain contractual rights even if doing so would otherwise violate the automatic stay.

Since GAO's 2013 report, no changes have been made to the chapter of the Code that relates to coordination between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in bankruptcy cases in which the debtor has foreign operations. Some structural challenges remain, such as conflicting regulatory regimes related to the treatment of financial contracts between parties in different countries when a firm enters bankruptcy, but efforts are underway to address them. Regulators have implemented a Dodd-Frank Act provision that requires certain large financial firms to submit a resolution plan to assist with an orderly bankruptcy process, which regulators expect to help address potential problems with international cooperation, among others. However, in 2014, FDIC and the Federal Reserve identified shortcomings with the plans for a number of large financial companies that those firms are to address in their 2015 submissions. Further, international bodies, such as the Financial Stability Board\u2014an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system\u2014have focused on having countries adopt a regulatory approach to resolutions.

As we previously reported in  July 2011, some experts we interviewed suggested that modifying the  safe harbor provisions might help to avoid or mitigate the precipitous  decline of the asset values typical in financial institution bankruptcies.  For example, these experts suggested that the treatment of QFCs in the  Lehman bankruptcy contributed to a significant and rapid loss of asset  values to the estate. Other experts we spoke with in 2011 suggested that  safe-harbor treatment might lessen market discipline. Because  counterparties entered into QFCs may close out their contracts even if  doing so would otherwise violate the automatic stay, the incentive to  monitor the risk of each other could be reduced. Additionally, as we  reported in July 2013, attendees of our roundtable discussions on  bankruptcy reform noted that the safe harbors lead to a larger derivatives  market and greater reliance on short-term funding because QFCs would  not be subject to a stay, which could increase systemic risk in the  financial system.", "However, others argue that a repeal of the safe-harbor provisions could  have adverse effects. As we previously reported in July 2011, these  experts assert that subjecting any QFCs to the automatic stay in  bankruptcy would freeze many assets of the counterparties of the failed  financial institution, causing a chain reaction and a subsequent systemic  financial crisis. In January 2011, regulatory officials we spoke with also  told us that the safe harbor provisions uphold market discipline through  margin, capital, and collateral requirements. They said that the  requirement for posting collateral limits the amount of risk counterparties  are willing to undertake. In addition, during the 2013 expert roundtable on  financial company bankruptcies, one expert noted that one of the goals of  safe harbors is to limit market turmoil during a bankruptcy\u2014that is, they  are to prevent the insolvency of one firm from spreading to other firms."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Efforts to Enhance International Coordination to Resolve Failing Financial Companies under Bankruptcy", "paragraphs": ["In the United States the presumptive mechanism to resolve a failed cross- border large financial company continues to be through the judicial  bankruptcy process, though no statutory changes have been made to  Chapter 15 of the Code or the U.S. judicial bankruptcy process to address  impediments to an orderly resolution of a large, multinational financial  institution. However, while some structural challenges discussed earlier  remain, others, such as conflicting regulatory regimes and the treatment  of cross-border derivatives, are being addressed through various efforts.  For example, the Federal Reserve and FDIC have taken certain  regulatory actions mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act authorities toward  facilitating orderly resolution, including efforts that could contribute to  cross-border coordination. Specifically, certain large financial companies  must provide the Federal Reserve and FDIC with periodic reports of their  plans for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial  distress or failure under the Code. The resolution plans or living wills are  to demonstrate how a company could be resolved in a rapid manner  under the Code. FDIC and the Federal Reserve have said that the plans  were expected to address potential obstacles to global cooperation,  among others. In 2014, FDIC and the Federal Reserve sent letters to a  number of large financial companies identifying specific shortcomings  with the resolution plans that those firms will need to address in their  2015 submissions, due on or before July 1, 2015, for the first group of  filers.", "International bodies have also focused on strengthening their regulatory  structures to enable the orderly resolution of a failing large financial firm  and have taken additional actions to facilitate cross-border resolutions. In  October 2011, the Financial Stability Board (FSB)\u2014an international body  that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial  system\u2014issued a set of principles to guide the development of resolution  regimes for financial firms active in multiple countries. For example, each  jurisdiction should have the authority to exercise resolution powers over  firms, jurisdictions should have policies in place so that authorities are not  reliant on public bailout funds, and statutory mandates should encourage  a cooperative solution with foreign authorities. In addition, in December  2013 the European Parliament and European Council reached agreement  on the European Union\u2019s (EU) Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive,  which establishes requirements for national resolution frameworks for all  EU member states and provides for resolution powers and tools. For  example, member states are to appoint a resolution authority, institutions  must prepare and maintain recovery plans, resolution authorities are to  assess the extent to which firms are resolvable without the assumption of  extraordinary financial support, and authorities are to cooperate  effectively when dealing with the failure of cross-border banks. Unlike the  United States, EU and FSB do not direct resolution authorities to use the  bankruptcy process developed for corporate insolvency situations.", "In a letter to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)  in 2013, FDIC, the Bank of England, BaFin in Germany, and the Swiss  Financial Market Supervisory Authority called for changes in the exercise  of termination rights and other remedies in derivatives contracts following  commencement of an insolvency or resolution action. In October 2014,  18 major global financial firms agreed to sign a new ISDA Resolution Stay  Protocol to facilitate the cross-border resolution of a large, complex  institution. This protocol was published and these 18 financial firms  agreed to it on November 12, 2014, and certain provisions of which  became effective in January 2015. Generally, parties adhering to this  protocol have agreed to be bound by certain limitations on their  termination rights and other remedies in the event one of them becomes  subject to certain resolution proceedings, including OLA. These stays are  intended to give resolution authorities and insolvency administrators time  to facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled financial firm. The Protocol  also incorporates certain restrictions on creditor contractual rights that  would apply when a U.S. financial holding company becomes subject to  U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, including a stay on cross-default rights that  would restrict the counterparty of a non-bankrupt affiliate of an insolvent  U.S. financial holding company from immediately terminating its  derivatives contracts with that affiliate.", "Finally, a United Nations working group (tasked with furthering adoption  of the UNCITRAL Model Law) included the insolvency of large and  complex financial institutions as part of its focus on cross-border  insolvency.
