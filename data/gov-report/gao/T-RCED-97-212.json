The Congress ratified the compact in 1988.", "California, the only state since 1980 to have authorized the construction and operation of a disposal facility, is responsible for licensing and regulating its disposal facility. As authorized by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Atomic Energy Commission (a predecessor to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission [NRC]) relinquished to the state in 1962 a significant portion of the Commission\u2019s authority to regulate radioactive materials within the state, including the disposal of low-level radioactive waste. The state incorporated NRC\u2019s criteria for siting and regulating low-level waste disposal facilities into the state\u2019s regulations.", "In 1985, California named US Ecology its \u201clicense designee\u201d and authorized the company to screen and select a potential site for a disposal facility, to investigate its suitability, and to construct and operate the facility as licensed and regulated by the state. After evaluating potential sites, a 1,000-acre site in Ward Valley in the Mojave Desert was selected. (See fig. 1.)", "About 70 of the 1,000 acres would be used for the trenches containing the disposed waste. Almost all of the remaining area would constitute a buffer zone.", "In April 1991 Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management, which manages the land, and the state jointly issued an environmental impact statement concluding that the proposed facility would not cause significant adverse environmental effects. The statement is required as part of the record for the Secretary of the Interior\u2019s land-transfer decision.", "In July 1992, California asked Interior to sell the Ward Valley site to the state under authority granted to the Secretary by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). Among other things, this act authorizes the Secretary to transfer public land by direct sale upon finding that the transfer would serve important public objectives that cannot be achieved elsewhere and that outweigh other public objectives and values served by retaining federal ownership of the land. After making such a finding, the land transfer must be made on terms that the Secretary deems are necessary to ensure proper land use and the protection of the public interest. After considering the environmental impacts of a licensed disposal facility at the site, the outgoing Secretary decided in January 1993 to sell the land as requested. Acting for the state, US Ecology then paid Interior $500,000 for the land.", "The outgoing Secretary\u2019s decision was immediately challenged in federal court on the basis of Interior\u2019s alleged noncompliance with FLPMA and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and alleged failure to protect native desert tortoises under the Endangered Species Act. To settle the lawsuits and to assure himself that the proposed land transfer would comply with applicable federal laws, the incoming Secretary rescinded the earlier land-transfer decision and returned US Ecology\u2019s payment. Meanwhile, in September 1993, California issued a license to US Ecology, contingent on transfer of the land to the state, to construct and operate the disposal facility. Legal challenges to the state\u2019s licensing action were denied by the state\u2019s courts.", "From 1993 until 1996 the Secretary deferred the land-transfer decision while (1) the Bureau completed a first supplement to the April 1991 environmental impact statement, (2) the National Academy of Sciences reviewed seven technical issues related to the Ward Valley site, and (3) Interior negotiated, with the state, the terms of a public hearing on the proposed facility and the land-transfer agreement. The land-transfer negotiations reached an impasse in late 1995 over the issue of Interior\u2019s authority to enforce the state\u2019s compliance with the Academy\u2019s recommendations in court. Then, in February 1996 Interior announced that it would prepare a second supplement to the environmental impact statement and conduct tests that the Academy had recommended.

Although Interior also said it would address \u201cnearby Indian sacred sites\u201d in the supplement, it did not identify any such sites or sources of information on this issue.

The scientists were particularly concerned about the potential for (1) water to flow into the trenches containing the waste, (2) radioactive materials to move down through the unsaturated soil to the water table, and (3) a connection between the local groundwater and the Colorado River. In a May 1995 report, a 17-member committee of the Academy concluded that the occurrence of any of these three situations is unlikely. Two committee members, however, disagreed with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the movement of radioactive elements to the water table is \u201chighly unlikely.\u201d The Academy added that the potential effect on water quality of any contaminants that might reach the Colorado River would be insignificant.", "Among other things, however, the Academy recommended that additional measurements at the site be made to explain why tritium had apparently been detected about 100 feet beneath the surface of Ward Valley during the site\u2019s investigation. The unexpected measurement of tritium at this depth raised questions about how quickly radioactive elements might migrate from the disposal facility to the groundwater. The Academy concluded that inappropriate sampling procedures probably introduced atmospheric tritium into the soil samples.", "Fifteen committee members concluded that the tritium tests could be done during the facility\u2019s construction because the purpose of the tests was to improve baseline information for the long-term monitoring of the site rather than to resolve questions about the site\u2019s suitability for a disposal facility.

This facility had operated from 1962 until Nevada closed it after 1992. US Ecology began operating the facility in 1981. While conducting research next to the Beatty facility, the Survey detected radioactive elements in concentrations well above natural background levels. The Survey attributed this situation to disposal practices at Beatty, such as disposing of liquid radioactive waste, that are now prohibited.", "The Survey added that it is doubtful that the distribution of the radioactive elements leaking from the site and their movement through the ground over time will ever be understood because of incomplete records of the disposal of liquid radioactive wastes. Therefore, the Survey concluded, extrapolations of the information from Beatty to the proposed Ward Valley facility are too tenuous to have much scientific value because of the uncertainties about how radioactive elements at Beatty are transported and because liquid wastes cannot be buried at Ward Valley. The Survey concluded that the findings of tritium near Beatty do not help explain the measurements of tritium at Ward Valley."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Obtained From the Public", "paragraphs": ["Interior relied on the views of the public to add 10 more issues to address in the second supplement and to expand another issue\u2014\u201cnearby Indian sacred sites\u201d\u2014into a broader review of Native American issues. For example, before Interior announced that it would prepare a second supplement, an environmental group\u2014the Committee to Bridge the Gap\u2014had already requested that Interior prepare a supplement addressing the Academy\u2019s report, the Beatty facility, and four other issues that Interior eventually selected: (1) the potential pathways of waste to the groundwater and then to the Colorado River; (2) the types, quantities, and sources of waste to be disposed of; (3) the recent financial troubles of US Ecology; and (4) protection of the desert tortoise.", "After Interior\u2019s February 1996 announcement that it would prepare a second supplement, the Bureau obtained and summarized public comments and recommended to Interior\u2019s Deputy Secretary that 10 issues be addressed in the supplement. Four of the 10 issues were similar to those that the Committee to Bridge the Gap had already raised. Subsequently, the Deputy Secretary approved 13 issues to be addressed in the second supplement. In addition to the Academy\u2019s report, the new information on the Beatty facility, and the four other issues that the Committee to Bridge the Gap had recommended, Interior expanded the scope of the Indian sacred sites issue and added (1) the movement of radioactive elements in the soil, (2) alternative methods of disposal, (3) the potential introduction of nonnative plants, (4) waste transportation, (5) the state\u2019s long-term obligations, and (6) the public health impacts of operating the disposal facility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most of the Current Issues Were Previously Considered", "paragraphs": ["Except for the Academy\u2019s report and the new information about the Beatty facility, all of the issues that Interior will address in the second supplement had been considered earlier in the state\u2019s licensing proceeding; in the state\u2019s and the Bureau\u2019s joint environmental impact statement; and in the Bureau\u2019s first supplement of September 1993. According to the Council on Environmental Quality\u2019s regulations for implementing NEPA, however, when a federal agency has already addressed issues in an environmental impact statement, it must prepare a supplement to the statement when significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns has become available. An agency may also prepare a supplement when it determines that doing so will further the purposes of NEPA.", "Interior\u2019s announcement that it would prepare the second supplement did not state that the Academy\u2019s report and the new information on the Beatty facility constituted significant new circumstances or information that would require Interior to prepare a supplement. According to Interior, its decision to prepare the statement had been prompted by (1) the state\u2019s rejection of Interior\u2019s proposed land-transfer conditions and (2) the passage of 5 years since the initial environmental impact statement had been prepared.", "Other evidence indicates that Interior did not initially consider the Academy\u2019s report and the new information on Beatty significant enough to require a supplement. For example, the Secretary\u2019s public statement on the Academy\u2019s report said that the report \u201cprovides a qualified clean bill of health in relation to concerns about the site.\u201d According to the Secretary, with appropriate land-transfer conditions based on the recommendations of that report, the Secretary was \u201cnow confident that the transfer of the land is in the public interest.\u201d Also, when Interior announced that it would prepare the second supplement, it stated that the Survey\u2019s new information on the Beatty site indicated \u201clittle similarity with Ward Valley\u201d but underscored the need for continued scientific monitoring at both locations.", "Interior also did not compare the public comments it received with the state\u2019s licensing record or the previous environmental statements to provide a basis for identifying \u201csignificant\u201d new circumstances or information. According to the Bureau\u2019s Sacramento officials who are preparing the second supplement, whether or not there was any \u201cnew\u201d information was not important to the Bureau\u2019s deliberations about what issues should or should not be addressed in the supplement. For many of the issues, they said, what was \u201cnew\u201d was the public\u2019s concerns about the issues.", "The effect of the Ward Valley facility on Native Americans in the region is one example of an issue that had been addressed earlier by the state and the Bureau. In part, however, Interior plans to address Native American issues in the second supplement because of two recent Executive orders.One order requires federal agencies to accommodate access to and the ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites and avoid adversely affecting the integrity of such sites. The second order requires federal agencies to make \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d for low-income and minority populations (including Indian tribes) a part of their missions by identifying and addressing, as appropriate, the relatively high and adverse human health or environmental effects of their activities on these groups.", "To a significant degree, the state and the Bureau had addressed Native American issues in the site selection process, the state\u2019s licensing proceeding, and the 1991 environmental impact statement. The specific consultation steps, according to the 1991 statement, included an archaeological survey of the site with Native American participation. This survey found that no significant cultural resources were present at the site. In addition, US Ecology contacted the Indian tribes in the region to evaluate the potential cultural impacts of a regional nature. A site-specific walkabout by tribal representatives did not identify any unique cultural resources. According to US Ecology\u2019s license application, that part of Ward Valley where the proposed disposal site is located had once been disturbed by military tank maneuvers. Also, electric-power transmission lines cross the site, and a pit used to supply rock for highway construction is nearby. As recently as February 1997, The Director of the Bureau\u2019s Sacramento office stated in a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency that the affected tribes were fully represented and consulted in the scoping and descriptive phases of the 1991 environmental impact statement.", "Interior plans to assess compliance with the two Executive orders in the second supplement by addressing the effects that a disposal facility at Ward Valley could have on Native Americans\u2019 religious and cultural values, tourism, agricultural cultivation, and future economic developments, such as hotels and gambling casinos, along the Colorado River. The river is about 20 miles east of the Ward Valley site at its closest point.

The applicable state laws and regulations required the state to conduct a hearing in which the public makes brief oral statements and provide written comments. All comments were to be considered by the state and included in the written licensing record. Several individuals and groups unsuccessfully urged the state to conduct a public hearing on the license application using formal, trial-type procedures. However, a state appellate court found that the state had met the requirements of state law and regulations and an appeal of the court\u2019s decision was denied.", "California issued a license to US Ecology to build and operate a disposal facility for low-level radioactive waste at Ward Valley in accordance with the state\u2019s authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and related state laws and regulations. Interior, however, has not accepted the results of the state\u2019s licensing proceeding as an adequate basis for Interior to make a land-transfer decision. For example, in an August 11, 1993, letter to the governor of California, Interior\u2019s Secretary asked the state to conduct a formal public hearing as part of a credible process for determining if the site is appropriate so the Secretary can make a land-transfer decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interior Wants to Independently Determine If Ward Valley Is Suitable for a Disposal Facility", "paragraphs": ["FLPMA requires the Secretary of the Interior to ensure that federal lands transferred to other parties are properly used and protect the public interest.

In contrast, the current Secretary has asserted more overlap between Interior\u2019s and the state\u2019s respective responsibilities.

Moreover, Interior had not sought advice or assistance on the suitability of the site from NRC or, until recently, the Department of Energy (DOE), which have such expertise.", "Interior has not sought NRC\u2019s assistance in addressing issues about the suitability of the Ward Valley site for a disposal facility. In 1993, the Bureau verbally requested NRC\u2019s views on the adequacy of California\u2019s program for regulating radioactive materials, including the Ward Valley facility. NRC responded that it periodically reviews California\u2019s regulatory program to determine, as required by the Atomic Energy Act, if the state\u2019s program is compatible with NRC\u2019s program for regulating radioactive materials in states that have not agreed to assume this responsibility. On the basis of these periodic reviews, NRC said that it had concluded that the state has a highly effective regulatory program for low-level radioactive waste and is capable of conducting an effective and thorough review of US Ecology\u2019s license application for the Ward Valley facility.", "DOE had no role on the Ward Valley facility until February 1996, when Interior decided to perform the tritium tests at the site. Thereafter, DOE and Interior negotiated conditions under which Interior would use facilities at DOE\u2019s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to conduct one technical part of the tests. Interior officials subsequently told us that DOE\u2019s role in the testing has evolved into a partnership with Interior in setting up the test arrangements. The Interior officials also pointed out that federal agencies such as NRC and the Environmental Protection Agency are expected to comment on the second supplement.", "California and US Ecology do not agree that Interior is authorized to independently determine if the Ward Valley site is suitable for a disposal facility. Their position is that the regulation of radiological safety issues, such as migration of radionuclides, is the state\u2019s responsibility because of the state\u2019s agreement with NRC under the Atomic Energy Act. Therefore, they argue, radiological safety matters are outside of Interior\u2019s authority and expertise. As discussed earlier, the state and US Ecology have sued Interior. They have asked the court to order Interior to complete the sale of the land and declare that Interior had exceeded its authority with respect to protecting the public against radiation hazards.

In the case of Ward Valley, however, Interior has not accepted the state\u2019s findings in the area of radiological safety as adequate to permit Interior to decide on the land transfer. Instead, Interior has decided that it must independently determine if the site is suitable for a disposal facility.
