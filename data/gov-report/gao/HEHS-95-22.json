These issues include the government costs of providing benefits and services to illegal aliens and the impact illegal aliens\u2019 presence has on the employment of U.S. workers.", "In an effort to reduce the size of the nation\u2019s illegal alien population, estimated at 3 million to 5 million in 1986, the Congress enacted the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). IRCA reduced the size of the illegal alien population by granting legal status to certain aliens already in the country and attempted to deter the inflow of illegal aliens by prohibiting employers from hiring any alien not authorized to work.", "Despite a brief drop in illegal entries to the United States after IRCA was enacted, the size of the illegal alien population is now estimated to have exceeded the lower bound of the pre-IRCA estimate. INS and the Bureau of the Census estimated the population of illegal aliens ranged from 3.4 million to 3.8 million in 1992. At the same time, governments at all levels began experiencing fiscal crises that heightened public concerns about the costs of providing benefits and services to illegal aliens.", "Illegal aliens are not eligible for most federal benefit programs, including Supplemental Security Income, Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC), food stamps, unemployment compensation, and financial assistance for higher education. However, they may receive certain benefits that do not require legal immigration status as a condition of eligibility, such as Head Start and the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children. Furthermore, illegal aliens may apply for AFDC and food stamps on behalf of their U.S. citizen children. Though it is the child and not the parent in such cases who qualifies for the programs, benefits help support the child\u2019s family.", "Education, health care, and criminal justice are the major areas in which state and local governments incur costs for illegal aliens. Regarding education, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that states are prohibited from denying equal access to public elementary and secondary schools to illegal alien children. State and local governments bear over 90 percent of the cost of elementary and secondary education.", "To provide for certain medical services, the Congress in 1986 revised the Social Security Act to stipulate that illegal aliens are eligible for emergency services, including childbirth, under the Medicaid program. The federal government and the state of California each pay 50 percent of the cost of these benefits for illegal aliens in California. In California and New York, illegal aliens are also eligible to receive Medicaid prenatal services.", "States also incur costs for incarcerating illegal alien felons in state prisons and supervising those released on parole. Section 501 of IRCA authorizes the Attorney General to reimburse states for the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens convicted of state felonies.", "Illegal aliens generate revenues as well as costs; these revenues offset some of the costs that governments incur. Research studies indicate that illegal aliens do pay taxes, including federal and state income taxes, Social Security taxes, and sales, gasoline, and property taxes. Researchers disagree on the amount of the revenues illegal aliens generate and the extent to which these revenues offset government costs for benefits and services.

We also reviewed the revenue estimates for illegal aliens contained in California\u2019s September study and the Fiscal Impacts study. (California\u2019s January 1994 study did not include revenue estimates.) The California study included estimates for 13 types of federal, state, and local revenues; the Fiscal Impacts study\u2019s estimates were limited to 3 types of revenues. With assistance from Urban Institute researchers, we used the Fiscal Impacts study and another study published by the Urban Institute to extrapolate estimates for the remaining 10 types of revenues. This enabled us to compare the revenue estimates in the California and Fiscal Impacts studies. (See app. I for a detailed discussion of the methodology we used to develop these additional revenue estimates.)", "We convened a panel of experts in May 1994 to obtain their opinions regarding the reasonableness of California\u2019s January 1994 estimates and the underlying methodologies, and interviewed state officials and private researchers.

In conjunction with related work we have done for several congressional requesters on the national fiscal impact of illegal aliens, we also examined the relevant research on the costs and revenues\u2014at all levels of government\u2014associated with illegal aliens. Some of the issues raised in these studies were relevant to our review, and we have incorporated them in our analysis.", "Assessing California\u2019s cost estimates was complicated by the fact that the state\u2019s estimates are for California fiscal year 1994-95. That is, the estimates are projections of future costs and are only valid to the extent that the growth trends assumed in the projections hold true. We did not assess the validity of the growth trends. In addition, we did not independently verify California\u2019s administrative data for Medicaid and incarceration because we had no reason to believe that the data on expenditures and number of recipients in these programs presented any special concerns about reliability.", "We did our work between April and September 1994 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost Estimates Are Questionable Due to Limited Data and Varied Assumptions", "paragraphs": ["As of September 1994, California estimated that it will spend $2.35 billion on elementary and secondary education, Medicaid, and adult incarceration for illegal aliens in fiscal year 1994-95. California officials believe that these three programs represent the state\u2019s highest costs for illegal aliens. This estimate is $80 million lower than California\u2019s January 1994 estimate primarily because the education estimate was reduced.", "In the September estimate, California reduced its projections of the numbers of illegal aliens who will receive education or Medicaid services, or be incarcerated in state prisons. At the same time, however, this new estimate added in administrative costs not previously included and for education and adult incarceration, added capital costs. The net effect of these adjustments is shown in table 1.", "The Urban Institute\u2019s Fiscal Impacts study estimated costs lower than California\u2019s estimates for all three programs (see table 1). This is in part because the Fiscal Impacts study estimated costs for earlier years\u2014the education estimate was for the 1993-94 school year; Medicaid, for fiscal year 1992-93; and adult incarceration, for 1994. Other reasons for the lower estimates in the Fiscal Impacts study varied by program, as described in the following sections.", "The cost estimates in the California and Fiscal Impacts studies are questionable because of the limited direct data available on illegal aliens and certain assumptions made by the studies. For example, estimates of the cost of education\u2014the single largest cost associated with illegal aliens\u2014are based entirely on assumptions about the size and characteristics of the illegal alien population. However, by combining selected data and assumptions from both California\u2019s September 1994 estimates and the Fiscal Impacts study, we developed adjusted estimates for education and adult incarceration that we believe are more reasonable than either study\u2019s original estimates. We did not adjust the state\u2019s Medicaid estimate because the necessary data are not currently available.", "It is important to note that none of the estimates of education or incarceration costs represents the amount that would actually be saved if California did not educate or incarcerate illegal aliens. This is because the estimates are based on mean costs: total cost divided by total number of users. Mean costs include both variable costs, which are affected by the number of individuals using the service, and fixed costs\u2014such as certain administrative costs\u2014which are not. The amount that would be saved if illegal aliens did not receive these services could either be less than the mean costs or greater (for example, if new schools would otherwise have to be built)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Direct Data Precluded Developing Precise Education Cost Estimate", "paragraphs": ["The state of California now estimates that it will spend $1.5 billion to educate illegal alien children in fiscal year 1994-95. The Fiscal Impacts study estimated California\u2019s education costs at $1.3 billion for school year 1993-94. The Fiscal Impacts estimate was lower not only because it covered an earlier year, but also because the study relied on a different data source to develop its per pupil cost figure. Selecting the components of each estimate that we believe are more reasonable, we adjusted California\u2019s fiscal year 1994-95 estimate upward to $1.6 billion.", "The education cost estimates were derived by multiplying estimates of the following components: (1) the size of the state\u2019s illegal alien population, (2) the percentage of this population that is of school age, (3) the percentage of school-aged illegal aliens enrolled in school, (4) the percentage of school days actually attended, and (5) the statewide average cost per pupil. The studies used an indirect method to estimate the number of illegal alien children in school because school districts do not collect information on the immigration status of students. According to California state officials, many school districts believe the U.S. Supreme Court decision, Plyler v. Doe, prohibits them from asking about immigration status.", "To develop each of the cost components, the state of California and Urban Institute researchers relied on research studies and published estimates. For their estimates of the illegal alien population, California\u2019s September 1994 study and the Fiscal Impacts study used recently revised INS population estimates; the small difference between the two estimates can be explained by the different years being estimated (see table 2). For the adjusted estimate, we used California\u2019s September estimate of 1.7 million illegal aliens because it is for the same time period (fiscal year 1994-95).", "The state had previously estimated its illegal alien population at 2.3 million\u2014a figure that was probably too high. The basis of California\u2019s January 1994 population figure was a 1993 Census Bureau estimate of 2.1 million illegal aliens in California; the state assumed this population would grow by 100,000 each year. This assumption was based on the Census Bureau estimate that the illegal alien population is growing nationally by 200,000 each year and that about 50 percent of illegal aliens live in California. However, researchers at the Census Bureau and INS have recently estimated that the percentage living in California may be lower, ranging from about 38 to 45 percent. Moreover, INS estimates that the size of the illegal alien population is smaller, but growing more rapidly.", "California\u2019s September 1994 study and the Fiscal Impacts study both relied on an indirect method to estimate the percentage of the illegal alien population that is of school age and the percentage of school-aged illegal aliens enrolled in school. The method involves constructing a proxy population based on INS estimates of the breakdown of the illegal alien population by country of origin. The proxy population consists of people who entered the United States from countries that contribute most of the illegal alien population. The education cost estimates in the California and Fiscal Impacts studies are based on 1990 Census data on the age distribution and school enrollment of the studies\u2019 proxy populations.", "However, the studies differed in their assumptions about the appropriate age range to include\u2014the Fiscal Impacts study included illegal aliens aged 5 to 19, while California included those aged 5 to 17 in its estimate. This difference resulted in the Fiscal Impacts study estimating a higher percentage of school-aged illegal aliens, but a lower percentage enrolled in school, to adjust for the likelihood that fewer 18- and 19-year-olds attend high school (see table 2). For the adjusted estimate, we used the Fiscal Impacts study\u2019s assumptions for these two components of the cost estimate because data indicate some 18- and 19-year-olds do attend high school.", "California\u2019s September 1994 estimate included a component that adjusted its enrollment estimate, which was based on fall enrollment, for the percentage of school days actually attended (\u201caverage daily attendance\u201d). This adjustment was necessary because California\u2019s average cost per pupil is based on average daily attendance, not fall enrollment. This adjustment was not needed in the Fiscal Impacts study because its estimate of per pupil cost was based on fall enrollment. Our adjusted estimate used California\u2019s figure for the percentage of school days actually attended (98.2) because it also used California\u2019s figure for average cost per pupil with some adjustments (as explained in the following paragraphs).", "The per pupil cost figure California included in its September 1994 estimate was considerably higher than that used in its January 1994 estimate\u2014$4,977 compared with $4,217\u2014even though both estimates were for fiscal year 1994-95. Both figures were derived from a statewide average based on state and local public school expenditures. However, state officials told us that their September estimate included additional funding sources that are used to pay education costs, as well as some additional costs (for example, debt service costs on bonds for school facilities and certain administrative costs).", "The Fiscal Impacts study, in contrast, used state-specific data on current expenditures from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The study used these data to develop standardized cost estimates for the seven states included in the study. However, while the NCES data are one possible source of education cost data, there is no agreed-upon standard on the expenditures that should be included in calculating per pupil costs, according to the authors of the Fiscal Impacts study and budget and education experts we spoke with. Using the NCES data produced a lower estimate of California\u2019s per pupil costs ($4,199) because the data do not include the range of funding sources used in the state\u2019s cost estimate, nor do they include capital costs such as debt service on bonds.", "For the adjusted estimate, we used California\u2019s September 1994 per pupil cost figure but subtracted two questionable cost items to yield an adjusted figure of $4,830. The state had included $78 per pupil for adult education costs; state officials acknowledged that this amount should not have been included. In addition, we subtracted the interest portion of the debt service cost\u2014$69 per pupil. Experts disagree about how to treat debt service in calculating per pupil expenditures; however, we identified OMB cost principles that may provide a standard for treating such capital costs. These cost principles establish standards for determining the allowable costs of federal grants, contracts, and other agreements administered by state and local governments. The OMB cost principles specify that depreciation is an allowable cost, but interest payments are not.", "Experts we spoke with suggested that statewide average cost data may not be the best measure of the costs of providing illegal alien children with a public education. They suggested that researchers should instead use estimates based on the costs incurred by districts where illegal aliens are believed to be most heavily concentrated, such as Los Angeles County. However, the Fiscal Impacts study reported, and state officials concurred, that the necessary data are not available.

Instead, it developed a \u201cbenchmark\u201d cost range for purposes of comparison. However, it is questionable whether this benchmark provides a good basis for comparison.", "We made no adjustments to the state of California\u2019s Medicaid estimate because the data needed to correct for elements that lead to possible over- or understatement of costs are not currently available. The state\u2019s estimate was based on administrative cost data for services provided to all individuals eligible for emergency Medicaid services only, not just illegal aliens. California\u2019s estimate may thus include some legal aliens because, at the time this estimate was developed, agency officials were legally prevented from inquiring about the immigration status of people who applied for emergency Medicaid benefits. California state officials do not have data on the extent to which legal aliens may be receiving these limited benefits.", "California officials told us that their cost estimate does not include all the illegal aliens they are serving under the Medicaid program. They said it does not include costs for illegal aliens who (1) are tracked in other eligibility categories, such as those for pregnant women and children, or (2) provide fraudulent documents to get full Medicaid benefits. However, state officials noted that they do not have data on the costs of Medicaid services provided to these illegal aliens.", "The Fiscal Impacts study used Medicaid data on formerly illegal aliens who were granted legal status under IRCA as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d against which to assess the estimates of the seven states included in the study. The legalized alien population has many of the same characteristics as the current illegal alien population and, therefore, provides a useful basis for comparison, according to this study. The estimated range that the Fiscal Impacts study used to assess California\u2019s Medicaid estimate\u2014$113 million to $167 million\u2014was considerably lower than the state\u2019s estimate for people receiving emergency services only (see table 3). Some of the difference between California\u2019s Medicaid estimates and those in the Fiscal Impacts study may be due to California\u2019s inclusion of certain legal aliens in its estimate.", "However, differences between legalized and illegal aliens\u2019 use of Medicaid may also explain why California\u2019s estimate was higher. For example, the Fiscal Impacts study acknowledged that illegal aliens may be more likely than legalized aliens to use emergency Medicaid services because they know their immigration status will not be questioned. In addition, California\u2019s administrative data indicate that illegal aliens have somewhat higher average Medicaid expenditures than aliens who were granted legal status under IRCA. Furthermore, differences in demographic characteristics of the two populations suggest that they may differ in their ability to qualify for Medicaid. In sum, these considerations raise doubt about whether the Fiscal Impacts study\u2019s benchmark cost range was based on a comparable population.", "California state officials\u2019 inability to ask about immigration status has, they believe, hindered their ability to fully account for all illegal aliens receiving Medicaid. The state court injunction that prohibited officials from asking applicants for emergency Medicaid benefits about their immigration status was initially overturned by the California Court of Appeal. However, the injunction is currently in effect pending a decision from the California Supreme Court.

As part of its study, the Commission has convened a task force of independent experts to review some of the estimates of aliens\u2019 fiscal impact and develop a better understanding of how to measure this impact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our review of estimates of the fiscal impact of illegal aliens shows that the credibility of such estimates is likely to be a persistent issue, given the limited data available on this population and differences in key assumptions and methodologies used to develop the estimates. For example, the studies we examined differed in their treatment of capital costs, the age groups they used to estimate education costs, and their methodologies for estimating revenues.", "While it probably will be difficult to obtain better data on the illegal alien population, greater agreement about appropriate assumptions and methodologies could help narrow the range of estimated costs and revenues. We believe state and federal officials need to reach consensus on the approaches that should be used in developing estimates of illegal aliens\u2019 net fiscal impact. This consensus would not necessarily produce estimates that are completely accurate, but at least it would produce estimates viewed as reasonable, given the limited data available. Instead of being confronted with an array of competing estimates, lawmakers would have information that would be more useful in assessing illegal aliens\u2019 fiscal impact."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We obtained written comments on a draft of this report from California state officials and the Urban Institute researchers who authored the Fiscal Impacts study. While California officials found no factual errors in the report, they argued that the report overstates data problems associated with estimates of costs for illegal aliens. They also maintained that the different studies\u2019 cost estimates were essentially identical. However, we found that the estimates did vary; moreover, most were based on indirect methods whose reliability is unknown. As noted in this report, we identified a number of problems with the cost estimates for education, Medicaid, and incarceration. California officials also provided comments on the Medicaid section that we incorporated where appropriate. (See app. III.)", "Urban Institute researchers agreed with our assessment of the different estimates and their relative strengths and weaknesses. The researchers also provided technical comments that we incorporated where appropriate.

An earlier study, Immigrants and Taxes: A Reappraisal of Huddle\u2019s \u201cThe Cost of Immigrants\u201d (the Immigrants and Taxes study), estimated 13 types of federal, state, and local revenues from illegal aliens in the United States for 1992. We used these studies to develop estimates of five types of state and local revenues (state excise tax, state lottery revenue, local sales tax, state vehicle license and registration fees, and state gasoline tax) and five types of federal revenues (income tax, excise tax, Federal Insurance Contributions Act [FICA] tax, unemployment insurance tax, and gasoline tax) from illegal aliens in California in 1992.", "The first section summarizes the methodology used by the two studies to estimate revenues from illegal aliens.
