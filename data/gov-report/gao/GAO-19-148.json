However, other ongoing challenges remain, including the marketability of VA properties and VA's lack of clear procedures for property disposals. While VA has guidance on disposals at the broad portfolio level, GAO determined that this guidance does not contain step-by-step procedures at the project level to assist facilities' managers to plan, implement, and execute disposals for the different disposal options. (See figure.) For example, a number of managers told GAO that they were not familiar with actions to take when transferring properties to a third party or turning over excess property to the General Services Administration for disposal.

On disposal projects, however, VA lacks certain information, such as the status of environmental or historical reviews, to monitor progress. According to VA, the Capital Asset Inventory currently does not have enough capacity to collect key information and supporting documentation. VA officials said they plan to increase the capacity, but VA has not yet included some key information in the Capital Asset Inventory that could enable VA to monitor the progress of disposals.

These external stakeholders included officials from the General  Services Administration (GSA), veteran service organizations (e.g.,  Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion), a local community  that purchased VA properties, a major commercial real estate company,  and historic preservation groups (e.g. Advisory Council on Historic  Preservation and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation  Officers). The 31 properties we selected were either disposed of in fiscal  year 2017 or planning was underway for disposal, including disposals  through GSA. Specifically, we selected properties that (1) captured a  range of disposal methods available to VA either planned or completed  and (2) represented a variety of property characteristics, including  historical status, age, and size. To examine the characteristics of VA\u2019s  vacant and disposed of properties and to select the 31 properties, we  obtained and analyzed data from VA\u2019s Capital Asset Inventory (CAI) for  fiscal years 2012 through 2017 and assessed the reliability of the data.

Although VA does not maintain data  on how long these reviews can take or how long it takes to dispose of its  properties, in our review of 31 selected properties, we found variation in  the timespan to conduct environmental and historic reviews. The  environmental reviews of these properties took about 2 years on average  to complete, depending on the condition of the property. For example,   an environmental review of temporary storage facilities in Biloxi took  about a year, as no environmental issues were identified. In another case,  it took about 2 years to conduct an environmental review of VA\u2019s  Cincinnati-Fort Thomas property, as asbestos and lead paint were  identified during the course of the review. For those disposals requiring  historic reviews, we found that it took about 5 years on average,  depending on the complexity of the disposal. For example, it took 5  years to complete a historic review of the St. Louis, Jefferson Barracks  property due to the need to collaborate with multiple stakeholders,  including the neighboring Army National Guard base, the state\u2019s historic  preservation office, local community council, community organizations,  and many veteran service organizations; and addressing the adverse  effects on historic properties, according to VA officials. VA officials and  stakeholders we spoke with stated that due to lack of staff expertise and  resources, VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers may choose to contract  out these reviews, but procuring contractors may also add time to the  disposal process, as facility managers need to define the terms of work  and identify contractors.", "Further, environmental and historic reviews can affect VA\u2019s decision- making process with regard to choosing a disposal method, potentially  lengthening the time it takes for disposal. For example, VA officials told us  that they began a historic review on the Pittsburgh-Highland Drive  property in 2012 but discontinued the review in 2013, partially due to  disagreements with historic preservation stakeholders about the proposed  demolition of some historic buildings. After 4 years, in 2017, VA decided  to declare the property as excess and turn it over to GSA for disposal.  According to VA officials, this required a different historic review, as it  entailed a different disposal method. GSA is currently administering the  additional historic review of this property.", "VA has begun taking actions to reduce the time it takes to conduct  environmental and historic reviews as part of VA\u2019s initiative to begin the  process of re-using or disposing of 430 vacant buildings within 2 years.  For example, VA worked with the Advisory Council on Historic  Preservation to obtain a program comment alternative to reduce time  spent with historic preservation stakeholders when consulting on  \u201cancillary utilitarian support buildings and structures,\u201d such as a boiler  plant or a sewage plant. VA officials also told us that they established a  headquarters-level working group consisting of experts in historic  preservation and environmental reviews as well as real property  transactions to assist VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers in  administering disposals, including conducting these reviews, and in  moving them forward. VA officials also told us that they awarded four  regional contracts with contractors to complete the environmental and  historic reviews and expedite the disposal process.", "VA officials and historic preservation stakeholders we spoke with also  said they can have disagreements on how to meet the historic review  requirements, and such disputes can add time to the review process. The  historic preservation stakeholders commented that VA does not consult  with them early in the disposal\u2019s decision-making process and does not  provide adequate information on the adverse effects of demolishing a  historic property as well as other potential methods through which VA  could dispose of a property. VA officials we spoke with stated that they  have been consulting with historic preservation stakeholders on all  disposal projects as required.", "To improve collaboration and communication between VA and external  stakeholders, VA developed a toolkit in June 2017 on how to effectively  communicate with stakeholders. This communications toolkit responded  to our recommendation for VA to develop and distribute guidance for  VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers to use when communicating with  stakeholders on facility alignment changes, and we subsequently closed  this recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competing Priorities", "paragraphs": ["VA officials and stakeholders we spoke with also pointed out that  competing priorities for VA funds is another remaining challenge. VA  officials stated that projects to demolish buildings compete for funding  with other capital projects, such as renovating inpatient units. Since VA\u2019s  mission is to provide health care services, demolishing buildings is not as  high a priority compared to other projects that may lead to providing  better health care services.", "VA officials also told us that competing priorities can affect how long it  takes to dispose of vacant properties. If a demolition project is part of a  construction project, then VA may give it a relatively high priority for  funding. For example, at VA\u2019s Dayton campus it took about a year from  when VA requested funding in 2016 to demolish two historic buildings in  2017. A VA official said that due to a $1 million donation to build a Fisher  House on VA\u2019s Dayton campus, funds were prioritized to demolish two  national historic landmark buildings to make space available for  construction of the Fisher House. However, according to other VA  officials, demolition projects in and of themselves do not rank well for  funding; such rankings can affect the time it takes for disposal.", "For example, a VA official said that VA had initially planned to demolish a  temporary building on the Cleveland Wade Park campus sometime during  the 2012-to-2013 time frame; however, VA did not demolish the  temporary building until 2017, in part due to the longer than expected time  it took for VA to allocate funds to this project. If funds are not available for  demolition, a building can remain vacant for many years. For example,  VA closed several properties on its Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center  campus in North Hills, CA, after they sustained major damage from the  1994 Northridge earthquake. According to VA officials, competing funding  priorities, among other factors, contributed to the long wait to demolish  these vacant properties, which had not been disposed of as of October  2018 (see fig. 7). VA officials also noted that waiting for VA to allocate  funds to demolish properties can result in additional potential cost later  on. For instance, VA officials mentioned that since buildings on the  Sepulveda campus have been vacant for many years, they now qualified  for historic status, requiring them to undergo a historic review\u2014a  requirement that could have been avoided if VA had demolished them  more than 20 years ago when they were originally identified for disposal.", "VA officials and stakeholders we spoke with identified property  characteristics that affect the marketability of VA properties\u2014historic  status, deficient physical conditions, location, unusable building  configuration, and repair costs\u2014as barriers for disposal. This is a long- standing challenge that limits VA\u2019s ability to re-use or dispose of vacant  and underutilized properties. In our recent analysis of VA\u2019s CAI data, we  found that a majority of VA\u2019s vacant properties (about 78 percent) from  fiscal years 2012 through 2017 have an historic status, and the average  age of those vacant properties is about 91 years old. As discussed  earlier, historic reviews can be lengthy and can make the disposal  process challenging, according to VA officials. Also, older buildings are  likely to have configurations that are difficult to use or are in need of  significant repair.", "VA officials and stakeholders said that the location of VA properties limits  disposal options. For example, a VA official told us that demolition is  sometimes the only disposal option available when a deficient building is  located on an existing VA campus and cannot be re-used or disposed of  and removed from VA\u2019s inventory. VA officials also stated that historic  buildings are frequently located in the middle of a campus and sometimes  cannot be easily demolished due to the historic designation (see fig. 8).  In these cases, VA will close and \u201cmothball\u201d the building to minimize  maintenance and operations costs and let the buildings sit vacant as an  interim measure. VA officials commented that there are also safety and  security challenges associated with disposing of or re-using a building  located in the middle of a VA campus. For example, a local facility  manager told us that when two of its buildings on campus were leased  out to an organization on a short-term lease for use as dormitories, young  adults from the dormitories gained access to private inpatient areas,  violating patients\u2019 privacy. This is consistent with our previous findings  that many disposable VA properties located in the middle of medical  campuses draw limited private sector interest making some disposal  options challenging.", "VA officials and stakeholders we spoke with\u2014including commercial real  estate experts\u2014also indicated that it can be difficult to attract developers  for several reasons. In one instance, a VA official and a stakeholder we  spoke with told us that it took multiple years to identify developers that  would take on environmental mitigation efforts as part of the negotiated  sale and transfer of VA\u2019s properties to the City of Fort Thomas, Kentucky.  According to a stakeholder, developers were not willing to take on the  cost and risk of environmental mitigation without a title to the property and  no guaranteed income from the property. VA, however, could not transfer  the property title to a third party without first meeting federal standards for  cleaning up the environmental hazards on the properties. While the  issue was ultimately addressed, it took several years to complete the  deal."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Lacks Clear Procedures to Manage Property Disposals", "paragraphs": ["Another challenge that VA officials and stakeholders raised was VA\u2019s lack  of clear disposal procedures. Several VA officials and stakeholders we  spoke with stated that it is unclear what specific steps need to be taken for disposals, what are the targeted time frames for completing those steps, and who is responsible for completing them.", "VA\u2019s guidance on managing underutilized properties and disposals  provides policies and procedures on a portfolio level, such as VA\u2019s  priorities for disposing of vacant properties and the different disposal  options available. However, VA\u2019s guidance does not specify sequential  steps and actions that need to be taken at the project level to plan,  implement, and execute property disposals for VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019  managers. Further, a VA official in headquarters told us that VA does  not have formal guidance on selecting any particular disposal methods.", "While we found that documentation on policies and procedures exists for  some specific disposal methods, such as enhanced-use lease projects,  VA officials told us that policies and procedures for other disposal actions,  such as transferring or declaring property as excess and disposing of it  through GSA, are not documented. A VA official in headquarters told us  that informal guidance may exist in some VISNs, but no standardized  procedures on managing a disposal project is available. VA officials said  there are no step-by-step procedures to refer to when using a disposal  options more complex than demolishing a building. A VISN facilities\u2019  manager we spoke with further pointed out that a decision-tree to help  plan, implement, and execute for the different disposal methods does not  exists to help local facilities navigate through VA\u2019s decentralized and  complex disposal process.", "VA officials told us that its disposal process is decentralized, an approach  that can contribute to unclear procedures for disposal projects. According  to VA officials, VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers are responsible for  making disposal decisions, developing a disposal plan, and executing the  disposal. As previously discussed, different VA program offices are  responsible for different disposal actions, depending on the disposal  method that VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers are considering. VA  officials noted that this decentralized approach to managing disposals can  make it difficult for VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers as well as local  stakeholders to know when or how best to coordinate with the appropriate  VA offices. A real property stakeholder we spoke with also noted that  common uncertainties in working with VA, such as its lack of a clear and  timely disposal process, can hinder developers\u2019 interests in VA properties.  Specifically, the stakeholder stated that VA\u2019s decision-making process is  divided among different entities within VA, a situation that may add time  to the disposal process, and stated that having a clear and timely disposal  process may provide a level of certainty for developers.", "VA officials and stakeholders also said that in some cases, VISNs\u2019 and  local facilities\u2019 managers may lack the knowledge and experience to  manage disposals. For example, VA officials told us that while facility  managers generally know what actions are needed to demolish  properties, they are not familiar with actions that need to be taken for  transferring or selling properties to a third party or turning excess property  over to GSA for disposal. VA officials also mentioned staff turnover and  the infrequency of disposals as contributing factors to staff\u2019s lack of  knowledge on procedures for disposing of properties. For example, two  facilities\u2019 managers we spoke with said that in their many years of working  for VA they have never reported a property as excess and disposed of it  through GSA, until recently. VA officials and stakeholders further noted  that VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers may lack expertise conducting  historic and environmental reviews as they are usually engineers, who  are not experts on environmental and historic issues. For example, a  VISN facility manager informed us that a local facility manager was not  familiar with administering an environmental review, a lack that led to a  misstep in the review and duplication of work and added time to the  disposal process.", "While VA has policies and guidance on historic and environmental  reviews, our review of these documents showed that they do not provide  guidance on how to make decisions, what actions to take, what are the targeted time frames for taking those actions, and who should be completing those actions.", "Further, while VA officials with experience in disposals may estimate how  long these reviews can take, VA does not have documented guidance on  estimated time frames (milestones) for taking those actions.", "Federal internal controls call for documentation to help management  oversee execution of procedures by establishing and communicating the  \u201cwho, what, when, where, and why\u201d to personnel. Documentation also  provides a means to retain organizational knowledge and mitigate the risk  of having that knowledge limited to a few personnel and a means to  communicate that knowledge as needed to external parties, such as  external auditors or interested third parties. Federal internal controls also  call for management to define objectives in specific terms\u2014in this case,  disposal actions\u2014so they are understood at all levels of the entity. This  understanding involves clearly defining what is to be achieved, who is to  achieve it, how it will be achieved, and the estimated time frames for  achievement. Without procedural documentation that describes the  disposal options and the actions needed to carry out the disposal,  including estimated time frames, it is difficult for VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019  managers to plan, implement, and execute the different disposal options  available and efficiently dispose of vacant properties.", "A procedural document at the project level may include information on  who is authorized to make decisions and include estimated time frames  around historic and environmental reviews to ensure timely and  appropriate disposal of VA properties. For example, VA officials with  experience in disposals estimated that it should take about 6-to-8 months  for a property disposal, if there are no environmental and historic issues  involved and funding is available. For disposals where environmental and  historic reviews are needed, those officials told us it should take about 2- to-4 years from when VA decided to dispose of a property to complete the  disposal.

One facility manager told us that  VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office is \u201cactively pushing\u201d local managers to  update this information, and the data in the CAI have improved as a  result.", "Generating \u201cdiscrepancy reports\u201d to identify problems with  inaccurate or outdated property data in the CAI. VA officials in  headquarters told us that facility managers review these reports and  explain any identified discrepancies regarding vacant properties,  including those identified for disposal. VA officials told us they then  correct any errors. Discrepancy reports include checks on whether  facility managers have specified a disposal method for each disposal,  estimated an associated disposal\u2019s cost, and entered a planned future  year for the disposal.", "Refining the database by, for example, adding new \u201cbusiness  rules\u201d to limit user errors. VA officials told us that since 2012 it has  implemented program changes and new business rules to the CAI  database to address inaccuracies in the data, including data that  support disposal information. For example, a VA official in  headquarters told us that to decrease the number of errors caused by  users entering data more than once, the database now limits the  number of times users may enter the same information. This prevents  multiple data entries appearing for, for example, the year a building  was built, according to VA officials. VA officials in headquarters also  told us they developed similar business rules to identify \u201cclearly  wrong\u201d data entries and duplicative data. For instance, users cannot  enter letters in numeric fields which, they told us, has led to fewer  errors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Does Not Collect Key Information to Track and Monitor Property Disposals", "paragraphs": ["Although VA has enhanced its data collection efforts for vacant  properties, we found that VA does not collect all the information  necessary for its headquarters officials to track and monitor the disposal  of VA\u2019s vacant properties. As part of its annual call for validating data, VA  requires facility managers to record certain information about disposals in  the CAI, including: which buildings are identified for disposal, whether a disposal plan is in place, when the disposal is to occur, what type of disposal method is to be used, and what are the costs associated with the disposal.", "However, VA does not have the ability in its CAI to collect detailed data  on the status of disposal projects\u2014specifically, data fields for facility  managers to input detailed information on the status of: (1) disposal  actions, (2) due diligence reviews, and (3) approvals, such as  environmental permits that are necessary to complete the disposal.  Since CAI does not have this information, VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office,  as part of the Secretary\u2019s initiative to begin the re-use or disposal process  of 430 buildings, developed a standalone spreadsheet to track and  monitor the disposal status of these buildings. Then, according to officials  in VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office, they had to ask local facility managers  what was the status of each individual disposal.", "Federal internal-control standards state that management should use  quality information to achieve an entity\u2019s objectives and establish and  operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and  evaluate the results. This includes management obtaining data on a  timely basis and using it for effective monitoring, which includes controls  to achieve complete and accurate data. While the Secretary\u2019s initiative  has raised the priority of tracking and monitoring VA\u2019s real property  disposals, the CAI does not contain key information to improve VA\u2019s  routine tracking as called for in internal controls. A key official in VA\u2019s  Asset Enterprise Office told us that officials there usually leave it to local  facilities to track key information and that the CAI currently does not  collect this information. Without incorporating information needed to better  track and monitor disposals through VA\u2019s primary real property tracking  database\u2014CAI\u2014VA may not be able to efficiently track and monitor its  real property disposals going forward after the Secretary\u2019s initiative is  completed. VA officials in headquarters told us that without data on the  actions and status of disposals, including steps taken to complete  environmental and historic reviews, they are unable to track and monitor  the progress of disposal projects\u2014including the length of time these  reviews take\u2014and to identify any areas where management may assist  local facilities in disposing of properties. For instance, as previously  mentioned, VA officials in headquarters told us they used the information  gathered as part of the 430 re-use or disposal initiative to identify and  award contracts to perform environmental and historic reviews and, as a  result, more quickly expedited the disposal process.", "In addition, VA officials in headquarters do not collect documentation,  such as environmental and historical review documents, that could allow  headquarters staff to verify the status of disposal projects. As mentioned,  federal internal controls state that management should use quality  information to achieve an entity\u2019s objective, including obtaining data on a  timely basis and using these data for effective monitoring, which includes  controls to achieve complete and accurate data. Further, VA requires  VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers to record a planned or completed  disposal in the CAI, including updating information as changes occur.  However, a key official in VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office told us the CAI  database does not currently have enough space for facility managers to  upload supporting documentation, including environmental and historic  review documents. As part of the Secretary\u2019s initiative to begin the re-use  or disposal process for 430 buildings, VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise Office set up  a website to collect and exchange documents, such as environmental and  historic review documents from local facility managers. This process  allowed VA\u2019s Asset Enterprise staff to verify the disposal information of  the properties in the spreadsheet using this collected information. While  VA created a website to exchange documentation as part of the 430 re- use or disposal initiative, this website is separate from CAI and was  created because VA had not previously collected supporting documents  in CAI. However, a VA official told us that when they compared  information they collected from the website, they found the information in  CAI is not always correct and appropriately updated.", "As we have previously found, documentation provides a means to retain  organizational knowledge while mitigating the risk of having that  knowledge limited to a few personnel. Documentation can also ensure  that knowledge gets communicated to external parties, such as external  auditors. As previously mentioned, some VA staff lack expertise and  organizational knowledge to properly document a variety of disposal  options. VA also experiences frequent staff turnover. These issues,  together with the inability of facilities\u2019 managers to upload disposal-related  documents directly into CAI, puts VA at risk of losing valuable information  about the disposal process. For example, according to a stakeholder we  spoke with, VA could not readily provide information about consulting  stakeholders on historic properties, as required by historic review  requirements. A VA official told us that after contacting facility managers  for information about specific disposal projects as part of the 430  initiative, they found disposal procedures were not consistently  documented and, in some cases, documents were missing.", "VA officials in headquarters provided us with a draft proposal to enhance  the CAI in several ways, including:  to add specific data fields for dates, including completion dates for  reviews and  to increase the capacity of the CAI to allow facility managers to upload  disposal documentation, including environmental and historic review  documentation.", "However, the proposed changes do not include some key information,  such as the start dates for compliance reviews, so VA cannot monitor and  track when the reviews began and how disposals are progressing.  Additionally, a VA official we spoke with could not provide a specific time  frame for increasing the capacity of CAI, as VA is currently working on  developing space requirements that are needed to increase capacity and  help estimate a time frame."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given that the number of VA\u2019s vacant buildings has been generally  increasing in the last 6 years and the implementation of the VA Asset and  Infrastructure Review Act of 2018 could lead to more unneeded buildings,  effectively managing VA\u2019s real property disposal is crucial. Otherwise, VA  may maintain a large inventory of vacant buildings that may be costly to  secure and maintain. While effectively disposing of excess and  underutilized property has been a long-standing challenge for VA, the  agency has taken some positive actions, such as examining ways to  streamline the historic review process, having some documented  procedures, and improving data collection efforts on vacant properties.  However, without documented procedures for all the disposal options to  assist VISNs\u2019 and local facilities\u2019 managers in planning, implementing,  and executing disposals and navigating the complex property-disposal  process, VISNs and local facilities\u2014which are responsible for managing  their real property\u2014may continue to struggle to facilitate property  disposals efficiently.

The Secretary should develop clear procedures for each of VA\u2019s  disposal options to help facilities\u2019 managers plan, implement, and  execute projects to dispose of vacant and unneeded properties.  (Recommendation 1)  2.  As VA implements its plans to enhance the CAI to collect key data on  disposal projects, the Secretary should collect data on disposal status  information and time frames (e.g., environmental and historical  reviews\u2019 starting dates) to ensure VA has the information it needs to  track the length of the disposal process and identify any areas where  management may assist local facilities in implementing property  disposals. (Recommendation 2)  3.  As VA pursues its plans to enhance the CAI, the Secretary should  increase the capacity of the CAI to allow local facilities to upload  disposal-specific documentation, such as environmental- and  historical-review documents, to ensure all documentation related to a  property\u2019s disposal is available to appropriate parties, including VA  officials.

To examine the full scope and extent of VA\u2019s vacant and  disposed of properties, we obtained and analyzed data from VA\u2019s Capital  Asset Inventory for fiscal years 2012 through 2017 and assessed their  reliability. To assess the reliability of VA\u2019s data we: (1) looked for any  missing data, outliers, or other obvious data errors; (2) reviewed existing  documentation about the data and the system that produced them; (3)  reviewed VA\u2019s processes for checking and validating the data; and (4)  interviewed officials knowledgeable about the data.

Specifically, we selected  properties that:  captured a range of disposal methods available to VA using VA\u2019s  current process for disposal,  included both recently planned and completed disposals to observe  disposals in different phases of planning and were likely documented  by current VA staff, and  represented a variety of building and disposal characteristics,  including associated disposal costs, historic status, age, and size.", "The challenges faced by these selected properties cannot be used to  make inferences about all VA properties. However, they illustrate the  range of challenges that VA faces in disposing of properties.", "In addition, to help identify disposal challenges VA faces, including those  challenges that were identified as a lengthy time frame for disposal, we  obtained and reviewed documents related to the 31 selected properties,  including environmental review reports and historic review documents.  We used environmental and historic review documents to help estimate  the timespan for disposals, including time frames to conduct these  reviews. We also conducted semi-structured interviews with VA officials  and external stakeholders, who were involved or knowledgeable about  the disposal of these selected properties and are familiar with VA\u2019s  disposal process. These included interviews with facility managers from  VA\u2019s Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) and local facilities who  were knowledgeable about the disposal of the 31 selected properties.
