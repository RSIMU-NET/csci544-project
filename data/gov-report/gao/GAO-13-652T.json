Although these companies do not consider foreign-manufactured equipment to be their most pressing security threat, their brand image and profitability depend on providing secure, reliable service. In the absence of industry or government standards on the use of this equipment, companies have adopted a range of voluntary risk-management practices. These practices span the life cycle of equipment and cover areas such as selecting vendors, establishing vendor security requirements, and testing and monitoring equipment. Equipment that is considered critical to the functioning of the network is likely to be subject to more stringent security requirements, according to these companies. In addition to these efforts, companies are collaborating on the development of industry security standards and best practices and participating in information-sharing efforts within industry and with the federal government.", "The federal government has begun efforts to address the security of the supply chain for commercial networks. In 2013, the President issued an Executive Order to create a framework to reduce cyber risks to critical infrastructure. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)--a component within the Department of Commerce--is responsible for leading the development of the cybersecurity framework, which is to provide technology-neutral guidance to critical infrastructure owners and operators. NIST published a request for information in which NIST stated it is conducting a comprehensive review to obtain stakeholder input and develop the framework. NIST officials said the extent to which supply chain security of commercial communications networks will be incorporated into the framework is dependent in part on the input it receives from stakeholders. GAO identified other federal efforts that could impact communications supply chain security, but the results of those efforts were considered sensitive.", "There are a variety of other approaches for addressing the potential risks posed by foreign-manufactured equipment in commercial communications networks, including those approaches taken by foreign governments. For example, the Australian government is considering a proposal to establish a risk-based regulatory framework that requires network providers to be able to demonstrate competent supervision and effective controls over their networks. The government would also have the authority to use enforcement measures to address noncompliance. In the United Kingdom, the government requires network and service providers to manage risks to network security and can impose financial penalties for serious security breaches. While these approaches are intended to improve supply chain security of communications networks, they may also create the potential for trade barriers, additional costs, and constraints on competition, which the federal government would have to take into account if it chose to pursue such approaches."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to testify at today\u2019s hearing on federal and  industry efforts related to communications supply chain security. The  United States, like many other nations, is reliant on commercial  communications networks for business and personal communication as  well as for matters of national and economic security. Public and private  organizations rely on computer systems to transmit sensitive and  proprietary information, develop and maintain intellectual capital, conduct  operations, process business transactions, transfer funds, and deliver  services. In addition, the Internet has grown increasingly important to  American business and consumers, serving as a medium for hundreds of  billions of dollars of commerce each year. Many communications-based  applications and services, including local and long-distance telephone  calls, email, text messages, file transfers, and on-demand video  programming, depend on effectively operating communications networks.  Government, industry, and the public rely on communications networks to  such a great degree that federal policy has included them in a category of  national assets deemed critical infrastructure, making their protection a  national priority. Many other critical infrastructure sectors such as  banking and finance, energy, transportation systems, and water also rely  on communications networks to sustain their operation. In addition, we  have identified protecting systems that support our nation\u2019s cyber critical  infrastructure as a government-wide high-risk area.", "U.S. communications networks are, by and large, owned, operated, and  safeguarded by the private sector. Network providers are dependent on a  global supply chain to provide equipment\u2014such as routers, switches,  and elements of evolved packet cores\u2014that is used to transport a high  volume of aggregated voice and data traffic over their commercial  communications networks. According to several network providers, very  little of this equipment is manufactured in the United States. Equipment  manufacturers\u2014including those headquartered in the United States\u2014are  heavily dependent on facilities in foreign countries to design,  manufacture, and assemble their products. This dependence on foreign- manufactured equipment is viewed by some federal entities as an  emerging threat that introduces potential risks to the networks.  According to the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive, \u201cthe  globalization of the economy has placed critical links in the manufacturing  supply chain under the direct control of U.S. adversaries.\u201d A potential  enemy or criminal group has a number of ways to potentially exploit  vulnerabilities in the communications equipment supply chain, such as  placing malicious code in the components that could compromise the  security and resilience of the networks.", "Recent government efforts in the United States and other countries  highlight concerns about the potential impact of supply chain threats on  government, industry, and personal communications and transactions.  Legislative proposals in the United States have sought to improve the  protection of critical infrastructure, such as commercial communications  networks, from cyber attacks., Likewise, the White House released an  Executive Order and a presidential policy directive in February 2013 that  seek to improve the protection of critical infrastructure, including  communications networks, from cyber attacks. In 2012, the House  Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittees on Oversight and  Investigations, and Communications and Technology held a series of  hearings that addressed, among other things, cybersecurity threats to  communication networks. The House Permanent Select Committee on  Intelligence released a report in October 2012 in which it recommended  the United States view with suspicion the continued penetration of the  U.S. telecommunications market by Chinese telecommunications  companies. To help protect against the potential national security risks,  the committee further recommended that U.S.-based network providers  consider the long-term security risks associated with purchasing products  or services from specific foreign-based equipment manufacturers. Other  countries\u2014such as Australia, India, and the United Kingdom\u2014are  similarly concerned about the emerging threats to their commercial  communication networks posed by the global supply chain and have  taken actions to improve their ability to address this security challenge.", "You asked us to examine private-sector and government actions to  respond to the potential security risks posed by the use of foreign- manufactured equipment.

We also asked federal agencies  to identify statutes and regulations related to the federal government\u2019s  legal and regulatory authority over how communications network  providers ensure the security of their U.S. commercial networks. We  interviewed commercial communications network providers and  equipment manufacturers that supply providers with routers, switches,  and evolved packet cores to discuss their approaches for ensuring the  security of the equipment used in commercial communications networks.  We focused this work on the five wireless and five wireline network  providers with the highest revenue and the eight manufacturers of routers  and switches with the largest market share in the United States. We did  not test the effectiveness of the practices identified by the federal  government, communication network providers, or equipment  manufacturers.", "Additionally, through a review of government and academic studies and  interviews with stakeholders, we identified and described other  approaches from governmental entities in Australia, India, and the United  Kingdom that address supply chain risks for commercial communications  networks. We chose these countries to show the variation in how foreign  governments are approaching supply chain risk management and  because of the availability of public information in English describing their  approaches. While the results of the data collected from these three  countries may not encompass all possible approaches, they provided  important insights into the approaches that some countries are using to  address supply chain risks for commercial communications networks. We  also assessed the potential for using the Committee on Foreign  Investment in the United States (CFIUS) review process for purchases  of foreign-manufactured equipment. A voluntary notification process  similar to CFIUS is being discussed by government and industry  stakeholders. We reviewed the Foreign Investment and National Security  Act of 2007, related regulations, and CFIUS annual reports to Congress  to describe the CFIUS process and its applicability to purchases of  foreign equipment for commercial networks. Finally, we conducted our  own analysis regarding several potential issues that could arise from the  use of these approaches. We identified these issues based on interviews  with foreign government officials and U.S. industry stakeholders, and our  review of foreign proposals and other documentation. The issues  identified do not present an exhaustive list of all issues that could arise,  but rather provide a range of considerations involved in other approaches  to addressing supply chain risks.", "We conducted this work from December 2011 to May 2013 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

While the  import data do not distinguish whether the imports are from U.S. or  foreign-based companies, according to International Trade Commission  staff, many of the imports are from U.S. companies manufacturing  abroad. Imports of network equipment to the United States grew about  $10 billion (about 76 percent) over a 5-year period, from $13.5 billion in  2007 to $23.8 billion in 2011, as shown in figure 3. During this same  period, imports from China, which was the leading source country, grew  by $4.9 billion (112 percent).

Risks include threats posed  by actors such as foreign intelligence services or counterfeiters that may  exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain, thus compromising the  availability, security, and resilience of the networks. Multiple points in  the supply chain may present vulnerabilities that threat actors could  exploit. For example, a lack of adequate testing for software patches and  updates could leave a communications network vulnerable to the  insertion of code intended to allow unauthorized access to information on  the network. Routers and switches can present points of vulnerability  because they connect to the core network and are used to aggregate  data, according to an FCC official with whom we spoke.

Officials from  the companies and industry groups that we spoke with said that they  consider the level of risk to be affected not by where equipment and  components are made, but how they are made, particularly the security  procedures implemented by manufacturers. Many of these officials also  said they were not aware of any intentional attacks originating in the  supply chain, and some said that they consider the risk of this type of  attack to be low. Officials from four industry groups and one research  institution we spoke with told us that supply chain attacks are harder to  carry out and require more resources than other modes of attacks, such  as malicious software uploaded to equipment through the Internet, and,  therefore, are the less likely vehicle to be used by potential attackers.  Three network providers told us the most common anomalies found in  equipment are caused by erroneous coding in the software, anomalies  that are unintentional. Such anomalies could, however, lead to exploitable  vulnerabilities, according to officials from a third-party testing firm.  Nonetheless, the companies we spoke with told us that security is a high  priority because their brand image and profitability depends, in part, on  avoiding any type of breach of security or disruption of service.", "Network providers and equipment manufacturers told us that their  voluntary risk management practices are in the areas of vendor selection,  vendor security requirements, and equipment testing and monitoring, as  described below and in figure 4. They said these practices are often a  part of their company\u2019s overall security plans and procurement processes  and are applied throughout the entire life cycle of their equipment.", "The network providers and equipment manufacturers we spoke with said  that ensuring the security and reliability of their equipment requires them  to carefully select their vendors. In addition to the typical considerations  when selecting vendors\u2014prices and product performance, the vendor\u2019s  financial stability, and maintenance and service options offered\u2014the  providers and manufacturers told us that they consider security-related  factors, such as the vendor\u2019s security practices, the industry standards  related to security the vendors follow, and past security performance or  reputation. Another consideration for some network providers when  selecting vendors is how critical the equipment being procured is to  network operations. Components that will be used in the core network, for  example, are typically purchased from vendors that network providers  consider most trustworthy. Some network providers told us they also  value having long-term relationships with equipment manufacturers,  because they are able to develop trust over time that the manufacturer  will provide them with reliable and secure equipment and services.", "While network providers said that they are aware of security concerns  about vendors from certain countries, they do not exclude vendors from  consideration that have manufacturing locations in those countries, in  part, because the global nature of the supply chain would make excluding  all vendors located in a particular country difficult. Some network  providers told us they may exclude or avoid vendors based on factors  such as the ownership of the company or concerns about the security of  the vendor\u2019s product, and two told us that federal government officials  had advised against using specific vendors for national security reasons,  as discussed in the following section of this testimony.", "Network providers and equipment manufacturers told us that once vendor  selections are made, they might require vendors to follow certain security  practices, often as part of their contracts. Network providers told us that  the security practices they require are typically based on the criticality or  perceived risk of the project and the role of the vendor. For example, one  network provider we spoke with generates a vendor risk profile for  purchases that it considers critical or high risk or if it does not have an  established relationship with the vendor. The company uses the profile to  collect information on the product or service being provided, the vendor\u2019s  access to proprietary information, such as the company\u2019s financial  information or customer sensitive information, and available information  on a vendor\u2019s subcontractors. This information enables the network  provider to identify areas of concern to investigate and to customize the  security requirements placed on the vendor. The security practices that  both network providers and equipment manufacturers may require of their  vendors include the following: physical security measures, such as procedures for securing  manufacturing sites, transporting equipment and parts, and packaging  equipment and parts; access controls, such as limiting in-house and vendor employees\u2019  access to equipment, maintaining records of who accesses  equipment, and restricting who performs patches and updates; and employee security measures, such as requiring employees to have  background checks and use passwords and user verification to  access systems.", "Additionally, network providers and equipment manufacturers told us they  might require vendors to allow inspections of their manufacturing sites to  check for compliance with the agreed-upon security practices.  Representatives from the companies we met with told us that they  conduct inspections at varying frequencies and for a number of reasons,  including if the vendor is providing a critical piece of equipment or part or  is identified as high risk, or if the equipment is performing poorly.", "Network providers and equipment manufacturers told us that equipment  is tested to detect vulnerabilities. This is done throughout the life cycle of  equipment, including during product development, before and after  implementation, and when any patches or updates are applied. After  equipment is installed into the network, network providers also monitor  the equipment constantly to detect abnormal traffic or problems with the  equipment that might indicate a potential cyber attack and disrupt network  service. According to officials from a third-party testing firm, there are  several tools available to test the security of equipment, including:  vulnerability scans\u2014searching software and hardware for known  vulnerabilities; penetration testing\u2014executing deliberate attempts to attack a network  through the equipment, sometimes targeting specific vulnerabilities of  concern; and  source code analysis\u2014evaluating in depth the underlying software  code that can uncover unknown vulnerabilities that would not be  detected during a vulnerability scan.", "Testing can be performed by the network provider, the equipment  manufacturer, or independent third-party testing firms. Most network  providers and several equipment manufacturers told us they use third- party testing firms on an ad-hoc basis, such as when requested by a  customer or when they do not have the expertise or resources to conduct  appropriate tests. Network providers and equipment manufacturers also  use these firms when they want to analyze software or firmware source  code because equipment manufacturers are reluctant to provide network  providers with source code, which they consider intellectual property.  Two network providers and one equipment manufacturer told us they use  a trusted delivery model that employs a third-party testing firm to ensure  that the equipment purchased and received is secure. Under this model,  the third-party testing firm tests equipment over the full life-cycle of  equipment, including when there are software patches or hardware  updates, and uses a number of different techniques, such as source code  analysis. Additionally, the testing firm verifies that the equipment  delivered and implemented by the network provider matches the  equipment tested and that the equipment manufacturer followed certain  security procedures.", "However, a recent congressional report identified the following potential  limitations of third-party testing and available testing techniques.", "These firms typically test equipment that is configured in a specific  and restrictive way that may differ from the configuration that is  actually deployed in the network.", "The behavior of equipment can vary widely depending on how and  where it is configured, installed, and maintained.", "The pace of technology is changing more rapidly than third-party  evaluation processes.", "Vendors that finance their own security evaluations create a conflict of  interest that can lead to skepticism about the independence and rigor  of the result.", "Officials from a third-party testing firm told us that there are evaluation  processes, such as the trusted delivery model, that test the equipment  delivered to network providers and deployed into the network against the  equipment tested. Although they said it is impossible to test every piece  of equipment, the firm tests a statistically significant random selection of  equipment that represents all manufacturing lots and geographic  locations. They also told us that independence is critical to their business.  The officials said the vendor has no visibility into the evaluation process,  and, typically, the vendor is obligated to report testing results.", "The congressional report further stated that regardless of the testing  technique employed, fully preventing a determined and clever insider  from intentionally inserting flaws into equipment means finding and  eliminating every significant vulnerability from a complex product, a  monumental, or even\u2014in the words of one congressional report\u2014 \u201dvirtually impossible\u201d task. Similarly, officials from one third-party testing  firm whom we spoke with told us that they have concerns about the  effectiveness of network monitoring as a way of detecting vulnerabilities.  They said that security monitoring, in most cases, can only detect  attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities, or in more complex approaches,  identify potentially dangerous anomalous network activity.

The government would also have the authority to use  enforcement measures to address noncompliance, as described in   table 1.", "Under this framework, the government would provide guidance to inform  carriers and carriage service providers how they can maintain competent  supervision and effective control over their networks and educate carriers  and carriage service providers on national security risks. The approach  would require amendments to telecommunications statutes, such as the  Telecommunications Act and other relevant laws.", "India enacted a new approach in 2011 through its operating licenses for  telecommunications service providers. India\u2019s Department of  Telecommunications (DoT) is responsible for granting operating licenses  to India\u2019s telecommunications service providers. In May 2011, DoT issued  amendments to its operating licenses that included new or revised  requirements for providers and equipment vendors to improve the  security of India\u2019s telecommunications network infrastructure. Under the  amendments, telecommunications service providers are to be completely  responsible for security of their networks, including the supply chain of  their hardware and software. Key security requirements are described in  table 2.", "The United Kingdom (UK) enacted new security and resilience  requirements for network and service providers in 2011 through revisions  to its Communications Act of 2003. The UK\u2019s Office of Communications  (Ofcom), the independent regulator and competition authority for the UK  communications industries, is responsible for enforcing the requirements.  According to Ofcom officials, these requirements address supply chain  risks by focusing on the ability of the network and service providers to  manage the overall security of their infrastructure and maintain network  availability. Ofcom officials told us they are still developing their overall  approach to enforcing the requirements, which are described in table 3.", "A Chinese network equipment manufacturer voluntarily partnered with the  UK government to establish a Cybersecurity Evaluation Centre to test its  equipment for use in UK networks. According to officials from Ofcom and  the Chinese manufacturer, the facility was created in part to address  national security concerns related to using equipment from a vendor that  did not have an established relationship with the UK government or UK  network providers. The Chinese manufacturer provides the facility with  the design and source code for all equipment, which is then tested for  vulnerabilities by staff with UK security clearances. According to officials  from Ofcom and representatives from the Chinese manufacturer, network  providers cannot use the equipment until it has been approved through  the testing process. In addition, the UK government requires all software  patches be tested using the same process before they are installed on  the equipment by the network providers. According to officials from the  Chinese manufacturer, this voluntary approach helped increase trust with  its customers. However, in November 2012, the chairman of the UK  parliament\u2019s intelligence and security committee confirmed to us that the  committee is reviewing the commercial relationship between the Chinese  manufacturer and a British telecommunications provider and the Chinese  manufacturer\u2019s overall presence in the UK\u2019s critical national  infrastructure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Expanding Use of the U.S. Process for Reviewing Foreign Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government\u2019s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United  States (CFIUS) conducts reviews to determine whether certain  transactions that could result in foreign control of U.S. businesses pose  risks to U.S. national security. Industry representatives from the U.S.  Communications Sector Coordinating Council told us the council and  participating federal entities are discussing whether a voluntary  notification process similar to CFIUS should be used for network provider  purchases of foreign-manufactured equipment. In addition, the House  Intelligence Permanent Select Committee report recommended that  legislative proposals seeking to expand CFIUS to include purchasing  agreements should receive thorough consideration by relevant  congressional committees.", "CFIUS follows a process established by statutes and regulations for  examining certain transactions that could result in foreign control of U.S.  businesses. Parties generally submit voluntary notices of transactions to  CFIUS, but CFIUS also has the authority to initiate reviews unilaterally.  Pursuant to the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007,  CFIUS must complete a review of a covered transaction within 30  days. In certain circumstances, following the review, CFIUS may initiate  an investigation that may last up to 45 additional days., If CFIUS finds  that the covered transaction presents national security risks and that  other provisions of law do not provide adequate authority to address the  risks, then CFIUS may enter into an agreement with, or impose conditions  on, the parties to mitigate such risks. If the national security risks cannot  be resolved and the parties do not choose to abandon the transaction,  CFIUS may refer the case to the President, who can choose whether to  suspend or prohibit the transaction., As shown in table 4, presidential  decisions are rare.

The council is trying to  understand the threats the government is concerned about and whether  these could be best addressed by a CFIUS- type process or some other  means.

We identified these  issues based on interviews with foreign government officials and U.S.  industry stakeholders, and our review of foreign proposals and other  documentation. While the issues we identified provide a range of  considerations that U.S. federal agencies would need to take into account  if they chose to implement these approaches, they do not represent an  exhaustive list.", "Some of the approaches may create a trade barrier or cause trade  disputes. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR)  has reported that standards-related measures that are non-transparent,  discriminatory, or otherwise unwarranted can act as significant barriers to  U.S. trade. USTR has reported concerns regarding some of India\u2019s  licensing requirements for telecommunications service providers including  the following:  the requirement for telecommunications equipment vendors to test all  equipment in labs in India;  the requirement to allow the service provider and government  agencies to inspect a vendor\u2019s manufacturing facilities and supply  chain and perform security checks for the duration of the contract to  supply the equipment; and  the imposition of strict liability and possible blacklisting of a vendor for  taking inadequate precautionary security measures, without the right  to appeal and other due process guarantees.", "These requirements may result in trade-distorting conditions by making it  more expensive and burdensome for foreign equipment manufacturers to  do business in India. According to USTR, it is too early to evaluate  whether the proposed reforms in Australia, new requirements and  voluntary Cybersecurity Evaluation Centre in the UK, and an extension of  CFIUS to equipment purchases would create trade barriers or cause  trade disputes. Three U.S.-based equipment manufacturers told us that  extending CFIUS to equipment purchases could cause other countries to  implement similar policies, which may result in barriers to entry in other  countries and trade disputes.", "All of the approaches may increase costs to industry and the federal  government. The Australian and UK governments recognize that changes  to the regulatory framework would include a cost to industry, which may  increase prices for consumers. Representatives from the Chinese  equipment manufacturer stated that although voluntarily setting up the  Cybersecurity Evaluation Centre was expensive, it was the cost of doing  business in the UK. Similarly, one telecommunications industry group  reported that India\u2019s 2011 License Amendments would increase  compliance costs for Indian telecommunications services providers. The  majority (6 of 8) of equipment manufacturers we spoke with told us that  any proposal to extend CFIUS to equipment purchases would increase  costs for network providers, equipment manufacturers, and ultimately  consumers. In addition, it is likely that the responsible federal agencies  will also incur additional administrative costs in implementing any supply  chain risk management requirements.", "All of the approaches may have an impact on the business decisions of  network providers and equipment manufacturers and competition within  the industry. The Australian government is aware that its proposed  framework could have effects on the industry, and it is trying to anticipate  these effects and explore how they might be mitigated. It is also seeking  input from industry and government stakeholders on any potentially  broader effects on competition in the telecommunications market and on  consumers. Similarly, a telecommunications industry group reported the  Indian requirements complicate the relationship between  telecommunications service providers and their equipment vendors,  creating concerns about access to intellectual property and giving each  an incentive to shift the risk of enforcement onto the other (though the  current requirements still place the principal obligations on the  licensees). Representatives from a U.S.-based equipment manufacturer  told us that extending the CFIUS process to equipment purchases could  potentially lead to vendors being excluded from the U.S. market without  appeal rights; this would result in limited competition and therefore  potentially higher prices for consumers. Similarly, four network providers  and one think tank also told us that extending CFIUS to equipment  purchases would limit competition and raise costs.", "The appropriate universe of equipment supply contracts that would be  subject to review would need to be defined if the CFIUS process were  extended to cover these transactions. There were 269 notices of  transactions covered by the CFIUS process from 2009 through 2011. By  comparison, four network providers and two equipment manufacturers we  spoke with noted that network providers conduct thousands of  transactions a year and expressed concerns about their being subject to  a CFIUS-type process. Specifically, the two manufacturers said it would  be difficult for CFIUS members to oversee all of these transactions in a  timely fashion, adding expense to the procurement process for network  providers and equipment manufacturers that could be passed on to  consumers. In addition, CFIUS member agencies may incur significant  administrative costs if asked to review thousands of procurement  transactions per year.", "Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Eshoo, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.

We focused this work on the five wireless and five wireline network  providers with the highest revenue, the eight manufacturers of routers  and switches with the highest market shares in the U.S. market, and two  cable network providers. To identify the top five U.S. wireless providers  by subscribers, we used data from the Department of Defense and  verified the subscribership data against investor relations reports from the  providers. To identify the top five U.S. wireline providers by subscribers,  we used publicly available rankings and verified the subscriber data  against investor relations reports from the providers. We selected the top  eight manufacturers of routers and switches based on 2010 U.S. market  share. We selected two of the top three U.S. cable companies based on  2011 subscriber data.", "To identify how the federal government is addressing the potential risks of  foreign-manufactured equipment that is used in commercial  communications networks, we asked federal agencies to identify statutes  and regulations to identify potential sources of the federal government\u2019s  legal and regulatory authority over how communications network  providers ensure the security of their U.S. commercial networks.
