To address these objectives, GAO analyzed data and records from Education, examined Education's policies and procedures, reviewed relevant research studies, conducted site visits and undercover investigations at proprietary schools, and interviewed officials from Education, higher education associations, and state oversight agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Education makes loans available to students to help them pay for higher education at public, private non-profit, and proprietary schools, and the students who attend proprietary schools are most likely to default on these loans, according to analysis of recent student loan data. Students from proprietary schools have higher default rates than students from other schools at 2, 3, and 4 years into repayment. Academic researchers have found that higher default rates at proprietary schools are linked to the characteristics of the students who attend these schools. Specifically, students who come from low income backgrounds and from families who lack higher education are more likely to default on their loans, and data show that students from proprietary schools are more likely to come from low income families and have parents who do not hold a college degree. Borrowers who are not successful in school and drop out also have high default rates. Ultimately, when student loan defaults occur, both taxpayers and the government, which guarantees the loans, are left with the costs. Although students must meet certain eligibility requirements to demonstrate that they have the ability to succeed in school before they receive federal loans, weaknesses in Education's oversight of these requirements place students and federal funds at risk of potential fraud and abuse at proprietary schools. Students are required to pass a test of basic math and English skills or have a high school diploma or GED to qualify for federal student aid. Yet, GAO and others have found violations of these requirements. For example, when GAO analysts posing as prospective students took the basic skills test at a local proprietary school, the independent test administrator gave out answers to some of the test questions. In addition, the analysts' test forms were tampered with-their actual answers were crossed out and changed-to ensure the individuals passed the test. GAO also identified cases in which officials at two proprietary schools helped prospective students obtain invalid high school diplomas from diploma mills in order to gain access to federal loans. GAO's findings do not represent nor imply widespread problems at all proprietary schools. However, GAO's work has identified significant vulnerabilities in Education's oversight. Education's inadequate monitoring of basic skills tests and lack of guidance on valid high school diplomas enables unqualified students to gain access to federal student aid. Unqualified students are at greater risk of dropping out of school, incurring substantial debt, and defaulting on federal loans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Institutions of higher education, including public colleges, private non- profit, and private for-profit schools, receive billions of dollars each year  from the Department of Education (Education) to help students pay for  school.

Currently, there are over 2,000 proprietary schools  of higher education that participate in Title IV programs. Title IV funds for  the proprietary sector have increased 164 percent since the 2001-2002  school year, and grown at a substantially faster rate than Title IV funds for  the public and private non-profit sectors. Moreover, institutions of higher  education, including proprietary schools, are poised to receive additional  Title IV funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.", "In recent years, the scale and scope of proprietary schools have changed  considerably.

Traditionally focused on certificate and associate programs ranging from  cosmetology to medical assistance and business administration,  proprietary institutions have expanded their offerings to include  bachelors, masters, and doctoral level programs. Both the certificate and  degree programs provide students with training for careers in a variety of  fields.

As part of our analysis of default rates at  proprietary schools, we also looked at information on student  characteristics and outcomes. We analyzed the most recent student survey  data available from the 2004 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study  (NPSAS), data on students during the 2007-2008 school year from the  Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), and data on  student outcomes from a 6-year study following students beginning in the  1995-1996 school year conducted by the National Center for Education  Statistics (NCES). To assess the reliability of those data elements needed  for our study, we (1) performed electronic testing of required data  elements, (2) reviewed existing information about the data and the  systems that produced them and (3) interviewed agency officials  knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data are  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. To determine the  extent to which Education\u2019s policies and procedures for monitoring  student eligibility requirements for federal aid at proprietary schools  protect students and the investment of Title IV funds, we reviewed  Education\u2019s policies and procedures for monitoring the administration of  ability-to-benefit tests and for enforcing high school diploma requirements;  reviewed relevant program reviews, independent audits, relevant laws and  regulations, and enforcement actions taken against schools; and  interviewed officials from Education, state education licensing agencies,  and higher education associations. We also gathered information during  school site visits conducted in California, Illinois, New York, and Virginia.  We selected these sites for geographic diversity and a mixture of  ownership types (independently-owned and publicly-traded schools) and  degree and certificate programs. In addition, GAO anonymously tested  institution compliance with Title IV eligibility requirements and sent, on  two separate occasions, analysts posing as prospective students to take  and purposely fail ATB tests at a local proprietary institution.

More recently, from 2000 until 2008, four  schools were subject to immediate loss, suspension, or termination from  the Title IV program due to high default rates, including three from the  proprietary sector. According to an Education official, there are several  possible explanations for the drop in defaults and, subsequently, for the  drop in the number of schools subject to sanctions. For example, the  Education official noted that the Department\u2019s efforts to provide schools  with default prevention training may have reduced default rates.

See  table 2 for data on family income and parental education of students at  proprietary, public, and private non-profit schools.", "Student age was also linked to default rates in some of the research  studies, with borrowers who take out student loans at an older age being  more likely to default on their loans. One of the studies that linked age to  default rates suggested that older students may default at higher rates  because they tend to have other obligations besides paying for college.  These obligations may include paying a mortgage or paying for child care.  Our analysis of Education\u2019s data shows that proprietary schools serve a  higher percentage of older students than public and private non-profit  schools and the majority of students at proprietary schools are 25 years  old and older.", "Research also shows that borrowers\u2019 success in school may help predict  whether they will default. We found studies published in national journals  that showed that borrowers who have a low grade point average and who  are not continuously enrolled in school before they leave their programs  are more likely to default. Across the three school sectors and program  lengths, a factor closely associated with increased default rates was drop- out rates. In six different research studies\u2014three that examined default  rates from national datasets and three that examined default rates from  state-specific datasets\u2014default rates were positively correlated with drop  outs, or students who failed to complete their programs.

In addition, the study estimated that 6 years after  beginning a 4-year school, a significantly smaller percentage of proprietary  students attained their bachelor\u2019s degree compared to those at public and  private non-profit schools. In contrast, data show that for students who  first started at 2-year proprietary schools, there is a significantly higher  percentage who attained their associate\u2019s degrees compared to students at  public schools.

For example, a factor in predicting defaults  can be the amount that borrowers take out in loans; those who borrow  smaller amounts, according to one study, may have a higher likelihood of  defaulting than those who borrow larger amounts. Researchers estimated  that borrowing larger amounts is correlated with higher levels of  education\u2014such as graduate or professional programs\u2014which give  borrowers an increased earning potential so that they are better able to  repay their loans. In another study that examined characteristics of  borrowers\u2019 loans and repayment options, researchers estimated that those  who graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree and used the forbearance or  deferment options after entering repayment were more than twice as likely  to default.

Generally, prospective students without high school diplomas or GEDs  must pass ATB tests to become eligible to receive federal financial aid, and  test administrators are responsible for administering ATB tests at schools  in accordance with test publisher rules. When we conducted our own  investigation of compliance with ATB requirements, we found improper  activities that compromised the integrity of the test process. For example,  in 2008 we sent two GAO analysts who posed as prospective students to a  local branch of a publicly traded proprietary school to deliberately flunk  an ATB test. Each analyst was sent separately to the school and on both  occasions, the independent test administrator gave them and all the test  takers in the room\u2013about 20 in total\u2013answers to some of the test  questions.

For example, in one case the  OIG found personnel at a proprietary school in Louisiana had changed the  failing test scores of prospective students to allow 80 individuals to pass  and inappropriately qualify for federal funding. Likewise, in two separate  New York investigations in which multiple undercover operatives were  sent to flunk ATB tests at local proprietary schools, test answers were  changed by either the test administrator or school officials to ensure all  people posing as students passed and gained access to federal aid. In  addition to giving out test answers and falsifying test results, test  administrators and officials at proprietary schools have violated other ATB  test rules, impairing the independence of the testing process and allowing  ineligible students to access federal financial aid. Regulations governing  the test process require test administrators, who are certified by test  publishers to administer ATB tests, to be independent of the school at  which tests are taken and to submit test answer sheets directly to the test  publisher for scoring. However, Education\u2019s Office of Inspector General  previously found violations of the requirement for independent test  administration, in which proprietary school officials inappropriately  administered tests. In another case involving improper testing at a  proprietary school, the Education OIG found that test administrators failed  to follow test rules that govern when students can retake the test on the  same form. As a result, 724 students who passed improper retests received  over $3 million in federal financial aid. While OIG officials told us that  some of their cases have involved public schools, they reported that most  of their findings regarding abuse of ATB tests have involved proprietary  schools. When ATB tests are not properly administered, a prospective  student\u2019s ability to benefit from higher education may not be accurately  assessed. As a result, prospective students who are academically  unqualified are more likely to be admitted to a school and receive federal  student aid. Such students are at greater risk of dropping out of school,  incurring substantial debt, and defaulting on their federal student loans.", "These problems result, in part, from key weaknesses in Education\u2019s  oversight of ATB testing, which were previously identified in a 2002  Education Office of Inspector General report. As part of its report, the  OIG recommended changes to strengthen Education\u2019s monitoring of test  publishers. Education approves the tests for ATB use and test publishers  monitor how tests are administered. However, Education has done little  since then to strengthen its oversight of test publishers. Although test  publishers are required to conduct and submit to Education test score  analyses every 3 years to help identify test score irregularities, Education  has not followed up with test publishers to ensure that all comply with  these requirements. For example, as of early 2009, one of the four  approved test publishers had yet to submit test score analyses due in April  2005 and in April 2008 for two of its approved tests. Further, the same test  publisher had failed to submit test score analysis also due in April 2008 for  another of its approved tests. Similarly, two of the four test publishers  failed to submit test score analyses due to Education in January 2008.  Education officials told us the employee responsible for test publisher  oversight and review of test submissions retired in 2008. Since that time  and until March 2009, no one at Education had followed up to obtain  unsubmitted test score analyses, increasing the risk of unidentified test  violations and fraudulent access to federal student aid. In response to our  review, Education followed up with test publishers in the spring of 2009 to  obtain missing test score submissions. In addition to ensuring the  timeliness of submissions, Education should also ensure that the analyses  conducted by test publishers are sufficient to identify improper testing.  When we spoke with OIG and Education officials, they told us that one  test publisher provides thorough analyses that have led to the  identification of possible violations; however, other test publishers  provide only cursory analyses of test scores. According to the Standards  for Internal Controls in the Federal Government, federal agencies need to  have systems in place that ensure timely, effective, and efficient oversight  of government programs and continually monitor programs to address  potential risks. Weaknesses in Education\u2019s systems of controls for  monitoring test publishers may not adequately guard against fraud and  abuse in the ATB test program.", "In addition to problems with Education\u2019s monitoring of test publishers,  Education regulations do not allow for timely identification of improper  test administration. Education\u2019s regulations only require test publishers to  conduct test score analyses every 3 years. Consequently, test  administrators who improperly administer tests can go undetected for 3  years before violations are discovered, resulting in an increased risk of  fraud and abuse. As part of the internal control standards for federal  agencies, the evaluation of a program should depend on the risks  associated with the program and should ensure that timely information is  available to allow for effective monitoring. Given the risks of potential  fraud and abuse associated with the ATB test program, the analysis of test  scores every 3 years may leave the program vulnerable to violations.  Education and test publisher officials we spoke with suggested that more  frequent analyses of test scores by test publishers could improve the  integrity of the testing process.", "Education\u2019s regulations also do not specifically require test publishers to  follow up on test score irregularities or report any corrective actions to  Education. While test publishers are required to identify test score  irregularities that raise suggestions that tests are not being properly  administered, there is no requirement that test publishers further  investigate irregularities to determine if actual violations occurred. In  addition, regulations require that test publishers decertify test  administrators who fail to properly administer tests; however, Education  regulations do not require test publishers to report to Education on the  implementation of their decertification process. Because test publishers  are not required to provide Education with the results of their  decertification activities, Education cannot be assured that test  administrators found in violation of test rules are decertified. Likewise,  without further requirements in regulation for test publishers to provide  information on test administrators, Education has no way to determine  whether test administrators decertified by one publisher are instead  administering tests for other publishers, and therefore cannot protect  against the risk of future violations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education\u2019s Weak Oversight of High School Diploma Requirements Does Not Adequately Protect against the Use of Diploma Mills to Obtain Federal Aid", "paragraphs": ["During our review, we identified cases in which proprietary schools  helped students obtain high school diplomas from diploma mills\u2013entities  that provide invalid diplomas, usually for a fee and little academic work\u2013in  order to obtain access to federal student loans. Through one of our site  visits and interviews with students and student interest groups, we learned  of cases where recruiters at two separate publicly traded proprietary  schools referred students to diploma mills for invalid high school diplomas  in order to gain access to federal loans without having to take an ATB test.  In one case, a student interest group told us a student who dropped out of  high school in the 9th grade was guided by the proprietary school to take  an online test to receive a high school diploma. Based on our discussion  with a state education agency, we confirmed that the entity that provided  the diploma was a diploma mill. In another case, a student told us he was  flunking out of high school when a recruiter at the proprietary school  directed him to a place where he could pay a fee to take a test and obtain a  high school diploma. Based on our review of that county\u2019s listing of high  schools considered diploma mills, we later determined that the entity  offering the high school diploma was a diploma mill. Although Education  has also identified some cases of high school diploma mills\u2013including one  in which a proprietary school had arrangements with a diploma mill to  secure high school diplomas for 30 students who obtained $76,000 in  federal financial aid\u2013Education regional officials told us that the problem  may be more widespread than is known.", "Despite evidence of invalid high school diplomas being used to gain access  to federal student loans, Education has not established clearly written  policies to help ensure high school diploma requirements are met for Title  IV funding. Although senior Education officials told us that the  department\u2019s official policy is that high school diplomas from diploma  mills are not acceptable for Title IV eligibility and the department  prosecutes diploma mill cases, Education officials told us they do not  explicitly assert this policy in any written form. Rather, Education notes in  its Federal Student Aid Handbook that a high school diploma is one that  comes from a school recognized by the state in which the school is  located. Internal control standards provide that federal agencies should  employ effective ways to record and communicate important information  to employees and others, such as in policy manuals, to enable them to  carry out their duties and responsibilities. Without a written policy that  clearly communicates Education\u2019s position against the use of diploma  mills to obtain access to federal student aid, Education staff and external  parties such as schools and independent auditors\u2013who must comply or  monitor compliance with Title IV rules\u2013lack important information  regarding eligibility requirements. Education officials have acknowledged  that the use of high school diplomas from diploma mills to obtain access  to federal student aid is a problem and that more guidance would be  helpful. In May 2009, Education announced plans to convene public  forums to help inform the development of proposed regulations that  would address matters related to Title IV program integrity, including the  definition of a high school diploma as a condition of receiving federal  student aid.", "In addition to weaknesses in its policies governing high school diploma  requirements, Education provides limited guidance and tools that  Education program review staff, schools, and independent auditors can  use to help identify high school diploma mills. Though Education, in its  Federal Student Aid Handbook, advises officials to contact state education  agencies if they question the validity of a high school diploma, Education  officials told us that program review staff have no other guidance to help  them judge whether there is a potential problem. Further, they  acknowledged that in many cases, the identification of an invalid high  school diploma is based on the experience of the program review staff and  whether something appears to be wrong. For example, when a reviewer  finds an unusually large number of students with high school diplomas  coming from the same school located outside the state, this may prompt  the reviewer to look into the origin of the diplomas further. As we noted  earlier, standards for internal controls in the federal government require  federal agencies to communicate relevant and reliable information to help  agency staff and external stakeholders carry out their responsibilities.  Education provides limited information and resources that would help  internal and external reviewers and schools better monitor compliance  with high school diploma requirements. Education officials told us that a  comprehensive list of recognized high schools could help Education staff  and schools better identify diplomas from diploma mills. Several states  already provide lists of the high schools they recognize and make them  available to the public on their Web sites. However, Education provides  little information on these already available resources that could help  officials identify invalid high school diplomas. In contrast, Education  already maintains information and resources on its Web site to help  individuals identify and avoid higher education diploma mills by listing  colleges and universities that are eligible to participate in federal student  aid programs. Education\u2019s limited guidance to help both internal and  external parties detect the use of high school diploma mills for Title IV  eligibility may hinder its efforts to ensure that students receiving federal  financial aid have the ability to succeed in higher education."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Proprietary schools have become a rapidly growing sector of higher  education in this country and will likely continue to grow with the  availability of additional federal funding and an increased demand for  education and job training. Many of these schools play an important role in  providing a range of students, including non-traditional and disadvantaged  students, with an opportunity to obtain the education they need to  increase their work skills and find jobs. However, students who attend  proprietary schools are more likely to default on their federal student  loans, which can tarnish their credit records, make it difficult for them to  obtain employment, and jeopardize their long-term financial well-being.  Students from lower-income backgrounds can be particularly hurt when  they default on their loans. In addition, taxpayers and the government,  which guarantees the loans, are left with the cost when students default on  their school loans.", "To decrease the likelihood that students will default on their loans, it is  critical that Education increase its oversight of federal student aid  eligibility requirements to make sure that only students who have the  ability to benefit receive federal funds to attend college. While our findings  do not represent nor should they be interpreted as implying widespread  problems at all proprietary schools, our work has identified significant  vulnerabilities in Education\u2019s oversight that should be addressed. Without  better oversight of the ATB testing process to ensure more frequent  identification of improper testing, and stronger processes for handling and  reporting improper testing, both the integrity of the testing process and the  qualifications of students who receive federal funding cannot be assured.  In addition, without stronger controls, such as clear guidance from  Education banning the use of high school diploma mills to obtain federal  aid and information on how to identify diploma mills, the government  cannot be assured that its student aid funds are only provided to students  who have an ability to benefit from higher education. Unqualified students  who receive federal financial aid for higher education programs are at  greater risk of dropping out of school, incurring substantial debt, and  defaulting on federal loans.

For example, Education  could provide this guidance through regulation or the Federal Student Aid  Handbook; and    Establish a cost-effective and readily available source of information that  the department\u2019s program review staff, schools, and independent auditors  can use to help them determine whether a high school diploma is from a  diploma mill.

Education noted that final regulations would become  effective no sooner than July 1, 2011, as provided under the Higher  Education Act of 1965, as amended.  In the interim, Education will provide  additional guidance in the next revision of the Federal Student Aid  Handbook. However, in regards to providing a source of information to  help protect against the use of diplomas from high school diploma mills,  Education commented that there is no centralized source for information  about all high schools and no specific statutory authority for Education to  create and maintain one, making it unlikely that it will be able to establish  a readily available source of such information.  Further, Education stated  that it can only expend appropriated funds for authorized purposes, and  this use is not authorized under the Department of Education Organization  Act or other federal education laws. We acknowledge that there is no  centralized source for information about all high schools and we do not  recommend that Education investigate the status of all high schools.

From the dataset of 3-year cohort default rates for individual  schools, we conducted our own analysis to calculate the numbers of  proprietary schools that had default rates of 0 and under 5 percent.

In addition, we used  Education calculations of Title IV funding for the various sectors over time  from NSLDS for background information. We began our data analysis of  Title IV funding in the 2001/02 award year after learning from a data  specialist at Education that data prior to 2001/02 are considered less  accurate because the Department used different methodologies to identify  and calculate Title IV funding data.
