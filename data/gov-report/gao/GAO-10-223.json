This report addresses (1) the extent to which recipients were able to fulfill their reporting requirements and the processes in place to help ensure data quality and (2) how macroeconomic data and methods, and the recipient reports, can be used to assess the employment effects of the Recovery Act.

Given the national scale of the recipient reporting exercise and the limited time frames in which it was implemented, the ability of the reporting mechanism to handle the volume of data from a wide variety of recipients represents a solid first step in moving toward more transparency and accountability for federal funds. Because this effort will be an ongoing process of cumulative reporting, GAO's first review represents a snapshot in time. While recipients GAO contacted appear to have made good faith efforts to ensure complete and accurate reporting, GAO's fieldwork and initial review and analysis of recipient data from www.recovery.gov , indicate that there are a range of significant reporting and quality issues that need to be addressed For example, GAO's review of prime recipient reports identified the following: Erroneous or questionable data entries that merit further review: (1) 3,978 reports that showed no dollar amount received or expended but included more than 50,000 jobs created or retained; (2) 9,247 reports that showed no jobs but included expended amounts approaching $1 billion, and (3) Instances of other reporting anomalies such as discrepancies between award amounts and the amounts reported as received which, although relatively small in number, indicate problematic issues in the reporting. Coverage: While OMB estimates that more than 90 percent of recipients reported, questions remain about the other 10 percent. Quality review: While less than 1 percent were marked as having undergone review by the prime recipient, over three quarters of the prime reports were marked as having undergone review by a federal agency. Full-time equivalent (FTE) calculations: Full-time equivalent (FTE) calculations: Under OMB guidance, jobs created or retained were to be expressed as FTEs. GAO found that data were reported inconsistently even though significant guidance and training was provided by OMB and federal agencies. While FTEs should allow for the aggregation of different types of jobs--part time, full time or temporary--differing interpretations of the FTE guidance compromise the ability to aggregate the data. Although there were problems of inconsistent interpretation of the guidance, the reporting process went relatively well for highway projects. Transportation had an established procedure for reporting prior to enactment of the Recovery Act. In the cases of Education and Housing, which do not have this prior reporting experience, GAO found more problems. Some of these have been reported in the press. State and federal officials are examining these problems and have stated their intention to deal with them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Congress and the new administration crafted the American Recovery and  Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) with the broad purpose of  stimulating the economy. One of the express purposes of the act was to  preserve and create jobs. To help measure the progress of this effort,  Congress and the administration built into the act numerous provisions to  increase transparency and accountability over spending that require  recipients of Recovery Act funding to report quarterly on a number of  measures. Nonfederal recipients of Recovery Act funded grants, contracts,  or loans are required to submit reports with information on each project  or activity, including the amount and use of funds and an estimate of the  jobs created or retained. Neither individuals nor recipients receiving  funds through entitlement programs, such as Medicaid, or tax programs  are required to report. The first of these recipient reports cover cumulative  activity since the Recovery Act\u2019s passage in February 2009 through the  quarter ending September 30, 2009. The Recovery Act requires GAO to  comment on the estimates of jobs created or retained in the recipient  reports no later than 45 days after recipients have reported. The final  recipient reporting data for the first round of reports were first made  available on October 30, 2009.", "The transparency that is envisioned for tracking Recovery Act spending  and results is unprecedented for the federal government. Both Congress  and the President have emphasized the need for accountability, efficiency,  and transparency in the expenditure of Recovery Act funds and have made  it a central principle of the act. As Congress finished work on the  Recovery Act, the House Appropriations Committee released a statement  saying, \u201cA historic level of transparency, oversight and accountability will  help guarantee taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and Americans can see  results for their investment.\u201d In January, the new administration pledged  that the Recovery Act would \u201cbreak from conventional Washington  approaches to spending by ensuring that public dollars are invested  effectively and that the economic recovery package is fully transparent  and accountable to the American people.\u201d However, tracking billions of  dollars that are being disbursed to thousands of recipients is an enormous  effort. The administration expects that achieving this degree of visibility  will be an iterative process in which the reporting process and information  improve over time and, if successful, could be a model for transparency  and oversight beyond the Recovery Act.", "This report, the first in response to the Recovery Act\u2019s section 1512  mandate that GAO comment on the estimates of jobs created or retained  by direct recipients of Recovery Act funds, addresses the following: (1) the  extent to which recipients were able to fulfill their reporting requirements  and the processes in place to help ensure recipient reporting data quality  and (2) how macroeconomic data and methods, and the recipient reports,  can be used to assess the employment effects of the Recovery Act, and the  limitations of the data and methods.", "To meet our objectives, we performed an initial set of edit checks and  basic analyses on the final recipient report data that first became available  at www.recovery.gov, the federal government\u2019s official Web site on  Recovery Act spending, on October 30, 2009. We calculated the overall  sum, as well as sum by states, for the number of full-time equivalents  (FTE) reported, award amount, and amount received and found that they  corresponded closely with the values shown for these data on  Recovery.gov. We built on information collected at the state, local, and  program level as part of our bimonthly reviews of selected states\u2019 and  localities\u2019 uses of Recovery Act funds. These bimonthly reviews focus on  Recovery Act implementation in 16 states and the District of Columbia,  which contain about 65 percent of the U.S. population and are estimated  to receive collectively about two-thirds of the intergovernmental federal  assistance funds available through the Recovery Act. A detailed  description of the criteria used to select the core group of 16 states and the  District is found in appendix I of our April 2009 Recovery Act bimonthly  report. Prime recipients and delegated subrecipients had to prepare and  enter their information by October 10, 2009. The days following up to  October 30, 2009, included the data review period, and as noted  previously, on October 30, 2009, the first round of recipient reported data  was made public. Over the course of three different interviews, two with  prime recipients of Recovery Act funding and one with subrecipients, we  visited the 16 selected states and the District of Columbia during late  September and October 2009. We discussed with prime recipients projects  associated with 50 percent of the total funds reimbursed, as of September  4, 2009, for that state, in the Federal-Aid Highway Program administered  by the Department of Transportation (DOT). Prior to the start of the  reporting period on October 1, we reviewed prime recipients\u2019 plans for the  jobs data collection process. After the October 10 data reporting period,  we went back to see if prime recipients followed their own plans and  subsequently talked with at least two vendors in each state to gauge their  reactions to the reporting process and assess the documentation they were  required to submit.", "We gathered and examined issues raised by recipients in these  jurisdictions regarding reporting and data quality and interviewed  recipients on their experiences using the Web site reporting mechanism.  During the interviews, we used a series of program reviews and  semistructured interview guides that addressed state plans for managing,  tracking, and reporting on Recovery Act funds and activities. In a similar  way, we examined a nonjudgmental sample of Department of Education  (Education) Recovery Act projects at the prime and subrecipient level. We  also collected information from transit agencies as part of our bimonthly  Recovery Act reviews. In addition, we interviewed federal agency officials  who have responsibility for ensuring a reasonable degree of quality across  their program\u2019s recipient reports. We assessed the reports from the  Inspector Generals (IG) on Recovery Act data quality review from 15  agencies. We are also continuing to monitor and follow up on some of the  major reporting issues identified in the media and by other observers. For  example, a number of press articles have discussed concerns with the jobs  reporting done by Head Start grantees. According to a Health and Human  Services (HHS) Recovery Act official, HHS is working with the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) to clarify the reporting policy as it applies  to Head Start grantees. We will be reviewing these efforts as they move  forward.", "To address our second objective, we analyzed economic and fiscal data  using standard economic principles and reviewed the economic literature  on the effect of monetary and fiscal policies for stimulating the economy.  We also reviewed guidance that OMB developed for Recovery Act  recipients to follow in estimating the effect of funding activities on  employment, reviewed reports that the Council of Economic Advisers  (CEA) issued on the macroeconomic effects of the Recovery Act, and  interviewed officials from the CEA, OMB, and the Congressional Budget  Office (CBO).", "We conducted this performance audit with field work beginning in late  September 2009 and began analysis of the recipient data that became  available on October 30, 2009, in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In December 2007, the United States entered what has turned out to be its  deepest recession since the end of World War II. Between the fourth  quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009, gross domestic product  (GDP) fell by about 2.8 percent, or $377 billion. The unemployment rate  rose from 4.9 percent in 2007 to 10.2 percent in October 2009, a level not  seen since April 1983. The CBO projects that the unemployment rate will  remain above 9 percent through 2011.", "Confronted with unprecedented weakness in the financial sector and the  overall economy, the federal government and the Federal Reserve together  acted to moderate the downturn and restore economic growth. The  Federal Reserve used monetary policy to respond to the recession by  pursuing one of the most significant interest rate reductions in U.S.  history. In concert with the Department of the Treasury, it went on to  bolster the supply of credit in the economy through measures that provide  Federal Reserve backing for a wide variety of loan types, from mortgages  to automobile loans to small business loans. The federal government also  used fiscal policy to confront the effects of the recession. Existing fiscal  stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance and progressive aspects of  the tax code, kicked in automatically in order to ease the pressure on  household income as economic conditions deteriorated. In addition,  Congress enacted a temporary tax cut in the first half of 2008 to buoy  incomes and spending and created the Troubled Asset Relief Program in  the second half of 2008 to give Treasury authority to act to restore  financial market functioning.", "The federal government\u2019s largest response to the recession to date came in  early 2009 with the passage of the Recovery Act, the broad purpose of  which is to stimulate the economy\u2019s overall demand for goods and  services, or aggregate demand. The Recovery Act is specifically intended  to preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery; to assist  those most impacted by the recession; to provide investments needed to  increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances in health  and science; to invest in transportation, environmental protection, and  other infrastructure that will provide long-term economic benefits; and to  stabilize the budgets of state and local governments. The CBO estimates  that the net cost of the Recovery Act will total approximately $787 billion  from 2009 to 2019.", "The Recovery Act uses a combination of tax relief and government  spending to accomplish its goals. The Recovery Act\u2019s tax cuts include  reductions to individuals\u2019 taxes, payments to individuals in lieu of  reductions to their taxes, adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax,  and business tax incentives. Tax cuts encompass approximately one-third  of the Recovery Act\u2019s dollars. Recovery Act spending includes temporary  increases in entitlement programs to aid people directly affected by the  recession and provide some fiscal relief to states; this also accounts for  about one third of the Recovery Act. For example, the Recovery Act  temporarily increased and extended unemployment benefits, temporarily  increased the rate at which the federal government matched states  Medicaid expenditures, and provided additional funds for the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and the Temporary Aid to Needy  Families programs, among other things. Other spending, also accounting  for about a third of the act falls into the category of grants, loans, and  contracts. This includes government purchases of goods and services,  grants to states through programs such as the State Fiscal Stabilization  Fund for education and other government services, and government  investment in infrastructure, health information technology, renewable  energy research, and other areas.", "In interpreting recipient reporting data, it is important to recognize that  the recipient reporting requirement only covers a defined subset of the  Recovery Act\u2019s funding. The reporting requirements apply only to  nonfederal recipients of funding, including all entities receiving Recovery  Act funds directly from the federal government such as state and local  governments, private companies, educational institutions, nonprofits, and  other private organizations. OMB guidance, consistent with the statutory  language in the Recovery Act, states that these reporting requirements  apply to recipients who receive funding through the Recovery Act\u2019s  discretionary appropriations, not recipients receiving funds through  entitlement programs, such as Medicaid, or tax programs. Recipient  reporting also does not apply to individuals. In addition, the required  reports cover only direct jobs created or retained as a result of Recovery  Act funding; they do not include the employment impact on materials  suppliers (indirect jobs) or on the local community (induced jobs). Figure  1 shows the division of total Recovery Act funds and their potential  employment effects.", "Tracing the effects of the Recovery Act through the economy is a  complicated task. Prospectively, before the act\u2019s passage or before funds  are spent, the effects can only be projected using economic models that  represent the behavior of governments, firms, and households. While  funds are being spent, some effects can be observed but often relevant  data on key relationships and indicators in the economy are available only  with a lag, thereby complicating real-time assessments. When a full range  of data on outcomes becomes available, economic analysts undertake  retrospective analyses, where the findings are often used to guide future  policy choices and to anticipate effects of similar future policies. Stimulus  spending under the broad scope of the Recovery Act will reverberate at  the national, regional, state, and local levels. Models of the national  economy provide the most comprehensive view of policy effects, but they  do not provide insight, except indirectly, about events at smaller  geographical scales. The diversity and complexity of the components of  the national economy are not fully captured by any set of existing  economic models. Some perspective can be gained by contemporaneous  close observation of the actions of governments, firms, and households,  but a complete and accurate picture of the Recovery Act\u2019s impact will  emerge only slowly.", "Section 1512 of the Recovery Act requires recipients of recovery funds to  report on those funds each calendar quarter. These recipient reports are to  be filed for any quarter in which a recipient receives Recovery Act funds  directly from the federal government. The recipient reporting requirement  covers all funds made available by appropriations in division A of the  Recovery Act. The reports are to be submitted no later than 10 days after  the end of each calendar quarter in which the recipient received Recovery  Act funds. Each report is to include the total amount of Recovery Act  funds received, the amount of funds expended or obligated to projects or  activities, and a detailed list of those projects or activities. For each  project or activity, the detailed list must include its name and a  description, an evaluation of its completion status, and an estimate of the  number of jobs created or the number of jobs retained by that project or  activity. Certain additional information is also required for infrastructure  investments made by state and local governments. Also, the recipient  reports must include detailed information on any subcontracts or  subgrants as required by the Federal Funding Accountability and  Transparency Act of 2006. Section 1512(e) of the Recovery Act requires  GAO and CBO to comment on the estimates of jobs created or retained  reported by recipients.", "In its guidance to recipients for estimating employment effects, OMB  instructed recipients to report only the direct employment effects as \u201cjobs  created or retained\u201d as a single number. Recipients are not expected to  report on the employment impact on materials suppliers (indirect jobs) or  on the local community (induced jobs). According to the guidance, \u201cA job  created is a new position created and filled or an existing unfilled position  that is filled as a result of the Recovery Act; a job retained is an existing  position that would not have been continued to be filled were it not for  Recovery Act funding. Only compensated employment . . . should be  reported. The estimate of the number of jobs . . . should be expressed as  \u2018full-time equivalents (FTE),\u2019 which is calculated as total hours worked in  jobs created or retained divided by the number of hours in a full-time  schedule, as defined by the recipient.\u201d Consequently, the recipients are  expected to report the amount of labor hired or not fired as result of  having received Recovery Act funds. It should be noted that one FTE does  not necessarily equate to the job of one person. Firms may choose to  increase the hours of existing employees, for example, which can certainly  be said to increase employment but not necessarily be an additional job in  the sense of adding a person to the payroll.", "To implement the recipient reporting data requirements, OMB has worked  with the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board (Recovery  Board) to deploy a nationwide data collection system at  www.federalreporting.gov (Federalreporting.gov), while the data reported  by recipients are available to the public for viewing and downloading on  www.recovery.gov (Recovery.gov). Recovery.gov, a site designed to  provide transparency of information related to spending on Recovery Act  programs, is the official source of information related to the Recovery Act.  The Recovery Board\u2019s goals for the Recovery Act Web site include  promoting accountability by providing a platform to analyze Recovery Act  data and serving as a means of tracking fraud, waste, and abuse allegations  by providing the public with accurate, user-friendly information. In  addition, the site promotes official data in public debate, assists in  providing fair and open access to Recovery Act opportunities, and  promotes an understanding of the local impact of Recovery Act funding.", "In an effort to address the level of risk in recipient reporting, OMB\u2019s June  22, 2009, guidance on recipient reporting includes a requirement for data  quality reviews. OMB\u2019s data quality guidance is intended to address two  key data problems\u2014material omissions and significant reporting errors.  Material omissions and significant reporting errors are risks that the  information is incomplete and inaccurate. As shown in figure 2, OMB  gave specific time frames for reporting that allow prime recipients and  delegated subrecipients to prepare and enter their information on days 1  through 10 following the end of the quarter. During days 11 through 21,  prime recipients will be able to review the data to ensure that complete  and accurate reporting information is provided prior to a federal agency  review and comment period beginning on the 22nd day. During days 22 to  29 following the end of the quarter, federal agencies will perform data  quality reviews and will notify the recipients and delegated subrecipients  of any data anomalies or questions. The original submitter must complete  data corrections no later than the 29th day following the end of the  quarter. Prime recipients have the ultimate responsibility for data quality  checks and the final submission of the data. Since this is a cumulative  reporting process, additional corrections can take place on a quarterly  basis.", "OMB guidance does not explicitly mandate a methodology for conducting  data quality reviews at the prime and delegated subrecipient level or by  the federal agencies. Instead, the June 22, 2009, guidance provides the  relevant party conducting the data quality review with discretion in  determining the optimal method for detecting and correcting material  omissions or significant reporting errors. The guidance says that, at a  minimum, federal agencies, recipients, and subrecipients should establish  internal controls to ensure data quality, completeness, accuracy, and  timely reporting of all amounts funded by the Recovery Act.", "The Recovery Board published the results of the first round of recipient  reporting on Recovery.gov on October 30, 2009. According to the Web site,  recipients submitted 130,362 reports indicating that 640,329 \u201cjobs\u201d were  created or saved as a direct result of the Recovery Act. These data solely  reflect the direct FTEs reported by recipients of Recovery Act grants,  contracts, and loans for the period beginning when the act was signed into  law on February 17, 2009 through September 30, 2009.

Table 1 shows the distribution of jobs created or retained across  the nation as reported by recipients on Recovery.gov. Not surprisingly,  California, the most populous state, received the most Recovery Act  dollars and accounted for the largest number of the reported jobs created  or retained.", "Table 2 shows the number and share of jobs created or retained by federal  program agencies as reported by recipients of Recovery Act funding. The  Department of Education accounted for nearly 400,000 or close to two- thirds of the reported jobs created or retained. According to the  Department of Education, this represents about 325,000 education jobs  such as teachers, principals, and support staff in elementary and  secondary schools, and educational, administrative, and support personnel  in institutions of higher education funded primarily through the State  Fiscal Stabilization Fund (SFSF).

Collecting information from such a large and varied  number of entities in a compressed time frame, as required by the  Recovery Act, is a huge task. Major challenges associated with the new  Recovery Act reporting requirements included educating recipients about  the reporting requirements and developing the systems and infrastructure  for collecting and reporting the required information. While recipients in  the states we reviewed generally made good faith efforts to report  accurately, there is evidence, including numerous media accounts, that the  data reporting has been somewhat inconsistent. Even recipients of similar  types of funds appear to have interpreted the reporting guidance in  somewhat different ways and took different approaches in how they  developed their jobs data. The extent to which these reporting issues  affect overall data quality is uncertain at this point. As existing recipients  become more familiar with the reporting system and requirements, these  issues may become less significant although communication and training  efforts will need to be maintained and in some cases expanded as new  recipients of Recovery Act funding enter the system.

For the most part,  the number of records identified by our edit checks was relatively small  compared to the 56,986 prime recipient report records included in our  review.", "As part of our review, we examined the relationship between recipient  reports showing the presence or absence of any FTE counts with the  presence or absence of funding amounts shown in either or both data  fields for amount of Recovery Act funds received and amount of Recovery  Act funds expended. Forty four percent of the prime recipient reports  showed an FTE value. As shown in table 3, we identified 3,978 prime  recipient reports where FTEs were reported but no dollar amount was  reported in the data fields for amount of Recovery Act funds received and  amount of Recovery Act funds expended. These records account for  58,386 of the total 640,329 FTEs reported.", "As might be expected, 71 percent of those prime recipient reports shown  in table 3 that did not show any FTEs also showed no dollar amount in the  data fields for amount of Recovery Act funds received and amount  expended. There were also 9,247 reports that showed no FTEs but did  show some funding amount in either or both of the funds received or  expended data fields. The total value of funds reported in the expenditure  field on these reports was $965 million. Those recipient reports showing  FTEs but no funds and funds but no FTEs constitute a set of records that  merit closer examination to understand the basis for these patterns of  reporting.", "Ten recipient reports accounted for close to 30 percent of the total FTEs  reported. All 10 reports were grants and the majority of those reports  described funding support for education-sector related positions. For  reports containing FTEs, we performed a limited, automated scan of the  job creation field of the report, which is to contain a narrative description  of jobs created or retained. We identified 261 records where there was  only a brief description in this job creation field and that brief text showed  such words or phrases as \u201cnone,\u201d \u201cN/A,\u201d zero, or variants thereof. For most  of these records, the value of FTEs reported is small, but there are 10 of  these records with each reporting 50 or more FTEs. The total number of  FTEs reported for all 261 records is 1,776. While our scan could only  identify limited instances of apparently contradictory information between  the job description and the presence of an FTE number, we suspect that a  closer and more extensive review of the job description field in relation to  the count of FTEs would yield additional instances where there were  problems, and greater attention to this relationship would improve data  quality.", "In our other analyses of the data fields showing Recovery Act funds, we  identified 132 records where the award amount was zero or less than $10.  There were also 133 records where the amount reported as received  exceeded the reported award amount by more than $10. On 17 of these  records, the difference between the smaller amount awarded and the  larger reported amount received exceeded $1 million. While there may be  a reason for this particular relationship between the reported award  amount and amount received, it may also indicate an improper keying of  data or an interpretation of what amounts are to be reported in which  fields that is not in accordance with the guidance.", "We calculated the overall sum and sum by states for number of FTEs  reported, award amount, and amount received. We found that they  corresponded closely with the values shown for these data on  Recovery.gov. Some of the data fields we examined with known values  such as the Treasury Account Symbol (TAS) codes and Catalog of Federal  Domestic Assistance (CFDA) numbers showed no invalid values on  recipient reports. However, our analyses show that there is reason to be  concerned that the values shown for these data fields in conjunction with  the data field identifying who the funding or awarding agency is may not  be congruent. Both TAS and CFDA values are linked to specific agencies  and their programs. We matched the reported agency codes against the  reported TAS and CFDA codes. We identified 454 reports as having a  mismatch on the CFDA number\u2014therefore, the CFDA number shown on  the report did not match the CFDA number associated with either the  funding or awarding agency shown on the report. On TAS codes, we  identified 595 reports where there was no TAS match. Included in the  mismatches were 76 recipient reports where GAO was erroneously  identified as either the funding or awarding agency. In many instances,  review of these records and their TAS or CFDA values along with other  descriptive information from the recipient report indicated the likely  funding or awarding agencies. These mismatches suggest that either the  identification of the agency or the TAS and CFDA codes are in error on the  recipient report.", "Another potential problem area we identified was the provision of data on  the number and total amount of small subawards of less than $25,000.  There are data fields that collect information on small subawards, small  subawards to individuals, and small subawards to vendors. There were 380  prime recipient report records where we observed the same values being  reported in both small subawards and small subawards to individuals. We  also identified 1,772 other records where it could be clearly established  that these values were being reported separately. While we are able to  establish that these data are not being consistently reported, it is not  possible to assess from the data alone the full extent to which subaward  data are being combined or reported separately across all recipient  reports. Additionally, we noted 152 reports where, in either the subawards  or subawards to individuals data fields, the value for the number of  subawards and the total dollar value of subawards were exactly the same  and, as such, most likely erroneous.", "While most recipient report records were not identified as potential  problems in these initial edit checks and analyses thus far, our results do  indicate the need for further data quality efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Interpretations of How to Report FTEs Produced Questionable Data on Jobs Created or Retained", "paragraphs": ["Under OMB guidance, jobs created or retained were to be expressed as  FTEs.

These included weekly phone calls between OMB and  groups representing the state budget and comptrollers offices, weekly  calls between all state reporting leads, webinars, a call center, and e-mail  outreach. State officials reported they took advantage of and appreciated  this outreach. For example, Ohio state officials said they were generally  satisfied with the technical assistance and guidance provided by OMB\u2014 specifically, the assistance it received from the Federalreporting.gov help  desk staff. OMB estimated that it had a better than 90 percent response  rate for recipient reporting and said that they answered over 3,500  questions related to recipient reporting.", "The data element on jobs created or retained expressed in FTEs raised  questions and concerns for some recipients. OMB staff reported that  questions on FTEs dominated the types of questions they fielded during  the first round of recipient reporting. Although the recipient reports  provide a detailed account of individual projects, as Recovery.gov shows,  these projects represent different types of activities and start and end at  various points throughout the year, and recipients had various  understandings of how to report an FTE. In section 5.2 of the June 22  guidance, OMB states that \u201cthe estimate of the number of jobs required by  the Recovery Act should be expressed as \u2018full-time equivalents\u2019 (FTE),  which is calculated as the total hours worked in jobs retained divided by  the number of hours in a full time schedule, as defined by the recipient.\u201d  Further, \u201cthe FTE estimates must be reported cumulatively each calendar  quarter.\u201d In section 5.3, OMB states that \u201creporting is cumulative across  the project lifecycle, and will not reset at the beginning of each calendar or  fiscal year.\u201d", "FTE calculations varied depending on the period of performance the  recipient reported on. For example, in the case of federal highways  projects, some have been ongoing for six months, while others started in  September 2009. In attempting to address the unique nature of each  project, DOT\u2019s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) faced the issue of  whether to report FTE data based on the length of time to complete the  entire project (project period of performance) versus a standard period of  performance such as a calendar quarter across all projects. According to  FHWA guidance, which was permitted by OMB, FTEs reported for each  highway project are expressed as an average monthly FTE. This means  that for a project that started on July 1, 2009, the prime recipient would  add up the hours worked on that project in the months of July, August,  and September and divide that number by . For a  project that started on August 1, 2009, the prime recipient should add up  the hours worked on that project in the months of August and September  and divide that number by . For a project that started  on September, 1, 2009, the prime recipient should add up the hours  worked on that project in the month of September and divide that number  by . The issue of a standard performance period is  magnified when looking across programs and across states. To  consistently compare FTEs, or any type of fraction, across projects, one  must use a common denominator. Comparison of FTE calculations across  projects poses challenges when the projects have used different time  periods as denominators. Tables 4 and 5 below provide more detail on the  problems created by not having a standard performance period for  calculating FTEs.", "Table 4 is an application of the FHWA guidance for three projects with  varying start dates. This example illustrates the way FHWA applied the  OMB guidance and that the way FTEs are aggregated in  Federalreporting.gov could overstate the employment effects. In this  example, because the 30 monthly FTE data were aggregated without  standardizing for the quarter, FTEs would be overstated by 10 relative to  the OMB guidance. A standardized quarterly measure and job-years are  included as examples of a standard period of performance. A job-year is  simply one job for 1 year. Regardless of when the project begins, the total  hours worked is divided by a full years worth of time (12 months), which  would enable aggregation of employment effects across programs and  time.", "Table 5 is an application of the OMB guidance for two projects with  varying start dates. In this example, the OMB guidance understates the  employment effect relative to the standardized measure. Cumulative FTE  per OMB guidance would result in 20 FTE compared with 30 FTE when  standardized on a quarterly basis. Both a standardized quarterly FTE  measure and a job-year measure are included as examples of a standard  period of performance. Regardless of when the project begins, the total  hours worked is divided by a full year\u2019s worth of time (12 months), which  would enable aggregation of employment effects across programs and  time.", "There are examples from other DOT programs where the issue of a project  period of performance created significant variation in the FTE calculation.  For example, in Pennsylvania, each of four transit entities we interviewed  used a different denominator to calculate the number of full-time  equivalent jobs they reported on their recipients reports for the period  ending September 30, 2009. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation  Authority in Philadelphia used 1,040 hours as its denominator, since it had  projects underway in two previous quarters. Port Authority of Allegheny  County prorated the hours based on the contractors\u2019 start date as well as  to reflect that hours worked from September were not included due to lag  time in invoice processing. Port Authority used 1,127 hours for contractors  starting before April, 867 hours for contractors starting in the second  quarter, and 347 hours for contractors starting in the third quarter. Lehigh  and Northampton Transportation Authority in Allentown used 40 hours in  the 1512 report they tried to submit, but, due to some confusion about the  need for corrective action, the report was not filed. Finally, the  Pennsylvania Department of Transportation in the report for nonurbanized  transit systems used 1,248 hours, which was prorated by multiplying 8  hours per workday times the 156 workdays between February 17 and  September 30, 2009. In several other of our selected states, this variation  across transit programs\u2019 period of performance for the FTE calculation  also occurred.", "The issue of variation in the period of performance used to calculate FTEs  also occurred in Education programs. Across a number of states we  reviewed, local education agencies and higher education institutions used  a different denominator to calculate the number of FTEs they reported on  their recipient reports for the period ending September 30, 2009. For  example, two higher education systems in California each calculated the  FTE differently. In the case of one, officials chose to use a two-month  period as the basis for the FTE performance period. The other chose to  use a year as the basis of the FTE. The result is almost a three-to-one  difference in the number of FTEs reported for each university system in  the first reporting period. Although Education provides alternative  methods for calculating an FTE, in neither case does the guidance  explicitly state the period of performance of an FTE.", "Recipients were also confused about counting a job created or retained  even though they knew the number of hours worked that were paid for  with Recovery Act funds. For example, the Revere Housing Authority, in  administering one Recovery Act project, told us that they may have  underreported jobs data from an architectural firm providing design  services for a Recovery Act window replacement project at a public  housing complex. The employees at the architecture firm that designed the  window replacement project were employed before the firm received the  Recovery Act funded contract and will continue to be employed after the  contract has been completed, so from the Revere Housing Authority\u2019s  perspective there were no jobs created or retained. As another example,  officials from one housing agency reported the number of people, by trade,  who worked on Recovery Act related projects, but did not apply the full- time equivalent calculation outlined by OMB in the June 22 reporting  guidance. Officials from another public housing agency told us that they  based the number of jobs they reported on letters from their contractors  detailing the number of positions rather than FTEs. OMB staff said that  thinking about the jobs created or retained as hours worked and paid for  with Recovery Act funds was a useful way to understand the FTE  guidance. While OMB\u2019s guidance explains that in applying the FTE  calculation for measuring the number of jobs created or retained  recipients will need the total number of hours worked that are funded by  the Recovery Act, it could emphasize this relationship more thoroughly  throughout its guidance.", "OMB\u2019s decision to convert jobs into FTEs provides a consistent lens to  view the amount of labor being funded by the Recovery Act, provided each  recipient uses a standard time frame in considering the FTE. The current  OMB guidance, however, creates a situation where, because there is no  standard starting or ending point, an FTE provides an estimate for the life  of the project. Without normalizing the FTE, aggregate numbers should  not be considered, and the issue of a standard period of performance is  magnified when looking across programs and across states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technical Reporting and Processing Glitches Occurred, but Recipients Were Able to Report", "paragraphs": ["Recipients we interviewed were able to report into and review data on  Federalreporting.gov. Particularly given the scale of the project and how  quickly it was implemented, within several months, the ability of the  reporting mechanisms to handle the volume of data from the range of  recipients represents a solid first step in the data collection and reporting  process for the fulfillment of the section 1512 mandate. Nonetheless, there  were issues associated with the functional process of reporting. For  example, state officials with decentralized reporting structures reported  problems downloading submitted information from Recovery.gov to  review top-line figures such as money spent and jobs created or retained.  The Iowa Department of Management, which did Iowa\u2019s centralized  reporting into Federalreporting.gov, said that, overall, the system was very  slow. In addition to the slowness, as the system was processing input from  Iowa\u2019s submission, every time it encountered an error, it kicked back the  whole submission\u2014but it showed only the one error. After fixing the one  errant entry, the state resubmitted its information, which would then be  completely sent back the next time an error was encountered. Iowa  officials believe it would have been more efficient if the system identified  all errors in submission and sent back a complete list of errors to fix.  Other recipient reporters we interviewed highlighted issues around  DUNS numbers and other key identifiers, along with the inability to enter  more than one congressional district for projects that span multiple  districts. The expectation is that many of these entry and processing errors  were captured through the review process, but the probability that all  errors were caught is low.", "Generally, state officials from our 17 jurisdictions reported being able to  work through technical reporting and processing glitches. For example,  Florida officials reported that they encountered many technical issues but  were able to solve the problems by contacting the Recovery Board. Ohio  officials noted that, although they were initially concerned, in spite of the  tremendous amount of data being submitted, Federalreporting.gov held up  well. While they faced some challenges, California officials reported that,  overall, they were successful in reporting the numbers into  Federalreporting.gov. They worked with the technical team at  Federalreporting.gov and performed a test on October 1, 2009, to see if the  upload of the job data was going to work. During the October reporting  time frame, New Jersey officials reported that they generally did not  experience significant recipient reporting problems. The few reporting  problems New Jersey experienced occurred in relation to issues uploading  the data onto Federalreporting.gov and issues requiring clarifying  guidance from the relevant federal agency.", "Notwithstanding the concerns over the slowness of the reporting system  and error checks, Iowa officials also reported that the process worked  rather well, determining that most of their state reporting problems  seemed to stem from a few recipients not fully grasping all of the training  the state had provided and thus not knowing or having key information  like DUNS numbers and in some cases submitting erroneous information.  The state department of management plans to specifically address the 30  or so recipients associated with these issues\u2014just about all of which were  school districts. As a follow-up from this first reporting cycle, several  states have developed a list of lessons learned to share with OMB and  other federal agencies. An example in appendix I illustrates problems  public housing authorities had with both the recipient reporting  processing functions and the FTE calculation.", "In addition to the Federalreporting.gov Web site, the Recovery Board used  a revised Recovery.gov Web site to display reported data. The revised site  includes the ability to search spending data by state, ZIP code, or  congressional district and display the results on a map. The Recovery  Board also awarded a separate contract to support its oversight  responsibilities with the ability to analyze reported data and identify areas  of concern for further investigation. In addition, the board plans to  enhance the capabilities of Federalreporting.gov. However, the Recovery  Board does not yet use an adequate change management process to  manage system modifications. Without such a process, the planned  enhancements could become cost and schedule prohibitive. The board has  recognized this as a significant risk and has begun development of a  change management process.

In addition, federal agencies funding Recovery Act  projects and activities provide a layer of oversight that augments recipient  data quality. Oversight authorities including OMB, the Recovery Board,  and federal agency IGs also have roles to play in ensuring recipient  reported data quality, while the general public and nongovernmental  entities can help as well by highlighting data problems for correction.", "All of the jurisdictions we reviewed had data quality checks in place for  the recipient reporting data, either at the state level or a state agency level.  State agencies, as entities that receive Recovery Act funding as federal  awards in the form of grants, loans, or cooperative agreements directly  from the federal government, are often the prime recipients of Recovery  Act funding. Our work in the 16 states and the District of Columbia  showed differences in the way states as prime recipients approach  recipient reporting data quality review. Officials from nine states reported  having chosen a centralized reporting approach meaning that state  agencies submit their recipient reports to a state central office, which then  submits state agency recipient reports to Federalreporting.gov. For  example, Colorado\u2019s Department of Transportation provided its recipient  report to a central entity, the Colorado Office of Information Technology,  for submission to Federalreporting.gov. States with centralized reporting  systems maintain that they will be able to provide more oversight of  recipient reporting with this approach. Advocates of centralized reporting  also expect that method will increase data quality, decrease omissions and  duplicate reporting, and facilitate data cleanup.", "Officials from the remaining eight jurisdictions reported using a  decentralized reporting system. In these cases, the state program office  administering the funds is the entity submitting the recipient report. In  Georgia, for example, the State Department of Transportation is  responsible for both reviewing recipient report data and submitting it to  Federalreporting.gov. Illinois, as is the case for four other decentralized  states, is quasidecentralized where the data are centrally reviewed and  reported in a decentralized manner.

Each New Jersey state department  or entity was responsible for formulating a strategy for data quality  reviews and implementing that strategy.

This  system gave the Department of Community Affairs the ability to view the  data as it came in from each subrecipient. From this data collection tool,  the department uploaded prime and subrecipient data to  Federalreporting.gov. All departmental strategies were reviewed by the  New Jersey Governor\u2019s office and the New Jersey Recovery Accountability  Task Force.

Consequently, DOT and its modal  administrations, such as FHWA, and state departments of transportation  gained experience collecting and reporting job creation and retention  information before the first Recovery Act section 1512 report was due in  October 2009 and required FHWA to have its data collection and review  process in place in advance of October 1, 2009, the start of the section  1512 reporting.", "To help fulfill these reporting requirements, FHWA implemented a  reporting structure that ties together the federal and state levels of  reporting, creating both a chain of evidence and redundancy in the review  of the reported data.

As part of t reporting structure, FHWA also created the Recovery Act Data System  (RADS), with the updated version of the system released in early  September 2009. RADS is primarily designed as a repository of data for  states, but it also serves as an important oversight tool for FHWA becaus it links federal financial data to project data reported by the states. The  system helps ensure consistent definitions of fields and enables FHWA to  auto-populate identification fields, including DUNS numbers, award  numbers, and total award amounts, to both reduce the burden at the  project level and to reduce the data entry errors.

Education has coordinated its efforts regarding recipient reporting with  OMB in a number of ways, including participating in cross-agency  workgroups and clearing its guidance materials with OMB prior to  disseminating them. On August 10, 2009, Education hosted a web-based  technical assistance conference on reporting requirements that included  information on OMB\u2019s guidance on estimating and reporting jobs data. On  September 11, the department issued guidance specifically related to  estimating and reporting jobs created or retained by states and LEAs  receiving Recovery Act grants. Education updated its jobs guidance and  hosted another web-based technical assistance conference on September  21, providing detailed instructions to states and LEAs on a range of topics,  such as how to estimate the number of hours created or retained for a  teacher who works less than 12 months in a year. In addition, according to  Education officials, the department developed and implemented a draft  plan to review the jobs data that states and LEAs reported to  Federalreporting.gov in October. This plan addresses the roles and  responsibilities of several Education offices to assist with the data quality  review throughout the 30-day reporting timeline (for example, Oct. 1  through Oct. 30, 2009). According to the plan, these responsibilities  include continuous evaluation of recipient and subrecipient efforts to meet  reporting requirements, as well as providing limited data quality reviews  and notifying the recipient of the need to make appropriate and timely  corrections. The plan says that reviewers are to conduct two types of data  quality checks \u2013 an automated and a manual review. The automated  review will validate various data elements for financial assistance against  its grant management system, such as prime award numbers, recipient  DUNS numbers, and amounts of awards. The manual review will identify  outliers in certain data elements, such as whether the reported number of  jobs created is reasonable. According to Education officials, upon their  initial review of recipient reported data, the most common errors were  relatively small\u2014such as mistyped award numbers or incorrect award  amounts\u2014and were easily addressed and corrected during the agency  review period. Department officials told us that they provided technical  assistance to states and were able to have states correct the errors such  that almost all of them were corrected before the October 30 deadline.  Furthermore, state officials generally provided positive feedback to the  department for these efforts, according to Education officials. Education\u2019s  Office of Inspector General (OIG) examined Education\u2019s process for  reviewing the quality of recipient reported data and found that Education\u2019s  data review process was generally adequate. The OIG\u2019s review  determined that Education has established a process to perform limited  data quality reviews intended to identify problems, such as questionable  expenditure patterns or job estimates. OIG also acknowledged that  Education developed a process to correct any issues that Education  officials find by contacting the recipients who submitted the report. In  addition, OIG noted that the department plans to review quarterly data at a  state level to determine whether there are systemic problems with  individual recipients and that Education plans to use the reported  information as a management tool.", "State educational agencies (SEA) also have taken action to collect and  report jobs data and to ensure data quality. State officials in Arizona,  Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York and officials in the District of  Columbia told us that they adapted their existing data systems or created  new ones to track and report jobs data. For example, Massachusetts  Department of Education officials created an online quarterly reporting  web site to collect jobs data from its LEAs and detailed information on  personnel funded by Recovery Act grants. In addition, many SEA and LEA  officials we spoke with reported taking steps to ensure data quality, such  as pre-populating data fields (that is, inserting data, such as DUNS  numbers, into the recipient reporting template for the LEAs), checking the  reasonableness of data entered, and looking for missing data. In addition  to tracking and reporting jobs data and taking steps to ensure data quality,  SEA officials reported providing technical assistance, such as written  guidance and Web-based seminars, that explain how LEAs should report  job estimates. For example, California state officials had LEAs submit  their data through a new web-based data reporting system and, prior to  implementing the new system, provided written guidance and offered a  web-based seminar to its LEAs.", "Despite efforts to ensure data quality, state and local officials we spoke  with raised some concerns about the quality of jobs data reported in  October 2009. For example, LEAs were generally required to calculate a  baseline number of hours worked, which is a hypothetical number of  hours that would have been worked in the absence of Recovery Act funds.  LEA officials were to use this baseline number to determine the number of  hours created or retained and to subsequently derive the number of FTEs  for job estimates. Each LEA was responsible for deriving its own estimate.  New Jersey state officials we interviewed told us that it was likely that  LEAs used different methods to develop their baseline numbers, and as a  result, LEAs in the same state may be calculating FTEs differently. (See  appendix II for a complete description of the calculations used to  determine baseline number of hours worked, number of hours created or  retained, and FTEs for jobs created or retained). According to Illinois state  officials, some of their LEAs had double-counted the number of positions,  attributing the positions to both state fiscal year 2009 (which ended on  June 30, 2009) and fiscal year 2010 (beginning July 1, 2009), in part  because the reporting period covered both of the state\u2019s fiscal years. Also,  according to Illinois officials, other school districts estimated that zero  positions were attributable to the Recovery Act. In those cases, LEA  officials received Recovery Act funds before finalizing staff lay-offs. Since  they had not officially laid off any staff, Illinois officials told us that LEA  officials were unsure as to whether those jobs would count as \u201cjobs saved\u201d  and believed it best to report that no jobs had been saved because of  Recovery Act funding. Illinois officials told us that Education reviewed  Illinois\u2019 data, but did not ask them to make any corrections, but instead  asked the state to disaggregate the job estimates by type of position, such  as teachers and administrators. Also, one LEA official from New York  reported that he did not have enough time to conduct the necessary data  quality checks he wanted to perform. Education officials acknowledged  that many state and local officials reported various challenges in  understanding the instructions and methodology that Education suggested  they use to calculate job estimates. According to Education officials,  when states contacted the department to report these problems,  Education officials provided technical assistance to resolve the state\u2019s  specific issues.", "States faced challenges due to the timing of guidance or changes in  guidance on how to estimate jobs attributable to the Recovery Act,  according to Education officials and several state officials we interviewed.  For example, Colorado officials reported that, based on June 22, 2009  guidance from OMB, they believed that subrecipient vendors\u2019 jobs would  be considered \u201cindirect jobs\u201d and therefore LEAs would not have to  provide estimates of their vendors\u2019 jobs in their reports. Colorado officials  told us they received guidance at Education\u2019s August technical assistance  conference indicating that subrecipients (in this case, LEAs) are supposed  to include vendor job estimates based on those jobs directly funded by  Recovery Act grants. However, Education\u2019s guidance did not clearly  distinguish between direct and in-direct vendor jobs, according to state  officials, making it difficult for LEAs to determine which vendor jobs to  include in their section 1512 reports. State officials also reported receiving  further guidance on estimating jobs from Education on September 15 and  attending a related technical assistance conference on September 21. On  September 16, the Colorado SEA issued guidance stating that LEAs would  be responsible for including vendor jobs in the job estimates they would  be reporting. (Colorado\u2019s LEA reports were due to the SEA on September  25, because the SEA was required to submit its data to the state  controller\u2019s office on September 29 for centralized reporting.) Also,  officials in California\u2014where LEAs had to report to the SEA on September  23\u2014said they were not notified until Education\u2019s September 21 conference  that all LEAs that received Recovery Act funds had to register in the  Central Contractor Registration. They told us that this contradicted  previous guidance from Education and would have required LEAs to  register within 2 days to meet their state\u2019s September 23 deadline.  California officials advised federal officials that the state would implement  this requirement for the second quarterly reporting period.", "Education officials and officials in two states mentioned actions that might  improve the reporting and data quality processes before the next reports  are due in January 2010. Education officials suggested a number of  possible changes in Federalreporting.gov, such as allowing Education to  pre-populate some basic state data, such as grant award numbers and  amounts, would decrease the workload for states and help avoid some  technical errors. Also, in response to problems such as LEAs counting jobs  in two fiscal years, Education plans to provide more guidance in early  December 2009 to states on calculating job estimates. At the state level,  officials in Georgia reported plans to make changes to the state\u2019s  processes, such as adding internal edit checks so that those who enter the  data will have to make corrections as part of the data entry process. Also,  Illinois has created an office to work with state agencies to improve their  data reporting processes, according to a state official.

Therefore, both the data reported by recipients and other  macroeconomic data and methods are necessary to understand the overall  employment effects of the stimulus.", "Economists will use statistical models to estimate a range of potential  effects of the stimulus program on the economy. In general, the estimates  are based on assumptions about the behavior of consumers, business  owners, workers, and state and local governments. Against the  background of these assumptions, themselves based on prior research, the  effects of different policies can be estimated. Any such estimate is  implicitly a comparison between alternative policies. The reliability of any  alternative scenario that is constructed depends on its underlying  assumptions and the adequacy of evidence in support of those  assumptions, as well as on the accuracy of the data that form the basis for  what is observed and on how well the model reflects actual behavior.", "In the broadest terms, economic research using macroeconomic models  suggests general rules of thumb for approximating the job impact and the  GDP increase for a given amount of stimulus spending. In constructing  their estimates of the employment impacts of the act, CEA observed that a  one percent increase in GDP has in the past been associated with an  increase in employment of approximately 1 million jobs, about three  quarters of 1 percent of national employment. Similarly, CBO economists  have assumed that a one percent increase in output generates somewhere  between 600,000 and 1.5 million jobs. As a result, projections of the  employment impact of the Recovery Act can be generated from  macroeconomic models that estimate output, providing the basis for  estimates of changes in employment.", "CEA estimates of the employment effects of the Recovery Act have been  based on statistical projections and allocations using historical  relationships. In January 2009, the incoming administration projected the  anticipated effects of fiscal stimulus on output and employment in the  economy, specifying a prototypical spending package of tax cuts,  payments to individuals, and direct spending by federal and state  government. The effects of such additional spending on output (GDP)  were projected using multipliers, values based on historical experience  that estimate the output change per unit of different types of changes in  government spending. These output increases were translated into  employment effects using a rule of thumb, again based on history, that a 1  percent rise in GDP yields 1 million jobs.", "The incoming administration\u2019s January 2009 analysis of a prototypical  stimulus package found that it would be expected to increase GDP by 3.7  percent and increase jobs by 3,675,000 by the fourth quarter of 2010. The  analysis compared the unemployment rate with and without the stimulus.  At that time, the unemployment rate for 2009 was projected to be 8  percent with a stimulus and closer to 9 percent without. In May 2009, CEA  reported on the anticipated employment effects of the actual Recovery Act  as passed by Congress and signed into law by the President. That analysis  was consistent with the January projections that the Recovery Act (which  was deemed to closely resemble the prototypical package earlier  assumed) would result in approximately 3.5 million jobs saved or created  by the end of 2010, compared to the situation expected to exist in the  absence of the act. Later, when the actual unemployment rate rose beyond  9 percent, the administration acknowledged that its earlier projections of  unemployment were too low but asserted that, without the Recovery Act,  the rate would have been even higher than observed.", "In September 2009 CEA reported on the effects of Recovery Act spending  through the end of August. It noted that statistical analysis of actual  economic performance compared to that which might have been expected  in the absence of the Recovery Act suggested that the Recovery Act had  added \u201croughly\u201d 2.3 percentage points to GDP in the second quarter and  was likely to add even more in the third. Translating that output gain into  employment, CEA surmised that employment in August was 1 million jobs  higher than it would have been without the act.", "The recipient reports are not estimates of the impact of the Recovery Act,  although they do provide a real-time window on the results of Recovery  Act spending. Recipients are expected to report accurately on their use of  funds; what they are less able to say is what they would have done without  the benefit of the program. For any disbursement of federal funds,  recipients are asked to report on the use of funds to make purchases from  business and to hire workers. These firms and workers spend money to  which they would not otherwise have had access. Recipients could not be  expected to report on the expansionary effects of their use of funds, which  could easily be felt beyond local, state, or even national boundaries.  Neither the recipients nor analysts can identify with certainty the impact  of the Recovery Act because of the inability to compare the observed  outcome with the unobserved, counterfactual scenario (in which the  stimulus does not take place). At the level of the national economy,  models can be used to simulate the counterfactual, as CEA and others  have done. At smaller scales, comparable models of economic behavior  either do not exist or cover only a very small portion of all the activity in  the macroeconomy.", "The effect of stimulus on employment depends on the behavior of the  recipient of aid. For consumers, it depends on the extent to which their  total spending increases. For business firms, it depends on the increase, if  any, in their purchases from other business firms or their payrolls. For  state and local governments, it is the increase in their purchases of goods  and services and their own employment rolls. Within any given group of  recipients, choices to spend or save will vary. For example, a consumer  with a large credit card balance may use a tax cut to pay down the balance  or save more rather than increasing spending. Given that the personal  savings rate fell to essentially zero before the recession, households may  well choose to rebuild savings rather than spend. A business firm might  not see additional capital spending or hiring as advantageous. A state  government might decide to bolster its reserves where permitted under  law rather than increase its outlays or cut its taxes. In each case, the  strength of the program as immediate stimulus is weakened to the extent  that all funds are not spent.", "The extent to which the initial spending reverberates throughout the  economy is summarized by a multiplier, a measure of the cumulative  impact on GDP over time of a particular type of spending or tax cut. The  resulting change in output translates into a change in employment. In the  context of the Recovery Act recipient reports, the output and employment  effects will likely vary with the severity of the economic downturn in a  recipient\u2019s location (as reflected by distress in labor markets and the fiscal  positions of governments), and the amount of funds received by the  recipient. The nature of the projects or activities to which the recipient  applies its funds also matters, whether the projects use labor intensively  and whether those who are hired will themselves spend or save their  earnings."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Potential Effect of Different Types of Fiscal Stimulus", "paragraphs": ["Economists use computer models of the U.S. economy with historical data  on employment, GDP, public spending, taxes, and many other factors to  study the effects of monetary (e.g., changes in interest rates) and fiscal  policies (e.g., changes in government taxing and spending) designed to  affect the trajectory of the economy. In general, a fiscal stimulus program  like the Recovery Act is aimed at raising aggregate demand \u2013 the spending  of consumers, business firms, and governments. This may be  accomplished by means of tax cuts, grants-in-aid, or direct Federal  spending. In response, the recipients may purchase more goods and  services than they would have otherwise. This could lead to governments  and business firms refraining from planned dismissal of employees or to  hiring additional workers. The stimulus may lead to an overall, net  increase in national employment and economic output. Models of the  nation\u2019s economy can provide estimates of changes in GDP and  employment that result from changes in monetary or fiscal policies.  In assessing the effects of fiscal policies such as additional government  spending or tax cuts on GDP, macroeconomic models can be used to  estimate \u201cmultipliers,\u201d which represent the cumulative impact on GDP  over time of a particular type of spending or tax cut. Multipliers translate  the consequences of a change in one variable, such as in the demand for  goods and services brought about by economic stimulus, on other  variables, such as the supply of those goods and services and employment,  taking into account \u201cripple effects\u201d that occur throughout the economy.", "The size of the multiplier depends on the extent to which changes in  additional government spending or revenue translates into changes in  spending by recipients and beneficiaries of the additional spending.  Spending increases the multiplier, and saving reduces it. The multiplier is  also larger when there is slack in the economy (unemployed persons and  idle productive capacity). Also, the expansionary effects of government  spending are greater when stimulus funds are borrowed rather than raised  by taxation. Finally, the multiplier effect in the U.S. will be greater to the  extent that new spending, whether by government or individuals, is  devoted to domestically-produced goods and services.", "In general, macroeconomic models and estimated multipliers can provide  insights on the potential effect of different types of public spending.  Because of the limited historical experience with fiscal stimulus of the  magnitude of the Recovery Act, there is uncertainty about the extent to  which the multipliers estimated using historical data about the effect of  previous business cycles will accurately reflect the stimulus effect this  time around. Economic research, however, has developed a basis for  constructing reasonable ranges of values. In projecting the anticipated  effect of the Recovery Act on national output, the CBO grouped the act\u2019s  provisions according to the size of the multiplier\u2014that is, the magnitude of  the effect of a particular provision\u2019s spending on GDP (see table 7).  Drawing on analyses based on past experience with the results of  government spending, CBO has identified a range of 1.0 to 2.5 for  multipliers. For example, a multiplier of 1.0 means a dollar of stimulus  financed by borrowing results in an additional dollar of GDP. CBO  assumes larger multipliers for grants to state and local governments for  infrastructure spending, and lower values\u20140.7 to 1.9\u2014for transfers not  related to infrastructure investment.

Generally speaking, states with weaker  economies and finances will be more likely to spend Recovery Act dollars.  States that may suffer little or no harm from a national downturn are less  motivated to make full use of any federal assistance. Rather than  increase spending, they may choose to cut taxes or, where permitted by  law, add to their reserves.

The expectation of aid could encourage governments to draw  more out of reserves or to borrow more than they would otherwise. The  rationale is that the expected aid would replace the reserves or liquidate  the new debt. In this way, the timing of aid could postdate the impact.  Research on individual consumption has long wrestled with the problem  of how expectations influence household decisions.

Balanced budget  requirements and other constraints cause them to reduce spending and  raise taxes, generating what is called \u201cfiscal drag.\u201d Federal assistance can  reduce the need for such measures. In this way, the negative employment  effects of fiscal drag can be precluded and existing jobs can be saved. With  sufficient aid, it is possible for state and local governments to go beyond  saving existing jobs to creating additional ones. However, there are likely  to be limits to the abilities of governments to spend aid quickly enough to  affect employment  The recession has substantially reduced states\u2019 and local governments\u2019  combined tax revenues.

The HUD official told  us these steps are necessary for validating the recipient reports because  they ensure the appropriate points of contact at the appropriate  organizations\u2014in this case, public housing agencies\u2014are reporting for  each program. The Federalreporting.gov Web site states that each  recipient\u2019s point of contact information is taken directly from the CCR and  if an organization changes its point of contact information it will take 48  hours for Federalreporting.gov to receive the change and e-mail the FRPIN  and temporary password to the new point of contact. According to the  HUD official, a housing agency\u2019s contact information in CCR is sometimes  outdated and the systems are often not updated in time for access to be  correctly transferred. Additionally, one housing agency official reported he  saved his data entry as a draft before being timed out of the system, but  was unable to retrieve the data when he reentered the reporting Web site.  A HUD official said in the future, HUD and OMB will need to improve the  function of the system and the official said that they are working to ensure  all housing agencies have access to the reporting systems.", "According to a HUD official, there was widespread misunderstanding by  public housing agencies about OMB\u2019s methodology for calculating the  number of jobs created or retained by the Recovery Act, in part because  housing agencies are not familiar with reporting jobs information. In a few  cases, we found that public housing agencies had reported the number of  jobs created or retained into Federalreporting.gov without converting the  number into full-time equivalents. For example, officials from one housing  agency reported the number of people, by trade, who worked on Recovery  Act related projects, but did not apply the full-time equivalent calculation  outlined by OMB in the June 22 reporting guidance. Additionally, officials  from another public housing agency told us that they based the number of  jobs they reported into Federalreporting.gov on letters from their  contractors detailing the number of positions rather than full-time  equivalents created as a result of their Recovery Act-funded projects. In  another case, a housing agency official reported having difficulty locating  guidance on calculating job creation. As a result, the housing agency may  have underreported jobs data from an architectural firm providing design  services for a Recovery Act window replacement project at a public  housing complex.", "HUD officials cited the fact that OMB and HUD provided additional  clarification and guidance close to the deadline for recipient reporting as a  factor in housing agencies\u2019 confusion about the methodology for counting  jobs. According to a HUD official, HUD was in discussions with OMB  about finalizing and clarifying portions of the June 22, 2009, job guidance  right up to the end of September. In early September, HUD posted the  OMB guidance to its Web site and provided information by e-mail to  housing agencies on registration for Federalreporting.gov, as well as links  to Web seminars and training provided by OMB. HUD issued further  guidance to public housing agencies by e-mail on September 25, 2009,  approximately 2 weeks before the October 10, 2009, deadline for recipient  reporting, providing templates and data dictionaries tailored to the Public  Housing Capital Fund. The guidance also reiterated the recipient reporting  responsibilities for public housing agencies.", "HUD officials told us they did not have enough time to translate some of  the terminology into concrete terms that would be clearer to housing  agency officials. For example, HUD posted a jobs calculator spreadsheet  to its Web site, and HUD field staff would direct housing agencies to this  guidance when they asked specific questions about how to calculate jobs.  Nonetheless, greater instruction may be needed beyond what was  provided to housing agencies on the job calculator\u2019s instructions page. A  HUD official said it seemed like some housing agencies may have pulled  information for the recipient reports from the wrong fields in the job  calculator, which produced errors. A HUD official stated they will work  with OMB to improve housing agencies\u2019 understanding of the methodology  for reporting in full-time equivalents prior to the next round of recipient  reporting in January 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "California\u2019s Experiences with Recipient Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["State officials from the California Recovery Task Force and the California  Office of the State Chief Information Officer (CIO) explained that while  the centralized reporting structure had several benefits, challenges with  changing reporting requirements from federal agencies and technological  glitches still occurred.", "As a centralized reporting state, each state agency reported directly to the  CIO through the California ARRA Accountability tool.

However,  according to state officials, local government agencies that received direct  Recovery Act dollars from the federal government are not under the Task  Force\u2019s purview of the state officials and report to Federalreporting.gov on  their own. State officials stated that a centralized reporting structure  allows the CIO to act as a liaison between OMB and the state for faster  reconciliation of issues. The CIO, on behalf of the task force, was  responsible for collecting, validating, and uploading data from state  agencies to Federalreporting.gov. The state officials believed the process  went well overall and commended their state team for successfully  reporting into Federalreporting.gov. The Task Force officials believed the  reporting process could be improved if OMB provided a comprehensive  list of awards to better crosscheck reporting. California officials stated  that many of the challenges in reporting did not come from the additional  information requested during October 11 to 20, but from changes  immediately prior to the September 30 cut-off date. These changes  included issues such as the Department of Education\u2019s request to include  Central Contract Registration numbers on September 21, and FHWA\u2019s  changes to four of the data elements, including the award amounts.", "California officials have a greater appreciation of what to expect during  the reporting process. They believe that the continuous communication  with the state agencies, including weekly data group meetings at which as  many as 60 people attended, contributed to the overall success of the  reporting process. They also have been developing their own internal logic  checks to assist with data validation. California officials continue to be  concerned that problems at Federalreporting.gov and changing agency  requirements will cause subrecipient data, initially correctly collected in  accordance with federal guidance, to be rejected, which will result in  penalties for late submissions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Florida Department of Transportation\u2019s Experiences with Reporting and Data Quality Reviews", "paragraphs": ["The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has reporting  requirements under both sections 1512 and 1201 of the Recovery Act.

For example,  FDOT\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG) developed five computer-based  training modules to assist department staff and external partners in the  use of the electronic reporting system. FDOT also partnered with its OIG  and the Florida Division of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)  to conduct town hall presentations for its seven District Offices and  Florida\u2019s Turnpike Enterprise.

Once approved, the data is available for review and approval by  the department\u2019s district office project manager. The district office project  manager performs a reasonableness check of the submitted data prior to  electronically approving the same.", "The electronic employment data is then available for review by OIG where  two types of analyses are performed. First, OIG identifies whether the  subrecipient should be reporting job data by comparing submitted data  (and subrecipient identifiers) against the master list of awarded Recovery  Act transportation projects. Second, OIG compares previously submitted  subrecipient information against information contained in its current  submission to determine any data anomalies or variances. Should any  significant data anomalies or variances occur, OIG will contact the  appropriate district and local agency.", "FDOT did not require subrecipients to submit verification of their job data  but subrecipients were advised by FDOT to maintain documentation for  review.

According to the contractor, this  reporting requirement is in the contract, and GDOT will withhold payment  if this report is not completed. As the general contractor, the firm is also  responsible for collecting the 1589 information from its subcontractors on  each job. Officials with the firm stated that they would withhold payment  from the subcontractors if they fail to provide the information. We  examined these contracts and confirmed these requirements. In addition  to the 1589 report, the contractor also submits certified payroll to GDOT  on a monthly basis.", "Guidance and Challenges: In terms of guidance, the contractor noted  that there was not a lot of training provided but that they did not  necessarily need much training. The main challenges raised were issues  with making changes within the GDOT system and the DUNS number  field. For example, officials explained once a report was submitted into  GDOT\u2019s system, it could not be edited, which made errors in entry or  reporting difficult to correct. The contractor has discussed this issue with  GDOT and hopes a solution will be reached for the next reporting cycle.", "The DUNS number requirement was an issue for several subrecipients  since they did not have a number and they were under the impression that  a cost was involved in obtaining a number, which there was not. After  discussions with GDOT, it was determined that subrecipients did not need  a DUNS number, but the field could not be blank. Therefore, GDOT  advised the contractor to have its subrecipients complete the file by  entering \u201cnot applicable.\u201d The contractor suggested that improvements in  reporting could be achieved by delaying the reporting date to GDOT to  allow more time to handle delays in payroll and obtaining supporting  information. Overall, the contractor felt that the September report was the  most accurate month reported to date and believed greater accuracy will  be achieved over time.", "Data Quality: Officials of the highway contractor told us they think they  have a handle on the process and were confident in the data submitted. In  their words, \u201cif it\u2019s inaccurate, we paid somebody wrong\u201d since the report  comes out of their payroll system. In terms of data from subcontractors,  the officials noted that their confidence varied somewhat across  subcontractors. Officials explained that information varied, based on the  capacity and expertise of the subcontractor (that is, experience in  reporting and if a certified payroll is in place). Officials explained they had  greater confidence in subcontractors that had certified payroll. They  provided several examples of subrecipients who were truckers or haulers  who are not familiar with reporting and often are a small operation of one  employee. Officials noted that the number of truckers or haulers on a  project is often large in order to meet disadvantaged business  requirements. Officials questioned if truckers and haulers should be part  of the job creation or retained count since similar positions may not be  counted for subcontractors that provide materials such as pipe.

Although there were additional data  elements required for Recovery Act projects, the company official noted  that FHWA Form 1589 specifies these additional reporting elements, and  they have been added to the EBO system to make it easier for contractors  and subcontractors to report on a monthly basis.", "According to the company official, the process was very straightforward.  Contractors and subcontractors log into the EBO system and can see  detailed information on all the projects they are working on for the  MassDOT Highway Division. Typically, by the 15th day of each month,  contractors and subcontractors upload their certified payroll files into the  EBO system.

He noted that for contractors that were used to working with complex  accounting systems, this training was adequate, but for smaller  contractors with little computer experience, the training could have been  better. In general, the official observed that most contractors and  subcontractors are very pleased with the new system because it interfaces  so well with their existing accounting and certified payroll databases and  because the cost is low.", "Data Quality: There are several steps for ensuring data quality. First, a  company official explained that most large contractors and many  subcontractors have accounting and payroll data systems that interface  with the EBO database well, so they are able to upload data from these  systems directly into the EBO system, eliminating the need to reenter  employment data. However, some smaller contractors don\u2019t have these  systems and thus must enter the data by hand each month.

Although it is rarely  needed, the official noted that withholding payments to subcontractors is  a very effective tool for getting subcontractors to submit their monthly  reports. Furthermore, all subcontractor employment reports are verified  against the daily duty log that is kept by the project supervisor, who is an  employee of the company. The MassDOT Highway Division also posts  resident engineers at each job site on a daily basis, and they keep a daily  diary of employment and work status that is used to verify the data  submitted by general contractors in the MassDOT Highway Division  project management system.

For example, if in quarter 2, all employees reported  in quarter 1 are retained and the baseline remains unchanged, we would  again have 1140 hours created or retained. To get the final cumulative   FTE created or retained, officials would sum 1140 for quarter 1 with 1140  for quarter 2 to get 2280 total hours created or retained.
