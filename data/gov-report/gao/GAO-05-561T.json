Its diversity allows it to address the needs of many citizens. To help it do so, Congress and some in the tax-exempt sector itself encourage good governance practices by exempt entities. Transparency over exempt entities' activities is aided by public access to their annual tax returns. As the nation's tax administrator, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a key role in overseeing this sector. Oversight can help ensure adherence to exempt purposes, protect against abuses, and sustain public support for the sector. The Chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means asked GAO to address (1) the growth of the section 501(c) tax-exempt sector; (2) the role of governance and transparency in ensuring that tax-exempt entities function effectively and with integrity; (3) IRS's capacity for overseeing the exempt sector, including its results and efforts to address critical compliance problems; and (4) states' oversight and their relationship with IRS in overseeing the tax-exempt sector."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The section 501(c) tax-exempt sector has grown steadily in reported assets, revenues, and expenses. For example, between 1998 and 2002 (the most recent year of data), its reported assets grew to over $2.5 trillion---with 12 percent growth for 501(c) charities and 22 percent growth for other 501(c) entities (noncharities). Accordingly, this tax-exempt sector comprises a significant part of the nation's economy and workforce. For example, spending in this sector appears to be about one-tenth of our economy and the paid exempt workforce appears to be comparable in size to some of the largest sectors of the U.S. civilian workforce, such as food and lodging. Good governance and transparency are essential elements to help provide assurance that exempt entities operate with integrity and effectiveness in meeting their missions. Good governance facilitates well-run operations that dissuade abusive behavior. Transparency sheds light on entities' practices, which enhances ethical and effective operations and facilitates oversight by the public and others. With recent concerns about abuses in the tax-exempt sector, renewed attention is being given to improving governance practices and increasing the transparency related to the sector. Staffing trends and insufficient data have contributed to IRS being challenged in executing its oversight role. IRS has begun to increase staffing, obtain better data on tax-exempt entities, and increase its capacity to analyze and use the data it obtains. For the critical compliance issues IRS has identified, it has started special initiatives to improve compliance. States often oversee tax-exempt entities, frequently focusing on protecting the public from fraudulent activities and guarding against misuse of charitable assets. States and the IRS believe that more data sharing would make their oversight more efficient and effective.

The sector recognized under section 501(c) of the  Internal Revenue Code (IRC) covers a diverse group of over 1.5 million  entities with varying sizes and exempt purposes (see app. I for types of  section 501(c) exempt entities).  The breadth and diversity of the tax- exempt sector allows it to address the specific needs of many of our  citizens and the general needs of society.  The exempt sector, and those  who volunteer to assist, also supplements government programs to meet  various needs.  For example, charities can supplement programs by  providing comfort to the aging, health care to the uninsured, and education  to the uneducated.", "As the nation\u2019s tax administrator, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a  key role in overseeing the tax-exempt sector.  Oversight can help sustain  public faith in the sector and ensure that exempt entities stay true to the  purposes that justify their tax exemption.  It also can help protect the entire  sector from potential abuses initiated by a small minority.", "Before discussing the work we did for the Committee, I want to frame  today\u2019s hearing within a broader context.  GAO recently issued a report  entitled, 21st Century Challenges:  Reexamining the Base of the Federal  Government.  This report provides examples of a number of key questions  that need to be explored in light of our current and projected fiscal  imbalances as well as other changes and challenges.  It highlights the need  for a re-examination of all major federal policies and programs in light of  21st century realities.  Although that report did not specifically cover the  tax-exempt sector, the sector is a microcosm of the issues raised in the  report.  While the provisions granting federally recognized tax-exempt  status and associated policies have been layered upon one another to  respond to challenges at the time, a comprehensive re-examination of the  tax-exempt sector has not been done in recent times.  On a broad scale, a  comprehensive re-examination could help address whether exempt entities  are providing services to our citizens commensurate with their favored tax  status, whether the current number and nature of exemptions continue to  make sense, whether restrictions on the activities of tax-exempt entities  remain relevant, and whether the framework for ensuring that exempt  entities adhere to the requirements attendant to their status is satisfactory.", "Today\u2019s hearing provides an excellent forum to launch such a re- examination.   Some of the more specific issues that may merit re- examination for the tax-exempt sector include:   Should the criteria for granting exempt status be reconsidered and do  we need as many types of tax-exempt entities?", "Do we need to modify the model used in overseeing tax-exempt entities  to ensure that the tax- exempt purpose is met and that fraud or other  misuse is deterred?", "What governance standards should apply to the tax-exempt sector, and  should particular types of exempt entities have more specific standards?", "Are the operations and activities of tax-exempt organizations  sufficiently transparent to support oversight by the public, news media,  and federal, state, and local governmental agencies?", "Beyond revoking tax-exempt status and various currently available  intermediate sanctions, do we need more intermediate sanctions to  deter abuse and enhance accountability while minimizing any damage to  those served by the exempt entity?", "Should certain federal audit and internal control requirements apply to  tax-exempt entities, and if so, how should the requirements vary  according to entities\u2019 size or other characteristics?", "Is there sufficient transparency over the total compensation package  and its justification for executives and other officials at tax-exempt  entities?", "What should be the allowable \u201clobbying and political\u201d activities in which  different types of tax-exempt entities can engage and how should such  activities be reported?", "What are the differences between nonprofit and for-profit entities that  perform similar missions, such as nonprofit and for-profit hospitals, and  do the nonprofit entities provide sufficiently different services to justify  their exemption?", "Based on your request, I will discuss  the growth of the tax-exempt sector, focusing on those entities whose  tax-exempt status falls under section 501(c) of the IRC;  the roles of sound governance practices and transparency in ensuring  that tax-exempt entities function with integrity and perform their  missions effectively;  IRS\u2019s capacity for overseeing those exempt from taxation under section  501(c), results of its oversight activities, and efforts to address critical  compliance problems; and  the states\u2019 role in overseeing tax-exempt entities and their relationship  with IRS in conducting oversight.", "To summarize the growth of the tax-exempt sector, we analyzed data filed  annually with IRS by section 501(c) entities.  To summarize governance  practices and transparency in the tax-exempt sector, we reviewed  documents published by IRS and others, and official statements made in  testimony before Congress.  To summarize IRS\u2019s oversight capacity, results,  and efforts to deal with critical compliance problems, we reviewed IRS\u2019s  data and interviewed IRS officials.  To summarize the role of states and  their relationship with IRS, we reviewed our previous reports and outside  articles and reports.  To the extent possible, we sought data from 1998  through the most recent year available for all descriptive statistics.  We  reviewed the reliability of the data used and found them reliable for our  purposes.  We did our work from December 2004 through March 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Let me begin by highlighting key points I will make.", "The 501(c) tax-exempt sector has grown steadily in reported assets,  revenues, and expenses.  For example, between 1998 and 2002 (the most  recent year of available data), their reported assets grew 15 percent to  over $2.5 trillion.  Accordingly, the tax-exempt sector comprises a  significant part of the nation\u2019s economy and workforce.  For example,  spending in the tax-exempt sector appears to be about one-tenth of our  economy and the paid exempt workforce appears to be comparable in  size to some of the largest sectors of the U.S. civilian workforce, such as  food and lodging.  The sector\u2019s significance in the economy might be  greater because the asset, revenue, and expense data are likely  understated to some unknown amount.  For example, the data do not  include all tax-exempt entities under section 501(c) because not all  entities are required to file, such as religious entities, and some entities  do not file required Form 990.", "Good governance and transparency are essential elements to ensure  that tax-exempt entities operate with integrity and effectiveness in  carrying out their missions.

IRS has begun to increase  staffing during 2005, which results in 467 full-time equivalents (FTE) to  examine the compliance of about a half million section 501(c) entities  that file Forms 990.  However, IRS does not know the extent to which  these entities comply.  Recognizing this, IRS started efforts in 2002 to  obtain compliance data for various segments of the exempt sector but  had to suspend most of these efforts to use those resources on higher  priorities such as pursuing known types of noncompliance.  For  example, IRS has ongoing special compliance initiatives dealing with  critical issues such as excessive compensation and abusive tax  transactions involving exempt entities.  IRS is also seeking ways to  access and better analyze existing data at IRS or elsewhere on exempt  entities.", "States often oversee tax-exempt entities, frequently focusing on  protecting the public from fraudulent activities and guarding against  misuse of charitable assets.

About  another 20 percent of exempt entities were social welfare organizations,  labor unions, and business associations--501(c) (4 through 6), respectively.   The remainder covered an array of types of exempt entities with varying  purposes and numbers.  In 2003, such types included 15 teacher retirement  funds, over 10,000 cemetery companies, over 4,000 state-chartered credit  unions, an employee-funded pension trust, 20 corporations to finance crop  operations, and over 35,000 veteran organizations.", "Entities that are not required to apply include those that are not private foundations and  that have gross receipts of less than $5,000 as well as churches and church-affiliated entities.", "Form 1023 (Application for Recognition of Exemption under Section  501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code) or Form 1024 (Application for  Recognition of Exemption under 501(a));   organizing documents, such as the Articles of Incorporation, Articles of  Association, Trust Indenture, Constitution, or other enabling  documents;  4 years of financial data; and  a full description of the purposes and the activities of the entity.", "After receiving tax-exempt recognition, many entities must annually file a  Form 990 to report their financial transactions and activities for a \u201ctax  year\u201d (see app. II for a copy of Form 990) if annual gross receipts are  normally more the $25,000.  Those that have less than $100,000 in gross  receipts and year-end assets of less than $250,000 may use Form 990-EZ.   Generally, entities with gross receipts below $25,000 are not required to  file.  Certain types of entities such as churches and religious organizations  also are not required to file.  Form 990 has information on revenues,  expenses, and assets.  For 2003, the form had 105 line items on 6 pages as  well as 46 pages of instructions plus two schedules.  Schedule A covers  several areas such as compensation, lobbying, and revenue sources.   Schedule B covers the source of contributions to charities and certain  other exempt entities, such as IRC Section 527 political organizations.", "IRS oversight relies on two activities.  First, IRS reviews applications for  tax-exempt status to determine whether a tax-exempt purpose is  envisioned.  IRS can approve or deny the application.  Once an application  is properly completed, the criterion for approving or denying the  exemption is whether the applicant provides sufficient evidence that its  operations will match an allowable exempt purpose.  Second, IRS annually  examines some Forms 990 to determine whether selected exempt entities  meet various requirements (such as restrictions on political activities).  In  general, IRS attempts to select entities that it believes are likely to have  violated requirements. IRS can accept the Form 990 as filed or change the  status of the entity, impose excise taxes for certain types of violations, or  revoke the exempt status if the violations are serious enough.  IRS can also  assess taxes if an entity has not fully paid employment taxes or taxes on  unrelated business income.", "Given concerns about the tax-exempt sector, the Senate Committee on  Finance asked that a panel of experts make recommendations to Congress  to improve oversight, transparency, and governance in the sector.  To do so,  the Independent Sector convened a Nonprofit Sector Panel in October  2004, which includes 24 nonprofit and philanthropic leaders.

This  is implicitly recognized in some of the statutory and regulatory  requirements for the tax-exempt sector.", "For example, to obtain federal tax-exempt recognition, applying entities  must include charters and bylaws with their application.  The states in  which they are established specify what must be included in the charters  and/or bylaws and the states\u2019 requirements help create a basic governance  structure for exempt entities.  Some states, for instance, have requirements  for audited financial statements of tax-exempt entities.  For example, in  one state, charities with gross revenue in excess of $100,000 and not more  than $250,000 are required to file financial statements accompanied by a  report from a licensed certified public accountant.

For instance, to ensure that tax-exempt assets are for public rather  than private benefit, IRS has issued regulations affecting tax-exempt  entities on \u201cexcessive compensation\u201d to officers, directors, or other  employees.  IRS requires market comparability studies and a review of  compensation by boards of directors.  If excessive compensation is found,  excise taxes under section 4958 for charities and section 4941 for private  foundations can be levied against the overpaid individual and certain  managers who knowingly approved the payments.

Presumably, when \u201csunshine\u201d is let in, inappropriate  activities are less likely to occur.

For example, a series of articles in 2003 highlighted possible  misuse of foundations and trusts, citing numerous cases of excess  compensation, insider loans, self-dealing, extravagant perks, and other  questionable activities.

An easement is when an owner voluntarily restricts changes to real  property, such as to preserve historic buildings and the environment.   Donation of the easement to an exempt entity provides an income-tax  break to the donor.  In some cases, insiders at the charities charged with  policing the restrictions imposed by the easements on development may  have benefited the most.  In other cases, individuals may have claimed tax  deductions for easement donations even though local or other laws already  required preservation of the property.", "Concerns about excessive compensation and whether some tax-exempt  entities provide sufficient services to justify their exempt status have  surfaced regarding nonprofit hospitals.  An example of concerns in these  areas has been offered by the Minnesota Attorney General who recently  testified on such abuses.  Among other things, his office found that certain  tax-exempt health care systems paid for trips to vacation resorts by  executives and board members without a clear business purpose, and that  some nonprofit hospitals provided inadequate levels of \u201ccharity\u201d care to  patients without the resources to pay.  Across the United States, little is  known about the extent to which these potential abuses involving excess  compensation and the level of services provided by nonprofit hospitals  occur.  More information about the practices employed by exempt entities  to compensate executives and others, and by nonprofit hospitals to serve  their patients, would be valuable.", "Even as these abuses were surfacing, some organizations within the tax- exempt sector were seeking to improve the governance and transparency  within the sector.  For example, in recent years, the National Association of  State Charity Officials (NASCO), the Independent Sector, and the National  Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, among others, have called for  revisions to the Form 990.", "Others have taken the initiative to establish self-regulatory standards  independent of those set by IRS.  For example, the Better Business Bureau  has established a seal of approval program to help donors make informed  decisions and foster public confidence in charities.  Charities participating  in the program are to provide documentation that the bureau uses to  determine whether its 20 standards have been met.  These standards  address governance and oversight, effectiveness, finances, and public  information materials.  For example, 5  standards are used to measure  governance and oversight such as through an active and independent  governing board, and 7 standards are used to ensure that spending is  honest, prudent, and in accordance with fund-raising appeals.", "Concerns about abuses in the tax-exempt sector also have spurred  congressional interests.  This House Committee on Ways and Means\u2019  hearing exemplifies that interest.  In June 2004, the Senate Committee on  Finance released a discussion draft of proposals for tax-exempt reforms.   The draft discussed more than three dozen proposals to generate  comments about possible legislation. The proposals addressed conflict of  interest, federal-state coordination, transparency, governance, best  practices, funding for enforcement, among many others.  Such proposals  mirror similar types of recent requirements to increase accountability and  oversight of other types of large public and private organizations, such as  corporations, in which ethical, financial, and other abuses have occurred.", "The Panel on the Nonprofit Sector responded to such proposals in its  March 2005 interim report.  In discussing governance and ethical conduct,  the report pointed to the need for best practices, accepted standards, self- regulation, and education.  To improve governance, the report  recommended that charities enforce a conflict-of-interest policy, select  board members with some financial literacy, and encourage disclosure of  illegal practices.  The report also advocated more transparency to enable  public oversight and confidence in tax-exempt entities.  It concluded that  IRS should promote transparency while recognizing the burdens that  reporting more data can place on exempt entities that are small and lack  resources.  The report supported revising the Form 990, mandating  electronic filing in coordination with the states for the Forms 990 and 1023,  and increasing the sanctions for not filing an accurate or timely Form 990.    The report acknowledged that these steps would not fully dissuade those  who want to violate standards, and concluded that some government  oversight is necessary.", "More specifically, among the proposals being considered to improve  governance and transparency are:  Require that compensation for all management positions at a charity  must be approved annually and in advance, and must be justified in a  manner that can be understood by those with a basic business  background.", "Require the board of directors of a charity to establish a conflict-of- interest policy, a compliance program to address regulatory and  liability concerns, and program objectives and performance  measures, among other duties.", "Prohibit board membership to those not permitted to serve on the  board of a publicly traded company.", "Establish a prudent investor rule for the investment activities of  charities.", "Require the chief executive officer of a tax-exempt entity to sign  under penalty of perjury that the Form 990 and other forms filed  comply with the Internal Revenue Code and that reasonable  assurances were given of the accuracy and completeness of the  information reported.", "Require disclosure of relationships of a tax-exempt entity with other  exempt and nonexempt entities, including the formation of taxable  subsidiaries and transactions with these other entities.", "Require disclosure of annual performance goals and measures by  charities with over $250,000 in gross receipts.", "Require disclosure of investments by public charities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "IRS Has Been Challenged to Oversee Tax-Exempt Entities and Is Beginning Steps to Enhance Its Oversight Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Staffing and insufficient data have constrained IRS\u2019s oversight of the tax- exempt sector.

The assigned FTEs  dropped about 4 percent from fiscal years 2000 through 2004 but increased  about 11 percent for fiscal year 2005, resulting in a 7 percent increase in  assigned FTEs overall (see fig. 4).  This 2005 increase is due to the FTEs  assigned to do examinations since the FTEs assigned to do determinations  of exempt status stayed relatively flat.  As of 2005, IRS assigned 467 FTEs to  examine the hundreds of thousands of entities who generally file Forms  990 (see table 6 in app. IV).", "Competition within IRS for resources helps explain why resources for tax- exempt oversight have not increased much until fiscal year 2005. IRS has  many other priorities in collecting the proper amount of tax from tens of  millions of individuals and businesses.  IRS\u2019s budget emphasizes areas that  produce tax revenue rather than areas that are regulatory.  IRS oversight of  the exempt sector is primarily regulatory rather than revenue producing.   IRS exempt officials also said that an ongoing issue is the proper mix of  resources budgeted for oversight versus other activities such as providing  guidance or education.  Beyond tax-exempt entities, TE/GE must also  budget resources to deal with pension plans, Indian tribal governments,  and other types of government entities.", "Congressional tax-writing committees have attempted to provide dedicated  funding for exempt oversight.  For example, in 1969, Congress added  section 4940 to the Internal Revenue Code, which imposes an excise tax on  the net investment income of private foundations (see app. V for an  explanation of this tax and tax rates).  The legislative history indicates that  the tax committees intended for the amounts collected from the excise  taxes would operate as user fees to fund IRS oversight of exempt entities.   To date, congressional appropriation committees, which have jurisdiction  over annual funding, have not earmarked these tax collections for this  purpose.", "IRS has not maintained data on how much excise tax it has assessed or  collected under Section 4940 (or any other excise tax that can be assessed  against tax-exempt entities either overall or by type of excise tax).   However, IRS did have data that showed tax-exempt entities reported  owing (i.e., self-assessed), in 2004 constant dollars, at least $247 million in  this excise tax annually (about $1.5 billion overall) for 2000 through 2003  (see table 10 in app. V).  For comparison, the fiscal year 2003 budget for all  of TE/GE (i.e., not just tax-exempt oversight functions) was around $205  million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Oversight Caseload Has Been Increasing in Recent Years and IRS Has Had Difficulties Sustaining Its Oversight", "paragraphs": ["For section 501(c) entities, IRS\u2019s oversight caseload has been increasing.  In  its determinations\u2019 work involving applications for tax-exempt status, in  fiscal years 1998 through 2004, applications increased about 17 percent  from 78,358 to 87,080, with some annual fluctuations (see table 7 in app.  IV).  IRS officials said that IRS must review each application to make a  determination of exempt status.  IRS\u2019s potential tax-exempt examination  universe has grown more slowly.  As mentioned earlier, the number of  exempt entities filing a Form 990 grew from about 450,000 to 465,000  during tax years 1998 through 2002\u2014or about 3 percent.", "IRS has had difficulty sustaining a consistent examination rate for tax- exempt entities. As figure 5 shows, the rate at which IRS examined filed  Forms 990 fell from 1.8 percent in 1998 to 1.1 percent in 2002 before rising  to 1.3 percent in 2003 (see table 8 in app. IV).", "IRS officials said that the declining examination rates primarily resulted  from a decline in FTEs for examinations and an increase in the average  hours spent per examination. The number of tax-exempt entities that IRS  examined decreased from 8,290 in fiscal year 1998 to 5,889 in 2004, or about  29 percent, after dropping as low as 5,423 examinations in 2002.  IRS  officials said that they have examined more returns since 2002 because  they used more of their examiners to examine Forms 990 rather than help  elsewhere such as with determinations, and expedited examinations, such  as by limiting their scope and depth.", "In terms of determinations\u2019 results, during fiscal years 1998 through 2004,  IRS annually denied about 1 percent of the applications while the approval  rate was 74-80 percent (see table 7 in app. IV).  Denials occur when IRS  determines that an applicant has not met the statutory requirements for  exemption.  In accordance with the statutory guidance on qualifying for  tax-exempt status, IRS is not likely to deny the recognition of tax-exempt  status as long as the applicant provides all required documents, files a  complete Form 1023, and provides an appropriate statement about its  intent to serve an approved exempt purpose.", "Regarding examination results, during fiscal years 1998 through 2003, IRS  revoked exempt status in 1.2 percent of its examinations.  Revocations  occur when IRS determines that the entity omitted or misstated a material  fact, operated materially different from its stated exempt purpose, or  engaged in a prohibited transaction in conflict with its exempt purpose. IRS  does not often revoke tax-exempt status because the need for revocation  often does not arise and when it does, IRS focuses more on getting the tax- exempt entity to comply with federal laws rather than on taking away its  exempt status.", "Beyond revocations, IRS examinations can produce one or more other  changes such as in the section 501(c) paragraph, foundation status of a  501(c)(3) entity, and assessed tax.   Changes in paragraph are important  because of rules governing permissible activities.  For example, a tax- exempt entity classified as a charity under 501(c)(3) can accept donations  that are tax deductible for the donor, unlike those classified as a social  welfare entity under Section 501(c)(4).  However, such charities are more  restricted in their ability to lobby and engage in political activity compared  to social welfare entities.  Changes in foundation status are important  because foundations generally are subjected to more requirements than  public charities, such as in the requirement to annually distribute a  minimum amount of income towards its exempt purpose.", "Figure 6 shows that the percentage of examinations that produced no  change rose from 31 percent in fiscal year 1998 to 39 percent in 2004, with  higher rates in 2002 and 2003 (see table 9 in app. IV). In general, IRS is not  likely to find a change in every examination given the focus on getting  exempt entities into compliance and the need for better data to select the  most noncompliant entities for examination.  Higher no-change rates mean  that IRS spends resources examining compliant entities.

IRS has determined that the Form 990 does not provide  sufficient data to identify tax-exempt entities that merit an examination  due to noncompliance.  Nor can IRS easily compare Form 990 data with  data reported on the Form 1023.   For example, the current Form 1023  requests data on hospitals and low-income housing that are not captured in  the Form 990.

IRS  officials said that the revision process has key steps to be taken before IRS  shares the specific changes.  However, IRS officials identified some general  changes being developed.  To ease preparation, IRS is attempting to write  all questions in plain English and group questions related to an issue.   Further, IRS officials explained that the revised Form 990 is to consist of  one form applicable to all tax-exempt entities and a series of organization  and activity schedules.  The organization schedules would be tailored to  filers such as hospitals or veteran\u2019s organizations while the activity  schedules would be tailored to issues such as compensation packages and  grant making that may be financing terrorism.", "An IRS team completed a first draft of the revised Form 990 in December  2004.

These studies  were to develop reliable data on the types and extent of compliance  problems.  IRS planned to use the data to refine selection criteria for  identifying noncompliant returns for examination as well as help identify  other strategies to improve compliance such as through improved guidance  or instructions.  However, IRS has had to delay most of these studies due to  higher priorities (such as dealing with abusive tax transactions).", "Given its concern about insufficient data, IRS also is taking steps in fiscal  year 2005 to improve its capabilities to analyze data.  IRS has been  establishing a Data Analysis Unit to provide trend analysis intended to  improve the selection of tax-exempt entities for examination and the  identification of compliance issues to pursue.

Private foundations are often tightly controlled  and receive a significant portion of their funds from a small number of  donors, and tend to make grants directly to other entities rather than  directly provide charitable services.
