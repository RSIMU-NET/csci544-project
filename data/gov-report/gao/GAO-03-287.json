We could not identify any obligations prior to 1996 in part because the Bureau included them with its general research and development efforts and did not assign the I.C.M./A.C.E. operations unique project codes in its financial management system. To track these costs in the future, it will be important for the Bureau to (1) have a financial management system that has specific project codes to capture coverage measurement costs, (2) establish the project codes as early in the planning process as possible, and (3) monitor the usage of the codes to ensure that they are properly charged."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To assess the quality of population data for the 2000 Census and to possibly  adjust for any errors, the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) conducted the  Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A.C.E.) program.

However, some degree of error in  the form of persons missed or counted more than once is inevitable  because of limitations in census-taking methods. Because census results  are used, among other purposes, to apportion Congress, redraw  congressional districts, and allocate federal aid to state and local  governments, the size and demographic composition of these coverage  errors have become increasingly sensitive since the Bureau was first able  to generate detailed data on them during the 1980 Census. However, the  Bureau has never used the results of its coverage measurements to correct  estimated coverage errors.", "The Bureau first attempted to measure the accuracy of the census in the  1940s when it compared the census numbers to birth and death certificates  and other administrative data using a procedure called demographic  analysis. Modern coverage measurement began with the 1980 Census when  the Bureau compared census figures to the results of an independent  sample survey of the population. Using statistical methods, the Bureau  generated detailed measures of the differences among undercounts of  particular ethnic, racial, and other groups. In the months that followed,  many lawsuits were filed, most contending that the results of the 1980  coverage measurement should have been used to adjust the census.  However, the Bureau designed the evaluation to measure errors, not to  correct the census results, and the Director of the Census Bureau decided  against adopting the adjusted numbers, as they were deemed flawed due to  missing and inaccurate data.", "The quality of the coverage measurement data improved for the 1990  Census, and the Bureau recommended statistically adjusting the results.  However, the Secretary of Commerce determined that the evidence to  support an adjustment was inconclusive and decided not to adjust the 1990  Census. The adjustment decision was complicated by the fact that the 1990  Census figures had already been released when the coverage measurement  results became available in the spring of 1991. The Secretary of Commerce  was concerned that two sets of numbers\u2014the actual census results and the  adjusted figures\u2014could create confusion and might allow political  considerations to play a part in choosing between sets of numbers when  the outcome of the choices, such as congressional apportionment, could be  known in advance of a decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the objectives of 2000 Census I.C.M./A.C.E. programs and  their results, we reviewed Bureau and other documents that included  Federal Register notices; Census Operational Plans; reports to Congress;  internal memorandums; research and feasibility studies; and reports of the  Executive Steering Committee for Accuracy and Coverage Policy (ESCAP)  I and II, which assessed the results of the A.C.E. program and  recommended how they should be used.", "To determine costs for consultants and technical studies for 2000 Census  I.C.M./A.C.E. programs, we focused on object class code 25 from the  financial management reports to obtain contract data.

However, as  shown in table 1, much like similar programs in earlier censuses, the  Bureau did not use I.C.M. and its successor program, A.C.E., to adjust the  census because of legal challenges, technical obstacles, and the inability to  resolve uncertainties in the data in time to meet the deadlines for releasing  the data."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Bureau Canceled I.C.M. in Response to a Supreme Court Ruling", "paragraphs": ["In designing I.C.M., the Bureau\u2019s goal was to produce a single, consolidated  count or \u201cone-number\u201d census and thus avoid the controversy of having  two sets of census results as occurred during the 1990 Census. Thus, as  shown in table 1, the objectives of I.C.M. were to (1) measure census  coverage, (2) generate, using statistical sampling and estimation methods,  the detailed data required for apportionment, congressional redistricting,  and federal program purposes, and (3) produce a one-number census.", "The Bureau\u2019s plans for I.C.M. emerged in response to the unsatisfactory  results of the 1990 Census. Although the 1990 headcount was, at that time,  the most costly in U.S. history, it produced data that were less accurate  than those from the 1980 Census. The disappointing outcome was due in  large part to the Bureau\u2019s efforts to count housing units that did not mail  back their census questionnaires. The operation, known as nonresponse  follow-up, where enumerators visited and collected information from each  nonresponding housing unit, proved to be costly and error-prone when a  higher-than-expected workload and a shortage of enumerators caused the  operation to fall behind schedule. The final stages of nonresponse follow- up were particularly problematic. Indeed, while enumerators finished 90  percent of the follow-up workload within 8 weeks (2 weeks behind  schedule), it took another 6 weeks to resolve the remaining 10 percent.  Moreover, in trying to complete the last portion of nonresponse follow-up  cases, the Bureau accepted less complete responses and information from  nonhousehold members such as neighbors, which may have reduced the  quality of the data.", "In the years following the 1990 Census, Congress, the Bureau, several  organizations, and GAO, concluded that fundamental design changes were  needed to reduce census costs and improve the quality of the data. In  response, the Bureau reengineered a number of operations for the 2000  Census.", "For example, to save time and reduce its nonresponse follow-up workload,  the Bureau planned to enumerate a sample of the last remaining portion of  nonresponse follow-up cases instead of visiting every nonresponding  household as it had done in previous censuses. To adjust for enumeration  errors, the Bureau developed I.C.M., which was intended to reconcile the  original census figures with data obtained from a separate, independent  count of a sample of 750,000 housing units using a statistical process called  Dual System Estimation. The Bureau believed that this approach offered  the best combination of reduced costs, improved accuracy expected at  various geographic levels, and operational feasibility.", "However, concerned about the legality of the Bureau\u2019s planned use of  sampling and estimation, members of Congress challenged the Bureau\u2019s  use of I.C.M. in court. In January 1999, the Supreme Court ruled that the  Census Act prohibited the use of statistical sampling to generate  population data for reapportioning the House of Representatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A.C.E. Did Not Meet Bureau Objectives", "paragraphs": ["Following the Supreme Court ruling, the Bureau planned to produce  apportionment numbers using traditional census-taking methods, and  provide statistically adjusted numbers for nonapportionment uses of the  data such as congressional redistricting and allocating federal funds. The  Bureau initiated the A.C.E. program, which was designed to take a national  sample of approximately 300,000 housing units to evaluate coverage errors  among different population groups and statistically correct for them. Thus,  as shown in table 1, the Bureau\u2019s objectives for A.C.E. were to (1) measure  how many people were missed in the census and how many were  erroneously included and (2) produce the detailed data required in time for  redistricting and federal program purposes.", "However, while the Bureau generally conducted A.C.E. in accordance with  its plans, the Bureau later determined that the A.C.E. results did not  provide a reliable measure of census accuracy and could not be used to  adjust the nonapportionment census data.", "The first decision against A.C.E. occurred in March 2001, when the Acting  Director of the Census Bureau recommended to the Secretary of  Commerce that the unadjusted census data be used for redistricting  purposes. He cited as a primary reason an apparent inconsistency between  the population growth over the prior decade, as implied by A.C.E. results,  and demographic analysis, which estimated the population using birth,  death, and other administrative records. The inconsistency raised the  possibility of an unidentified error in either the A.C.E. or census numbers.  He reported that the inconsistency could not be resolved prior to April 1,  2001, the legally mandated deadline for releasing redistricting data.", "The second decision against A.C.E. came in October 2001 when, based on a  large body of additional research, ESCAP decided against adjusting census  data for allocating federal aid and other purposes, because A.C.E. failed to  identify a significant number of people erroneously included in the census,  and other remaining uncertainties. According to Bureau officials, it might  be possible to use adjusted data to produce intercensal population  estimates for federal programs that require this information; however, the  Bureau would need to revise the A.C.E. results before any use of the data  could be considered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Bureau\u2019s Experience in Implementing Coverage Measurement Programs Highlights Important Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["Although I.C.M. and A.C.E. did not meet their formal objectives, they did  produce a body of important lessons learned. As the Bureau\u2019s current  approach for the 2010 Census includes coverage measurement to assess  the accuracy of the census (but not necessarily to adjust the numbers  themselves), it will be important for the Bureau to consider these lessons  as its planning efforts continue. The lessons include (1) developing a  coverage measurement methodology that is both technically and  operationally feasible, (2) determining the level of geography at which  coverage measurement is intended, (3) keeping stakeholders, particularly  Congress, informed of the Bureau\u2019s plans, and (4) adequately testing the  eventual coverage measurement program. 1. A.C.E. demonstrated operational, but not technical feasibility.", "According to Bureau officials, an important result of the A.C.E.  program was that it demonstrated, from an operational perspective  only, the feasibility of conducting a large independent field check on  the quality of the census. The Bureau canvassed the entire A.C.E.  sample area to develop an address list, collected census response data  for persons living in the sample areas on census day, and conducted an  operation to try and match A.C.E. respondents to census respondents,  all independent of the regular census operations and within required  time frames.", "Our separate reviews of two of these operations\u2014interviewing  respondents and matching A.C.E. and census data\u2014while raising  questions about the impact on final A.C.E. results due to apparently  small operational deviations, also concluded that the Bureau  implemented those two operations largely as planned.", "Nevertheless, while the Bureau demonstrated that it could execute  A.C.E. field operations using available resources within required time  frames, as the Bureau has noted, feasibility also consists of a technical  component\u2014that is, whether the A.C.E. methodology would improve  the accuracy of the census. Although the Bureau clearly stated in its  justification for A.C.E. that the effort would make the census more  accurate, as noted earlier, because of unresolved data discrepancies, its  experience in 2000 proved otherwise. Moreover, according to the  Bureau, because the A.C.E. was designed to correct a census with a net  coverage error similar to that observed in previous censuses, the  Bureau commented that applying the methodology to the historically  low levels of net error observed in the 2000 Census represented a  unique and unanticipated challenge for A.C.E. Thus, it will be important  for the Bureau to refine its coverage measurement methodology to  ensure that it is technically feasible.  2. The level of geography at which the Bureau can successfully measure  coverage is unclear. Since the October 2001 decision to not rely on  adjusted census data for nonapportionment and nonredistricting  purposes, Bureau officials have told us that they now doubt whether  census data can reliably be improved down to the level of geography  for which A.C.E. was intended to improve the accuracy\u2014the census  tract level (neighborhoods that typically contain around 1,700 housing  units and 4,000 people). The Bureau\u2019s current position differs from that  taken in 2000, when it reported to Congress that it expected accuracy at  the tract level to be improved, on average, by A.C.E. statistically  adjusting numbers at an even lower level of geography\u2014the census  block level. Uncertainty in the level of geography at which accuracy is  to be measured or improved can affect the overall design of coverage  measurement, as well as its technical feasibility. Therefore, it will be  important for the Bureau to determine the level of geography at which  it intends to measure accuracy as it decides the role and design of  future coverage measurement programs. 3. Keeping stakeholders informed is essential. Throughout the 1990s,  Congress and other stakeholders, including GAO, expressed concerns  about the Bureau\u2019s planned use of sampling and statistical estimation  procedures to adjust the census. A key cause of this skepticism was the  Bureau\u2019s failure to provide sufficiently detailed data on the effects that  I.C.M. would have at different levels of geographic detail. Information  was also lacking on the various design alternatives being considered,  their likely implications, and the basis for certain decisions. As a result,  it was difficult for Congress and other stakeholders to support the  Bureau\u2019s coverage measurement initiatives.", "For example, on September 24, 1996, the House Committee on  Government Reform and Oversight issued a report that criticized the  Bureau\u2019s initiatives for sampling and statistical estimation. Among  other things, the Committee found that the Bureau had not clarified  issues of accuracy, particularly for small geographic areas, raised by the  sampling initiative. Congress\u2019s perspective on the process was later  reflected in its enactment of legislation in 1997 that included provisions  requiring the Department of Commerce to provide Congress with  comprehensive information on its planned use of statistical estimation  within 30 days.4. Adequate testing of coverage measurement methodologies is critical.", "Although the Bureau conducted a dress rehearsal for the census in  three locations across the country that was intended to demonstrate  the overall design of the census, the 1998 operation did not reveal the  problems that the Bureau encountered in dealing with the  discrepancies between the 2000 A.C.E. results and its benchmarks.  According to Bureau officials, this was partly because the sites were  not representative of the nation at large. Additionally, as a result of a  compromise between Congress and the administration to  simultaneously prepare for a nonsampling census, the I.C.M. was tested  at only two of the three dress rehearsal sites\u2014an urban area and an  Indian reservation\u2014but was not tested in a rural location as was  originally planned. An earlier test in 1995 was also not comprehensive  in that it did not test a sampling operation designed to help determine  whether nonresponse follow-up of the magnitude projected by the  Bureau\u2019s current plan could be completed in time for the I.C.M to be  done on schedule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "I.C.M./A.C.E. Contractor Costs Are Not Complete", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001, the Bureau obligated about  $207 million for I.C.M./A.C.E. activities. As shown in table 2, of that  $207 million, we identified about $22.3 million (11 percent) in obligated  amounts for contracts involving more than 170 vendors. These contracts  were primarily for technical advisory and assistant services, computer  systems support, and training.

Although life cycle costs for the 2000  Census cover a 13-year period from fiscal years 1991 through 2003,  senior Bureau officials said that the I.C.M./A.C.E. program was not  viable for implementation until fiscal year 1997. Therefore, the Bureau  considered contractor costs from earlier years as part of its general  research and development programs, and the Bureau did not assign  unique project codes to identify I.C.M./A.C.E. programs and related  costs in its financial management system.", "Second, although $182,000 of fiscal year 1996 obligated contractor costs  were identifiable in the Bureau\u2019s financial management system as an  I.C.M. special test, the Bureau did not consider these costs as part of the  I.C.M./A.C.E. programs. Instead, these costs were considered general  research and development. However, because the Bureau separately  identified these costs as I.C.M. program contractor costs, we have  included the $182,000 as part of the I.C.M./A.C.E. program contractor  costs in this report.", "Finally, we were unable to identify the I.C.M./A.C.E. portions of costs  that were part of other programs. For example, in late fiscal year 2000  and after, the Bureau did not separate A.C.E. evaluations from its other  2000 Census evaluations in its financial management systems. Bureau  officials stated that the contracts for evaluations included overall 2000  Census and A.C.E. evaluations, and did not have a separate code  identifying A.C.E. costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tracking Future Coverage Measurement Costs", "paragraphs": ["During the 2000 Census, the Bureau, its auditors, and GAO, found extensive  weaknesses in the Bureau\u2019s financial management system, the components  of which include hardware, software, and associated personnel. The  weaknesses included difficulties in providing reliable and timely financial  information to manage current government operations and preparing  financial statements and other reports. Together, they affected the  completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of data needed for informed  management decisions and effective oversight. In light of these  weaknesses, the Bureau\u2019s ability to track future costs of coverage  measurement activities will largely depend on three factors.", "First, a sound financial management system is critical. As discussed in  our December 2001 report, the Bureau\u2019s core financial management  system, CAMS, had persistent internal control weaknesses in fiscal year  2000. In its latest financial report, the Bureau indicated that these  weaknesses have continued through fiscal year 2001. The Bureau  expects to issue its fiscal year 2002 financial report shortly.", "Second, it would be important to set up project codes to capture  coverage measurement activities as early in the planning process as  possible. The Bureau did not set up a specific project code to identify  I.C.M. program costs until 1996 because, according to Bureau officials,  the I.C.M. program was not viable until 1997 and all costs up to this  point were considered general research.", "Finally, it would be important for Bureau personnel to correctly charge  the project codes established for the coverage measurement program  activities. During the 2000 Census, for example, while the Bureau  established a project code and a budget for the remote Alaska  enumeration, the project costs were erroneously charged to and  commingled with a project code for enumerating special populations.

Less clear is whether the results of the coverage  measurement should be used to adjust the census. Any Bureau decisions  on this matter should involve close consultation with Congress and other  stakeholders, and be based on detailed data and a convincing  demonstration of the feasibility of the Bureau's proposed approach.  Whatever the decision, it is imperative that it be made soon so that the  Bureau can design appropriate procedures and concentrate on the business  of counting the nation\u2019s population.

The Bureau also maintained that  throughout the 1990s, it had an open and transparent process for  implementing the coverage measurement program, including the levels of  geography to which its results would be applied.", "We disagree. As we stated in our report, the Bureau\u2019s failure to provide  important information was a key cause of congressional skepticism over  the Bureau\u2019s coverage measurement plans. In fact, Congress was so  concerned about the lack of comprehensive information on the Bureau\u2019s  proposed approach that in July 1997, it passed a law that included  provisions requiring the Department of Commerce to provide detailed data  on the Bureau\u2019s planned use of statistical estimation within 30 days.

We believe this overstates what actually occurred. As we noted in the  report, the dress rehearsal failed to detect the problems that A.C.E.  encountered during the 2000 Census because the sites were not  representative of the nation. Additionally, because of an agreement  between Congress and the administration to simultaneously prepare for a  census that did not include sampling, the I.C.M. was only tested at two of  the three dress rehearsal sites\u2014an urban area and an Indian reservation\u2014 but was not tested in a rural location as was originally planned.
