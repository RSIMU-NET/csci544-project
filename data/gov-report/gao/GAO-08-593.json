The department lost its ability to manufacture pits in 1989 with the closing of the Rocky Flats Plant. In 1996, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) was directed to reestablish a pit manufacturing capability, starting with a limited number of pits for the W88 warhead. In recent years, NNSA has considered ways to increase its pit manufacturing capacity, including building a new, large-scale pit manufacturing facility. It has also proposed producing pits for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW). GAO was asked to determine the (1) extent to which NNSA achieved its major goals for reestablishing its pit manufacturing capability, (2) factors that currently constrain its ability to increase its pit manufacturing capacity, and (3) status of its plans for future pit manufacturing. For this review, GAO met with NNSA and LANL officials, reviewed agency documents, and visited the nuclear facility used to manufacture pits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NNSA achieved its major goals for reestablishing its pit manufacturing capability at LANL as defined by the agency in 2002. Specifically, NNSA's goals were to create a capability to manufacture 10 pits per year starting in 2007 and to deliver a single W88 war reserve pit to the stockpile in 2007. War reserve pits must meet stringent specifications, while other types of pits, such as pits destructively tested for production quality control, may not meet the same standards. NNSA estimated that this effort would cost about $1.55 billion for fiscal years 2001 through 2007. According to NNSA, LANL produced 11 pits in 2007, eight of which were W88 war reserve pits, and spent about $1.29 billion for fiscal years 2001 through 2007. However, GAO found that NNSA did not establish clear, consistent goals for the number of W88 war reserve pits it planned to produce. Specifically, some NNSA documents, including budget requests to Congress, called for delivering 10 W88 war reserve pits per year starting in 2007. In addition, NNSA's cost estimate did not include estimates for a variety of activities that directly and indirectly supported the pit manufacturing mission at LANL between 2001 and 2007. These support activities, which included scientific experiments and facility operations and maintenance, totaled over $1 billion. Because of three major constraints on pit manufacturing operations at LANL, NNSA will not be able to substantively increase its current pit manufacturing capacity for the foreseeable future. Specifically, GAO found that LANL's building for performing analytical chemistry, which deals with the separation and identification of the components in a pit sample, has major operational and structural limitations. LANL's ability to store pits and associated waste is also constrained by limited vault storage space. Finally, a lack of available floor space in LANL's main nuclear facility limits its ability to install a large-scale, efficient production line for manufacturing pits. NNSA's plans for future pit manufacturing are still being developed and, as a result, no reliable cost estimates exist. Originally, NNSA and the Department of Defense (DOD) had planned to develop the capability to produce RRW pits beginning about 2014, pending the outcome of a RRW design definition and cost study in 2008. However, in fiscal year 2008 all of NNSA's RRW funding was eliminated. While NNSA and DOD continue to support the RRW program, in the short run, NNSA plans to maintain the existing pit manufacturing capability at LANL. Over the long term, NNSA is planning, with DOD's concurrence, to upgrade the existing LANL facility to achieve a production capacity of up to 80 pits per year. However, NNSA has not established a cost and schedule baseline to support its projected effort."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately  organized agency within the Department of Energy (DOE), is responsible  for managing the nation\u2019s stockpile of nuclear weapons. As part of its  mission, NNSA is responsible for manufacturing a key nuclear weapon  component for use in the stockpile. This component, known as a \u201cpit,\u201d is  manufactured using a man-made radioactive element called plutonium and  is needed to begin the chain reaction in a nuclear weapon. Different  weapons systems use different types of pits. Pits that can be used in the  stockpile, known as war reserve pits, must meet stringent specifications  and be certified by NNSA\u2019s nuclear weapons laboratories. Consequently,  the capability to produce war reserve pits is critical for replacing pits that  are removed from existing warheads for surveillance testing or other  purposes. Other types of pits, such as pits that are destructively tested as  part of production quality control, may not be required to meet the same  standards.", "DOE lost its capability to manufacture pits when it ceased operations at  DOE\u2019s Rocky Flats Plant in Colorado in 1989 because of environmental  and regulatory concerns. At that time, Rocky Flats was manufacturing war  reserve pits for the W88 warhead, which is used on submarine-launched  ballistic missiles. In December 1996, DOE designated the Los Alamos  National Laboratory (LANL) as the site for reestablishing the capability to  manufacture pits. Specifically, DOE\u2019s original goals for the pit  manufacturing mission were to (1) reestablish the capability to  manufacture war reserve pits for the W88 warhead by fiscal year 2001 and  demonstrate the capability to produce all pit types for the enduring  stockpile, (2) establish a manufacturing capacity of 10 pits per year by  fiscal year 2001 and expand to a capacity of up to 50 pits per year by fiscal  year 2005, and (3) develop a contingency plan for the large-scale  manufacturing of pits (i.e., 150-500 pits per year) at some other DOE site  or sites.", "In meeting this new mission, LANL faced constraints not faced at the  Rocky Flats Plant. Historically, DOE conducted underground nuclear tests  to ensure that the nuclear warhead, including the pit, would perform as  required. Now, however, the safety and reliability of today\u2019s nuclear  stockpile, including newly manufactured pits, must be maintained without  the benefit of underground nuclear testing because the United States has  maintained a moratorium on such testing since 1992. In addition, LANL  had to replicate pit manufacturing processes used at the Rocky Flats Plant  in a manner compliant with current environmental and safety standards.", "In November 1998, we reported on DOE\u2019s plans for reestablishing the pit  manufacturing mission at LANL. We found that DOE had revised its  original 1996 goals for pit manufacturing capacity and instead planned to  have an interim capacity of only 20 pits per year online by fiscal year 2007.  DOE estimated that the total costs for establishing and operating its pit  manufacturing mission would be over $1.1 billion for fiscal years 1996  through 2007. However, we found that this estimate did not include over  $490 million in total costs for other activities\u2014such as construction- related activities at various LANL nuclear facilities\u2014that were needed to  support the production of pits, as well as a wide variety of other defense- related activities. In addition, we found that DOE had done little to  develop a contingency plan for the large-scale manufacturing of pits.", "We also found that the Department of Defense (DOD) and DOE had  discussed, but not resolved, important issues regarding DOE\u2019s planned pit  manufacturing capacity. DOD is responsible for implementing the U.S.  nuclear deterrent strategy, which includes establishing the military  requirements associated with planning for the stockpile. In this context,  the Nuclear Weapons Council is responsible for preparing the annual  Nuclear Weapons Stockpile Memorandum, which specifies how many  warheads of each type will be in the stockpile. We found that officials  from various DOD organizations, including U.S. Strategic Command and  the Department of the Navy, had expressed concern that DOE\u2019s plans for  pit manufacturing capacity would not be sufficient to meet the stockpile\u2019s  needs. Specifically, these DOD organizations had conducted preliminary  analyses of the capacity needed to support the stockpile. On the basis of  these analyses, some DOD officials believed that the stockpile\u2019s needs  exceeded the interim capacity of 20 pits per year planned for LANL, or  even a capacity of 50 pits per year that DOE indicated it might establish in  the future.", "NNSA currently funds the pit manufacturing mission through the Pit  Manufacturing and Certification Campaign, which includes funding for  both the manufacture and the certification of pits at LANL and for related  activities at other supporting locations, such as the Lawrence Livermore  National Laboratory. According to NNSA data, over $234 million was  spent on these activities in fiscal year 2007, and NNSA plans to spend  almost $214 million in fiscal year 2008. At LANL, pit manufacturing takes  place within the Plutonium Facility-4 building, known as PF-4, which was  constructed in 1978 as a multiuse research and development facility. LANL  employs approximately 430 full-time equivalent employees associated with  the pit manufacturing program, including employees associated with pit  manufacturing operations at PF-4 and the manufacture of non-nuclear pit  components at other facilities.", "Several key events over the past 6 years have affected NNSA\u2019s plans for pit  manufacturing.", "In May 2002, the Secretary of Energy approved the start of design work for  a large-scale manufacturing plant called the Modern Pit Facility. This  facility was designed to manufacture all pits in the enduring stockpile at a  capacity of 125 pits per year. However, the conference report  accompanying the fiscal year 2006 NNSA appropriation stated that it  provided no funding for the Modern Pit Facility and directed NNSA to  focus on improving its manufacturing capability at LANL. As a result,  NNSA suspended the Modern Pit Facility project indefinitely.", "In 2005, the Nuclear Weapons Council approved the creation of a Reliable  Replacement Warhead (RRW) program to study a new approach for  providing a credible nuclear warhead deterrent over the long term. The  RRW program would redesign weapon components, in particular the pit,  to be easier to manufacture, maintain, dismantle, and certify without  nuclear testing, potentially allowing NNSA to transition to a smaller and  more efficient weapons complex. In March 2007, the Nuclear Weapons  Council approved a RRW design by the Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory to provide a replacement warhead for a portion of the nation\u2019s  submarine-launched ballistic missiles. NNSA had planned to complete a  detailed design definition and cost study of the RRW during 2008.  However, the explanatory statement accompanying the fiscal year 2008  NNSA appropriation stated that the bill provided no funding for the RRW  program and directed NNSA to focus on assessing a new strategic nuclear  deterrent mission for the twenty-first century in order to define the  associated stockpile requirements and determine the scope of the  weapons complex modernization plans. According to NNSA officials,  NNSA has ceased all activities associated with the RRW program for fiscal  year 2008 but plans to continue to fund some elements of the RRW design  for fiscal year 2009 under activities associated with its Directed Stockpile  Work and Science Campaign programs.", "Finally, in October 2006, NNSA offered a proposal to address long- standing problems with the condition and responsiveness of the nuclear  weapon production facilities. Under its plan\u2014which NNSA currently  refers to as \u201cComplex Transformation\u201d\u2014NNSA proposed to build a new,  consolidated plutonium center at an existing DOE site that would replace  the interim plutonium production facility at LANL. A key responsibility of  the plutonium center would be to manufacture pits for a RRW-based  stockpile. Although NNSA had planned to begin design work on the  plutonium center during 2008, the explanatory statement accompanying  the fiscal year 2008 NNSA appropriation stated that no funding was  provided for the plutonium center and directed NNSA to focus on  developing a modern nuclear weapons strategy, including the required pit  production capacity defined by nuclear stockpile requirements. As a  result, NNSA has suspended its work on the plutonium center.", "In this context, you asked us to determine the (1) extent to which NNSA  achieved its major goals for reestablishing its pit manufacturing capability,  (2) factors that currently constrain NNSA\u2019s ability to increase its pit  manufacturing capacity, and (3) status of NNSA\u2019s plans for future pit  manufacturing.", "In conducting our work, we met with NNSA and contractor officials;  reviewed agency documents; and visited the pit manufacturing plant (PF- 4) and other supporting facilities at LANL.

This cost  distribution model will use the percentage of space occupied by the tenant  programs in TA-55 and CMR as the basis for distributing the shared costs.  According to the model, as of September 1, 2007, the pit manufacturing  and certification program occupied about 35 percent of the space in TA-55  and 30 percent of the space in CMR. However, NNSA pit manufacturing  program officials noted that these types of costs support the total program  portfolio at LANL, including defense-related and nondefense-related  activities.

Second, LANL\u2019s ability to store pits and associated  waste is constrained by limited vault space.

These analyses provide the (1)  data required to certify the material control and accountability of the  plutonium feed and waste materials, (2) chemical accuracy for quality  control of the product, and (3) assurance that the pit will meet its  performance specifications. The CMR building, which was constructed in  the early 1950s, houses most of LANL\u2019s analytical chemistry capabilities.  According to LANL estimates, for each pit that is produced at PF-4, the pit  manufacturing program generates an average of about 10 to 15 samples  that have to be sent to CMR for analytical chemistry analyses. Chemists at  CMR take each sample and conduct multiple analyses or \u201cinstrument  runs.\u201d As a result, each pit generates an average of about 100 to 150  instrument runs at CMR.", "According to LANL estimates, CMR currently contains enough analytical  chemistry instruments to support a pit production rate of 20 pits per year.  However, because of several limiting factors, LANL officials estimate that  the CMR building can only support a pit production capacity of between  10 to 15 pits per year. The major factor limiting analytical chemistry  operations in CMR is the need to impose safety restrictions on CMR\u2019s  operations that involve plutonium. In 1992, DOE began a planning process  aimed at upgrading many of the safety, security, and safeguards features of  CMR. Later, in 1997 and 1998, a series of operational, safety, and seismic  issues surfaced that affected the long-term viability of CMR. For example,  studies identified a seismic fault trace beneath one of the wings of the  CMR building that increased the level of structural integrity required to  meet current structural seismic code requirements for a Hazard Category 2  nuclear facility.", "DOE decided that it would be too difficult and costly to correct the CMR  building\u2019s defects by performing repairs and upgrades. Instead, DOE  decided to perform only the upgrades necessary to ensure the safe and  reliable operation of the CMR building through 2010. In addition, LANL  imposed a number of restrictions on the CMR facility\u2019s operations and  capabilities. For example, the areas within CMR that perform analytical  chemistry analyses are limited to handling no more than approximately  200 grams of plutonium material (equivalent to Pu-239) at a time.  Moreover, according to LANL officials, the analytical chemistry areas in  CMR may not be available for programmatic work for as much as 25  percent of the time due to the age and deteriorating condition of the  building. A final limiting factor is that the pit manufacturing program at  LANL does not have dedicated analytical chemistry instruments within the  CMR building. Specifically, while pit manufacturing accounts for almost 60  percent of the analytical chemistry work at CMR, the rest of the work is  conducted for other programs within PF-4, including programs associated  with NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation and DOE\u2019s Office  of Nuclear Energy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LANL\u2019s Ability to Store Pits and Associated Wastes Is Constrained by Limited Vault Space", "paragraphs": ["LANL maintains a storage vault in PF-4 to store old pits, newly  manufactured pits, pit residues, and waste material containing plutonium.

For example, in  August 2007, LANL officials had to temporarily cease pit manufacturing  operations because they had no more room in the vault to store pits. In  particular, the lack of vault space has led to significant amount of \u201con-the- floor\u201d storage of material, whereby materials are stored in safes on the  process floor, over the past 10 years.

However, NNSA\u2019s long-term strategy for the pit manufacturing mission,  and its attendant costs and schedule, is in a state of flux. In our 1998  report on pit manufacturing, we recommended that DOD provide DOE  with its views on the pit manufacturing capacity needed to maintain the  then existing stockpile.

While we agree that NNSA has successfully  reestablished the capability to manufacture W88 pits at LANL, as we state  in our report, and as acknowledged by NNSA officials responsible for the  pit manufacturing program, it is important for NNSA to establish the exact  number of war reserve pits that it plans to manufacture in the future.  NNSA\u2019s ability to determine the specific number of war reserve pits it  plans to produce per year is directly tied to decisions Congress will need  to make about any future pit manufacturing mission.
