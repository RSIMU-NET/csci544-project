To reduce the risk of successful deployment of nuclear or radiological weapons in U.S. cities, the program establishes local threat detection and deterrence capabilities. DHS tracks cities' spending of program funds and some performance data through cities' quarterly reports but does not collect other data on itemized expenditures and to assess how effectively cities achieved performance metrics and program milestones or how they performed in drills that simulate a threat. For example, DHS does not compare information on expenditures to the purchase plans it approved for cities. As a result, DHS does not know the dollar amounts cities actually spent on program purchases. Expenditure data GAO requested show that cities spent most funds on detection equipment\u2014that is, $94.5 million of the $144.8 million cities spent through June 30, 2018. By regularly collecting expenditure information from cities and comparing it to approved purchase plans, DHS could better ensure these funds were spent consistent with program goals.", "DHS does not have assurance that cities can sustain threat detection and deterrence capabilities gained through the STC program. DHS has not enforced planning requirements for sustaining those capabilities and has taken limited action to help cities do so, although encouraging sustainment is one of its primary program goals. Officials from the five cities in the program told GAO that they anticipate funding challenges that will adversely impact their ability to sustain capabilities over time. For example, several city officials said they cannot rely on other DHS or federal grant programs or local sources of funding once STC funding ends. Unless DHS analyzes risks related to sustainment, works with cities to address these risks, and enforces sustainment-planning requirements for cities in the program in the future, program participants could see their radiological detection programs and related capabilities deteriorate.", "DHS has not (1) fully developed potential changes or documented a plan for making changes to the STC program; (2) identified the basis for such changes; and (3) consistently communicated with cities, raising concerns about how the changes will impact them. DHS officials told GAO that the agency is considering several potential changes to the STC program that would broaden its geographic reach and scope and centralize acquisition of detection equipment, among other things, but it has not fully developed or documented these changes and does not have a strategy or plan for implementing them. A law enacted in December 2018 requires DHS to develop an implementation plan for the STC program. The law's requirements would provide DHS an opportunity to identify the basis for potential changes, and assessing such changes would provide more reasonable assurance that they would strengthen the program. Further, most city officials GAO interviewed said that in an August 2018 meeting, DHS provided a high-level overview of potential changes and little detail on how such changes would be implemented or affect city operations. If DHS does not clearly communicate to cities how the program will operate under potential changes, these cities could face difficulties planning for the future and achieving the program's detection and deterrence objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations including that DHS regularly collect detailed information from cities on program expenditures; analyze risks related to sustainment, work with cities to address these risks, and enforce sustainment-planning requirements for cities in the program; and clearly communicate to cities how the existing program will operate until a new program is in effect.

When exposed to  elevated radiation levels, the devices alarm with flashing lights, tones,  vibrations, or combinations of these.

Such  devices are used to determine if detected radiation is coming from a  potential threat or from naturally occurring radioactive material, such  as granite.", "Mobile detection systems contain larger detectors. Typically, mobile  detection systems interface with a laptop computer to display alarms  and analysis, and are capable of both detection and identification.  This type of system may be mounted on vehicle platforms, such as  cars, trucks, vans, boats, or helicopters.", "Figure 2 shows examples of such equipment.", "Such equipment and associated training are the basis for the capability  provided through the STC program. Officials we interviewed in one STC  city told us that in order to operate the equipment, law enforcement, fire,  health, and other state and local personnel must take training on the  process for screening and for resolving alarms related to suspected  nuclear or radiological material. As shown in figure 3, primary screening is  the first step of the process: if an officer is able to determine the source of  the alarm and deems it a nonthreat, then the case is resolved. According  to CWMD officials, PRDs often detect nuclear or radiological materials  that do not actually pose threats, such as radiation from medical  treatments and from naturally occurring substances such as granite. An  officer who is not able to determine the source of the alarm should initiate  a secondary screening process; according to CWMD officials, secondary  screening varies by locality. Officers with advanced training conduct  secondary screening by using equipment such as radiological isotope  identification devices to identify the type of source material detected.", "If, after secondary screening, officers still suspect a threat, they can  contact technical \u201creachback,\u201d which is a system that puts officers on the  ground in communication with off-site specialists and resources.

CWMD  officials said that the technical reachback may occur at the state and local  or national level. State and local technical reachback procedures may  vary, but national level technical reachback is standardized with 24-hour  call centers run by the Department of Energy or U.S. Customs and Border  Protection.", "According to CWMD officials, at any point in the screening process, if a  secondary screening device is utilized, it is standard protocol for the  officer to alert the FBI of the incident.

Thus far, New York\u2014New  Jersey is the only city of the two cities in the sustainment phase that has  received technical assistance.", "Furthermore, CWMD did not consistently take steps to ensure that cities  planned for sustainment when making purchasing decisions. As  previously noted, program agreements generally require sustainment  plans. Under CWMD\u2019s Project Management Plan, CWMD expects cities  to submit those sustainment plans to CWMD within 24 months of their  initial award date. However, New York\u2014New Jersey and Los Angeles\u2014 Long Beach did not submit their sustainment plans until many years after  they began to receive STC funding. New York\u2014New Jersey, for example,  did not submit a draft sustainment plan until 2015, nearly 8 years after the  city initially received funding because CWMD did not include a  sustainment plan requirement for the city until its award for fiscal year  2011 and allowed 36 months to complete a sustainment plan. Similarly,  Los Angeles\u2014Long Beach did not submit a draft sustainment plan until  2017\u20145 years after the city initially received funding. In its program  agreement with Los Angeles\u2014Long Beach, CWMD required that a  sustainment plan be submitted within 18 months of the award date, but  CWMD did not enforce this requirement and accepted a sustainment plan  from Los Angeles\u2014Long Beach that was significantly delayed. It is  unclear whether New York\u2014New Jersey and Los Angeles\u2014Long Beach  ever finalized their draft sustainment plans.", "CWMD identified sustainment as a program goal but has not enforced its  own requirements related to this goal or taken steps to analyze the risks  sustainment challenges pose to its program\u2019s success. Federal internal  control standards state that program management should identify,  analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives.  Unless CWMD analyzes risks related to sustainment, works with cities to  address these risks, and enforces sustainment planning requirements for  cities that join the program in the future, program participants could see  their radiological detection programs and related capabilities deteriorate  over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cities Anticipate Funding Challenges to Sustaining Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all five cities raised concerns to us about their ability to  maintain capabilities over time without a dedicated source of funding once  STC program funding ends. For example, New York\u2014New Jersey  officials told us that they informed CWMD they would not be able to  maintain capabilities past 2021 without additional funds. Houston  conducted an analysis of the funds needed to sustain the program and  estimated that it would generally need over $1 million per year, primarily  to replace equipment. City officials also said that they are already  experiencing challenges that will have implications for funding and  sustainment of the program. For example, Chicago officials said they are  facing challenges regarding funding for training. These officials said  CWMD told them that the company that conducted training in the other  STC cities\u2014at no cost to those cities\u2014will no longer be the designated  training entity. But a new training company has not been put in place.", "CWMD has not communicated a new plan for training Chicago\u2019s officers  on equipment that has already been purchased, and Chicago officials told  us that they do not have additional funds to purchase training. Chicago  officials said that if they do not receive future years of funding to conduct  training on the already-purchased equipment, their planned capabilities  could go to waste.", "According to several city officials, cities cannot rely on other DHS grant  programs or federal grant programs or local sources of funding to sustain  the STC program. Specifically, the officials said that cities\u2019 ability to obtain  funds from DHS\u2019s UASI for sustainment may be limited, in part because  of ineligibility by some partner agencies within an STC city. For example,  law enforcement agencies in Santa Ana, California, received support from  the STC program as part the Los Angeles\u2014Long Beach city region, but  they would not be eligible for UASI funds because Santa Ana is not in the  Los Angeles\u2014Long Beach UASI region. Moreover, UASI funds may not  be sufficient to meet demand from cities. Houston city officials said that in  fiscal year 2017, the city had requested $40 million in UASI funds from  the UASI Committee, which distributes UASI funds in each city. But the  committee had only $23 million to disperse to Houston. According to  CWMD officials, other DHS grant programs within the Federal Emergency  Management Agency\u2014such as the Homeland Security Grant Program\u2014 may not provide a guaranteed source of consistent funding. Further,  CWMD, NNSA, FBI, and city officials that we interviewed said they were  not aware of any other federal grant program that cities could utilize to  sustain nuclear or radiological detection capabilities. At a local level,  several city officials said that there are competing funding priorities, such  as preventing school shootings and addressing the opioid crisis, that  require more money and attention because they affect the local  community more directly every day."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Fully Developed or Documented Potential Program Changes, Including the Basis for Making Changes, or Communicated Their Impact on Current STC Cities", "paragraphs": ["DHS has not (1) fully developed potential changes or documented a plan  for making changes to the STC program; (2) identified the basis for such  changes; and (3) clearly communicated with the cities, raising concerns  about how the changes will impact them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CWMD Has Not Fully Developed or Documented Potential Changes to the STC Program and Does Not Have a Strategy or Plan for Implementing Them", "paragraphs": ["CWMD officials told us that the agency is considering several potential  changes to the STC program that would broaden its geographic reach  and scope, but it has not fully developed or documented these changes  and does not have a strategy or plan for implementing them. According to  these officials, CWMD has not made any final decisions about potential  changes and therefore has not developed any formal strategic  documents. Based on our interviews with CWMD and city officials and  some limited information in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2019 budget justification, we  found that CWMD is considering making the following changes to the  STC program:", "New program goals. CWMD officials told us that the STC program\u2019s  new goals would be to (1) enhance regional capabilities to detect,  analyze, report, and interdict nuclear and other radioactive threats; (2)  provide defense in large geographic regions; and (3) maximize  deployment of detection equipment to nonfederal agencies to support  federal nuclear detection priorities. The first program goal is one of the  original program goals. However, CWMD officials said that under this  proposal, CWMD would no longer include encouraging cities to  sustain capabilities over time as a program goal because CWMD has  discussed centralizing acquisition of detection equipment.", "Expansion of the program\u2019s geographic coverage. Although  legacy cities would still receive support under the new version of the  STC program, CWMD officials said that the new program would  provide national coverage and would include detection and deterrence  activities in regions well outside of cities that UASI identified as having  the highest level of threat and risk for a terrorist attack. Prior to  proposing this change, CWMD had included in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2018  budget justification its intent to select a sixth and seventh city to  participate in the program by the end of fiscal year 2018, which  CWMD officials told us did not occur. In DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2019  budget justification, CWMD stated its intent to support the  development of nuclear or radiological detection capability for broader  regions.", "Centralized acquisition of detection equipment. Instead of  providing funding to STC cities to purchase detection equipment  directly, CWMD officials told us that they would plan to centralize the  acquisition process and purchase equipment on behalf of cities and  regions. CWMD officials told us that they expect most of this  equipment to be PRDs.", "A greater role for other agencies. CWMD officials said that although  the STC program would remain a CWMD-only program, CWMD  expects to work closely with the FBI, NNSA, and other DHS  components, such as the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and  Border Protection, to detect and deter nuclear or radiological threats.  Currently, according to CWMD officials, CWMD is working with the  FBI and NNSA on a Domestic Detection Concept of Operations to  coordinate their capabilities and functions. In addition, CWMD officials  said that they plan to align the STC program with the existing FBI  stabilization program, which responds to nuclear or radiological  threats that have been detected. According to CWMD officials,  CWMD would rely on FBI-led stabilization teams for guidance on  selecting and distributing detection equipment for the STC program.  Each stabilization team would have a partner STC program office to  test, calibrate, and distribute detection equipment and to train  operators, and the STC program would provide funding to cities to  maintain these offices.", "Inclusion of chemical and biological weapon detection and  deterrence within the program\u2019s scope. The Countering Weapons  of Mass Destruction Act of 2018 includes chemical and biological  weapon detection and deterrence under the scope of CWMD but  limits the STC program to detecting and deterring nuclear or  radiological threats. CWMD officials told us that they had planned to  add chemical and biological detection and deterrence efforts to the  STC program, but such a change would now require a statutory  change.", "The changes that CWMD is considering making to the STC program  would be significant in scope. However, CWMD officials confirmed that  CWMD has not documented these potential changes for key  stakeholders, such as cities or partner agencies or provided strategic  documents to describe how it plans to implement any changes. FBI  officials we interviewed said that although the FBI supports greater  coordination between CWMD and FBI-led stabilization teams, these  programs will remain distinct and independent, with separate and  dedicated lines of funding and personnel. These officials also said that  CWMD and the FBI will not share equipment or technicians. According to  NNSA officials, there is no new role defined for NNSA in the STC  program, although NNSA leadership has asked its Radiological  Assistance Program to contribute to the STC program where possible.  NNSA officials also said that NNSA and CWMD will continue to  coordinate on how information flows at a federal level if a nuclear or  radiological threat has been detected.", "CWMD officials told us that they first introduced potential program  changes to five STC cities at a meeting in February 2018 and met with  leadership from these cities in August 2018 to discuss these changes  further. In November 2018, we contacted officials from the STC cities to  determine whether they understood how the STC program would  continue. Officials from the STC cities made statements that indicated  confusion and uncertainty about the future of the program. For example:", "Officials from one city told us they believed that changes to the STC  program would apply only to new cities joining the program, even  though CWMD officials told us that the changes would affect all cities  going forward.", "Officials in another city told us that they left the August meeting with  the impression that the changes presented were only preliminary  proposals up for discussion and that the program could evolve in any  number of directions. However, documents CWMD provided to us  during interviews show CWMD\u2019s intention to make several of the  specific changes described above, even though the agency\u2019s  proposals for the STC program have not yet been finalized.", "Officials in most cities told us they believed that CWMD may provide  them separate funding under the new program for sustaining  capabilities developed to date, but CWMD officials told us that no final  decisions had been made regarding future support for legacy cities.", "Most city officials we interviewed said that the August meeting provided a  high-level overview of potential changes and little detail on how such  changes would be implemented or affect city operations.", "Our past work has discussed the importance of strategic planning. We  have reported that, among other things, strategic plans should clearly  define objectives to be accomplished and identify the roles and  responsibilities for meeting each objective. By developing a written  strategic plan (or implementation plan) for any potential changes to the  STC program, CWMD would provide clarity on what specific changes are  planned and how CWMD plans to implement them. For example, given  the uncertainty around the future direction of the program, a written  strategy would help shed light on the exact role that CWMD envisions for  partner federal agencies and how it plans to utilize these partnerships to  acquire and distribute equipment.", "In October 2018, we briefed staff on the Senate Committee on Homeland  Security and Governmental Affairs and House Committee on Homeland  Security on our ongoing work, including our preliminary findings on the  benefits of (1) developing an implementation plan for potential changes to  the STC program and (2) assessing the effect of changes on the  program. The recent Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of  2018, signed into law on December 21, 2018, requires that CWMD  develop an implementation plan that among other things, identifies the  goals of the program and provides a strategy for achieving those goals.  The act requires CWMD to submit this implementation plan to Congress  by December 21, 2019. In addition, the law requires a subsequent report  assessing effectiveness and proposing changes for the program, which  could provide clarity on how proposed changes would align with STC  program strategy and how CWMD plans to implement them.

In DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2019 budget justification,  CWMD discussed the importance of using the STC program to build  capabilities far outside the immediate target areas, (i.e., cities) and the  need to detect threats along the air, land, or sea pathways into and within  the country that terrorists could potentially use to reach their targets.  However, according to CWMD officials, CWMD has not identified a  change in the nature or level of nuclear or radiological threats to explain  its intent to move from its original city-focused model for the STC program  to a more national approach. In addition, as stated above, CWMD does  not collect information to fully assess the performance of cities currently in  the program and therefore does not have a performance-based rationale  for changing its program goals.

Some city  officials we interviewed expressed concerns that the potential  changes could detract from their ability to decide which types of  equipment and support would best meet their needs. For example,  officials in one city expressed concern that their planned calibration  laboratory, which is used to maintain equipment, could become  obsolete if CWMD chose to distribute PRDs that differ from the type  the city currently uses. Furthermore, some city officials questioned  whether CWMD and local FBI-led stabilization teams could  adequately assess the specific equipment needs of state and local  partner agencies within current STC cities. FBI officials told us that  they do not assess the equipment needs of state and local partner  agencies, but instead share information with those partners should  they wish to acquire similar resources in order to maintain state, local,  and federal capabilities.", "Scope of the program. Several city officials said concerns arose  when CWMD requested that STC cities test toxic compound meters in  2018, raising questions about the scope of the program. These  devices are designed to detect the presence of certain chemical  weapons, but the STC program does not include detecting or  deterring chemical weapons. Therefore, several officials felt that the  request to test the devices was outside the scope of their mission.  CWMD officials said that although the meters were not connected with  the STC program, it made sense to reach out to the STC cities as  CWMD already had a relationship with the cities and they were  deemed appropriate locations.", "Role of the FBI. Some city officials told us that they had heard from  CWMD that the FBI could play an expanded role in secondary  screening in the future, which they felt could be problematic because  of the FBI\u2019s limited staff presence in field locations. FBI officials we  interviewed said that they did not plan to conduct additional secondary  screening in the future; instead they plan to formalize the secondary  screening process that is already in place in STC cities.

City officials said that this change came as  a surprise to them and now they will only be able to buy approximately  90 percent of the equipment they had originally planned to purchase.  In addition, these officials said that they planned to use much of the  fifth year funding for sustainment activities, such as training classes,  and that this loss would adversely affect their current sustainment  plans. CWMD officials said that under the new program, CWMD will  take responsibility for sustaining the nuclear or radiological detection  equipment distributed to cities, but, as described above, these officials  said that no final decisions have been made regarding future support  for legacy cities.", "Several city officials said that CWMD had not adequately responded to  their concerns and that there has been less communication from CWMD  about the STC program since 2017 as a result of the DHS reorganization.

By  regularly collecting detailed information from cities on expenditures made  using program funds and comparing that information to approved  purchase plans, CWMD would have greater assurance that cities spent  funds as approved, and consistent with program goals, and that the  expenditures are in keeping with program objectives. In addition, until  CWMD requires cities to submit checklists or equivalent information on  their progress in the STC program, it will not have complete information  on how cities are performing compared to the key performance metrics  and program milestones they identified for themselves.
