During school year 1996-97, DCPS operated 158 elementary and secondary schools and reported its official student enrollment to be 78,648. DCPS\u2019 budget was more than $570 million in fiscal year 1997\u201416 percent, or $90 million, of which came directly from federal government programs providing grants and funds.", "As early as school year 1989-90, questions about the accuracy of DCPS\u2019 enrollment count arose when the previous year\u2019s enrollment count was approximately 6,400 fewer students than had been reported. Even before school year 1989-90, school system figures were at odds with other independent counts. In 1984 and again in 1986, the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights released figures differing from DCPS\u2019 official counts by more than 5,000 and 2,000, respectively. More recent critics have found discrepancies when comparing the reported enrollment with census estimates and with the District\u2019s general population decline. In addition, various reviewers and auditors have questioned several aspects of DCPS\u2019 enrollment count process.", "These criticisms raise concern because an accurate enrollment count is the cornerstone of a school district\u2019s financial needs assessments. Although in the past DCPS did not receive funds on the basis of the number of students enrolled, new budget initiatives will soon directly link DCPS\u2019 funding to school enrollment. Consequently, a valid enrollment count process and an accurate count are critical to DCPS\u2019 district- and school- level planning, staffing, funding, and resource allocation.", "In response to these issues, you asked us to examine the enrollment count process that DCPS used in school year 1996-97 to determine whether the process appeared sufficient to produce an accurate count. In addition, you asked us to examine enrollment count processes used by some other urban school systems and to determine the role of the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Inspector General in preparing DCPS\u2019 official enrollment count for school year 1996-97.", "To conduct this review, we obtained relevant documents from and we interviewed DCPS administrative staff, city officials, officials in other urban school districts and their state departments of education, officials in the Department of Education, and education experts.

The state determines the rules to be used in the enrollment count\u2014who should be counted, by what method, and when. States also distribute state and federal funds to their districts, usually on the basis of enrollment, and they routinely audit various school district operations, including the enrollment count.", "The governance of DCPS had been performed for many years by an elected Board of Education. In November 1996, however, the specially appointed District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (Authority) declared a state of emergency in DCPS and transferred DCPS management\u2014until June 30, 2000\u2014to the Authority\u2019s agents, a nine-member, specially appointed Emergency Transitional Education Board of Trustees. In so doing, the Authority transferred to the Board of Trustees \u201c. . . all authority, powers, functions, duties, responsibilities . . .\u201d of the former Board of Education (with some exceptions not relevant to this report). Meanwhile, the Authority also replaced DCPS\u2019 superintendent with a Chief Executive Officer/ Superintendent. These changes have resulted in a shift of control from elected officials toward those appointed for a specific purpose: to reform the system. Early reform initiatives have included the administrative reorganization of DCPS and the closure of 11 schools.", "Even before the Authority\u2019s takeover of DCPS, the Congress, relying on its plenary power to legislate for the District of Columbia, acted directly to reform DCPS. In April 1996, the Congress passed the District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995, calling for the calculation of the number of students enrolled in DCPS. The law requires the District of Columbia Board of Education to do the following: calculate by October 15 of each year the number of students enrolled in the District\u2019s public schools and students whose tuition in other schools is paid by DCPS funds, including students with special needs and nonresident students, in the following categories by grade level if applicable: kindergarten through grade 12, preschool and prekindergarten, adult students, and students in nongrade level programs; calculate the amount of fees and tuition assessed and collected from nonresident students in these categories; prepare by October 15 and submit to the Authority, the Comptroller General of the United States, appropriate congressional committees, and others an annual report summarizing those counts; and arrange with the Authority to provide for the conduct of an independent audit of the count.

Forty-one of the 50 states use some type of direct student count to assess resource needs and to distribute state funds to their school districts. Enrollment counts also usually determine budgets and resource allocations to the individual schools.", "Three basic methods are used for counting enrollment. One method\u2014 called Enrolled Pupils (often called ENR)\u2014counts all enrolled students on a specified day of the year. Definitions of \u201cenrolled students\u201d vary among districts, but they usually include elements of attendance. That is, students must be in attendance at least once during some preceding time period. ENR is used by 12 states and the District of Columbia. Another similar method is called Pupils in Average Daily Membership (often called ADM). This method, used by 22 states, calculates the average of total enrollment figures over a specified time period. A third method, called Pupils in Average Daily Attendance (often called ADA), calculates the average total daily attendance over a specified time period. Seven states use this method.", "Enrollment counts may occur several times throughout the school year in response to both state and local information needs and may use different counting methods depending on the purpose of the count. For example, officials in one district reported that they perform a count about 5 days after school opens, using the ENR method. The district uses this count to make final adjustments to school-level resource allocations for the current school year. On September 30, the district conducts the first of three state-required enrollment counts, also using the ENR method. The state uses this count to assess compliance with state quality standards (such as pupil/teacher ratios) and to estimate enrollment before the March 31 count. On March 31, the district conducts the second state-required count, this time using the ADM method. The state uses this count to distribute state funds. Finally, the district conducts the third state-required enrollment count at the end of the school year, also using the ADM method. The state uses this count as a final report on enrollment for the entire school year. In addition to fulfilling reporting requirements, the school district uses the state-required enrollment counts for local planning and monitoring purposes.", "States vary in their approach to monitoring and auditing their districts\u2019 enrollment counts. Some states do little monitoring or auditing of their districts\u2019 counts, while others stringently monitor and audit. For example, one state simply reviews district enrollment reports for the fall and spring and contacts districts if large discrepancies exist. In contrast, another state not only conducts an electronic audit of its districts\u2019 spring and fall official enrollment counts, but also visits districts and examines a random sample of student records in detail. School district officials in this state reported that the state withdraws from its districts state funds paid for students improperly enrolled or retained on the rolls.", "Regardless of when the count is performed or by what method, whether audited or not, accuracy is critical. A student count may be inaccurate if it has problems in any of at least three critical areas: enrollment, residency verification, and pupil accounting. Enrollment and residency verification take place when a student enters the school system. They determine a student\u2019s initial eligibility and therefore who may potentially be included in the count. Pupil accounting refers to the tracking of students after initial enrollment. Monitoring student attendance, status, and transfers in and out of school are all part of pupil accounting, which often involves an automated student database. The pupil accounting system provides the basis for determining continued eligibility to be counted\u2014based upon a student\u2019s attendance\u2014and it helps determine which school may count a particular student in its enrollment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accuracy of DCPS\u2019 Enrollment Count Has Been Questioned", "paragraphs": ["Critics have often charged that the District\u2019s reported official enrollment numbers have been overstated.

In fact, only 2 of the 15 schools had\u2014or reported having\u2014residency forms for 100 percent of the student files we reviewed.", "In addition, schools did not collect all required proofs of residency. Students and their families presented two proofs of residency in only isolated cases, and many students submitted no proofs. In many other cases, the proofs that the schools collected did not meet the standards established by DCPS and printed on the residency form. Although the residency form specified proofs of residency, such as copies of deeds, rental leases, utility bills, or vehicle registrations, as acceptable, schools sometimes accepted proofs such as newspaper or magazine subscriptions, copies of envelopes mailed to the student\u2019s family, stubs from paid utility bills with no name attached, and informal personal notes (rather than leases or rental agreements) from individuals from whom the family reportedly rented housing. We also found some instances in which the names or addresses on the proof did not match those on the form. School staff often complained to us about the difficulty they had trying to get students to return completed residency forms and proofs. Some acknowledged that they placed little emphasis on this effort.", "Schools we visited also varied in their compliance with the requirements to report residency issues to OEA. Schools were supposed to forward copies of all students\u2019 completed residency forms to OEA. These copies were to be attached to a list of students whose residency was considered questionable. Some schools sent copies of their student residency forms along with the list as required. Others sent the proofs with the forms. At least six schools sent no verifications of residency to the Central Office.", "Some of these implementation issues may have resulted from poorly specified requirements and procedures. For example, though DCPS officials reported to us that the requirements were for at least two proofs of residency, we found no written documentation communicating to the school staff or to the students a requirement for more than one proof. DCPS officials also gave us conflicting information about the number of proofs required. At one meeting, we were told that three proofs were required; at a later meeting, that two to three were required.", "Similarly, DCPS\u2019 guidance to the schools did not specify how the schools were to maintain their students\u2019 completed residency documentation\u2014or even exactly what documentation was to be maintained. Consequently, schools\u2019 maintenance of residency documents varied considerably. For example, about one-third of the schools we visited maintained the residency forms alphabetically; the remaining schools grouped them by classroom. The schools\u2019 disposition of the proofs of residency varied even more. Eight schools filed proofs of residency with the students\u2019 completed residency forms; one filed the proofs in the students\u2019 permanent (cumulative) record folder; one filed them either with the completed form or in the folder; one placed all proofs in a file drawer without annotating them to permit subsequent identification of the student to whom they belonged; two forwarded all proofs to OEA, along with copies of the completed form; and two schools had no proofs at all for the student records we reviewed. And, because procedures did not provide for the schools to document the proofs on the residency forms, schools not retaining the proofs with the forms could not demonstrate that they had adequately verified residency. Other audits of schools\u2019 compliance with residency verification would face similar obstacles because of the schools\u2019 inability to link student records with proof of residency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Central Office Did Not Effectively Monitor or Enforce Residency Verification Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Monitors for student residency, in general, did not report the level of school and student noncompliance that we observed in our review. For the nine schools for which we could directly assess compliance, with few exceptions, proofs of residency were missing for large portions of the student population. But, most DCPS Daily Activity Reports (monitoring reports) failed to cite the missing proofs, focusing instead on students who lived with someone other than a parent or whose forms indicated a nonresident address or phone number. For example, in one school we visited, we determined that about one-fourth of the students (or 108) did not return a proof to the school. The DCPS monitoring report, however, identified only one student living with a grandmother and two students with nonresident addresses. In another school, we found no proofs, and staff reported that they could not get students to provide proofs. But the monitoring report showed that only two students had nonresident addresses or phone numbers. Moreover, DCPS officials did not provide monitoring reports for 3 of the 15 schools we visited, telling us that it only prepared monitoring reports for schools where issues of nonresidency had been identified on enrollment cards or residency verification forms. At one of the three schools without monitoring reports, we found no proofs of residency on file for any student.", "Some of the monitors\u2019 failure to detect and report residency problems may have resulted from poorly specified guidance. Instructions to monitors were not specific enough to guide implementation, for example, asking monitors to identify students for whom parents had not \u201csufficiently documented\u201d residence. Monitoring instructions did not specify what to examine to determine whether residency was documented or what documentation was considered sufficient.", "Furthermore, despite recommendations of previous audits, monitors had no instructions to review the files to determine whether students had submitted a residency form. Consequently, when monitors failed to compare names on the student roster with those on completed residency forms, DCPS missed a key element in determining school and student compliance. We found forms missing for at least some of the students at 13 of the 15 schools we visited. At one school, the staff estimated that about 25 to 30 percent of the students did not return the residency forms, and, at another school, the staff could not find about one-third of the forms.", "Despite monitoring efforts and threats of sanctions, DCPS administration did not ensure that the schools completed the residency verification procedures. DCPS conducted no follow-up of schools failing to submit the office copy of the residency form. In addition, on the basis of the reports from the schools we visited, it conducted only minimal follow-up of schools failing to collect adequate proofs. Furthermore, as noted earlier, DCPS conducted no follow-up of those schools failing to collect residency forms for all students because no one in the Central Office checked to see if all forms had been received.", "In addition, the Central Office did not consistently apply the established sanctions to the students or their families for failing to submit forms or proofs. As noted earlier, parents and guardians were told that failure to provide proof could result in an investigation, a tuition bill, or exclusion from DCPS. On the basis of our visits to 15 schools, we assessed the degree of student noncompliance as very high. In one school alone, staff estimated that about 80 percent of the students\u2014or about 700 students\u2014 did not comply. Yet, for all 158 schools, the Nonresident Tuition Enforcement Branch reported that, as of May 1, 1997, it issued only 469 letters to students requesting them to submit proofs of residency, collected tuition from only 35, and excluded only 156 students from DCPS schools. Action was pending for another 136.

Students classified as inactive would not be included in the official enrollment count. No-shows, however, were sometimes not reclassified as inactive as required by the attendance rules. While most schools we visited appeared to be following this rule, at least one school we visited apparently had difficulty changing these students\u2019 status to inactive. At this school, the data entry staff reported that they were having trouble maintaining student status as \u201cinactive\u201d for the no-shows. Some of these students were appearing on their active rolls as late as February, possibly affecting DCPS\u2019 official count.", "Second, schools were required to change to inactive status those students who showed up for at least 1 day but subsequently accumulated 45 consecutive days of absences. For students who had 45 days of absences, schools reported that they only rarely changed their status to inactive. School officials often told us that they did not change a student\u2019s status unless they could obtain accurate information about the student\u2019s whereabouts, confirming that the student should be dropped from the rolls. School administrators stated reluctance to \u201cgive up on a student,\u201d and they viewed changing the student\u2019s status to inactive as such. Unlike the no-show rule, failing to implement the 45-day rule would not have directly affected the October count. It would have affected, however, subsequent counts and the accuracy of projections from them.", "The 45-day attendance rule, if implemented, may have allowed some nonattending students to be considered active and enrolled. The rule enabled any student who reported 1 day to be considered enrolled until evidence was obtained that he or she had transferred elsewhere or until 45 days had elapsed. If a student went to another school district without notifying the school, the school would not have known to drop the student from its rolls. Consequently, even if the student appeared only on the first day of school, the 45-day time period would not have expired before the official enrollment count, allowing a student to be counted who no longer attended a DCPS school.", "This 45-day time period might be considered lengthy by some other nearby districts. Other school districts we visited reported that they have shorter time periods. For example, Virginia law requires that students with 15 or more consecutive days of absence be withdrawn from school, district officials told us. Therefore, neither Arlington County nor Fairfax County counts any student with 15 or more days of consecutive absence. Neither does Boston count any student in this category.", "SIS provided no safeguards to ensure that the schools followed either the no-show rule or the 45-day rule.

These districts rely on a variety of automatic edits and procedures in their student database systems to prevent such errors and serve as ongoing checks and balances on the schools. For example, in Arlington, Fairfax, Prince George\u2019s, and Montgomery counties, the student database systems either do not allow a transfer to proceed unless the losing school removes the student from its rolls or automatically removes the student from the losing school as part of the transfer process. The school cannot override these safeguards.", "In addition, Arlington, Fairfax, and Prince George\u2019s counties reported using two centralized oversight mechanisms for further enhancing accuracy in accounting for student transfers. First, they regularly and frequently check their student databases for duplicate student entries using students\u2019 names and dates of birth as well as identification numbers. These checks also help to safeguard against multiple student entries arising from other sources such as enrollments. Arlington County performs this check every 15 days; Fairfax County, every 2 weeks; and Prince George\u2019s County, daily concerning transfers.", "Second, if these districts identify duplicates, they notify the school immediately and work with the school to resolve the situation, officials reported. For example, Prince George\u2019s County reports duplicates from transfers to the schools every day; when school staff log onto the computer system in the morning, the first thing that appears is an error screen showing duplicates from transfers as well as any other errors. Prince George\u2019s County officials also review these schools\u2019 error screens and follow up daily. If schools do not respond, according to these officials, database management staff can readily access senior district officials to quickly resolve such problems.

Most of the other districts reported that they also use their central student databases to track all student absences as a check on the schools\u2019 tracking. In addition, several districts withdraw students from school after substantially fewer days of consecutive absences than DCPS.

This meant that the auditor could not validate the enrollment of some students\u2014students who were no longer in school at the time of the audit and for whom the school could provide no documentation demonstrating attendance before the count.", "To remedy the problem with duplicate database entries, the auditor recommended that DCPS periodically search the database for duplicates and errors before the enrollment count. Because of differences found in SIS and the manually prepared enrollment count report, the auditor also recommended that these two data sources be reconciled periodically to help update SIS.", "Regarding timing of the audit, the auditor recommended that the audit of the official enrollment count take place closer to the date of the count. And, to facilitate future audits, the auditor suggested that documentation exist to support a student\u2019s attendance in school before the enrollment count. The independent auditor also suggested that after an enrollment count is taken, the staff responsible for monitoring attendance problems have the opportunity to review the enrollment count so they can remove from the count those students who have not attended at least 1 day of school or who have withdrawn from DCPS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of the District of Columbia Auditor Findings Regarding the October 1995 Count", "paragraphs": ["The District of Columbia Auditor, in its audit of the October 5, 1995, enrollment count, found that DCPS needed significantly improved procedures for student enrollment counts to ensure more reliable and valid counts. The Auditor\u2019s office expressed concerns about the security and reliability of SIS, the absence of any penalty for providing false enrollment information, and the lack of oversight or controls to ensure the accuracy of the information reported on the enrollment count. In addition, the Auditor found that SIS was not updated regularly to reflect changes in the enrollment status of students, particularly before the official enrollment count.", "The Auditor also discussed the weak controls in place to detect nonresidency and the weak procedures to collect nonresident tuition. The Auditor found that DCPS did not maintain records on the number of Student Residence and Data Verification Forms completed and returned by students\u2019 parents, and it did not test the information on these forms or the documents provided to support the forms. As a result, the Auditor reported that according to the DCPS Nonresident Tuition Enforcement Branch estimates, about 4,000 to 6,000 DCPS students were nonresidents but did not pay nonresident tuition.", "Consequently, the Auditor recommended that each local school periodically reconcile SIS-generated reports with the attendance records it maintains. This would allow for adjustments to SIS to include those students who have physically presented themselves in class and removing those who have not presented themselves, withdrawn, or transferred.", "In addition, the Auditor suggested that unless students could document their residency, including proof of residency, they should be excluded from the official enrollment count. Furthermore, the Auditor suggested that those nonresidents who pay tuition be excluded from the enrollment count."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From District of Columbia Public Schools", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the U.S. Department of Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, the following individuals made important contributions to this report: Christine McGagh led numerous site visits, reviewed DCPS\u2019 enrollment count process, and cowrote portions of this report; James W.
