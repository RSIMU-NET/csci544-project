Studies of the public sector, while  more limited, have shown similar benefits. For example, the Merit  Systems Protection Board found that higher levels of employee  engagement in federal agencies led to improved agency performance,  less absenteeism, and fewer equal employment opportunity complaints.  As we reported in 2015, across the government, key drivers of employee  morale include holding constructive performance conversations, career  development and training opportunities, work-life balance, an inclusive  work environment, employee involvement, and communication from  management. We also identified key lessons for improving employee  engagement. These key lessons include using effective management  practices to implement change, looking to other sources of data in  addition to the FEVS to form a complete picture of employee  engagement, and recognizing that improving engagement and  organizational performance takes time, which may involve several efforts  with effects seen at different points in time. Engagement is one  component of employee morale.", "DHS employee morale and engagement concerns are one example of the  challenges the department faces in implementing its missions. In 2003,  shortly after the department was formed, we recognized that the creation  of DHS was an enormous undertaking that could take years to implement.  Failure to effectively address management challenges could have serious  national security consequences. As a result, in 2003, shortly after the  department was formed, we designated Implementing and Transforming  DHS as a high-risk area to the federal government. DHS subsequently  made considerable progress in transforming its original component  agencies into a single cabinet-level department. As a result, in 2013, we  narrowed the scope of the high-risk area to focus on strengthening DHS  management functions, including human capital management, and  changed the name of the high-risk area to Strengthening DHS  Management Functions to reflect this focus. We continue to monitor  DHS\u2019s work in this area\u2014including work to address employee morale and  engagement\u2014and regularly meet with DHS to discuss progress.", "My testimony today discusses our past and ongoing work monitoring  human capital management and employee morale at DHS and select  work on employee engagement across the government.

We  conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Has Taken Steps to Improve Its Employee Engagement Scores but Still Falls below the Government-Wide Average", "paragraphs": ["In connection with the Strengthening DHS Management Functions high- risk area, we monitor DHS\u2019s progress in the area of employee morale and  engagement. In 2010, we identified, and DHS agreed, that achieving 30  specific outcomes would be critical to addressing the challenges within  the department\u2019s high-risk management areas. These 30 outcomes are  the criteria by which we gauge DHS\u2019s demonstrated progress. We rate  each outcome on a scale of not-initiated, initiated, partially addressed,  mostly addressed, or fully addressed. Several of these outcome criteria  relate to human capital actions needed to improve employee morale.  Specifically, we monitor DHS\u2019s progress to:  seek employees\u2019 input on a periodic basis and demonstrate  measurable progress in implementing strategies to adjust human  capital approaches; base hiring decisions, management selections, promotions, and  performance evaluations on human capital competencies and  individual performance; enhance information technology security through improved workforce  planning of the DHS cybersecurity workforce; and  improve DHS\u2019s FEVS scores related to employee engagement.", "Since we began monitoring DHS\u2019s progress on these outcomes, DHS has  worked to strengthen employee engagement through several efforts both  at DHS headquarters and within its component agencies. In this  statement, we discuss nine recommendations related to DHS employee  engagement and workforce planning, eight of which have been  implemented by the department. Within DHS, the Office of the Chief  Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) is responsible for implementing policies  and programs to recruit, hire, train, and retain DHS\u2019s workforce. As the  department-wide unit responsible for human capital issues within DHS,  OCHCO also provides guidance and oversight related to morale issues to  the DHS components.", "Seeking employees\u2019 input and demonstrating progress to adjust  human capital approaches. DHS, OCHCO, and the components have  taken action to use employees\u2019 input from the FEVS to inform and  implement initiatives targeted at improving employee engagement. For  example, in 2017 and 2018 DHS implemented our two recommendations  for OCHCO and DHS components to establish metrics of success within  their action plans for addressing employee satisfaction problems and to  better use these plans to examine the root causes of morale challenges.  DHS components have continued to develop these employee  engagement action plans and several components report implementing  initiatives to enhance employee engagement. For example, the U.S.  Secret Service\u2019s action plan details a sponsorship program for all newly  hired and recently relocated employees. In addition, one division of U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) used FEVS survey data to  identify a need for increased engagement between employees and  component leadership. ICE\u2019s employee action plan includes goals with  milestones, timelines, and metrics to improve this engagement through  efforts such as leadership town halls and leadership site visits.", "At the headquarters level, DHS and OCHCO have also established  employee engagement initiatives across the department. For example,  DHS established initiatives for employees and their families that aim to  increase awareness and access to support programs, benefits, and  resources. Through another initiative\u2014Human Resources (H.R.)  Academy\u2014DHS provides education, training, and career development  opportunities to human resource professionals within the department.  DHS uses an Employee Engagement Steering Committee to guide and  monitor implementation of these DHS-wide employee engagement  initiatives. As a result of these steps, among other actions, we have  considered this human capital outcome area fully addressed since 2018.", "Basing hiring decisions and promotions on competencies and  performance. OCHCO has conducted audits to better ensure  components are basing hiring decisions and promotions on human capital  competencies and individual performance and we have considered this  outcome fully addressed since 2017. Our past work has highlighted the  importance of selecting candidates based on qualifications, as doing  otherwise can negatively affect morale. Working to ensure that  components\u2019 human capital decisions are based on performance and  established competencies helps create a connection between individual  performance and the agency\u2019s success.", "Enhancing information technology security through improved  workforce planning for cybersecurity positions. In February 2018, we  made six recommendations to DHS to take steps to identify its position  and critical skill requirements among its cybersecurity workforce. Since  then, DHS has implemented all six recommendations. For example, in  fiscal year 2019, regarding its cybersecurity position identification and  coding efforts, we verified that DHS had identified individuals in each  component who are responsible for leading those efforts, developed  procedures, established a process to review each component\u2019s  procedures, and developed plans for reporting critical needs.", "However, DHS has not yet implemented a recommendation we made in  March 2019 to review and correct its coding of cybersecurity positions  and assess the accuracy of position descriptions. Specifically, we stated  that DHS had not correctly categorized its information  technology/cybersecurity/cyber-related positions. We noted that having  inaccurate information about the type of work performed by 28 percent of  the department\u2019s information technology/cybersecurity/cyber-related  positions is a significant impediment to effectively examining the  department\u2019s cybersecurity workforce, identifying work roles of critical  need, and improving workforce planning. DHS officials stated that they  plan to implement this recommendation by March 2020. As a result, this  outcome remains mostly addressed. Until DHS accurately categorizes its  positions, its ability to effectively identify critical staffing needs will be  impaired.", "Improving FEVS scores on employee engagement. Since our last  High-Risk report in March 2019, DHS has demonstrated additional  progress in its employee engagement scores, as measured by the FEVS  Employee Engagement Index (EEI). The EEI is one of three indices OPM  calculates to synthesize FEVS data. The EEI measures conditions that  lead to engaged employees and is comprised of three sub-indices related  to employees\u2019 views on leadership, supervisors, and intrinsic work  experience. As a result of continued improvement on DHS\u2019s EEI score,  we have moved this outcome rating from partially addressed to mostly  addressed based on DHS\u2019s 2019 score. As shown in figure 1, DHS  increased its EEI score across 4 consecutive years, from a low of 53  percent in 2015 to 62 percent in 2019. In particular, DHS improved its  score by two points between 2018 and 2019 while the government  average remained constant over the same period. With its 2019 score,  DHS also regained the ground that it lost during an 8-point drop between  2010 and 2015.", "While DHS has made progress in improving its scores including moving  toward the government average, it remains below the government  average on the EEI and on other measures of employee morale. For  example, in 2019 DHS remained six points below the government-wide  average for the EEI. In addition to the EEI and other indices OPM  calculates, the Partnership for Public Service uses FEVS data to produce  an index of the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government\u00ae. The  Partnership for Public Service\u2019s analysis of FEVS data indicates low  levels of employee satisfaction and commitment for DHS employees  relative to other large federal agencies. In 2019, the Partnership for Public  Service ranked DHS 17th out of 17 large federal agencies for employee  satisfaction and commitment.", "Across the department, employee satisfaction scores vary by component.  Some DHS components have EEI scores above the government average  and rank highly on the Partnership for Public Service\u2019s index. For  example, the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration  Services have EEI scores of 76 and 74, respectively, and rank 85th and  90th, respectively, out of 420 subcomponent agencies on the Partnership  for Public Service\u2019s index. Further, some DHS component agencies have  improved their scores in recent years. The U.S. Secret Service raised its  EEI score 7 points between 2018 and 2019, and it moved from the last  place among all subcomponent agencies on the Partnership for Public  Service\u2019s Ranking in 2016 to 360th out of 420 subcomponent agencies in  2019. However, other DHS component agencies continue to rank among  the lowest across the federal government in the Partnership for Public  Service rankings of employee satisfaction and commitment. For example,  in 2019 out of 420 subcomponent agencies across the federal  government, the DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction office  ranked 420th, the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis ranked 406th,  and the Transportation Security Administration ranked 398th for  employee satisfaction and commitment. As a result, continuing to  increase employee engagement and morale remains important to  strengthening DHS\u2019s management functions and ability to implement its  missions.", "DHS employee concerns about senior leadership, among other things, is  one area that negatively affects DHS\u2019s overall employee morale scores.  In 2015, we identified effective management practices agencies can use  to improve employee engagement across the government. One of these  practices is the direct involvement of top leadership in organizational  improvement efforts. When top leadership clearly and personally leads  organizational improvement efforts, it provides an identifiable source for  employees to rally around and helps processes stay on course. A DHS  analysis of its 2012 FEVS scores indicated DHS low morale issues may  persist because of employee concerns about senior leadership and  supervisors, among other things, such as whether their talents were being  well-used. Within the 2019 FEVS results for both DHS and government  wide, leadership remains the lowest of the three sub-indices of the EEI. In  addition, for several years DHS components have identified several root  causes of engagement scores. For example, in 2019, the Transportation  Security Administration identified the performance of managers, time  constraints and understaffing, and lack of manager and leadership  accountability for change as root causes of the component\u2019s engagement  scores in recent years. Another component, U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services, identified in 2019 that the areas of leadership  performance, accountability, transparency, and training and development  opportunities were 2018 engagement score root causes.", "We have previously reported that DHS\u2019s top leadership, including the  Secretary and Deputy Secretary, have demonstrated commitment and  support for addressing the department\u2019s management challenges.  Continuing to identify and address the root causes of employee  engagement scores and addressing the human capital management  challenges we have identified in relation to the DHS management high- risk area could help DHS maintain progress in improving employee  morale. Implementing our recommendation to review and correct DHS  coding of cybersecurity positions and assess the accuracy of position  descriptions will assist the department in identifying critical staffing needs.  In addition, as we reported in May 2019, vacancies in top leadership  positions could pose a challenge to addressing aspects of DHS\u2019s high- risk area, such as employee morale. There are currently acting officials  serving in ten positions requiring Senate confirmation. Filling  vacancies\u2014including top DHS leadership positions and the heads of  operational components\u2014with confirmed appointees, as applicable, could  help ensure continued leadership commitment across DHS\u2019s mission  areas. We will continue to monitor DHS\u2019s progress in strengthening  management functions, and may identify additional actions DHS  leadership could take to improve employee morale and engagement.", "In conclusion, DHS has made notable progress in the area of human  capital management, specifically in improving employee engagement and  morale, but still falls behind other federal agencies. It is essential for DHS  to continue improving employee morale and engagement given their  impact on agency performance and the importance of DHS\u2019s missions.  Continued senior leadership commitment to employee engagement  efforts and filling critical vacancies could assist DHS in these efforts.", "Madam Chairwoman Torres Small, Ranking Member Crenshaw, and Members  of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement, I would be happy  to respond to any questions that you may have at this time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["If you or your staff have any questions concerning this statement, please  contact Christopher P.
