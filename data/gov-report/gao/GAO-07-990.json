Decisions to contract for professional and management support services were driven by the need for staff and expertise to get programs and operations up and running. However, for the nine cases we reviewed, program officials did not assess the risk that government decisions may be influenced by, rather than independent from, contractor judgments. These cases included services that have the potential to increase this risk. For example, contractors directly supported DHS missions and performed on an ongoing basis work comparable to that of government employees. Most of the nine contracts also lacked detail or covered a wide range of services. Conditions such as these need to be carefully monitored to ensure the government does not lose control over and accountability for mission-related decisions. DHS has not explored ways to manage the risk of these contractor services, such as through total workforce deployment across the organization. The level of oversight DHS provided did not always ensure accountability for decisions or the ability to judge whether the contractor was performing as required. Federal acquisition policy requires enhanced oversight of contracts for services that can affect government decision making, policy development, or program management. While contracting officers and program officials acknowledged their professional and management support services contracts closely supported inherently governmental functions, they did not see a need for increased oversight. Insufficient oversight increases the potential for a loss of management control and the ability to ensure intended outcomes are achieved."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2006, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) obligated  $15.7 billion for the procurement of goods and services, making it the  third largest department in terms of procurement spending in the federal  government. Of this amount, DHS obligated over $5 billion on contracts  for services categorized as professional and management support, such as  strategic planning, human resources development, and acquisition  support.", "While there are benefits to using contractors to perform services for the  government\u2014such as increased flexibility in fulfilling immediate needs\u2014 GAO and others have raised concerns about the federal government\u2019s  increasing reliance on contractor services. Of key concern is the risk  associated with contractors providing services that closely support  inherently governmental functions: the loss of government control over  and accountability for mission-related policy and program decisions.  Federal guidance requires agencies to assess this risk and provide  oversight accordingly.", "Given the dollars obligated for professional and management support  services contracts and the associated risk, you asked us to review DHS\u2019s  use of contracts for services that closely support inherently governmental  functions. Specifically, you asked us to (1) describe the types of services  DHS requested through these contracts, (2) identify potential risk in these  contracts and the extent to which DHS considered risk when deciding to  use these contracts, and (3) assess DHS\u2019s approach to managing and  overseeing contracts for these types of services.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed applicable federal procurement  policies and data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) for fiscal year 2005, the most recent year for which  complete data were available at the time we began our review. To identify  services that closely support inherently governmental functions, we  reviewed federal acquisition guidance that describes these functions and  FPDS-NG service codes. We selected the four professional and  management support services for which DHS obligated the most dollars in  fiscal year 2005\u2014program management and support services, engineering  and technical services, other professional services, and other management  support services. Because FPDS-NG does not provide definitions for  service codes, to better understand the services provided, we judgmentally  selected 125 contract statements of work for the four types of professional  and management support services. We selected contracts and orders  awarded by DHS components, excluding the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) that had obligated the most on these  services at the time we began our review\u2014the Coast Guard, the Office of  Procurement Operations (OPO), and the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA). From our selected statements of work, we received  and reviewed 117 statements and judgmentally selected and conducted a  more detailed review of 9 cases from the three components. These cases  totaled over $82.1 million, ranging in value from $1.3 million to   $42.4 million, and represented a variety of services that closely support  inherently governmental functions. For the 9 cases, we reviewed contract  files and interviewed contracting officers, program officials, and  contractors. In addition, we interviewed staff from the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Office of Federal Procurement Policy  (OFPP), the component heads of contracting activity at OPO and TSA, and  the Chief of the Office of Procurement Policy at the Coast Guard.  Appendix I provides more information on our scope and methodology. We  conducted our review between April 2006 and August 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Governmentwide, spending on services contracts has grown substantially  over the past several years. At DHS, in fiscal year 2005 services accounted  for $7.9 billion, or 67 percent, of total procurement obligations, with $1.2  billion obligated for four types of professional and management support  services: program management and support, engineering and technical,  other professional, and other management support (see fig. 1). More than  two-thirds of DHS\u2019s obligations for these services ($805 million) were to  support the Coast Guard, OPO, and TSA.", "The services federal agencies buy are organized under more than  300 codes in FPDS-NG and range from basic services, such as custodial  and landscaping, to more complex professional and management support  services, which may closely support the performance of inherently  governmental functions. Inherently governmental functions require  discretion in applying government authority or value judgments in making  decisions for the government; as such, they should be performed by  government employees, not private contractors. The Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) provides 20 examples of functions considered to be, or  to be treated as, inherently governmental, including    determining agency policy and priorities for budget requests,   directing and controlling intelligence operations,   approving contractual requirements, and   selecting individuals for government employment.", "The closer contractor services come to supporting inherently  governmental functions, the greater the risk of their influencing the  government\u2019s control over and accountability for decisions that may be  based, in part, on contractor work. This may result in decisions that are  not in the best interest of the government, and may increase vulnerability  to waste, fraud, or abuse. The FAR provides 19 examples of services and  actions that may approach the category of inherently governmental  because of the nature of the function, the manner in which the contractor  performs the contracted services, or the manner in which the government  administers contractor performance. Table 1 provides examples of these  services and their relative risk of influencing government decision making.", "FAR and OFPP guidance address contracting for services that closely  support the performance of inherently governmental functions, including  professional and management support services, due to their potential for  influencing the authority, accountability, and responsibilities of  government officials. In particular, the guidance states that services that  tend to affect government decision making, support or influence policy  development, or affect program management are susceptible to abuse and  require a greater level of scrutiny. Such services include advisory and  assistance, which includes expert advice, opinions, and other types of  consulting services. The guidance requires agencies to provide greater  scrutiny of these services and an enhanced degree of management  oversight. This would include assigning a sufficient number of qualified  government employees to provide oversight and to ensure that agency  officials retain control over and remain accountable for policy decisions  that may be based in part on a contractor\u2019s performance and work  products.", "The potential for the loss of government management control associated  with contracting for services that closely support the performance of  inherently governmental functions or that should be performed by  government employees is a long-standing governmentwide concern. For  example, in 1981, GAO found that contractors\u2019 level of involvement in  management functions at the Departments of Energy (DOE) and Defense  (DOD) was so extensive that the agencies\u2019 ability to develop options other  than those proposed by the contractors was limited. A decade later, in  1991, GAO reported that DOE had contracted extensively for support in  planning, managing, and carrying out its work because it lacked sufficient  resources to perform the work itself. We noted that while support service  contracts are appropriate for fulfilling specialized needs or needs of a  short-term or intermittent nature, the contracts we reviewed at DOE were  not justified on these bases. In that same year, GAO reported that three  agencies\u2014DOE, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2014may have relinquished  government control and relied on contractors to administer some  functions that may have been governmental in nature.", "More recently, government, industry, and academic participants in GAO\u2019s  2006 forum on federal acquisition challenges and opportunities and the  congressionally mandated Acquisition Advisory Panel noted how an  increasing reliance on contractors to perform services for core  government activities challenges the capacity of federal officials to  supervise and evaluate the performance of these activities. The panel also  noted that contracts for professional services are often performed with  close contact between the federal government and contractor employees,  which approaches the line between personal and nonpersonal services.  Personal services are prohibited by the FAR, unless specifically  authorized, and are indicated when the government exercises relatively  continuous supervision and control over the contractor. Both the panel  and GAO acquisition forum participants noted the large growth in  contracting for complex and sophisticated services has increased attention  to the appropriate use of contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Contracts for Selected Services Covered a Range of Activities Closely Supporting Inherently Governmental Functions", "paragraphs": ["A broad range of activities related to specific programs and administrative  operations was performed under the professional and management  support services contracts we reviewed. In most cases, the services  provided\u2014such as policy development, reorganization and planning  activities, and acquisition support\u2014closely supported the performance of  inherently governmental functions. Contractor involvement in the nine  cases we reviewed in detail ranged from providing two to three  supplemental personnel to staffing an entire office.", "Of the $805 million obligated by the Coast Guard, OPO, and TSA in fiscal  year 2005 to procure four types of professional and management support  services, more than one-half of the obligations was for engineering and  technical services\u2014most of which was contracted by the Coast Guard and  OPO. Figure 2 provides a breakdown of contracting dollars for the four  selected professional and management support services by the three DHS  components.", "Some of the 117 statements of work we reviewed were for services that  did not closely support inherently governmental functions. These included  a TSA contract for employee parking services at airports and a Coast  Guard contract to maintain historic human resource records and perform  data entry. However, most of the selected statements of work we reviewed  did request reorganization and planning activities, acquisition support, and  policy development\u2014services that closely supported inherently  governmental functions. Of the 117 statements of work that we reviewed,  71 included a total of 122 services that fell into these three categories\u2014 with reorganization and planning activities requested most often. For  example, the Coast Guard obligated $500,000 for a contractor to provide  services for the Nationwide Automatic Identification System to identify  and monitor vessels approaching or navigating in U.S. waters. The services  included advising and providing recommendations on strategies for  project planning, risk management, and measuring the performance and  progress of the system. Additionally, the tasks included assisting with the  development of earned value management reviews, life-cycle cost  estimates, and cost-benefit analyses. In another example, TSA obligated  $1.2 million to acquire contractor support for its Acquisition and Program  Management Support Division, which included assisting with the  development of acquisition plans and hands-on assistance to program  offices to prepare acquisition documents.", "Because contract statements of work can be broad, or contain  requirements that the contractor may not ultimately perform, we  conducted a more detailed review of nine cases to verify the work  performed. In these nine cases, we found that contractors provided a  broad array of services to sustain a range of programs and administrative  operations, with the categories of reorganization and planning, policy  development, and acquisition support requested most often. For example,  $2.1 million in orders supporting the Coast Guard\u2019s fleet modernization  effort\u2014the Integrated Deepwater System\u2014included modeling and  simulation services to analyze the operational performance and  effectiveness of various fleet scenarios for program planning. A  $42.4 million OPO order for professional, technical, and administrative  services for multiple offices in DHS\u2019s Information Analysis and  Infrastructure Protection Directorate included tasks to assist in  developing policies, budget formulation, and defining information  technology requirements. Specifically, contractor personnel provided  general acquisition advice and support to the Information Analysis and  Infrastructure Protection business office, which included the management,  execution, process improvement, and status reporting of procurement  requests. For another office, the contractor provided an analysis of  intelligence threats. A $7.9 million OPO human capital services order  provided a full range of personnel and staffing services to support DHS\u2019s  headquarters offices, including writing position descriptions, signing  official offer letters, and meeting new employees at DHS headquarters for  their first day of work.", "The extent of contractor involvement in the nine case studies varied from  providing two to three supplemental personnel to staffing an entire office,  and in most cases contractor staff performed services on-site at DHS  facilities.

When DHS was established in 2003, it was charged with  developing strategies, programs, and projects to meet a new mission while  facing skill gaps in core and key competencies. For example, at TSA\u2014a  component built from the ground up\u2014according to program officials, the  lack of federal staff to provide acquisition support led to hiring contractors  for its Secure Flight program. Federal staff limitations was also a reason  for TSA\u2019s contract for employee relations support services. Many TSA,  DHS human capital, and Information Analysis and Infrastructure  Protection program officials said that contracting for services was  necessary because they were under pressure to get program and  administrative offices up and running quickly, and they did not have  enough time to hire staff with the right expertise through the federal hiring  process. In another case, in prior work we found that when OPO was  established, the office had only seven staff to serve more than   20 organizations. Since that time, OPO has expanded and adjusted the  use of contractors for specific functions, such as acquisition support.", "In the case of TSA, the agency needed to immediately establish an  employee relations office capable of serving 60,000 newly hired airport  screeners\u2014an undertaking TSA Office of Human Resources officials said  would have taken several years to accomplish if they hired qualified  federal employees. In another case, DHS human capital officials said there  were only two staff to manage human resources for approximately  800 employees, and it would have taken 3 to 5 years to hire and train  federal employees to provide the necessary services. Similarly, the Coast  Guard, a more established agency, lacked the personnel needed to address  new requirements for its competitive sourcing program. According to  Coast Guard program officials, only one federal employee was in place  when the new requirements were established. An acquisition plan for  modeling and simulation services in support of the Coast Guard\u2019s  Integrated Deepwater System cited the need for technological expertise as  one of the reasons for hiring contractors. According to program officials,  contracting for such technological capabilities is routine at the Coast  Guard.", "Several officials also described a perception of a management preference  for contracting. For example, an OPO contracting officer said  governmentwide strategies to use contractors influenced program  decisions to award services contracts. TSA program and senior officials  also said decisions to contract were in keeping with a conscious decision  to build a lean organization. For example, in prior work, we found that  TSA contracted extensively to manage human resource needs, develop  and manufacture screening equipment, and provide the information  technology systems it uses to manage day-to-day operations.

Common themes and risks emerged from this  work, primarily the dominant influence of expediency, poorly defined  requirements, and inadequate oversight that contributed to ineffective or  inefficient results and increased costs. Inspector General reviews also  noted that many DHS procurement offices reported that their lack of  staffing prevents proper procurement planning and severely limits their  ability to monitor contractor performance and conduct effective contract  administration.

With limited staffing options, the department relied on contractors to  perform mission-related services that closely support the performance of  inherently governmental functions. However, the tasks assigned to  contractors were not always clearly defined up front, and the breadth and  depth of contractor involvement were extensive in some cases. Four years  later, the department continues to rely heavily on contractors to fulfill its  mission with little emphasis on assessing the risk and ensuring  management control and accountability. Given its use of contractors to  provide selected services, it is critical for DHS to strategically address  workforce deployment and determine the appropriate role of contractors  in meeting its mission. Until the department emplaces the staff and  expertise needed to oversee selected services, it will continue to risk  transferring government responsibility to contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the department\u2019s ability to manage the risk of selected  services that closely support inherently governmental functions as well as  government control over and accountability for decisions, we recommend  that the Secretary of Homeland Security implement the following five  actions:    establish strategic-level guidance for determining the appropriate mix  of government and contractor employees to meet mission needs;    assess the risk of selected contractor services as part of the acquisition  planning process, and modify existing acquisition guidance and training  to address when to use and how to oversee those services in  accordance with federal acquisition policy;    define contract requirements to clearly describe roles, responsibilities,  and limitations of selected contractor services as part of the acquisition  planning process;    assess program office staff and expertise necessary to provide  sufficient oversight of selected contractor services; and  review contracts for selected services as part of the acquisition  oversight program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OMB and DHS for review and  comment.

OMB did not comment on the findings or conclusions of   this report.", "DHS concurred with three of our recommendations, and partially  concurred with the other two. Regarding the first recommendation, to  establish strategic guidance for determining the appropriate mix of  government and contractor employees, DHS agreed and stated that its  Chief Human Capital and Chief Procurement Officers plan to initiate  staffing studies and recommend the number and skill sets of federal  employees required to successfully manage its long-term projects and  programs. We agree that such action should provide the basis for  developing a strategic approach to managing the risk of contracting for  selected services.", "DHS partially concurred with our recommendation to assess the risk of  selected contractor services as part of the acquisition planning process  and to modify existing acquisition guidance and training accordingly. DHS  agreed that its training for contracting officers and contracting officer\u2019s  technical representatives should include the guidance in OFPP Policy  Letter 93-1. DHS stated the Chief Procurement Officer plans to emphasize  this requirement to the component Heads of Contracting Activity and to  department contracting personnel and to coordinate with the Defense  Acquisition University to ensure that guidance is also included in its  training. However, DHS stated that its Acquisition Planning Guide  already provides for the assessment of risk. Our review of the acquisition  planning guidance found that it addresses risk factors such as cost,  schedule, and performance, but it does not address the specific risk of  services that closely support the performance of inherently governmental  functions. As we note in our report, these types of services carry  additional risk that should be considered when making contracting  decisions.", "Concerning the third recommendation, to define contract requirements to  clearly describe roles, responsibilities, and limitations of selected  contractor services, DHS concurred and anticipated that the risk of  contracting for selected services will be appropriately addressed more  often in the future. However, DHS did not specify related initiatives.  Because developing well-defined requirements can be challenging but is  essential for obtaining the right outcome, we believe this effort will require  sustained attention from DHS.", "DHS also concurred with our fourth recommendation, to assess the  program office staff and expertise necessary to provide sufficient  oversight of selected contractor services. DHS stated that this process has  already begun at TSA and that it plans to proceed on a larger-scale  initiative as part of its overall human capital planning.", "With respect to our recommendation that DHS review selected services  contracts as part of the acquisition oversight program, DHS agreed that  these types of services require special assessment, but stated that the  Chief Procurement Officer will direct a special investigation on selected  issues as needed rather than as part of the routine acquisition oversight  reviews. We did not intend that the formal oversight plan be modified.  Rather, we recognize that the acquisition oversight program was designed  with flexibility to address specific procurement issues as necessary.

To confirm  the selection, we then compared each of the services to federal acquisition  guidance that describes inherently governmental functions and services  approaching inherently governmental functions. On the basis of this  review, we gathered and analyzed data from the FPDS-NG on DHS\u2019s fiscal  year 2005 obligations for 29 services. Sixteen of the 29 services fell into the  professional, administrative, and management support services category.  From this category, we selected the 4 services for which DHS obligated  the most in fiscal year 2005\u2014program management and support services,  engineering and technical services, other professional services, and other  management support services. We reviewed these criteria with DHS  acquisition policy and oversight officials, focusing on the link between the  4 selected services and federal acquisition guidance.
