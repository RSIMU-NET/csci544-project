Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, mandated GAO to assess AOC's Chief Operating Officer's (COO) action plan. This report provides that assessment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["AOC has made progress on key management control issues, but substantial work remains to achieve sustained, long-term management improvements and organizational transformation. These key issues include (1) stakeholder involvement, (2) employee communications, (3) auditable financial statements and related internal controls, (4) financial reporting for operating units and cost accounting, (5) information security management, (6) worker safety performance measures, (7) Capitol complex master planning, and (8) strategic management of recycling. For example, AOC has not fully engaged its congressional and other stakeholders in developing a clear, transparent, and documented understanding of how AOC sets project priorities and how progress will be assessed. AOC has taken some steps to involve its stakeholders by delivering planning documents and responding to requests for information. AOC has made progress addressing employee communications issues and can maintain momentum by fully and effectively implementing its planned initiatives. AOC has made progress in preparing auditable agencywide financial statements; however, it has deferred the audit of a complete set of financial statements from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2005. Also, substantial work remains before AOC can provide its managers with the meaningful financial, cost, and performance information needed to enhance their management of operating units. AOC has continued to make some progress establishing the management foundation for effective information security management, but much remains to be accomplished, such as completing system risk assessments and monitoring and evaluating its security policies and controls. Additionally, AOC has developed performance measures to track worker safety, but work remains to ensure successful implementation of these measures. In regard to project management, AOC has taken steps to develop a Capitol complex master plan and expects it to be available for stakeholder comment in February 2006. Given the importance of the master plan, stakeholder involvement early in and throughout its development is key to the plan's ultimate acceptance and value. Similarly, AOC has made progress developing a mission statement and goals for its recycling program as part of its broader Environmental Program Plan, although AOC does not expect to obtain congressional input until after the plan has been completed--an important omission. The Architect and the COO need to work with Congress to determine Congress' information needs--with a specific focus on AOC's project management--and the timing and format of delivery of that information that will best meet Congress' needs. The COO Action Plan was submitted to Congress on December 22, 2003--59 days late. Overall, the plan's high-level description of action items assumes that Congress and other users have a deep and detailed knowledge of AOC's goals, internal operations, and management functions--a level of knowledge that is not reasonable to expect."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This is our second semiannual report on the Office of the Architect of the  Capitol (AOC), as required by the Conference Report on the Consolidated  Appropriations Resolution, 2003.

In January 2004, we completed  the first semiannual review and issued a report on AOC\u2019s progress from  January 18, 2003, through November 30, 2003, in implementing  recommendations outlined in our January 2003 report.", "Based on our past reviews of AOC\u2019s progress implementing our  recommendations, this report focuses on eight key management control  issues that deserve near-term attention.

The historic  nature and high profile of many of these buildings creates a complex  environment in which to carry out AOC\u2019s mission.  AOC must perform its  duties in an environment that requires balancing the divergent needs of  congressional leadership, committees, individual members of Congress,  congressional staffs, and the visiting public.  The challenges of operating in  this environment were complicated by the events of September 11, 2001,  and the resulting need for increased security.", "We issued a report in January 2003 that contained 35 recommendations to  assist AOC in establishing a strategic management and accountability  framework, including strong management infrastructure and controls, to  drive its agency transformation effort, and to address long-standing  program issues.  As a part of ongoing work to monitor AOC\u2019s efforts to  implement the recommendations, we issued a report in January 2004 that  covered the agency\u2019s progress from January 18, 2003, through November  30, 2003.", "In our January 2004 report, we reiterated that many of AOC\u2019s management  problems are long-standing and that organizational transformation would  take time to accomplish.  Not surprisingly, AOC\u2019s efforts to address the 35  recommendations were, at that time, very much a work in progress.  We  highlighted the agency\u2019s first steps to develop a management and  accountability framework, including the issuance of a draft strategic plan  and efforts to strengthen individual accountability for goals.  We noted,  however, that additional steps were needed to enhance communications  with congressional and other stakeholders and employees.  In addition, we  found that AOC began to draft new human capital policies and procedures  and developed three broad-based action plans to help institutionalize  financial management best practices, although many of the actions were  not scheduled for completion until 2007.", "We also reported that AOC was making progress developing an agencywide  approach to information technology (IT) management, although additional  steps were needed to ensure that, for example, mature information security  management, investment management, and enterprise architecture (EA)  management processes are implemented.  In addition, we found that AOC  was beginning to address worker safety concerns by developing a hazard  assessment and control policy, although it is not expected to be fully  implemented until May 2006; was taking steps to establish a project  prioritization framework for better management and accountability; and  was progressing toward adopting a more strategic approach to recycling.

Our first objective was to  assess AOC\u2019s progress over the 6-month period from December 1, 2003,  through May 31, 2004, on eight key issues that deserve near-term attention  and focus: (1) stakeholder involvement, (2) employee communications,   (3) auditable financial statements and related internal controls,   (4) financial reporting for operating units and cost accounting,   (5) information security management, (6) worker safety performance  measures, (7) Capitol complex master planning, and (8) strategic  management of recycling.  Our second objective, which was mandated by  the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 108-7), was  to assess AOC\u2019s COO action plan that was issued in December 2003.", "To address our first objective, we collected documentation to determine  AOC\u2019s progress on addressing each key issue and the 16 corresponding  prior recommendations.  For example, we reviewed documents such as  AOC\u2019s 5-year strategic and annual performance plans; strategic  communications plan; process manuals; funds control administration  order; policy for inventory management; security risk management policy;  information security training, education, and awareness policy; IT security  metrics policy; inspection, audit, and evaluation policy; and updated  occupational safety and health program plan.  We also interviewed AOC  officials responsible for implementing the 16 recommendations and other  related improvement efforts under way at AOC.", "To address our second objective, we reviewed and analyzed several  documents, including (1) the requirements of the Deputy Architect/Chief  Operating Officer Action Plan described in the legislation; (2) the Report  to the Congress from the Deputy Architect/Chief Operating Officer, dated  December 22, 2003; (3) the Deputy Architect/Chief Operating Officer  Action Plan, dated December 22, 2003; and (4) the Architect of the Capitol  Strategic Plan, dated December 15, 2003.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., from April 2004 through July  2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AOC Has Yet to Fully Engage Congressional and Other Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["AOC must perform its duties in an environment that requires balancing the  divergent needs of congressional leadership, committees, individual  members of Congress, congressional staffs, and the visiting public.  The  challenges of operating in this environment were complicated by the events  of September 11, 2001, and the resulting need for increased security.  As we  stated in our January 2003 and January 2004 reports, it is critical for AOC to  engage Congress and other stakeholders to ensure that its strategic and  other planning efforts fully consider the interests and expectations of these  stakeholders.  Successful stakeholder involvement requires continuously  engaging Congress and other stakeholders to obtain their input and  feedback for organizational or operational changes at AOC, ensuring that  AOC\u2019s finite resources are efficiently targeted at the highest project  priorities, and fostering a basic understanding with Congress and other  stakeholders of how to balance competing demands.  Successful  stakeholder involvement also includes improving AOC\u2019s accountability  reporting, which helps communicate what AOC has accomplished and its  plan for continued progress.", "In our January 2003 report, we made three recommendations that would  help AOC improve its relations with Congress and other stakeholders:  Improve strategic planning and organizational alignment by involving  key congressional and other external stakeholders in AOC\u2019s strategic  planning efforts and in any organizational changes that may result from  these efforts.", "Develop a comprehensive strategy to improve internal and external  communications by improving annual accountability reporting through  annual performance planning and reporting.", "Develop a comprehensive strategy to improve internal and external  communications by completing the development of congressional  protocols by involving stakeholders.", "As noted in our January 2004 report, AOC improved its strategic planning  process and provided more specificity to its strategic goals and objectives,  as well as developed milestone dates and actions to assist AOC in  monitoring its progress.  AOC also made progress in improving annual  accountability reporting by implementing a strategic management  framework, which includes issuing a strategic plan every 2 years,  developing an annual performance plan, and developing an annual  performance report that discusses how AOC is progressing on meeting its  goals, as well as holding midyear status briefings.  An AOC official stated  the agency recognizes that the next step in the strategic planning process is  to more fully incorporate outcome- and performance-based measures into  the agency\u2019s strategic and performance plans, and AOC has recently  developed a statement of work to seek assistance in developing both  quantitative and qualitative performance measures to demonstrate  progress toward its strategic goals and objectives.  In addition, we noted  that AOC was partially addressing the development of congressional  protocols.  To further assist these efforts, we made an additional  recommendation for AOC to conduct a pilot of its congressional protocols  in one or more of its jurisdictions to determine how well its protocols  would work in addressing customer requests for service while balancing  the needs of multiple requests with the requirements of the strategic plan  and corresponding project priorities of the agency.", "During the 6-month review period, AOC did not fully engage its  congressional and other stakeholders.  For example, AOC has not reached  agreement with Congress on how best to develop a clear, transparent, and  documented understanding of how AOC sets project priorities and how  progress will be assessed.  In addition, as detailed in other sections of this  report, AOC needs to expand Congress\u2019 involvement in the development of  the Capitol complex master plan and the mission and goals for the agency\u2019s  recycling program.  AOC did take some steps to inform these stakeholders  by delivering planning documents to Congress, responding to requests for  information, and attending monthly or biweekly meetings with  congressional stakeholders.  AOC officials stated that they delivered AOC\u2019s  final strategic plan, performance plan, and COO action plan to  congressional stakeholders in December 2003 to inform them of planned  activities.  (See our assessment of the COO action plan below.)  AOC also  generated a detailed report, at the request of its congressional  stakeholders, that outlined AOC\u2019s progress in implementing our  recommendations.  Furthermore, AOC did take some steps to  communicate with congressional and other stakeholders by attending  monthly meetings held by House leadership; biweekly meetings with other  House stakeholders, such as the House Clerk and Sergeant At Arms;  monthly meetings with the Senate Rules Committee; and bimonthly  meetings with the Senate Sergeant At Arms.  AOC is also preparing to issue  its third building services customer satisfaction survey in June 2004 to  measure the agency\u2019s performance.  However, it has yet to release the  results of the 2003 survey, which was originally scheduled for December  2003, because it has yet to be approved by several AOC jurisdictions.", "As we reported in January 2003, AOC drafted an initial set of congressional  protocols to help AOC work with its congressional customers using clearly  defined, consistently applied, and transparent policies and procedures.   Since then, AOC completed draft congressional protocols and submitted  them to key congressional stakeholders.  An AOC official stated that, based  on stakeholder feedback, the protocols are not viable because  congressional stakeholders do not believe they are applicable to the  operation of and services conducted by AOC.  Based on this feedback, an  AOC official said that the agency may not pursue implementing the  congressional protocols.", "As a legislative branch agency, we have found congressional protocols to  be a successful vehicle in helping us work with Congress.  Successful  development and implementation of these protocols first required us to  reach out to and solicit feedback from congressional and other  stakeholders to develop an understanding of congressional customer needs  and identify concerns before we developed an initial draft.  Further, we  continuously engaged our congressional and other stakeholders  throughout pilot testing and implementation.  Thus, if AOC decides not to  further pursue the congressional protocols or some other vehicle, neither  AOC nor congressional stakeholders can be assured that agency efforts and  resources are targeted at their highest project priorities and transparency  exists for strategic and tactical decisions and trade-offs.", "AOC has taken some steps to involve congressional and other  stakeholders; however, it has yet to fully engage these stakeholders.

Effective communication efforts  include receiving employee input, which can be obtained from existing  offices that interact directly with employees, or via other methods,  including employee surveys or focus groups.  Regardless of the source,  systematically collecting and analyzing employee data are important for  identifying agencywide issues affecting employee relations and improving  human capital policies and procedures.  Another useful practice for dealing  with issues affecting employee relations and collecting employee data is to  establish an ombudsperson position.", "In our January 2003 report, we made three recommendations to improve  AOC\u2019s ability to communicate with employees:   Develop a comprehensive strategy to improve internal and external  communications by providing opportunities for routine employee input  and feedback.", "Strengthen AOC\u2019s human capital policies, procedures, and processes by  assessing ways in which AOC management could better gather and  analyze data from the various employee relations offices and employee  advisory council while maintaining employee confidentiality.", "Establish a direct reporting relationship between the ombudsperson and  the Architect consistent with professional standards.", "In our January 2004 report, we noted that AOC was partially addressing the  development of a comprehensive strategy to improve internal and external  communications.  As such, we made an additional recommendation for  AOC to gather and analyze employee feedback from focus groups or  surveys before fiscal year 2005, as well as communicate how it is taking  actions to address any identified employee concerns.", "Over the 6-month period reviewed, AOC continued to make progress  addressing employee communications by obtaining employee input and  providing employees with feedback, as well as assessing the data gathered  during these efforts.  To help implement these steps, AOC management  issued a communications plan, a draft employee feedback manual, a  customer satisfaction survey manual, and a focus group guide.  Specifically,  AOC\u2019s Employee Feedback Process Manual stated that it is AOC\u2019s policy  \u201cto periodically and systematically obtain and report employee feedback,  to assess satisfaction levels on activity-related topics, and to use this  feedback in improvement actions.\u201d", "To obtain employee input and provide employee feedback, AOC developed  a guide that outlines procedures for conducting focus groups and discusses  AOC\u2019s intent to contract out the facilitation of focus groups.  AOC  management also prepared a statement of work that provides requirements  a contractor must follow when conducting focus groups, including a  requirement for providing a written report containing general conclusions  and findings.  AOC officials stated that they awarded the contract on June  28, 2003, to facilitate AOC\u2019s focus groups, so they may begin no later than  August 1, 2004.", "AOC also obtains employee input by requiring key managers to document  and track employees\u2019 concerns or issues each month.  Key AOC officials  from AOC\u2019s Employee Assistance Programs, Labor Relations, Employment  Counsel, Equal Employment Opportunity, Employee Advisory Council  (EAC), senior management, and Human Resources Management Division  (HRMD) meet monthly to assess employee concerns and identify  systematic concerns.  Agency officials stated that at each of the meetings,  all attendees are reminded that employee confidentiality must be  maintained.  In May 2004, the attendees agreed to pursue a number of  actions in response to employee concerns discussed at the monthly  meetings.  Furthermore, AOC has included as an objective in its Human  Capital Plan to solicit feedback from its EAC.  AOC also plans to use exit  interviews to collect employees\u2019 views upon leaving AOC as well as  regularly obtain input from employees through its customer satisfaction  surveys, to gauge AOC\u2019s internal customers\u2019, including employees\u2019,  perceptions of AOC\u2019s performance.", "To provide feedback to its employees, AOC continues to publish its weekly  and quarterly agencywide newsletters (AOC This Week and Shop Talk) and  issues HR Bulletins that provide updates on changes in human resource  practices and highlight information regarding issues such as employee  benefits.  AOC also published a pamphlet that summarizes the agency\u2019s  strategic plan.  According to agency officials, every AOC employee has  received a copy of the pamphlet, while \u201ctown hall\u201d briefings have been held  with over 400 employees to further discuss the strategic plan.", "Regarding the use of an ombudsperson, AOC officials agreed with the  recommendation in our January 2004 report to adhere to the standard of  independence for the office of an ombudsperson.  Agency officials also  noted that direct meetings between the Ombudsperson and the Architect  were planned, but they never took place because the Ombudsperson\u2019s  contract expired on September 30, 2003, and the position has not been  filled.  AOC does not have plans to fill the position of ombudsperson.   According to AOC officials, the ombudsperson was to serve as an  independent provider of advice and counsel to nonunion employees on  employment policies, practices, and other employment-related matters.   The ombudsperson\u2019s duties and responsibilities focused on resolving  employee issues that may have not been resolved by other offices,  according to AOC officials.", "AOC has made progress in addressing employee communications issues by  creating the basic framework in its communications plan and process  manuals by which AOC will regularly obtain employee input, systematically  analyze those data, and provide feedback to employees on improvement  actions that results from those efforts.  For instance, AOC has committed  itself to initiating employee focus groups not later than August 1, 2004.   AOC also needs to issue and implement its draft Employee Feedback  Manual.  AOC can maintain momentum in this area by fully implementing  the policies and procedures that it drafted or issued as part of its employee  communication efforts.  As we noted in our October 2003 report on the  Government Printing Office\u2019s transformation, developing a comprehensive  communications strategy that reaches out to employees and seeks to  engage them in a two-way exchange helps to build trust and cultivate  stronger working relationships.  Most important, AOC\u2019s top leadership  must make visible and timely adjustments as appropriate in policy or  procedures in response to employee concerns.", "AOC\u2019s decision to not fill the vacant ombudsperson position raises  questions as to whether the services previously provided by the  ombudsperson are being met by other offices or are no longer needed.   Given the history of employee relations issues at AOC, a critical component  of such a management decision would be to conduct a thorough analysis of  the agency\u2019s and employees\u2019 needs, as well as an assessment of the  capacity of existing offices, both internal and external to AOC, to fulfill  those needs.  Without a thorough analysis AOC cannot be assured that the  need for an ombudsperson no longer exists, or that AOC units are prepared  to fulfill the responsibilities an ombudsperson would have performed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendations for Agency Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve communications with employees, we recommend that the  Architect of the Capitol direct the Chief Operating Officer to  fully and effectively implement the basic framework as defined in its  communications plan and process manuals, and finalize its draft  employee feedback manual to assure that the current progress already  made is maintained and   conduct an analysis of both AOC management and employee needs with  respect to resolving employee concerns and issues, as well as assessing  the capacity of existing offices to fulfill those needs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Progress Made in Preparing Auditable Financial Statements and Establishing Related Internal Controls", "paragraphs": ["Preparing auditable financial statements and establishing related internal  controls are fundamental components of a foundation of control and  accountability.  In our January 2003 and January 2004 reports, we discussed  the value of a system of checks and balances over assets and financial  reporting.  These steps are a key foundation for implementing our January  2003 recommendation that AOC continue to improve its approach to  financial management by institutionalizing practices that will support  budgeting, financial, and program management.  AOC\u2019s goals of preparing  auditable financial statements and establishing effective internal controls  are significant components of AOC\u2019s plan to build a foundation of financial  control and accountability\u2014one of the three broad-based action plans  established by AOC\u2019s Office of Chief Financial Officer to respond to our  recommendation.", "In preparing for an audit of its September 30, 2003, balance sheet, AOC  prepared a full set of agencywide financial statements for fiscal year 2003  and has, in fiscal year 2004, begun preparing quarterly agencywide financial  statements.  This first-ever audit of AOC\u2019s balance sheet is nearing  completion and AOC officials expect the auditor\u2019s report to be issued in the  near future.  Completing the first agencywide balance sheet audit  represents a key step in AOC\u2019s efforts to build a foundation of financial  control and accountability.  As we reported in January 2004, AOC planned  to begin issuing a complete set of audited financial statements for fiscal  year 2004.  However, according to AOC officials, the fiscal year 2003 audit  has taken longer and required more effort to support than initially planned  and, as a result, management has now modified its plan for the fiscal year  2004 audit.  In particular, AOC officials noted that establishing the  historical cost for AOC building and improvement assets and values for  AOC liabilities took longer and required more work than initially expected.   AOC has decided to forgo an audit of a complete set of financial statements  for fiscal year 2004 and instead will have its September 30, 2004, balance  sheet audited.  According to AOC officials, after consulting with AOC\u2019s  audit committee and its auditor, AOC decided to defer the audit of a full set  of statements to fiscal year 2005 because of the limited time and CFO staff  resources available to begin preparing for an audit of a complete set of  statements for fiscal year 2004 and the need to work on strengthening  internal controls, including ongoing efforts to address issues identified  during the fiscal year 2003 audit.  In conjunction with the audit of the  September 30, 2004, balance sheet, AOC officials plan to ask the external  auditor to perform additional procedures, which will be designed to help  AOC better prepare for the audit of a complete set of AOC financial  statements for fiscal year 2005.  However, even though the auditor\u2019s work  for fiscal year 2004 will be limited to a balance sheet audit and some  additional procedures, AOC has not revised its stated goal of receiving an  unqualified opinion on a complete set of fiscal year 2005 financial  statements.", "Regarding progress on internal controls during the 6-month period, AOC  has adopted and implemented key policies and procedures in the areas of  account reconciliations and funds control administration, and  institutionalized its policies on inventory management and control.  In  addition, during this period, AOC\u2019s external auditor has, as part of the  balance sheet audit, been reviewing relevant internal controls.  Account  reconciliations, such as those adopted by AOC for accounts receivable and  fund balance with Treasury, are a fundamental control over financial  reporting.  Funds control administration is a group of control processes  that provide a means of establishing responsibilities and delegating  authority to the managers who are to be accountable for the use and  control of appropriated funds.  In addition, AOC has made progress in  institutionalizing its policies on inventory management and control.  AOC  finalized an inventory management policy in January 2004 and, shortly  thereafter, initiated a major effort to train all inventory personnel on  related procedures and controls.  According to AOC officials,  implementation of these policies and procedures came about as part of  efforts to prepare the fiscal year 2003 agencywide financial statements.   Finally, as we discussed, AOC expects the auditor to report on the results  of the audit, including its internal control work, in the near future.  The  results of the auditor\u2019s internal control work will provide AOC with  valuable information as it pursues other efforts to strengthen internal  controls and enhance financial control and accountability.", "We reported in January 2004 that AOC plans to issue a policy statement on  internal controls by September 30, 2004.  In this regard, AOC has begun the  process of obtaining contractor support to assist management in  developing an internal control framework, a related policy statement on  internal controls, and related training.  To speed their efforts and enhance  its acceptance within the agency, AOC officials hope to model their internal  control framework and related guidance after ones that are currently in use  elsewhere in the legislative branch.  As AOC prepares to implement an  internal control framework, AOC needs to realize that establishing  appropriate and effective accounting, compliance, and operational  controls, which potentially may affect all aspects of AOC operations and  activities, represents a significant agencywide challenge\u2014one that will  require senior management attention and support.", "During the 6-month review period, AOC made progress in preparing  agencywide financial statements; supporting the audit of its September 30,  2003, balance sheet; and establishing related internal control policies and  procedures.  This progress provides a valuable baseline from which to  further leverage the audit process through related efforts to improve  internal controls over financial reporting and institutionalize financial  management best practices.

AOC officials expect to begin distributing the financial reports and  providing related training to operating unit managers by the end of March  2005.

However, the plan calls for only limited work to be  completed through the end of fiscal year 2005, with major work scheduled  for fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2007 to identify and implement  system and procedural changes needed to have a cost accounting system  operational in fiscal year 2008.", "In explaining the limited near-term progress planned for implementing cost  accounting, AOC officials noted that successfully implementing cost  accounting depends on an organization\u2019s strategic goals, objectives, and  related performance measures, which tend to drive the categories of costs  and how the related data should be collected and reported.  However, AOC  officials noted that a recent AOC effort to study the potential for  developing performance-based budgets indicated that AOC\u2019s current  strategic and performance plans do not define either the expected level of  program performance or the actual results that should be achieved.   Recognizing these limitations, AOC\u2019s recently issued Cost Accounting  Feasibility Study noted that AOC staff working on strategic planning are  developing an agencywide approach that will identify appropriate and  consistent performance metrics across major operating units. The effort is  scheduled for completion some time in fiscal year 2005.  The December  2003 performance plan indicates that the CFO staff plan to begin  substantive work on the underlying studies and analyses needed to support  recommendations on implementing cost accounting at AOC in fiscal year  2006.  In explaining the schedule for implementing cost accounting, AOC  officials said that it made more sense to defer substantive work on  implementing cost accounting until agencywide performance measures  and metrics are established, especially in light of the other ongoing tasks  and priorities that the CFO\u2019s office is responsible for leading.", "While AOC can now generate financial reports for major operating units  annually and quarterly, substantial work remains to be done to conduct an  initial review and analyze the form and content of the recently developed  reports and to train operating managers on the information\u2019s content and  its potential use in managing and overseeing operating units.  Also, while it  may now be relatively easy and efficient to generate quarterly and annual  financial reports for major operating units consisting of financial- statement-level information, it is not clear at this time how useful operating  managers will find the information they contain.  In addition, AOC does not  have outcome and performance-based measures and metrics that can be  used by operating managers to link financial information to outcomes and  performance.  As a result, substantial work remains to be done before AOC  can provide managers with the meaningful financial, cost, and performance  information needed to enhance their management of operating units and  extend responsibility for financial accountability and control to the units.", "We consider AOC\u2019s ongoing efforts to provide managers with operating unit  financial information and training on the meaning and potential use of such  information to be good initial steps in orienting AOC\u2019s managers on the use  of financial data to enhance operational management.  However, once the  managers are provided with timely financial statements for major operating  units and the related training, AOC officials need to work with operating  managers to assess the usefulness of the financial-statement-level  information and to identify opportunities to expand or otherwise enhance  the nature and type of information (e.g., detailed cost accounting  information for specific projects and operating activities) made available to  managers.", "With regard to cost accounting, AOC does not have the cost accounting  processes and procedures needed to produce operation-specific cost  information that can be used by managers to enhance their management of  major operating units.  Furthermore, AOC officials noted that they do not  expect to begin substantive work on a multiyear effort to develop and  implement system and procedural changes necessary to implement  appropriate cost accounting at AOC until fiscal year 2006.  The officials  anticipate completing the needed system and procedural changes in fiscal  year 2007 and having a cost accounting system operational in fiscal year  2008.", "AOC officials acknowledged that, in the interim, some opportunity exists to  develop and apply selected high-level cost allocations that would  allocate\u2014over some reasonable basis\u2014selected categories of overhead  costs (e.g., the costs associated with operating functional activities such as  human resources, finance, and budget) to major operating units.  However,  the officials also noted that the value or usefulness of such information is  limited by the lack of specific cost accounting data on performance  measures and metrics.  The officials noted that the allocations would be, by  their nature, done after the fact and operating unit managers would likely  have little to no reasonable frame of reference or perspective on the level  of overhead costs allocated to their operating unit or how those costs relate  to their unit.", "While each of the reasons cited by AOC officials to support the anticipated  time frame for implementing the needed cost accounting system has merit,  we think it is reasonable to determine whether, prior to fiscal year 2006,  substantial work can begin on the underlying studies and analyses that will  be needed to identify options and develop tentative recommendations for  implementing a cost accounting system at AOC.  In addition, it is important  for the CFO\u2019s office to actively support and facilitate AOC\u2019s efforts to  develop organizational performance measures and metrics, which along  with cost accounting information can be tracked and used to improve the  operations and management of AOC\u2019s major operating units.

Such AOC assets  include the Computer-Aided Facilities Management system that is used to  request and fulfill work orders for maintenance of the Capitol and the  surrounding grounds, and the Records Management system that is used to  archive architectural drawings pertaining to the U.S. Capitol, Library of  Congress, Botanic Garden, and other buildings.  We also reported that AOC  took important steps to establish an effective information security  program, but that much remained to be done before the agency would be in  a position to effectively safeguard its information and technology assets.   Accordingly, we recommended that the agency establish and implement an  information security program.  More specifically, we recommended that  AOC (1) designate a security officer and provide him or her with the  authority and resources to implement an agencywide security program,  (2) develop policies for security training and awareness and provide the  associated training, (3) develop and implement policies and guidance to  perform risk assessments continually, (4) use the results of the risk  assessments to develop and implement appropriate controls, and  (5) monitor and evaluate policy and control effectiveness.", "In our January 2004 report, we stated that AOC laid some of the foundation  for establishing an effective security program, such as designating an  information security officer, giving this official the authority and  responsibility to implement an agencywide security program, and  beginning to draft information security policies.  We also reported that AOC  partially allocated the resources needed to begin to implement its security  program, although more work remained to define and then execute the  program.  For example, we reported that AOC needed to follow through on  its stated commitments to provide needed program resources, finalize its  security policies, define processes for implementing the policies, and  implement them.", "Since then, AOC has continued to make progress in implementing our  recommendations, but important work remains in five basic areas of  information security management.  First, AOC has contracted to conduct  security operations, risk management, policy assessment, and metrics  activities, but it still needs to provide resources to its security program,  including hiring two security specialists to conduct system risk  assessments.  Second, AOC has developed security training and awareness  policies and began implementing them, but it still needs to provide the  training and awareness to all employees who use information technology  assets.  Third, AOC has developed policies and guidance to perform system  risk assessments and conducted risk assessments on agency mission- critical support systems, but it still needs to complete assessments on 4  mission-critical major applications and 34 other agency systems.  Fourth,  AOC has developed guidance that for resolving identified risks and begun  implementing it on those support systems that it has assessed, but it still  needs to develop and implement controls to address any risks that may be  identified by the yet-to-be-completed assessments.  Fifth, AOC has defined  a metrics policy and a plan for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness  of its controls and begun measuring its support systems controls, and it  plans to complete initial data gathering on defined metrics by December  2004 and report on them by March 2005.  However, the agency still needs to  do the same for any controls assessments implemented as a result of any  yet-to-be compiled risks.", "AOC plans to complete work in most of these areas over the next 8 months.   Specifically, it plans to (1) expedite the modification of an existing contract  to hire two security specialists by August 2, 2004; (2) complete security  awareness activities for all AOC employees between July and the end of  November 2004, develop role-based security training and begin  implementing it in fiscal year 2006; (3) complete the risk assessments on its  mission-critical major applications by September 30, 2004; (4) subsequently  develop and implement controls to address any risks identified by the yet  to be completed assessments; and (5) complete the initial data gathering on  security policy and control metrics by December 2004 and issue its first  report on their effectiveness by March 2005.", "As we reported in January 2003, successfully completing these plans  depends in large part on the commitment and leadership of AOC senior  managers.  Such commitment and leadership will require the timely  allocation and application of needed resources and close oversight of plan  execution.

AOC developed  several broad performance measures to judge the success of its safety and  health program.  First, AOC developed a measure of the number and  severity of safety and health deficiencies that exist at AOC (a baseline  assessment was completed).   Second, AOC developed a measure to assess  employees\u2019 attitudes and beliefs about safety within their organization\u2014a  gauge of employees\u2019 perceptions of safety at AOC.   The initial survey was  administered between December 2003 and January 2004.  In February 2004,  AOC completed analysis of the survey responses and developed  recommendations to improve worker perceptions about safety.  Finally,  AOC uses the rate at which employees suffer a job-related injury and illness  to monitor workplace safety as established by the Department of Labor\u2019s  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).  AOC discussed its  injury and illness rate in public testimony to demonstrate its commitment  to a safe and healthy work environment.", "AOC is also developing specific performance measures related to worker  safety.  First, AOC senior management, through quarterly council meetings  known as the Safety, Health and Environmental Council (SHEC), has  developed measures to assess and control workers\u2019 compensation costs  including (1) the number and severity of injuries and illnesses, (2) the  number and cost of workers\u2019 compensation injuries and illnesses, (3) the  number of lost production days associated with workers\u2019 compensation  cases, and (4) the number of modified work assignments.  In addition,  SHEC has developed several tools aimed at raising employee awareness of  safety and the link between safety and workers\u2019 compensation.   Second,  AOC has developed performance measures for several of the 34 safety  policies.  The purpose of the safety policies is to establish consistent  requirements for AOC with agencies such as OSHA and the Environmental  Protection Agency.  These safety policy measures include (1) the number of  safety inspections and audits performed, (2) the number of safety  deficiencies, and (3) the number of employees trained.  Finally, AOC has  continued to assess training performance by asking participants to evaluate  training courses; having subject matter experts from the Safety, Fire, and  Environmental Program Office audit the courses; and soliciting informal  feedback from participants\u2019 supervisors.  Moreover, AOC has begun to  notice that safety training participants are applying lessons learned from  training.  For example, AOC officials reported that training on blood-borne  pathogens resulted in employees applying the principles learned during a  recent event.  In addition, AOC plans to assess employee knowledge and  behavior to ensure compliance with the policy, including interviewing  employees on the requirements of a jurisdictional standard operating  procedure.  However, AOC has made little progress on developing tools  necessary for more complex assessments of its training and development  efforts, such as measuring their impact on overall program or  organizational results, or comparing the benefits of training efforts against  their costs.  We have previously reported on the potential value\u2014and  challenges\u2014associated with these more complex approaches of assessing  training and development.  When deciding on an evaluation strategy,  agencies (such as AOC) should select an appropriate analytical approach  that will best measure the effect of their programs while also considering  what is realistic and reasonable given the broader context and fiscal  constraints.", "AOC has made progress in its safety performance measures.  However,  AOC can strengthen its efforts to evaluate workplace safety.  First, while  AOC\u2019s measure of the number and severity of safety and health deficiencies  is a positive step, time frames to correct these deficiencies still need to be  established.  Although AOC has plans to develop a measure of the timeline  in which hazards and deficiencies are corrected, it has yet to complete this  measure.  Second, while the safety perception survey provided information  on how employees\u2019 perceive safety in their work environment, the full  potential of this tool has not been fully recognized.  AOC officials stated  that the survey should not be considered a measure of safety performance  and have no plans to administer the survey on a recurring basis.  However,  the survey is a valuable performance measure of employees\u2019 perceptions  about workplace safety and could prove useful if conducted in the future.   For any future use, AOC would need to first address design and  implementation weaknesses.  For example, pretests of the survey were not  conducted, survey instructions were poorly worded, the questions allowed  for a biased response, and the design did not allow for a non-response  analysis.  Moreover, given the low response rate of frontline employees,  AOC should be hesitant to represent findings as reflective of the employee  population.", "AOC has fulfilled our third worker safety recommendation listed above by  developing performance measures to assess the long-term impacts and  trends of workers\u2019 compensation injuries and costs.

The plan could also better communicate whether the action  items are standalone or dependent upon each other to accomplish the  COO\u2019s responsibilities.  Finally, even though the legislation required that  the COO action plan be developed concurrently and consistently with the  strategic plan, the plan did not include a direct crosswalk to the AOC  strategic plan, which was released on December 15, 2003, nor did it provide  a clear picture of how the action items will help accomplish the agency\u2019s  mission and goals."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Recommendation for Agency Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance the usefulness of the COO action plan, we recommend the  Architect of the Capitol and the Chief Operating Officer consult with  members of Congress and key committees on the specific information  regarding AOC\u2019s plans, policies, procedures, actions, and proposed  organizational changes.  As part of this effort, the Architect and the COO  should work with Congress to determine Congress\u2019 information needs and  the timing and format of delivery of that information that will best meet  Congress\u2019 needs.  Furthermore, consistent with our findings and  recommendations with respect to congressional and other stakeholder  involvement in general and the Capitol complex master plan in particular,  as well as our original January 2003 management review, specific emphasis  should be placed on AOC\u2019s project management.  Particular issues to be  discussed could include how  AOC\u2019s projects\u2019 priorities are determined,   AOC monitors and controls project cost, quality, and timeliness,   AOC uses lessons learned from projects and seeks to incorporate best   project management accountability is assigned and managed, and  AOC determines the best mix of in-house and contractor support when  designing projects.", "Subsequent COO action plans and status reports will likely be most helpful  to Congress to the extent that they are rigorously specific as to the problem  or issue that needs to be addressed, the actions that are being taken in  response, the progress to-date, and milestones for additional actions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As we noted in our two previous reviews, organizational transformation  does not come quickly or easily and the changes under way at AOC require  a long-term concerted effort.  AOC has made progress in addressing the  eight key management control issues and the corresponding  recommendations outlined in this report; however, AOC management will  need to build on its efforts to date and more fully engage congressional and  other stakeholders to ensure that their interests and expectations are  incorporated into AOC\u2019s organizational transformation.  For example,  involving stakeholders in the development of a comprehensive strategy to  improve internal and external communications, the formulation of a  Capitol complex master plan, and the establishment of a recycling mission  and goals will be critical in successfully addressing these key issues.  As  AOC works to establish its strategic management and accountability  framework and address long-standing areas of concern, it must continue to  demonstrate progress on each of these eight key issues to help it sustain  the momentum needed to accomplish its organizational transformation,  particularly in engaging its congressional and other stakeholders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Architect of the Capitol a draft of this report on   July 26, 2004, for review and comment.  We received written comments  from the Architect on August 13, 2004, and they are reprinted in appendix I.   In his comments, the Architect generally agreed with our findings and  conclusions.  He suggested technical changes and provided additional  information related to information security, safety performance measures,  and Capitol complex master planning that were incorporated into our  report where appropriate.  The Architect also noted his agreement with  each new recommendation, except for those regarding worker safety  performance measures, Capitol complex master planning, and the process  for prioritizing projects.", "Regarding worker safety performance measures, we reported that AOC\u2019s  safety perception survey had design and implementation weaknesses and,  therefore, we recommended a more rigorous methodological approach to  the survey.  In response, the Architect stated that they found AOC\u2019s  employee response rate to be 68 percent.  While this rate is approaching the  70 percent cut-off that is considered minimally acceptable for this type of  survey, only 49 percent of the subgroup of frontline employees (e.g.  carpenters, plumbers, and custodial workers) returned a completed survey,  according to AOC\u2019s summary report.  As frontline employees are most at  risk of work-related injuries, their low response rate makes it difficult for  AOC to draw meaningful conclusions about these employees\u2019 attitudes and  beliefs towards safety.  The Architect also noted that the survey used a  number of benchmark questions that have previously been used in other  surveys.  Nonetheless, AOC\u2019s lack of a pre-test of the entire instrument  does not give AOC assurance that employees interpreted the questions in  the manner AOC had expected.  In fact, officials in one AOC jurisdiction  were concerned that some questions could be misinterpreted and therefore  had employees complete their individual survey in a group like setting.   Thus, we believe that AOC\u2019s safety perception survey would still benefit  from a more rigorous methodological approach.", "In our draft report, we also recommended that the Architect direct the COO  to improve Capitol complex master planning efforts and the process to  prioritize projects by (1) ensuring that congressional and other  stakeholders are engaged early and throughout the development of the  Capitol complex master plan, and (2) ensuring that AOC informs and  obtains agreement from congressional and other stakeholders on how and  why specific projects are submitted for funding.  According to the  Architect, he has and will continue to lead the Capitol complex master plan  initiative.  In addition, the Architect noted his plan to get an  Architect/Engineer (AE) onboard so that they can jointly meet with and  ensure that stakeholders are engaged at the beginning and throughout the  development of the master plan.  We agree that the Architect\u2019s personal  involvement in the development of the Capitol complex master plan will be  critical to its success and the Architect\u2019s commitment to engage  stakeholders is consistent with our recommendation.  However, because  the COO position was created to serve as the central leadership point to  improve AOC\u2019s executive decision-making capacity and accountability, the  COO should also be involved in the master planning process, project  prioritization, and communication with stakeholders.  As such, we made  revisions to the two recommendations to address the Architect\u2019s concerns  so that the Architect, with support from the COO, leads efforts to  implement the recommendations.  In addition, the Architect questioned the  direct link between the master plan and the prioritization process.  We  continue to believe that the Capitol complex master plan and project  prioritization should be linked because a master plan could help guide day- to-day prioritization by being the basis for communicating, both internally  and externally, the trade-offs that result from prioritizing one project over  another, or how individual projects fit within a broader AOC framework.   We made revisions to the two recommendations to provide greater clarity  by addressing the master plan and the prioritization process separately.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional parties.
