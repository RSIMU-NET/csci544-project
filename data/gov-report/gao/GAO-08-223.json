The extent of these liabilities nationwide is not yet known, but some predict they will be very large, possibly exceeding a trillion dollars in present value terms. The federal government has an interest in assuring that all Americans have a secure retirement, as reflected in the federal tax deferral for contributions to both public and private pension plans. Consequently, the GAO was asked to examine: 1) the key measures of the funded status of retiree benefits and 2) the current funded status of retiree benefits. GAO analyzed data on public pensions, reviewed current literature, and interviewed a range of experts on public retiree benefits, actuarial science, and accounting."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Three key measures help to understand different aspects of the funded status of state and local government pension and other retiree benefits. First, governments' annual contributions indicate the extent to which governments are keeping up with the benefits as they are accumulating. Second, the funded ratio indicates the percentage of actuarially accrued benefit liabilities covered by the actuarial value of assets. Third, unfunded actuarial accrued liabilities indicate the excess, if any, of liabilities over assets in dollars. Governments have been reporting these three measures for pensions for years, but new accounting standards will also require governments to report the same for retiree health benefits. Because a variety of methods and actuarial assumptions are used to calculate the funded status, different plans cannot be easily compared. Currently, most state and local government pension plans have enough invested resources set aside to keep up with the benefits they are scheduled to pay over the next several decades, but governments offering retiree health benefits generally have large unfunded liabilities. Many experts consider a funded ratio of about 80 percent or better to be sound for government pensions. We found that 58 percent of 65 large pension plans were funded to that level in 2006, a decrease since 2000. Low funded ratios would eventually require the government employer to improve funding, for example, by reducing benefits or by increasing contributions. However, pension benefits are generally not at risk in the near term because current assets and new contributions may be sufficient to pay benefits for several years. Still, many governments have often contributed less than the amount needed to improve or maintain funded ratios. Low contributions raise concerns about the future funded status. For retiree health benefits, studies estimate that the total unfunded actuarial accrued liability for state and local governments lies between $600 billion and $1.6 trillion in present value terms. The unfunded liabilities are large because governments typically have not set aside any funds for the future payment of retiree health benefits as they have for pensions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nearly 20 million employees and 7 million retirees and dependents of state and  local governments\u2014including school teachers, police, firefighters, and other  public servants\u2014 are promised pensions, and many are promised retiree health  benefits.

Typically, pension benefits are paid from a fund made  up of assets from employers\u2019 and employees\u2019 annual contributions and the  investment earnings from those contributions. Such a fund has an unfunded  liability when the actuarial value of assets is less than actuarial accrued  liabilities. Accounting standards have called for state and local governments to  report their unfunded pension liabilities since 1986. But accounting standards  have only recently been established that call for reporting the size of unfunded  retiree health liabilities. While few state and local governments have as yet  officially reported these unfunded liabilities, some studies have estimated that  they may exceed $1 trillion dollars nationwide in present value terms.

However, new GASB standards  (Statements 43 and 45) call for employers to quantify and report on the  size of retiree health care benefit liabilities.

To  help clarify, we found that three measures are key to understanding  pension plans\u2019 funded status. GASB standards require reporting all three of  these measures.

Actuaries calculate yearly contribution amounts  needed to maintain or improve the funded status of plans over time.  Comparing this amount to the amount governments actually contribute  indicates how well governments are keeping up with yearly funding needs.  Two other measures, funded ratios and unfunded liabilities, both suggest  the extent to which current assets can cover accrued benefits. These three  measures should be viewed together and over time to get a complete  picture of the funded status. The funded status measures of different plans  cannot be compared to one another easily because different governments  use different actuarial funding methods and assumptions to estimate them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Three Measures, Viewed in Relation to One Another over Time, Describe Funded Status", "paragraphs": ["Some officials we interviewed expressed confusion about how to  understand the funded status of public pension plans. State and local  governments report a significant amount of information on funding,  required by GASB standards. The media often report various measures of  the funded status without explaining the meaning of the terms or without  enough context. In addition, governments have been reporting these  funded status measures for pensions for years. However, the new  accounting rules will also call on governments to report the funded status  of retiree health benefits in a similar manner, even though many have not  made any contributions to build assets to cover liabilities.", "We identified three key measures to help explain plans\u2019 funded status:  contributions, funded ratios, and unfunded liabilities. According to experts  we interviewed, any single measure at a point in time may give a  dimension of a plan\u2019s funded status, but it does not give a complete  picture. Instead, the measures should be reviewed collectively over time to  understand how the funded status is improving or worsening. For  example, a strong funded status means that, over time, the amount of  assets, along with future scheduled contributions, comes close to  matching a plan\u2019s liabilities.", "Comparing governments\u2019 actual contributions to the \u201cannual required  contribution\u201d (ARC) helps in evaluating the funded status of each plan.  Each year, plan actuaries calculate a contribution amount that, if paid in  full, would normally maintain or improve the funded status. This amount  is referred to as the ARC, although the use of the word \u201crequired\u201d can be  misleading because governments can choose to pay more or less than this  amount. If the actuarial assumptions are consistent with the plans\u2019 future  experience, paying the full ARC each year provides reasonable assurance  that sufficient money is being set aside to cover currently accruing  benefits as well as a portion of any unfunded accrued benefits left over  from previous years, instead of leaving those costs for the future. In other  words, when a government consistently pays the ARC, the benefits  accrued by employees are paid for by the taxpayers who receive the  employees\u2019 services. When the ARC is not paid in full each year, future  generations must make up for the costs of benefits that accrued to  employees in the past. In addition, the ARC can be compared to the  government\u2019s yearly budget to understand the financial burden of the  benefits, according to officials. This comparison indicates how affordable  the plan is to the government in a given year. A high ARC relative to a  government\u2019s budget may indicate that the costs of benefits are relatively  high or that payments have been deferred from previous years.", "The funded ratio is the ratio of assets to liabilities. Liabilities are the  amount governments owe in benefits to current employees who have  already accrued benefits they will collect in the future. The funded ratio  indicates the extent to which a plan has enough funds set aside to pay  accrued benefits. If a plan has a funded ratio of 80 percent, the plan has  enough assets to pay for 80 percent of all accrued benefits. A rising funded  ratio over time indicates that the government is accumulating the assets  needed to make future payments for benefits accrued to date. A low or  declining funded ratio over time may raise concerns that the government  will not have the assets set aside to pay for benefits.", "While the funded ratio equals the ratio of assets to liabilities, unfunded  liabilities equal the difference between liabilities and assets in dollars.  Thus, unfunded liabilities indicate the amount of benefits accrued for  which no money is set aside. Assets may fall short of liabilities, for  example, when governments do not contribute the full ARC, when they  increase benefits retroactively, or when returns on investments are lower  than assumed. Additionally, because all these financial calculations  involve estimates of future payments, they are based on a number of  assumptions about the future. Unfunded liabilities can grow if actuaries\u2019  assumptions do not hold true. For example, if beneficiaries live longer  than anticipated, they will receive more benefits than predicted, even if the  government has been paying the ARC consistently. Unfunded liabilities  will eventually require the government employer to increase revenue,  reduce benefits or other government spending, or do some combination of  these. Revenue increases could include higher taxes, returns on  investments, or employee contributions. Nevertheless, we found that  unfunded liabilities do not necessarily imply that pension benefits are at  risk in the near term. Current funds and new contributions may be  sufficient to pay benefits for several years, even when funded ratios are  relatively low.", "As described in figure 1, unfunded liabilities are calculated as intermediate  steps in the process of calculating the ARC. After calculating the unfunded  liabilities, actuaries usually determine an amount to fund the unfunded  liabilities over several years or \u201camortize\u201d the cost of the liability. That  amortized portion is added to the cost of benefits that employees accrued  in the current year to determine the ARC. If a government pays the ARC,  then a portion of the unfunded liabilities is paid off each year. When no  more unfunded liabilities exist, the funded ratio is 100 percent, and the  plan has \u201cfully funded\u201d all the benefits that its current employees have  accrued under the plan\u2019s actuarial cost method. However, a fully funded  plan still requires yearly contributions to maintain full funding because as  employees perform additional service, they accrue additional benefits.", "Asset = sum of past contribution from the te nd locl government plponor, employee, nd invetment erning tht hve not een pid ot in enefit or dminitrtive expen.", "Liabilitie = rrent cot of ll fre enefit tht hve een ccred to dte."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparing the Funded Status of Different Plans Is Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Under GASB reporting standards, the funded status of different pension  plans cannot be compared easily because governments use different  actuarial approaches such as different actuarial cost methods,  assumptions, amortization periods, and \u201csmoothing\u201d mechanisms."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Actuarial Cost Methods", "paragraphs": ["Most public pension plans use one of three \u201cactuarial cost methods,\u201d out  of the six GASB approves. Actuarial cost methods differ in several ways.  First, each uses a different approach to calculate the \u201cnormal cost,\u201d the  portion of future benefits that the cost method allocates to a specific year,  resulting in different funding patterns for each, as described in Table 2.", "Actuarial cost methods are used to allocate the current value of future  benefits into amounts attributable to the past, to the current year, and to  future years, as shown in figure 2. The cost of future benefits that are  attributable to past years under the actuarial cost method is called the  actuarial accrued liability (AAL), while the cost of benefits accrued under  the cost method in the current year is known as the normal cost.", "The funded status of plans using different cost methods differs because  each has a different approach to dividing up the value of future benefits.  Different cost methods are designed for plans to accrue liabilities at  different rates, so the normal cost and the AAL vary according to the cost  method. For example, under some cost methods, governments accrue  more liabilities in the early part of employees\u2019 career rather than later. As a  result, two identical plans, using identical actuarial assumptions but  different cost methods, would report a different funded status.", "In addition to the cost methods, differences in assumptions used to  calculate the funded status can result in significant differences among  plans that make comparisons difficult. One key assumption is the rate at  which governments assume their invested assets will grow. If governments  assume a high growth rate, their calculations will indicate that they do not  have to pay as much today, because the assets set aside will grow more  rapidly. In 2006, 70 percent of state and local government pension plans  assumed a return of 8.0 to 8.5 percent, while 30 percent assumed a lower  rate of return (7 percent at the lowest). If a plan\u2019s assets fail to grow at the  assumed rate of return, then the shortfall becomes part of the unfunded  liabilities. However, in other years, assets may earn more than the  assumed rate of return, reducing unfunded liabilities.", "Amortization Periods for Unfunded Liabilities  In addition to actuarial cost methods and assumptions, differences in  amortization periods make it difficult to compare the funded status of  different plans. Governments amortize unfunded liabilities to reduce the  volatility of contributions from year to year. Governments can choose  shorter or longer periods over which to amortize unfunded liabilities.  GASB standards allow governments to amortize unfunded liabilities over a  period of up to 30 years. State and local governments can amortize their  benefits because there is little chance that they will cease to exist."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smoothing Periods", "paragraphs": ["Finally, actuaries for many plans calculate the value of current assets  based on an average value of past years. As a result, if the value of assets  fluctuates significantly from year to year, the \u201csmoothed\u201d value of assets  changes less dramatically. GASB does not limit the number of years  governments may use to smooth the value of assets, but in 2006, most  governments averaged the value of current assets with those of the last  zero to 5 years. Comparing the funded status of plans that use different  smoothing periods can be confusing because the value of the different  plans\u2019 assets reflects a different number of years.

In fiscal year 2006, the aggregate funded ratio was about 86  percent. Some officials attribute the decline in funded ratios since the late  1990s to the decline of the stock market, which reduced the value of  assets. This sharp decline would likely affect funded ratios for several  years because most plans use smoothing techniques to average out the  value of assets over several years. Our analysis of several factors affecting  the funded ratio showed that changes in investment returns had the most  significant impact on the funded ratio between 1988 and 2005, followed by  changes in liabilities.", "Although most plans report being soundly funded in 2006, a few have been  persistently underfunded, and some plans have seen funded ratio declines  in recent years.

In addition, 17 of  these governments did not contribute more than 90 percent of the full ARC  in more than half the years.", "State and local government pension representatives told us that  governments may not contribute the full ARC each year for a number of  reasons. First, when state and local governments are under fiscal pressure,  they may have to make difficult choices about paying for competing  interests. State and local governments will likely face increasing fiscal  challenges in the next several years as the cost of health care continues to  rise. In light of this stress, the ability of some governments to continue to  pay the ARC may be questioned. Second, changes in the value of assets  can affect governments\u2019 expectations about how much they will have to  contribute. Because a high proportion of plan assets are invested in the  stock market, the decline in the early 2000s decreased funded ratios and  increased the unfunded liabilities of many plans. Such a marked decline in  asset values was not typical in the experience of public pension funds,  according to one expert. Reflecting the need to keep up with the increase  in unfunded liabilities, ARCs increased, challenging many governments to  make full contributions after they had grown accustomed to lower ARCs  in the late 1990s. Moreover, some plans have contribution rates that are  fixed by constitution, statute, or practice and do not change in response to  changes in the ARC. Even when the contribution rate is not fixed, the  political process may take time to recognize and act on the need for  increased contributions. Nonetheless, many states have been increasing  their contribution rates in recent years, according to information compiled  by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Third, some  governments may not contribute the full ARC because they are not  committed to pre-funding their pension plans and instead have other  priorities, regardless of fiscal conditions.", "When a government contributes less than the full ARC, the funded ratio  can decline and unfunded liabilities can rise, if all other assumptions are  met about the change in assets and liabilities.

The projected unfunded liabilities do not have to be paid all at  once, but can be paid over many years. Some governments do not pay for  any retiree health benefits and therefore do not have any unfunded  liabilities. Others may have large unfunded liabilities. For example,  California has estimated its unfunded retiree health benefits liabilities at  $70 billion, while the state of Utah estimates $749 million.", "Estimates of unfunded liabilities for retiree health benefits are subject to  change substantially because projecting future costs of health care is  difficult. Compared to the future payments for pension benefits, payments  for health care benefits are significantly more unpredictable. Pension  calculations generally use salaries as a base for calculations and result in a  predictable benefit amount per year. But the cost of providing health care  benefits varies with the changing cost of health care as well as with each  individual\u2019s usage. In addition, state and local governments usually have  the ability to reduce or eliminate benefits.", "Unfunded liabilities for retiree health benefits are high because unlike  pension plans, nearly all state and local government retiree health benefits  have been financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. In other words, most  governments have not set aside funds in a trust dedicated for future retiree  health benefit payments. As a result, governments do not pay a yearly  ARC, but rather pay for retiree health benefits as they become due from  annual funds. However, the new GASB accounting standards will require  state and local governments to report their funding status on an accrual  basis. In other words, for the first time, most governments will begin to  calculate and report their funding status in a manner similar to the way  they report pensions\u2019 funding status, whether or not they are prefunded.", "Officials told us that state and local governments have not prefunded  retiree health benefits for several reasons. First, for many governments,  retiree health benefits began as an extension of employee health care  benefits, which are usually paid for from general funds. Governments did  not view retiree health as a separate stream of payments. Second, retiree  health benefits were established at a time when health care costs were  more affordable, so paying for the benefits as a yearly expense was less  burdensome. Third, the inflation rate for health care is less predictable  than for pensions, so calculating the current funding status is difficult.  Fourth, given that specific retiree health benefits are generally not  guaranteed by law, employers are freer to modify benefits; as a result,  state and local governments are reluctant to commit funds to an obligation  that may be reduced or eliminated in the future. Finally, changes in  national health care policy and health insurance markets can affect what  benefits state and local governments cover, so state and local governments  may have resisted locking in their commitment to pay for future retiree  health benefits by prefunding, and instead preferred to finance on a pay- as-you-go basis.", "Although the unfunded liabilities for retiree health benefits are generally  much higher than for pensions, their current annual payments are  considerably lower. According to our analysis presented in our recent  report on this topic, in 2006, the aggregate state and local contribution  rate for pensions was about 9 percent of salaries, and the pay-as-you-go  expense for retiree health benefits was about 2 percent of salaries.  However, if retiree health continues to be financed on a pay-as-you-go  basis, the pay-as-you-go amount is estimated to more than double to  5 percent of salaries by 2050 to keep up with the growth in health costs,  adding to budgetary stress. Pay-as-you-go financing also leaves less  budgetary flexibility because state and local governments must pay the full  costs of each year\u2019s benefits. In contrast, under pre-funding, benefits are  paid from a fund that already exists, so government contributions can be  reduced when fiscal pressures are great. As a result, governments may  face even greater pressure to reduce benefits or shift the costs of benefits  to beneficiaries, for example, by restricting eligibility, reducing coverage,  or increasing premiums. Still, pre-funding retiree health benefits would  require significantly higher contributions in the short term than pay-as- you-go financing would require."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Understanding the funded status of state and local government retiree  benefits requires examining, on a plan-by-plan basis, whether funding  levels are improving over time and whether governments are making the  contributions recommended by the plan\u2019s actuary each year. The variety of  actuarial funding methods and assumptions makes it difficult to compare  funded status across different pension plans. However, funded status  information is not intended to help compare plans, but rather to determine  contributions that will achieve full funding over time and to assess a given  plan\u2019s funded status over time.", "The funded status of state and local government pensions overall is  reasonably sound, though recent deterioration underscores the  importance of keeping up with contributions, especially in light of  anticipated fiscal and economic challenges. Since the stock market  downturn in the early 2000s, the funded ratios of some governments have  declined. Governments can gradually recover from these losses. However,  the failure of some to consistently make the annual required contributions  undermines that progress and is cause for concern, particularly as state  and local governments will likely face increasing fiscal pressure in the  coming decades. While unfunded liabilities do not generally put benefits at  risk in the near-term, they do shift costs and risks to the future.", "In the case of retiree health benefits, pay-as-you-go financing has been the  norm up to the present day. The initial estimates of the unfunded liabilities  will be daunting. But that is a natural consequence of pay-as-you-go  financing. Just as the unfunded liabilities did not accumulate overnight, it  may be unrealistic to expect them to be paid for overnight. Rather, state  and local governments need to find strategies for dealing with unfunded  liabilities, and such strategies will take time, will require difficult choices,  and could be affected by changes in national health policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided officials from the Internal Revenue Service, GASB staff, and  other external reviewers knowledgeable about the subject area a copy of  this report for their review.

We also  spoke with experts on actuarial science such as the Actuarial Standards  Board, the American Academy of Actuaries, and independent actuaries.  We spoke to staff of the Governmental Accounting Standards Board to  understand accounting practices and principles. We also reviewed  actuarial literature and attended conferences. In addition, we conducted  the following analysis:    To understand the impact of various economic factors on the funding  ratio of public pension plans, we developed a simple model of the  determinants of the funding ratio and conducted \u201ccounterfactuals\u201d  holding rates of return on investments constant. To do this, we used  the following data sources:  funding ratio data from the Public Fund Survey (PFS) for years 2001 to  2005 and the Survey of State and Local Pensions for years 1988 to 2000;    market value of pension assets from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Flow of    contributions and benefits data from the Bureau of Economic  Analysis\u2019s National Income and Product Accounts database; and    data on returns on pension fund portfolios by analyzing market data.", "Our methodology and data sources for this analysis include some  limitations. First, annual data are not available in the Survey of State  and Local Pensions for 5 years during the period. For those years,  values were imputed by using the average growth between the two  closest values. In addition, the funding ratios are available on a fiscal  year basis and were subsequently adjusted to a calendar year period.  Second, assumptions may not be representative of all pension plans,  such as the assumptions based on smoothing functions and the real  expected returns on investments. Last, counterfactuals do not include  policy adjustments that may occur because of different rates of return.", "To describe the funded status of state and local governments\u2019 pensions, in  addition to a literature review, we analyzed pension funding data provided  by the National Association of State Retirement Administrators (NASRA).  The data come from two different databases. The first database is the PFS  and is sponsored by NASRA and the National Council on Teacher  Retirement (NCTR). Data from years 2001 to 2006 were available. PFS data  are gathered by reviewing publicly available financial documents from the  state and local government plans. The second database is called the  PENDAT database and was sponsored by the Public Pension Coordinating  Council. PENDAT data are available in fiscal years 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998,  and 2000.
