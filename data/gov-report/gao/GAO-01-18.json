The increased use of precision  munitions in recent conflicts reduced inventories and raised questions  about whether adequate attention had been paid to the impact of small- scale contingencies on the ability of U.S. forces to respond and sustain  operations for the two major theaters of war. Of the approximately   $4.2 billion of munitions the services are planning to procure in fiscal year  2001, 46 percent (or $1.9 billion) will be used to procure precision  munitions designed to reduce the number of conventional munitions  needed to defeat enemy targets while at the same time limiting loss of  expensive weapons systems and life.

In 1997, the Department of  Defense issued Instruction 3000.4, which sets forth policies, roles and  responsibilities, time frames, and procedures to guide the services as they  develop their munition requirements. This instruction is referred to as the  Capabilities-Based Munitions Requirements process and is the  responsibility of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics.", "The instruction describes a multiphased analytical process that begins  when the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy develops, in consultation  with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the military services, and  the warfighting Commanders in Chief, policy on munition requirements for  the Defense Planning Guidance. The Defense Intelligence Agency uses the  Defense Planning Guidance and its accompanying warfighting scenarios as  well as other intelligence information to develop a threat assessment. This  assessment contains estimates and facts about the potential threats that  the United States and allied forces could expect to meet for each of the  two major theaters of war scenarios. The warfighting Commanders in  Chief, responsible for the major theaters of war scenarios, in coordination  with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, use the threat assessment to allocate each  service a share of the identified targets by phases of the war.", "Next, the services develop their combat requirements using battle  simulation models and scenarios to determine the number and mix of  munitions needed to meet the Commanders in Chief\u2019s objectives  separately by each major theater of war scenario. To develop these  requirements, the services draw upon and integrate data and assumptions  from the Defense Planning Guidance requirements, warfighting scenarios,  and target allocations, as well as estimates of repair and return rates for  enemy targets and projected assessments of damage to enemy targets and  installations. Other munition requirements include munitions (1) needed  for forces not committed to support combat operations, (2) to provide a  post-major theater of war combat capability, and (3) to train the force,  support service programs, and peacetime requirements. These  requirements, in addition to the combat requirement, comprise the  services\u2019 total munitions requirement.

Since the services use these rates as input into their  warfighting simulation models to determine their munition requirements,  these rates should be current and reflect a country\u2019s existing repair  capability. In response to a Department of Defense Inspector General  review of this process, the Department has taken steps to address the  quality of its data on projected repair rates.", "A Department of Defense Inspector General audit of service  requirements for specific categories of munitions reported that the  services used repair rates that overstated the requirement for these  munitions. According to an official from the Joint Staff, the services were  using repair rates for countries from the Cold War era that were able to  repair and return damaged property to the battle more quickly than could  countries used in today\u2019s war planning scenarios. To address this issue, in  December 1999, the Defense Intelligence Agency updated and  standardized the repair rates the services used in their battle simulation  models, and the Department expects these actions will address the issue  of overstated requirements.", "Battle damage assessments are more critical to munitions requirement  planning with the increased use of precision guided munitions and  changes in warfighting. Previously, munitions were fired from a range that  allowed a visual damage assessment, but precision guided munitions are  often fired miles from the target, which eliminates the ability to visually  assess whether the target has been damaged or destroyed. Knowing in  advance the probability that a specific munition will destroy the target is  necessary to accurately determine the number and mix of munitions that  will be required.", "To improve battle damage assessments, the Defense Intelligence Agency  developed battle damage assessment factors that measure (1) whether a  target was hit, (2) the extent of the damage, and (3) whether the objective  was met. These factors are more predictive if the munition has a guidance  system that provides damage information to the launch site. According to  a Navy official, using the newly developed battle damage assessment  factors for the fiscal year 2002-2007 requirements planning cycle  significantly reduced the requirement for certain categories of naval  munitions.

This is an area that has proven problematic in reaching an  agreement among the services, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff have provided  direction to strengthen the process.", "In response to a Department of Defense Inspector General audit critical  of the Central Command\u2019s allocation process, a 1999 pilot project was  initiated that transferred the U.S. Central Command\u2019s target allocation role  to the Joint Chiefs of Staff who, in coordination with the services,  developed a methodology to allocate targets. According to officials at the  Joint Staff and the Central Command, the methodology was intended to  better align the Commanders in Chief\u2019s near-term objectives (which  generally cover a 2-year period) and the services\u2019 long-term planning  horizon (which is generally 6 years). Another benefit of the pilot was that  the Joint Staff could validate the services\u2019 munition requirements by  matching requirements to target allocations.", "The Army, the Navy, and a warfighting Commander in Chief objected to  the pilot\u2019s results and criticized the methodology used to allocate the  targets because it allocated significantly more targets to the Air Force and  fewer targets to the Army. Army officials objected that the methodology  did not adequately address land warfare, which is significantly different  than air warfare. The Navy did not concur with the results, citing the lack  of recognition for the advanced capabilities of future munitions. U. S.  Central Command officials disagreed with the results, stating that a  change in methodology should not in and of itself cause the allocation to  shift. In July 2000, citing substantial concerns about the pilot, the Under  Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Technology suspended the target  allocation for fiscal year 2000 and directed that the services use the same  allocations applied to the fiscal year 2002-2007 Program Objectives  Memorandum.", "In August 2000, the Joint Chiefs of Staff structurally changed the threat  allocation process to address the services\u2019 and the warfighting  Commander in Chief\u2019s objections. The warfighting Commanders in Chief  will now prepare a near-term target allocation using a methodology  developed by the Joint Chiefs. Each warfighting Commander in Chief will  develop two allocations\u2014one for strike (air services) forces and one for  engagement (land troops) forces for his area of responsibility. The first  will allocate specific targets to strike forces under the assumption that the  air services can eliminate the majority of enemy targets. The second  allocation will assume that less than perfect conditions exist (such as bad  weather), which will limit the air services\u2019 ability to destroy their assigned  targets and require that the engagement force complete the mission. The  Commanders in Chief will not assign specific targets to the engagement  forces, but they will estimate the size of the expected remaining enemy  land force. The Army and the Marines will then be expected to arm  themselves to defeat those enemy forces. The Joint Staff will use the  Commanders in Chief\u2019s near-year threat distribution and extrapolate that  information to the last year of the Program Objectives Memorandum for  the purpose of the services\u2019 munitions requirement planning.

According to an official from the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, the increased use of precision guided munitions during the  contingency operation in Kosovo prompted several Department studies  that addressed whether the military services have sufficient munitions to  fulfill the two major theaters of war requirement.

Some  Department officials stated that the Defense Planning Guidance used to  contain specifics on the conduct of the war fight; however, when the  Department adopted the Capabilities-Based Munitions Requirements  instruction, the detail was eliminated in favor of broader guidance.", "Conversely, other Department officials disagree with the need for  increased guidance. According to an official from the Office of Secretary  of Defense, Requirements and Plans, additional guidance and specificity is  not necessary because the services should use the scenarios in the  Defense Planning Guidance to plan their force structure rather than their  munition requirements. Some Air Force and Army officials agree, stating  that the Defense Planning Guidance provides sufficient guidance for  munition planning for the mandatory two major theaters of war scenarios.  The chief of the Army Combat Support War Reserve Branch suggested that  specific guidance would only be necessary if the Army was required to  plan for small-scale contingencies with restrictions on the conduct of the  war fight. However, according to some Department officials, while the  Defense Planning Guidance provides the services a basis for their force  structure, it is also an integral part of the requirements determination  process. From this vantage point, Department officials suggest that if  small-scale contingency operations are becoming a part of an overall  military strategy then the Defense Planning Guidance should reflect this by  incorporating more detailed guidance on the conduct of such operations.

In 1998, we reported that the services were using the  warfighting scenario that supported additional requirements for specific  munitions. In addition, the requirement for a specific Army munition was  inflated partly because the Army disregarded the Defense Planning  Guidance scenarios and instead used two scenarios it had developed  independently. Consequently, the requirement for the munition was tripled  and the Army\u2019s justification for the requirement was inconsistent with the  Commanders in Chief\u2019s objectives and the Army\u2019s doctrine.", "To ensure that the services plan for the most likely scenario in the Defense  Planning Guidance and not use unlikely events to support certain  munitions, the Capabilities-Based Munitions Requirements working group  requested that the Defense Intelligence Agency develop probability factors  for the various warfighting scenarios.
